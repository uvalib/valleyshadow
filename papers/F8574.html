<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In a confidential letter, General J. K. Morehead asks Edward McPherson's opinion

                    Hon
                        Ed McPherson
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Oct 31. 1860</p>
<p class="p10">Pittsburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I have not heretofore congratulated you upon your success. I do it now, but I
                    never for one moment doubted it. Your people are <u>appreciative</u>, and of course you could not fail.</p>
<p class="p10">I did not expect <i>[unclear: Jenkin]</i> to make it, but are greatly
                    disappointed at <i>[unclear: Longeneck's]</i> defeat, and fear it is mainly due
                    to inertness and inactivity. I believe from all I have heard, that much energy
                    and industry as were exhibited in your district and mine, would have moved him--
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>We must however make the most out of what we have, and rely on
                    South Americans, and Douglassites, to help us out if we are in a minority, as I
                    fear we will be in the next Congress.</p>
<p class="p10">I have just returned from Phila have been
                    looking over the <u>Senatorial</u> ground, and have very
                    decided convictions upon the subject. I know your love and admiration for Old
                    Thaddy, he is worthy of it. He will however be <i>[unclear: overlooked]</i> by
                        M'Clure, as will all other Eastern candidates,
                    and the contest will rest between him and a certain man. But here again I am in
                    your own district and M'Clure told me with <i>[deleted: ]</i> evident votes <i>[unclear: position]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> what a splendid fight <u>they</u> had made for
                    you.</p>
<p class="p10">One thing I do know about you, that is your honor and integrity are legend <i>[deleted: ]</i>. I can therefore <i>[unclear: un]</i> myself to you without
                    prejudice, if you dont agree with me.</p>
<p class="p10">Cameron can not afford to let M'Clure be elected. He
                    will beat him if he can with somebody and I have reason to believe he prefers
                    me. Our friend Alex Cummings told me he thought I could make it without doubt,
                    if I worked for it. I have many influences East working for me, &amp; some
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> that I am not detail, enough however I can <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>to make a less sanguine man than myself look upon the prospect as
                    good.</p>
<p class="p10">What I want to know of you, is what you think of it? and whether in any
                    contingency you can or will do any thing for me? You
                    may rely upon this (I think) that the struggle will be between M'Clure (<u>your constituent</u>)
                    and myself, unless I throw my aid to some person more likely to beat him --</p>
<p class="p10">Write now, fully &amp; frankly -- the letter shall be treated as I know this
                    will be by you, sir as strictly confidential.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
