<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">We are all packing up &amp; fixing for a move, as the enemy is reported advancing up the
     Valley -- their advance having reached Mt. Jackson -- their intentions are not fully developed
     yet, but the impression is that they will go across the Ridge from New Market -- I should have
     sent William out today but for that -- if we have to go away get Snyder to kill your pig -- Mr
     Christian Bear told me yesterday he could spare me $200 -- so if you need any money call on him
     &amp; tell him I want you to have it -- do not get it unless you want it. He wants
     Webster's Dictionary &amp; said he would give you a barrel of flour for it -- that is now
     ten dollars in specie -- I told him I thought you would like the bargain -- it is a good one
     &amp; you can hide the flour &amp; keep it -- I think -- I hope this will blow by
     &amp; I got home &amp; get you fixed better. Sandy will finish cutting your wood
     &amp; I will pay him -- I think you will <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>find Christian Bear a good man to call
     on if you need any aid -- I had a long talk with him -- I have clothes enough to get along --
     so do not be troubled about me -- If I need any I will send for them -- but if any ones come
     tomorrow send my flannels &amp; shirts -- only by some safe way -- &amp; I do not think
     you had better look much for a way -- for I can send after them -- Be of good cheer &amp;
     hope for the best &amp; the Lord protect &amp; defend you all -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your aff husband</p>
