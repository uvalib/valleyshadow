<p class="p10">Dear anaffection companion</p>
<p class="p10">I seat my self to drop you a few lines. this will inform you that i
     am well and hoap that when this comes to hand it may find you injoying the Same blesing i received. i
     received the letter yours of the 23rd yesterday and was happy to heare
     from you all and that you was all in good health but am sorry that you are so through other. i
      hoap that this may find you all right. I no
     when one gets to studing they dont feel so
     well for i have had the trial of it more than once. this appears to me to be a hard way of
      liveing the way things goas
     now days but then i think their is a
     better day a coming and that chears me up [a]gain and i look forward
     to the future and hoap this cruel war will soon come to an end and so
     we can return to our hoames and have the pleasure of sitting around
     our own fireside with our wives and children. i think often of the times that is past an
     goan and think of the times that is now. what a change of afairs in a few years. it is enough to make one shuder to think of it. [part of the letter is missing or illegible at this point]
     Doctor Robson was down heare a few days a go and
     he told me that some of the neighbours was or had reported John
     had for to be oald enough for service but David Kyle said he would do
     all he could to keep him with you and the Doctor said he would do all he could in our behaf. i did or dont think John Rolston is 18 teen yet but i sorta forgot his age but if
     he is 18 teen they cant keep him out of
     service i am a fraid. You stated in your last letter that some of the
      neighbours thought that their was a
     chance for me to be exempted as a farmer. the sooner you attend to it the better it will be. i
      havent much chance to do anything of that kind heare and you could do more with it than i could heare. their is nothing like trying. you wish to no what i
     think about our chance about the times of war. it is a hard question but i dont think that our chance looks as gloomy as it did some months a
     go. the soaldiers is is pretty good sperits now to what they was some time a go. those peopel that goas to the yanks i judge they are of
     northern sentiments or ought to be. if they think they are rite i
      wont stop them if i had the chance. for my part i dont
     feal like going their myself as yet i think if
     the South [torn away]</p>
