                <p>I am but just returned from a tour through my District, and in reply to your note
                    of 24th inst have to say that at this place there are three hundred and sixty
                    six (366) colored children under (14) fourteen of which perhaps two hundred
                    (200) might be gathered into a school. Add those who will probably come, within
                    a radius of five miles, and the adults who will desire to attend, and there will
                    be not far from three hundred (300) pupils. I can furnish School rooms (in the
                    upper part of the Court House now used by me for office &amp;c three (3)
                    rooms) for one hundred &amp; fifty and can soon, as I expect to arrange for
                    at least a hundred &amp; fifty (150) more.</p>

                <p>The colored people here are anxious that a school may be established, and I
                    heartily second their desire. Winchester also presents a favorable field for
                    efforts in their behalf. There are three hundred and seventy two (372) under 14,
                    and a colored church that will accommodate about half of the pupils. Another
                    church (colored) could be repaired for about $300 -- that would hold the rest,
                    and in reference to which <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Brown has a
                    statement forwarded by me.</p>

                <p>At Harpers Ferry I found a school of 40 pupils established by Miss Mann <pb n="2"
                    />(sister of Horace Mann) and taught by her for four months under every
                    discouragement illustrating heroic charity. She is about to accept a situation
                    elsewhere, and was exceedingly anxious that the school should be continued, and
                    would provide a teacher if desired. I promised that the school should continue.
                    The present room will not do for winter, and as soon as I can get an officer to
                    put on duty there, a place shall be provided - with you will rest the
                    responsibility of enabling me to keep my promise.</p>

                <p>At <orig reg="Martinsburg">Martinsburgh</orig> and Lexington smaller schools will
                    be necessary as I think, and when I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> I will write
                    you.</p>
