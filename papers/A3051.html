<h4>Augusta County: Samuel F. Carson to Virginia Miller,
                    July 1, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Carson writes to a friend, Virginia Miller, who seems to have lived in Augusta
                    and now lives in York, Pennsylvania. He describes prison life and mentions that
                    her old town has changed more than she could imagine.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Madam</p>
<p class="p10">Thinking you would like to hear from your friends--I will embrace the present
                    opportunity of writing you a few lines concerning them. When I left home which
                    was about the last of Jany your father's family
                    were all well, saw your sisters at church the Sabath before I left--also your brothers Rue &amp; William-- Since
                    that time your brother William has been assigned to the 50 Va
                    Infty - A great many changes have taken place in
                    your old neighborhood during the last few years which time &amp; space will
                    not allow me now to enumerate. Among your acquaintances who are here are James
                    B, McCutchan, Henry A. Wright, Thomas M. Smiley and James T. Beard.</p>
<p class="p10">We are getting along as well as could be expected considering the large numbers
                    that are here. So far as known to me, there is but little sickness among the
                    prisoners. We have divine services every night - and prayer meeting every
                    morning which is being productive of much good &amp; many have been
                    hopefully converted. But I must close for the present.</p>
<p class="p10">Hoping to hear from you soon I remain your true friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Lt.
                        Saml F. Carson</i></p>
<p class="p10">Direct in the care of Capt Ahl George
