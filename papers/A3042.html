                         Cousin Sam &amp; Annie oh I forgot they had a boy how is he, how I

                         forever until we meet in a better world. if you see any of your Uncle
                              <i>[unclear: Adams]</i> people ask them why they did not answer my
                         last letter to Father &amp; Wilford mailed the Same day nearly 2 months
                         ago if they are mad it would be more gratificatious to me to know what it is about than to be treated
                         with silent contempt if I wrote any thing
                              wrong<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> it was ignorance not intentional.</p>
