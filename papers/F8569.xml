                    <salute>Dear Sir --</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>Your letter of 16th inst., gave me the first information I received on the
                    subject to which it refers.-- It greatly surprised me to find my name connected
                    with an arraignment of Judge Douglas, and to observe the manner in which it has
                    occurred. I am very unwilling to be involved in the contest now going on between
                    rival interests in the Democratic party, but the publicity <del hand="h1"
                        >attached to the affair</del> given it, &amp; your request, appear to
                    make it proper for me to <del hand="h1">write the delegate</del> state a few
                    words of explanation.</p>

                <p>I had a conversation with Alfred E. Lewis, Esq., on the <del hand="h1"
                    >street</del> public square in Gettysburg, recently after my return from <abbr
                        expan="Washington">W<hi rend="underline">a</hi></abbr> in June. It was
                    casual, hurried &amp; brief. It was also unreserved, as is the intercourse
                    between personal friends--- It was <add hand="h1" place="inline">also</add> made
                    without the slightest idea that <pb n="2"/>it <abbr expan="would">wd.</abbr>
                    ever <unclear>read</unclear> the public <add hand="h1" place="inline">&amp;
                        be used as a political lever</add>.-- In that conversation I alluded to the
                    probabilities of W. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> the people, to the <unclear>ultimate</unclear> possible
                    co-operation of some of the Douglas men, and to the preferences of Judge Douglas
                    himself.-- In this <orig reg="connection">connexion</orig> I made the remark
                    which he either misapprehended, or inaccurately remembered.-- This brings me to
                    the leading point.--</p>

                <p>I never had a conversation with Judge Douglas on politics.-- At <abbr
                        expan="Senator">Sen.</abbr> Carr's party, <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                        >however,</add> on the Evening of May 18, I was standing in the
                    refreshment-room with friends, in the immediate vicinity of Judge Douglas who
                    was in Earnest &amp; <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> conversation with an officer of the
                    Army or Navy, whose name I do not know.-- I was <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                        >first</add> attracted by the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of the Judge's manner <del
                        hand="h1">and the</del>. He was replying to a question concerning the <add
                        hand="h1" place="inline">then recent</add> nomination of Mr. Lincoln <del
                        hand="h1">then recent</del>, whom the Judge <add hand="h1" place="inline"
                        >referred to in compelling terms,</add> &amp; the strength of whose
                    nomination he freely <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>. The conversation soon turned on the
                    condition of the <abbr expan="Senator's">Sen.</abbr> party, its rememberment of
                    Charleston, <pb n="3"/> &amp; its future.-- Among other points, was the
                    probability of the election going to the House -- Judge Douglas said with great
                    positiveness, that it never would go to the House, &amp; that, if necessary,
                    the NorthWest could be a <unclear>writ</unclear> to present it.-- The inference
                    I drew was that it <abbr expan="would">wd</abbr>
                    <add hand="h1" place="inline">ready</add> be a writ <hi rend="underline">for
                        Lincoln</hi>, as <add hand="h1" place="inline">neither he nor any one else
                        could possibly hope to do or <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/></add> he could not make it it a writ for any other
                    candidate.</p>

                <p>At the same time, the Juge made some heated remarks about the Southern ultras,
                    whose course had deprived him of the nomination at Charleston, &amp; who
                    threatened to fight him to the bitter end. He said, &amp; repeated it with
                    emphasis and marked gesture, that he <abbr expan="would">wd.</abbr> rather see a
                    "Free Nigger" <abbr expan="President">Pres-t.</abbr> than one of them.--</p>

                <p>The Judge's remarks were not such as would easily be forgotten, &amp; they
                    impressed themselves upon my memory.-- I mentioned the incident to but few
                    persons, &amp; scarcely ever in detail.-- <del hand="h1">I alluded to it in
                        a general way to Mr. Lewis, as we of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> that time, I have
                        had little doubt that there <abbr expan="would">wd.</abbr> be an election of
                        the people, or that <hi rend="underline">Abraham</hi> Lincoln <abbr
                            expan="would">wd.</abbr> be chosen.--</del>
                    <pb n="4"/> I give it now, because it appears to be of some importance that I
                        <abbr expan="should">shd</abbr> state <del hand="h1">precisely</del>
                    <add hand="h1" place="inline">(as you request)</add> precisely the facts.--</p>
