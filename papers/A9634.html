<p class="p10">Dear Kate,</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your kind and affectionate letter by Mr
                    Britton I was happy indeed to hear from you and to hear you ware well with all the rest of your brothers and sisters. My health
                    is very good and hope when theese
                    uninterresting lines come to hand you may be
                    enjoying the same with all the pleasure this poor world can afford. I have the
                    blues this morning and you must not exspect as long a
                    letter as usual. Brother John &amp; Tom Graham got to disputing about a very
                    trifling matter. John was left out of his mess to get breakfast, and it not
                    being ready when we came of
                    ove drill Graham commenced cursing John when he had been
                    swearing as John thought long enought he told him to
                    stop. Graham yanked up a stik and let him have it over
                    the face, at that moment the Capt
                    intofeared &amp; sent Graham to the Guard
                    house. Capt told John when ever he got a chance to
                    give him a good whipping I am sorry the fus
                    occured but it can not be helped know. The Staunton band has came down to blay for the regament. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> We ware marched ut yesterday morning
                    to be reviewed by the prince Napolion. Thare was tow brigades making ten
                    or twelve regaments all drawed up in line of Battle it was a magnifisent view. The Prince just passed along the road. I should have
                    liked to have seen him; Cousin Joseph R Brand was over the other day. I think he
                        wares the same old face he use to ware he seems to be a very kind &amp;
                    tender hearted young man he seems to be acquainted with young men all over the
                    State his school mates at Collig<i>[deleted: g]</i>e. We took dinner with one of his former Teachers he had a very
                    nice diner such as Chicken pork and good light bread
                    &amp; blackbury
                    gam
                    wich we used instead of putter. I renewed Jo's acquaintance with J.P.L. Jo. said he did'nt know any in our Co.
                    put your Brother, Charles &amp; my self, he said he
                    never would have none me if I had'ent
                    laughted when I seen him. Jo.
                    was at fairfax Court house when the Yankees came on them &amp; they had to
                    retreat back to Bulls run. Another of our old school mates was to see us, Wm. Weeb. You would not know him for he has such a
                    large beard &amp; mustache, he belongs to the Montosella Guards, has a very nice uniform. Weeb &amp; Cousin
                    Jo. both belong to brigadeer General <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                    Cox'es brigade. I have seen both my oncles since the Grate Battle of bulls run.
                    I shall know give you a short account of the Battle.</p>
<p class="p10">We recieved orders about the dawn of day to march
                    down to the run &amp; to charge on a battery near our breastworks; we had
                    been thare an hour and a half when we recieved orders
                    to, Change our position we marched about three miles north our enimies had been cannonading us for sometime at
                    different points</p>
<p class="p10">at eight oclock the attack became general. I can not
                        disscribe the fireing
                    of small arms at nine oclock our brigade was ordered
                    to the seen of slaughter on our way we met the Staunton
                    Artillery the men said thay
                    ware almost out of amunition and ware nearly surrounded.</p>
<p class="p10">We advanced in quick time to surport the Washington
                    Artillery on the right wich
                    don
                    exilent sevice in the engagement. We threw down a
                    fence and advanced a fiew paces and was ordered to lay
                    down and incessant fire was kept up by our enimies
                    for about ten or fifteen minutes. I believe if we had have raised up at one time
                    we would have all been wounded or killed the balls seemed to range about two
                    feet above the ground. The regament in advance of us
                    fell back in confusion but on bassing our line
                    immediately formed again. We then ware
                    <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> ordered to advance in quick time to the old <i>[unclear: home]</i>
                    we then laid down waiting orders to fire we beg<i>[added: ged]</i> our officers to let us fire at a regament
                    on our right but they said they ware our friends
                    &amp; would not let us fire on them. We then commenced fireing at three or four Reg. in
                    front of us I gave them three rounds &amp; then we fell back some twenty or
                    thirty yards &amp; met another Reg. advancing
                    we went up with them some of our boys went on &amp; never stoped at all &amp; some had left before we went up
                    to the house I hollowed at Sam two or three times
                        put he would not listen to me. When we went up the
                        seckond time that Reg.
                    on our right fired on us put with little effect we
                    returned thare fire throwing them in to confusion for a
                    little while we all got behind the house &amp; corn crip fences &amp; evry thing that would
                    shield us from thare
                    Manie balls I got behind the crip and fired five times at them I looked round &amp; couldent see any of our Reg. They had falen back to the woods I had
                    got mixed with a South Carlino
                    Reg. &amp; they ware
                    now falling back I turned round and jumped over a dead man &amp; commenced
                        retreting to the woods. I couldent find my one
                    Reg. or at least I did not hunt long for I came
                    upon the fourth Alabama Reg. and laid down
                        beside<i>[deleted: s]</i> my Oncle
                    W<sup>m</sup> Mosley one of the men was
                    shot on the oposite side of Oncle
                    W<sup>m</sup>. from me the men seemed
                        grately excited the most of thare field officers was killed in the Battle Oncle
                    Wm was not tuched
                    Oncle John was not thare he

                    Mr Brittons he said he kissed upwards of twenty ladies &amp; said he could
                    have kissed them all put he told them they ware too willing &amp; he would not kiss any more. I
                    should like very much to come home for a fiew days put it is imposible at presant I must bring this scrall to a close asking an interrest in
