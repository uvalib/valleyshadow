<p class="p10">Dear Cynthia </p>
<p class="p10">Will you ever excuse me for not writing you for so long a time. I know you will
                    &amp; I must assure I feel very sorry for you &amp; will hurry &amp;
                    tell you the reason for not writing sooner. Soon after the battle at Gettysburg
                    I got sick. My stomach &amp; liver were out of order. I hung on day after
                    day hoping to get better but instead got worse. We were moving over the
                    mountains until we came to Boneboro Md. when I got
                    so sick as not to be able to go any farther. The Doctor sent me to a barn with
                    John Milligan to wait on me. I lay there a week &amp; got some better. Then
                    we come down here yesterday Sabbath. I was still better but did not feel strong
                    enough to ride every day with the retiment, when I got the Doctor to write an
                    order for me to go to Baltimore to go to the hospital. Well the Dr. wrote the
                    order &amp; I came here. Saw the Quartermaster who had charge of the R.R. &amp; he told me I would have to get a
                    transportation order from Gen. Lockwood. I called
                    on him &amp; he sent me to his Medical Director who told me I would have to
                    go into the hospital here. He could not send me to Baltimore so I stopped here.
                    There are about 200 sick here. I have to act as Hospital Steward for them. They
                    have not been in operation long &amp; are not fully arrayed yet. The Drs. are very glad that I did come, as they had no
                    one who knew anything about a Hospital Stewards duties &amp; some of the
                        Drs.
                    dont know much about Hospital practice. They treat me
                    very kindly. I hope to be able to get a furlough &amp; get home before I got
                    back to the Regt. I have felt very bad about you
                    since I was sick knowing that you would be uneasy. You would go over to the
                    postoffice &amp; wait patiently for letter then to be dissapointed time after time. I know it would be
                    very unpleasant for you. It has been the greatest trouble &amp; sorrow I
                    have known to be dissapointed in getting your
                    letters &amp; the children too would wonder where Pa is. I do wish I knew
                    where he is. I think I can hear Josey saying. &amp; so you are all at home
                    again, you wrote to me in your last. I forgot myself when I was reading it
                    &amp; I thought I was at home on the back porch reading your letter
                    &amp; you were getting dinner for me. I felt bad about it &amp; wished I
                    could have got up &amp; run there on the double quick. Well we have driven
                    the rebs back into Old Va. again &amp; hurt
                    them some as they were going. Our regiment had a brush with them while I was
                    sick &amp; several were killed &amp; some wounded. Abe Lezarden was
                    killed &amp; James Milligan was wounded. I hear our hospital was a factory
                    &amp; stands high on the Virginia side of the Potomac which washes the walls
                    of the building. The Stewards room has a window looking out on the river
                    &amp; I am writing this on the window seat with the roar of the river in my
                    ears as I write. This is called the Factory Hospital &amp; if you write soon
                    address Factory Hospital, Harpers Ferry.</p>
<p class="p10">Teusday. The mail has not gone yet but will in an hour
                    or two &amp; I will write a little more since this is the most enjoyment I
                    have since your letters can not reach me from the Regiment. I feel quite well
                    this morn &amp; should go back to the Regiment but as they want me to stay
                    here I will remain &amp; see if I can not get a furlough. to get home. I
                    would like so well to see you all once more. I would like to hear from you soon
                    to find out how you all are. How Josey has got over scared at drowning. I hope
                    he will be more careful of the millrace &amp; keep a respectful distance
                    from it. How do Lucy &amp; Bell get along. Tell about them when you write
                    &amp; Jimmy I suppose Jumping Jimmy from what you say of his activity is he
                    walking yet. How is the cow getting along. Do you have her in a pasture or is
                    she living as usual in the road. I suppose you have a good garden. I hope to be
                    able to help you eat some of it this summer, if my furlough comes all right. I
                    will still leave you in the hands of our Great Preserver who has kept us all so
                    long in the midst of dangers &amp; preserve us from harm. Oh how I would
                    like to be sitting beside you in the old church on the hill listening to Mr.
                    McKee. Those were among the most pleasant hours of my life there to have them
                    with the children &amp; me there &amp; oh how I would like to enjoy them
                    again. I hope God will preserve &amp; protect us &amp; permit us to meet
                    again to enjoy the service of his sanctuary again on earth. Pray for me dear
                    Cynthia that I may grow in grace maybe more sanctified &amp; that I may be
                    more acceptable to my Creator &amp; I will still pray for my dear wife that
                    she may be kept in the hollow of Gods hand, that no harm may befal her that she may be made holy &amp; righteous that we all
                    parents &amp; children may be accepted by the Almighty through his son the
                    Lord Jesus Christ. That will bless you all in the prayer of your most
                    affectionate husband. </p>
