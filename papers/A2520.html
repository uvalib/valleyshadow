<p class="p10">Tuesday March 25<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Near Woodstock Shenandoah Co. Va. Camp Narrow Passage</p>
<p class="p10">My afflicted wife --</p>
<p class="p10">I read with streaming eyes by the camp fire, where we stopped after a long advance &amp;
     a weary &amp; rapid retreat, your two letters, both mailed the 21<sup>st</sup>,
     &amp; the first news I have recd from home -- sad, sad, may
     God forgive me for the sorrows of last night &amp; may he in mercy have spared my child --
     but I am now resigned -- May you be supported in your extreme sorrow -- I would that I could be
     with you, but it is forbidden me -- &amp; it is now too late to reach you before the crisis
     has passed -- I wait in painful solicitude the further news --</p>
<p class="p10">We had a bloody battle on Sunday resulting disastrously to our arms, though our retreat was
     conducted in good order -- &amp; our front only fell back a few miles -- Jackson was
     deceived as to the number of the enemy when he started after them &amp; they came on him
     with overwhelming numbers -- the 5<sup>th</sup> Va. stood the shock of battle
     &amp; stooped the advance of the foe -- we lost some 40 killed
     &amp; some 300 wounded -- the enemy refused to let us bury our dead or bring away our
     wounded -- saying they neither asked or gave quarter -- we met ambulances all day yesterday
     with wounded men, wounds of all kinds in them -- Col. Echols was one it was a sad sight for us
     to thus meet them but we went on until we met Jackson &amp; were ordered to retreat. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> We are now some 10 miles from the enemy &amp; about 60 miles from Staunton -- I
     will write again tonight -- &amp; hope to hear more today -- May God bless our neighbors
     for their kindness to you &amp; sustain you under the burden of sorrow falling upon us --
     None of the W. Augusta Guards were killed some were wounded -- write to me to Mt. Jackson to be
     sent on if the Augusta Battallion of Va M. is ahead of these</p>
<p class="p10"> May God be with you</p>
<p class="p10"> My love to all -- kisses for my children if any are spared to me -- &amp; God be praised
     that they have been dedicated to him -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your Aff husband,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
