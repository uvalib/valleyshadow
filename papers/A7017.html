<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">I commenced writing to Rate &amp; intented to leave more room for yours but
                    it seemed like I could'nt get Rates done any sooner.
                    I am sorry your health is not improving more. My health is very good. I have
                    improved very much since I came here. I have had the dysentery, &amp; the
                    cold since I came but I think the dysentery was a benefit to me. You said you
                    would like to send me something good to eat, well I would like to have something
                    god. Some little "one makes" I mean. I get plenty of meat and bread &amp;
                    coffee but I am getting tired of it all the time. I have'nt eat off a table or slept in a bed for a month.</p>
<p class="p10">If I was to sit down to a table well filled with good things now, I expect I
                    would kill myself eating, no doubt at any rate, but that I would pitch into
                    every thing with my fingers, for I have hardly eaten with a knife &amp; fork
                    since I left home.</p>
<p class="p10">There are 8 in my mess, &amp; we have but one fork, &amp; you know the
                    foremost man always gets it.</p>
<p class="p10">John Berry left for home the other day, he went off &amp; did'nt tell a man in the company good bye. We have several late
                    recruits Ress Kerr, Wm. Wiseman, Henry Wiseman, Fred Alinger, John Montgomery
                    &amp; Mordecai Smith. Adkins that used to live in Middlebrook is here with
                    the Mississippi troops. But I must stop this time. I will write more next time.
                    Write soon. Kiss all the children.</p>
<p class="p10">I am as ever your affectionate brother</p>
