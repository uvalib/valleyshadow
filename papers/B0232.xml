                <p>Responding to Jordan's request for a school report, Cithrow describes the
                    situation in the area around Waynesboro. He writes that although he taught a
                    Sabbath school for blacks, his resources were stretched too thin to keep it
                    going. He also comments on the level of interest in setting up a proper school
                    for blacks among the black and white communities in the area.</p>

                    School <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> apply to this place, there being no day or
                    night School here. I conducted a <abbr expan="colored">Col<hi rend="super"
                        >d</hi>.</abbr> Sabbath school in the village for one year or more, ending
                    at <unclear>X</unclear> May but having a white school on my hands found my
                    duties too heavy &amp; was reluctantly constrained to suspend it for the
                    time. The work was an interesting one &amp; about 15 white teachers engaged
                    in it. <abbr expan="Number">No.</abbr> of pupils might be set down at from 40 to
                    90, average about 50. I am met almost daily by the former pupils with the
                    question when is the school to begin again? The Negro's never have had a school
                    here, except this Sunday school. I <abbr expan="request[ed]">req.</abbr> about 4
                    to 500 primary &amp; other books from the <unclear>tract</unclear> society
                    &amp; other sources, for the use of the school, during its existence the
                        <abbr expan="colored">Col<hi rend="super">d</hi></abbr> people did nothing
                    scarcely toward keeping it up. Those who might have <abbr expan="served">serv<hi
                            rend="super">d</hi></abbr> as teachers seemed to take little interest in
                    &amp; had to depend on white teachers alone. I think a school here could be
                    a good enterprise - a day school, the whites have no prejudice that I know of
                    against day schools. I know they look with <unclear>approbation</unclear> on
                    Sabbath schools as most of <add hand="h1" place="inline">our</add> young people
                    &amp; some old, took a hand as teachers from time to time.</p>
