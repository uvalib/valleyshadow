<p class="p10">Camp Stonewall</p>

<p class="p10">As I have a few moments after helping cook our rations I hasten to drop you a few
                    lines knowing you will be ancious to hear from me. I
                    arrived safly in camp the 15th. found all the boys
                    well; They ware all camped in line of battle at
                    Fishershill above Strausburg. We had a fine commanding position &amp; well
                    fortified: The enimy thought it prudent to make a retrogade
                    moovment &amp; commenced retreating <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>&amp; had a slight engagement in the eavning
                    near Winchester. Our Brigade never got close enough to fire at the Yanks; Some
                    of thare leaden messengers came unplesantly near us. The enimy was reported to have a large army from 40 to 50 thousand. We have
                    been reinforced by one Division of Longstreets corps &amp; two Brigade of
                    F.H. Lee cavilry. The enimy
                    distroyed nearly the entire wheat crop from
                    Winchester to Strausburg, burned may barns. We are now
                    lying in the woods near Bunkers hill, ten miles below Winchester have orders to
                    be ready to moove at any moment none of us no
                    wich way we will moove next
                    some think in to Maryland I had a fine time coming down the valley; Ive come down the back way; ware
                    treated kindly at many plases by the duch of Rockinham &amp; Shanandoor; all the objections I had to the girls
                    they ware all barefooted &amp; as I thought awkward
                        <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>in thare manners; They would commence
                    talking duch in our presance, often I thought they might be talking about me. None that I
                    saw could I think half as much of as my -- I am sure. Do not censure me for not
                    writing sooner I fooly intended writing the day after I
                    got to camp but was sent to the ordinance wagon &amp; coming back to camp I
                        stoped at a Batery
                    &amp; found my cousin R. Brand &amp; stayed nearly all day with him; he
                    is a nice young man; I think you would know him he is still readheaded &amp; freckles in his face. For a few
                    day after leaving I think I was a little low spirited probably you can account
                    for it I donnt think it was leaving Lottie; though her
                    company was very agreeable. Since I have got with the boys I have been in fine
                    spirits &amp; have been enjoying the best <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>of health, I hope theese lines may find you enjoying the same blessing Jake
                    is enjoying fine health. Abe &amp; Hunter the same Abe is now by my side
                    writing to his better half Be cheerfull &amp;
                        hapy &amp; pray that I may be spared to return
                    to thee once more Often I think I would not have nothing to live for if it was
                    not for thee; It is an eavill thought but still it will
                    arise in my wandering thoughts I must soon close as it is getting so dark I can
                    hardly see how to write; My love to all Write soon, oh how glad I would be to
                    get a letter from you tomorrow excuse bad writing &amp; all mistakes I will
                    write again before long from one that has wished the
                    hapiness for years</p>
