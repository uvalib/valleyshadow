<p class="p10">Dear Wife </p>
<p class="p10">One week ago yesterday I wrote you. Since that time we left the river &amp;
                    moved up towards Richmond within 7 miles so were cut off from the outer world we
                        dont know what the Army of the Potomac has been
                    doing for over a week. Except what we learn from Richmond papers &amp; we
                        dont put faith in what they say. Our mail is still
                    back. Nothing from my family. But I still hope you are all well. We have not had
                    any fighting the past week. Today we came for rations &amp; forage. It is
                    Sabbath but all are in a hurry &amp; bluster marching, &amp; hallooing
                    making it quite differant from the Sabbath at home.
                    My health continues good as usual, except headaches these hot days. I have been
                    living on corn cakes for nearly a week. Will get to hard tack this evening. As I
                    have no particular news I send you my love, remember me to the children
                    &amp; at the throne of grace </p>
<p class="p10">Your most affectionate husband </p>
<p class="p10"><i>S.M. Potter </i></p>
<p class="p10">Will you send me some stamps &amp; still write once a
                        week. I will get your letters after awhile. </p>
