<p class="p10">I take my pen in hand to let you know that I am well at preasent and hope these few lines may find you in the same state of
                    health. we are now laying in the front in the breastworks about one half mile
                    from the canal that butler is diging across the James
                    river we expect to have a fight as soon as it is done we are now doing picket
                    duty here our pickets are about two hundred yards apart from the rebels and we
                    exchange sugar and coffee for tobacco to them and every day one or two of them
                    desert and come over to us they say that if little <i>[unclear: Mc]</i> is
                    elected they will come back to the union<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> but there will be a very bad
                    show for him in the army but I hope yous will give him a
                    large magority in the north for he is the only one
                    that can settle the war. I hope you will not forget to put in a vote for little
                        <i>[unclear: Mc]</i> and the union</p>
<p class="p10">I must now close by sending my love and respects to Eliza and George and all the
