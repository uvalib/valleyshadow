<h4>Franklin County: Edward McPherson to John B.
                    McPherson, April 14, 1857<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In a letter to his father, Edward McPherson mentions editing his letters, the
                    printing of his pamphlets, a visit to the Opera House, interactions with a lady
                    friend, and a new type of hat.</p>

<p class="p10">Apl. 14.</p>
<p class="p10">
                            Phila.
                        </p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Father --</p>
<p class="p10">I have read all the proofs of my letters, which were in type before I came down.
                    I expect to revise part of them this afternoon, &amp; the balance in the
                    morning. The pamphlet will be about 50 pages.-- They are anxious to have more at
                    Harrisburg on Thursday; but it is possible they will have to wait until Friday
                    for them. I have not made as many changes, as I would if the <i>[added: letters]</i> had not been in type; but I have corrected the
                    errors &amp; made a few improvements in style.-- Mr. Cummings had gone to
                        Harr-g. He went yesterday aftn., &amp; will <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> be absent most of
                    the week. I <u>may</u> go up on Thursday with 200 of the
                    pamphlets.-- I understand, however, that the Amer.
                    Repub. State Comte. will meet here on Tuesday next, &amp; I think it likely I
                    will not be home until after that.-- I am disappointed about it, &amp; will
                    not stay over Sunday, unless for some such reason.--</p>
<p class="p10">I saw Prof.
                    <i>[unclear: Haupt]</i> this morning, &amp; met Paul Keller on the street.
                    I have not yet been to see <i>[unclear: Wer.]</i> Kurtz, and I have had little
                    leisure. The heaviest of my work is over, but I must still watch to have all
                    right.= I was at the Opera House a short time on Saturday. It is a beautiful
                    building &amp; was filled with a fashionable <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> audience. I enjoyed
                    looking at them more than listening to the Italian of the <u>artistes</u>.--</p>
<p class="p10">If the letters on the Main Line <sup>1000 copies are to be
                    printed</sup> -- I have made up an Index to the most important tables. I will
                    write Chas. in a day or two. I was at Dr. <i>[unclear: Brandman's]</i> church
                    on Saturday aftn., &amp; walked home with
                    Miss Rachel Watson, cousin of Mr. Watson. I met her at <i>[deleted: Martere]</i> Caledonia two years ago.-- I called in for a moment at Dr.
                    Siebert's on Sunday <i>[illeg.]</i>, but did not go up stairs to see the
                    ladies. I was passing up <i>[unclear: Arch]</i> street, &amp; <i>[deleted: ]</i> to <i>[illeg.]</i> for the location of Dr.
                    <i>[unclear: Stark's]</i> church-- It was too far up town, &amp; I <i>[deleted: ]</i> to the St. Lawrence. I called at <i>[unclear: Kent]</i>
                    Gilbert's but he was not at home. Harriet is to be married <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> soon. I
                    may call on them before leaving town.-- These hats are but light improvements in
                    the old style. The improvement is the insertion of a soft material, where the
                    hat rests upon the forehead. The <i>[unclear: movement]</i> is flexible.--
                    Hence the name.-- They are not at all what I expected.-- They are very
                    comfortable, however. I don't know how they would last.-- I have made the
                    personal acquaintance of a Judge <i>[unclear: Laporte]</i>, Wilmot's intimate
                    friend. He was formerly <i>[unclear: Surgeon]</i> General, &amp; his face
                    has been familiar to me for years. He will be in town until after next Tuesday.
                    Mr. Wilmot will meet the comte. here.-- Give my
                    love to all.-- I will write again in a day or two.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
