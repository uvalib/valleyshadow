</h4>

                    also expresses his desire to serve God and country.</p>

<p class="p10">March 31, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Stephensburg, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father:</p>
<p class="p10">This morning I take the opportunity to inform you that I am well. Hoping these
                    few lines may find you all enjoying good health and happiness.</p>
<p class="p10">I have come to the conclusion that if I have not much to write-I will write shorte letters and more of them. Things appear pretty
                    quiet. Yet not knowing how long they will remain so.</p>
<p class="p10">The weather was so very pleasant in January and February and part of March that I
                    think it will make up now with rain and mud. These few days back it has been
                    raining. This morning is midling clear.</p>
<p class="p10">We have not much duty to do a out camp more than we are drilled pretty freely.</p>
<p class="p10">About our getting home in 9 months it is still kept in darkness. Some say that we
                    will not be paide off till we are taken out of The
                        Regt. It appears very much like it. Some say
                    that we are only transferred. Some has one story and some another. So I can't go
                    by what I hear.</p>
<p class="p10">Now, the substitutes are only good for 1 year. The 300 dollars are only good for
                    1 year. That is why I think that they can not make us
                    stay longer then 1 year.</p>
<p class="p10">Be this as it may. Time will reveal all things. I will be contented trusting in a
                    higher power. My desire is to do my duty and live in such a way as to make
                    Heaven my home when I come to cross the cold Jordan of Death.</p>
<p class="p10">My prayer and sincere desire is that-if we never meet on Earth, that God will
                    help us to meet in Heaven where there will be no War or no parting then.</p>
<p class="p10">Take care of your health and if it is God's will-we will soon be permitted to
                    meet each other.</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon.</p>
<p class="p10">May God provide for us all. No more at present.</p>
<p class="p10">When you write-Direct in this way. 1st Division- 2 nd Corps, Washington, D. C.</p>
<p class="p10">So farewell for this time.</p>
<p class="p10">Your son,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
