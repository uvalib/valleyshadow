<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: William J. Dews to
                    Orlando Brown, July 8, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Dews applies to Brown for employment in the Bureau or other branch of government.
                    Dews was once a member of the Freedman's Court in Staunton, and claims that he
                    is presently unable to find work in his profession because he remained loyal to
                    the Union during the war.</p>

                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">July 8th, 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Richmond,</p>
<p class="p10">General:</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to make the following brief statement, and application, to
                    which, I venture to hope, you will accord a favourable consideration.</p>
<p class="p10">I claim to have been strictly a loyal man to the U.S. Gov. during the Rebellion -
                    have ever been so - refusing to aid the Rebel Gov., at the point of the Bayonet, in this city. After suffering, more
                    than I should be willing to inflict upon you in a communication, or otherwise, I
                    made my escape through the lines.</p>
<p class="p10">I am a native Virginian, and after the suppression of the Rebellion, returned to
                    Staunton (Augusta County), at which place I became connected with the Bureau
                        R. F. &amp; A.
                    L. as Comr. or agent, <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>on the
                    part of the Freedmen; and also clerk for Mr. F. S. Tukey, then Asst. Supt. of that Sub-Dist. After the Freedman's Court was abolished by
                    orders I was connected with the U.S. B.C. at
                    Staunton. Upon the completion of the work returned to Richmond where I have
                    attempted to resume my profession (I am a teacher of Music) but owing to the
                    fact of being well known as an uncompromising Union man, having been connected
                    with the Bureau, and having testified before the "Reconstruction Committee" (to
                    which I beg leave to call your attention) I find it <u>totally</u> impossible to make a support for myself and child at my profession
                    on account of the direct and indirect influences operating against the interests
                    of loyal men. Having no means I have no resources but to seek employment in some
                    branch of the Gov.</p>
<p class="p10">In view of these circumstances, General, I herewith respectfully make application
                    to you for a clerkship or any situation in your gift in your Dept. where I could be useful and derive a support
                    for myself and child.</p>
<p class="p10">I refer to Mr. F. S. Tukey, Asst.
                    Supt. in Caroline County, Lieut. Lahea
                        Asst. Supt. at Farmville,
                    Prince Edward County, and will present the <i>[unclear: endorsation]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>of loyal citizens of Richmond. I will have certificates from
                        <i>[unclear: Messrs.]</i> Tukey and Lahea in a few days.</p>
<p class="p10">I take occasion to say General, that I should not have intruded thus upon your
                    time, but for the circumstances of my case, and the <u>urgent</u> necessity of employment.</p>
<p class="p10">Trusting to the kind consideration of this communication, at your hands,</p>
<p class="p10">I am General,<br>With Respect<br>Your Obt.
                        Srvt.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Wm. J Dews</i></p>
