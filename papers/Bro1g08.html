<p class="p10">Camp Carter
</p>
<p class="p10">Dear sister:</p>
<p class="p10">Knowing <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i> your anxiety <br>
to hear from us at this time, after receiving <br>
Andrews letter,
I write to inform you that we <br>
are both well, except that Andrew is somewhat <br>
wearied &amp; broken down from a march of about 11 <br>
miles on yesterday, under a broiling sun &amp; some <br>
dust &amp; but a little water,
we forming the rear of about <br>
ten or twelve thousand soldiers &amp; consequently were <br>
crowded out from the wells, that being
the prin-<br>
cipal source, until the middle of the evening <br>
when we fell back from the main body. <a href="#n1">[1]</a><br>
We <i>[added: that is
Jackson's brigade,
Johnston
having gone to Winchester
]</i> 
camped in the woods
last night &amp; this <br>
morning marched to this place about 3 ½ miles <br>
below Winchester.  At our last encampment we <br>
were placed in an open field, under a burning <br>
sun &amp; orders to be at your posts &amp;
had to stay <br>
there for four days.  The enemy were all the while <br>
stationed at Martinsburgh
 6 ½ miles off.</p>
<p class="p10">General Johnston sent <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i>
to Gen. Patterson <br>
who is in command of the enemies
 forces <br>

<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Bro1g084.jpg"><center><img src="images/Bro1g084.gif"></center></a><br><br>

to send away the women &amp; children from
Martins
<i>[added: burgh]</i>
<br>

but he refused &amp; sent back word that if
he (<i>[added: Johnston]</i>)
 would <br>
lay down his arms &amp; return home the
he (Patterson) <br>
would forgive all past offences.  
Gen. Johnston

offered him battle for four days, if he would <br>
come out of 
Martinsburgh but he would not do <br>
it and

John
<i>[added: s]</i>ton 

thinking his numbers too great <br>
being at lea<i>[added: st]</i>
 twenty five &amp; perhaps thirty thousand <br>
&amp; a reinforcement of 5 thousand at the
Potomac <br>
at some point between Harpers Ferry and
Shepherds-<br>
town and his position too strong, thought it <br>
advisable to fall back &amp; so we have had no <br>
battle yet, but on Saturday evening<a href="#n2">[2]</a> a dispatch <br>
was brought to the General that our pickets <br>
had been driven in &amp; that the enemy
were advan-<br>
cing: we were soon drawn up in battle array <br>
&amp; advanced to a position,
after having been <br>
on the field about <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i>
<i>[added: two]</i>
 hours, we were taken back <br>
to quarters, it having turned out to be simply <br>
a fight between the pickets; the enemy not coming. <br>
Jackson on that morning received a letter <br>
from Gen. Lee
congratulating him upon his <br>
promotion to brigadier General, the letter<br>

<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/Bro1g085.jpg"><center><img src="images/Bro1g085.gif"></center></a><br><br>

came in advance of the official announcement.  <br>
While on the field the two Generals made <br>
a review of the troops
Johnston of all of the forces <br>
&amp; Jackson of the Virginia brigade. </p>
<p class="p10">
I like Johnston's
appearance very well; I think <br>
he is a very prudent commander: indeed the
same is <br>
true of both: you know "prudence is the better part <br>
of valor."<a href="#n3">[3]</a>
  What is going to be done I don't know; <br>
the soldiers never know the intentions of their
com-<br>
manders until it comes to execution; so we here in <br>
camp have as little idea of an intended action <br>
as you. I suppose the Yankee papers will glory over <br>
our falling back as an inglorious <i>[added: 
and precipitan]</i>
retreat; but <br>
call it by what name you please I think that <br>
Johnston
knows what he is about &amp; am very willing <br>
to obey his orders, although it did pester me a good <br>
deal for a while &amp; does yet somewhat, to go at <br>
things as it were blindfolded. <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i>
Even suppo-<br>
sing that we could have whipped them, it would <br>
have been at too great a loss of life &amp; consequently <br>
it is more prudent to retire.  How soon we <br>
will have an engagement I can't tell you; but <br>
there must be one at some time or another. </p>
<p class="p10">
The result of the fight that took place on Tuesday <br>
the 2<sup>nd</sup> I suppose
Andrew gave you very correctly; <br>
on our side <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i> three killed &amp; four or five
wounded.  <br>
The most reliable report we get <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i>
in regard <br>
to the loss of the Federal forces comes from <br>

Mr. Boteler, a brother of
Hon. Alex
Boteler, <br>
who says he had it from the quartermaster of <br>
their army to this effect: that there were <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i> <br>
from three to five hundred in killed &amp;
wounded <br>
however true this is I think that there is no <br>
doubt that their loss was considerable.<a href="#n4">[4]</a><br>
 The number engaged on our side was <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i>
<i>[added: the whole (except
one company)]</i> <br>
<i>[deleted: illeg/]</i> of Harper's regiment
<i>[added: and one piece of
canon]</i>: on the enemies there <br>
was supposed to
be about 3000 a great many <br>
of them being regulars.<a href="#n5">[5]</a>  </p>
<p class="p10">Since writing the above I <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i>
hear through one <br>
of our company who has been at 
Winchester, that <br>
they are throwing up a breastwork about one mile <br>
on this side of town; which looks very much like <br>
making a stand here, I didn't suppose however <br>
that we would retire beyond Winchester.</p>
<p class="p10">Billy Wilson
received a letter from home, a day or <br>
two ago, which brought the news that
Edgar Wilson,<br>
whilst capping his pistol, shot himself in the foot, shooting off <br>
one toe &amp; another almost off.<a href="#n6">[6]</a>  I heard from Gam
Dalhouse<br>
 a day or two ago, he was then improving with a prospect <br>
of getting well.  John D.
Brooks<a href="#n7">[7]</a>
 &amp; all
my acquaintances <br>
are very well.  We have just perused yours and
aunt Martha's
<a href="#n8">[8]</a><br>
letters.  On their
way down McComb and
Baskins
<a href="#n9">[9]</a> heard at <br>
Bunkers hill,
a village between Winchester &amp; our
camp, that <br>
we had sent back all the baggage, except so much as we <br>
could carry &amp; accordingly
left their knapsacks there &amp; our letters <br>
with them &amp; did not get them again until this evening.<br>
Aunt Martha
wrote that Mr. Lee was taken prisoner by <br>
the Georgians, our own troops.  I
didn't understand <br>
it at all; he has not turned traitor has he?
<a href="#n10">[10]</a></p>
<p class="p10">We heard yesterday that Lincoln
 message recommends <br>
calling for 400,000 more men &amp;
400,000,000 of dollars.  <br>
I don't <i>[deleted: illeg.]</i> know where he will get the <br>
money from.  Andrew joins in sending
love to all <br>
at home and Uncle Ben's
<a href="#n11">[11]</a>.  Remember us both very <br>
 especially to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Murkland;
we would like to <br>
be there to see them, but more especially the folks <br>
 at home.  I was sorry to hear
of Father's sickness <br>
but I hope ere this shall have reached you he will be <br>
restored to his wonted
health.  I regretted very much <br>
<i>[added: not]</i> seeing Willie
 and Elick Murkland. <i>[deleted: illeg]</i>
<br>
To night Andrew
 is pretty
well again. </p>
<p class="p10">I have nothing more to write.

Your brother</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
William</i></p>
<p class="p10">
Tuesday morning <br>
We got our bag<br>
gage last night <br>
&amp; will get a clean <br>
suit &amp; send it <br>
off again.

Excuse the dirt <br>
Can't keep Clean <br>
hands on all <br>
occasions.  <br>
Tell Emmett <br>
that it is im<br>
possible to get <br>
a likeness taken <br>

<p class="p11"><b>Notes</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> On July 2, 1861, Federal troops under the command of
General Robert Patterson crossed the Potomac and moved toward
Martinsburg, West Virginia, prompting General Johnston to order Jackson
to have his troops advance and meet the enemy.  The advance guard of
Patterson's forces skirmished with Jackson's forces at Falling Waters, a
village on the south side of the Potomac.  Ultimately Jackson's brigade,
outnumbered, withdrew to a camp below Martinsburg (Wallace 15; Bean 33;
Robertson, <i>The Stonewall Brigade</i>, 29-33).  Although the Liberty
Hall Volunteers acted in support of the Fifth Virginia rather than
participating directly in the battle, Captain James J. White was pleased
with their performance, bragging that "[t]he boys were cool as you
please, with shells bursting around them and bullets whistling around
their ears" (quoted by Turner, 57).  After Patterson took control of
Martinsburg on July 3, Johnston's forces remained encamped at Camp
Stephens, awaiting an attack.  But on July 7, as William Brooks reports,
Johnston, fearing that Patterson had greater numbers, ordered his troops
to fall back to Winchester (Bean 34).  </p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a> Saturday was July 6, the day before the troops were
ordered back to Winchester.

</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> General Joseph E. Johnston (1807-1891) received his diploma
from the U. S. Miltary Academy in 1829 along with his friend
Robert E. Lee.  He received praise for his service in both
the Mexican War and in the wars against the Seminole Indians.
In April of 1861, he resigned from his position as a brigadier
general in the U. S. Army, and in May of 1861 accepted a commission
as a brigadier general in the Confederate Army.  He commanded
the Army of the
Shenandoah at Harper's Ferry and led Confederate forces at First
Manassas, August 1861 (McMurry, 859-61).


</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> Hon. Alex R. Boteler (1815-1892) was a
congressman from Virginia.  Initially he opposed secession
and gave an eloquent address in the House arguing for the
preservation of the Union, but when Virginia seceded
he supported its actions and left with it.  During the war, he served in
the Confederate legislature and also worked a a volunteer
aide on the staff of his friend Stonewall Jackson (Lankford,
197-8).

</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n5">[5]</a> Out of Patterson's 3000 men, ten died and fifty were
captured, while 10 of Jackson's men died out of the 350 soldiers
who took part in the skirmish (Robertson, <i>The Stonewall Brigade</i>,
32.
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n6">[6]</a> Billy Wilson is probably William N. Wilson, a member
of Company I.  Wilson was captured at Kernstown on March 23, 1862 and
exchanged on August 5, 1862.  He was listed as a deserter after November
27, 1862 (Robertson, <i>4th Virginia Infantry</i>, 81)
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n7">[7]</a>
John D. Brooks, perhaps a cousin of the Brooks
brothers, enlisted in
Company H of the Fifth Virginia Infantry on April 19, 1861.
After serving five months as regimental quartermaster clerk,
Brooks was promoted to first sergeant in September of 1861.
In April of 1862, he was transferred to Company E, and he
was promoted
to captain in 1864.
He was paroled at
Appomattox Court House in April of 1865 as Captain, Assistant
Quartmaster. 2nd Corps, Army of Northern Virginia.  After the war, he
moved to Missouri and New York.
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n8">[8]</a> Aunt Martha is most likely Martha Stuart, the sister
of William Brooks' mother.  According to the 1860 Census of Augusta County,
Martha Stuart was 48 in 1860 and
lived on a farm adjacent to the Brooks'.

</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n9">[9]</a> "Baskins" probably refers to James W. Baskins of the
Fifth Virginia Infantry, Company H.  He was born in Augusta County,
Virginia in 1840 and enlisted in the the Fifth Virginia on April 19,
1861. He was killed on July 21, 1861 at Manassas (Wallace, 94).
"McComb" is most likely Moses Andrew McComb, who enlisted with Baskins
in Company H of the Fifth Virginia Infantry.  Born in 1837, McComb was a
a farmer in Augusta County until he enlisted as a second lieutenant.  He
was promoted to first lieutenant in 1861, was dropped on April 17, 1862,
and re-enlisted on January 1, 1864 in Albemarle County as a private in
the First Regiment Virginia Cavalry.  McComb was paroled at Staunton on
May 1, 1865, and died in Staunton on March 17, 1906.  </p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n10">[10]</a> "Mr. Lee" may refer to Charles Lee,
a minister who lived in Augusta County (Augusta County Census,
1860).

</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n11">[11]</a> Benjamin Stuart,
William Brooks's maternal uncle, owned the farm next to the Brooks' farm.
In the 1860 census of Augusta County, Stuart
was listed as a forty-year old farmer.
