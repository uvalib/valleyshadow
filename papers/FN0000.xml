                <p>Barnitz writes a very patriotic letter that sings the praises of the Union and
                    the defeat of the Copperheads. He talks about the inevitable defeat of the
                    Confederacy and discusses the presence of contraband slaves in the Union camps.
                    He also commends the ex-slaves for being eager to learn and expresses his
                    support for African-American troops, whom he describes as more brave and
                    honorable than their copperhead adversaries.</p>

                <p>Like the tocsin peal of victory the news of the resurrection of Northern
                    patriotism broke upon us a few days ago; and oh! the enthusiasm that burst out
                    in every camp! Every face beamed with gladness, every heart was lightened of its
                    depairing burden. No victory however great and splendid, even to the taking of
                    Richmond, could have occasioned such universal joy and mutual good feeling among
                    the patriotic soldiers. Here and there, to be sure, some sneaking leech, who
                    foisted himself upon the Government, in order to have the opportunity of
                    breeding discontent among the men, the effect of which would redound to the
                    disadvantage of the Government, or, as in a multitude of cases, to insure a
                    living, which <hi rend="italic">the party at home</hi> could no longer
                    vouchsafe, would skulk along with hang-dog look and sullen mien, discovering his
                    vicious heart and traitorous feeling; but, generally, there was joy -- open,
                    beaming joy -- and from ten thousand hearts went up a thankful prayer for the
                    awaking of the patriots so long dormant, or who had been regarding our life
                    struggles with a morbid indifference, though they saw the fabric of our Union
                    shaking on its foundation and almost ready to totter to ruins. Since
                    Beauregard's proclamation, exhorting his hosts to call all Union men
                    Abolitionists, his allies in the North, seeing that thus they could deceive the
                    masses and array them against the Government, spreading discontent and sowing
                    disaffection broadcast, took up the cry, and every true patriot -- every one whe
                    favored the vigorous prosecution of the war, the confiscation of rebel property,
                    or the subjugation of the rebels, the only possible means of crushing the
                    rebellion -- was trumpeted forth as an Abolitionist and execrated as an enemy of
                    liberty. Indeed so utterly blinded were many of their followers -- so utterly
                    and hellishly belied, betrayed and deceived -- that they would have seen our
                    armies annihilated, and rejoiced, and would have thrown themselves in the way
                    for that arch-traitor, Jeff Davis, to ride over in his triumphal entry to our
                    Capital. But, thank God, the film has fallen from their eyes in good time, the
                    bubble of treachery and deceit has burst, and clearer, brighter skies glow
                    around us; and was it not wonderful that men of substance, self-deluded, tarried
                    so long upon the mine that threatened every day to explode and engulf them and
                    their all in an abyss so deep that all the energies of posterity for ten
                    centuries could not resurrect them! We do not realize the terrors and calamities
                    that anarchy spreads when a nation falls under her rule; neither can we
                    appreciate the struggles and difficulties attendant upon the organization of new
                    institutions, else these hell hounds who have been plotting the destruction of
                    our temple of liberty, cemented by the blood of our fathers and reared at so
                    great a cost of life and agony, would now be hanging on every tree, objects for
                    the execration and loathing of patriots all over the civilized world.</p>

                <p>Let the fires of liberty, rekindled, be kept steadily burning; let that patriotic
                    association, the <hi rend="italic">Union League</hi>, be established in every
                    city, town and township throughout the North, gathering together men of every
                    name and party, where sentiments fresh from the fountains of truth and loyalty
                    may be interchanged, and where, like Marius, true men may pledge themselves upon
                    the altars to freedom, and swear to live or die for their country. Then may the
                    traitor demons plot, and howl, and lie, and hiss, as they see their hopes of
                    agrarianism, dissolution and anarchy scattered to the winds; the army of the
                    Union increased, inspirited, jubilant will march on from victory to victory,
                    crush the last stronghold of rebellion and show to the world that a republic has
                    with in itself a self-sustaining power -- that princes were not <hi
                        rend="italic">born to rule</hi>, and nations only to <hi rend="italic"
                        >obey</hi>.</p>

                <p>Last night our pickets were again driven in; our brave boys dashed off after the
                    rebs, but in asmuch as we have heard no firing, we presume they have <orig
                        reg="vamoosed">vamosed</orig> as usual.</p>

                <p>There are about 8,000 contrabands here, working on the railroad, cutting wood,
                    and raising a regiment of volunteers. Philanthropists from the North have opened
                    schools for the instruction of the youth, and the avidity and ease with which
                    they study and learn, is truly surprising; how their eyes glitter with every new
                    discovery, with what satisfaction they enter the school room, how attentive, as
                    if they feared some beautiful would escape their notice; it humbles one to see
                    the efforts these youth put forth to attain knowledege, and it is a grand omen
                    for the amelioration of the race. As soldiers they evince the same traits,
                    attentive, active, quick to learn, ambitious, and, above all, courageous; and I
                    will guarantee when put in the field, they will surprise even the cowardly
                    copperheads, whose superiors they are, in everything constituting manliness,
                    worthiness and honor! The Union is safe! The rebellion will be crushed in six
                    months, and these unchained people, fierce under the stings of recent goads,
                    will dash down before the nabobs, who have kept them in eternal bondage,
                    ignorance and degredation, for their own gratification, to administer to their
                    own selfish wants. What a fearful retribution will be visited upon these
                    traitors, who, like satan, dissatisfied with prosperity, with a government the
                    most <orig reg="benign">benignant</orig> ever known, with civil immunities and
                    privileges, unknown to other nations, and with an enslaved race to produce the
                    necessaries of life, to jump at their bidding, to fan them while they slept, and
                    tremble when they woke -- who thus favored, thus pampered, attempted at one fell
                    blow to dash down their government, and establish one exclusive as China,
                    proscriptive as Spain, with nigger heads and hearts for foundation, pillar, and
                    dome.</p>

                <p>Our regiment, the 158th, is in high, good spirits and health, though deploring
                    the abscence of our gallant Colonel D. B. M'Kibbin, who on the night of our
                    search for the rebs, near White Oak river, while riding through the forest,
                    broke the fibula of his right ankle, his horse having gotten his foot into a
                    port hole and fallen upon him.</p>
