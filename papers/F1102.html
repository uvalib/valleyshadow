<h4>Franklin: Lafayette McLaws to Emily (probably
                    McLaws), June 28 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>The handwriting in this letter is not clear, but the images are vivid. McClaws
                    describes marching through enemy territory in Virginia, remarking upon the
                    hiding inhabitants as well as the physical destruction. He recounts his
                    encounters with people, conveying the tension between occupying soldiers and
                    residents. McLaws mentions that many townspeople in Chambersburg fiercely oppose
                    abolition and President Lincoln, even as they hope for peace. McLaws also
                    mentions that the mail is being read by outsiders, because the mail carriers are
                    repeatedly captured.</p>

<p class="p10">Headquarters Division<br> Camp near Chambersburg, Pa</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Emily</p>
<p class="p10">My Command arrived at this place, this morning at 10 oclock, and joined the rest
                    of the <i>[unclear: Corps]</i> camped near this place.</p>
<p class="p10">We left Martinsburg in Virginia on the 25<sup>th</sup> at five oclock
                    in the morning, and finding the river, camped <i>[unclear: three]</i> Brigades

                    <i>[unclear: Much]</i> of the Baltimore and Ohio Canal running along the Canal
                    was also destroyed. From Martinsburg to the river, eleven miles,
                    <i>[unclear: many]</i> houses were all dark, the curtains drawn and the people
                    either absent or invisible - Showing an evident dislike to our cause. It was

                    places which had long ago been deserted and devastated. The Secret was out, when
                    we visited the town and <i>[unclear: was]</i> told that <i>[unclear: Mr]</i>
                    Faulkner had not long since returned from Washington, and on the evening Our
                    troops first entered the town H<i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: have]</i> issued tickets for a large party to be given to the
                    Yankee Officers. The daughters were also constantly visiting the Yankee families
                    and were being visited by them and the Yankee officers generally, and that the
                    greater cordiality existed between them. The farms we saw lying in waste were
                    those of Southern families who were not so devoted to Yankeedom. There was no
                        <i>[unclear: real]</i> cause given as in Martinsburg, except by very few
                    and those of the ladies who exhibited any cordiality I noticed were clothed in
                    silks and de<i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; muslins, and all the finery of a thriving
                    Yankee town. Many women &amp; children made faces at us as we marched along,
                    and although we could not hear them, we could see their mouths moving, and from
                    their expressions<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> knew they were giving us their
                    <i>[unclear: Valediction]</i>. As we <i>[unclear: crowd]</i> into
                    Williamsport, the people were more friendly, but yet all the Shops were closed
                    and the houses generally deserted or exhibiting no signs of being inhabited. One
                    lady said she was delighted to see us. shook hands very cordially, said she
                    expected to be sent across the river if the enemy should ever return, but did
                    not care. Shortly after I went to the window to get some water and seeing a boy
                    of nine or ten in the room with the blue blouse of a Yankee, I said "you are a
                    Yankee <i>[unclear: and]</i> the boy said nothing but held down his head's. the
                        yankey lady before mentioned said to him "speak up
                    loudly and tell him you are no Yankee. "Yes but I am one" answered the boy. and
                    I remarked "Children take their opinions from their older sisters &amp;
                    brothers &amp; they always tell the truth" and <i>[unclear: strode]</i>
                    away, the family within looking as if they had been caught in a falsehood</p>

                    to his <i>[unclear: house]</i> for a few minutes, found him a
                    <i>[unclear: most]</i> polished gentleman, and his wife and niece good
                    specimens of Southern ladies. I <i>[illeg.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> very glad to meet
                    them as I then had in my mind the contrast between the Southern gentleman and
                    ladies and the very different species I have encountered. as I crossed the line
                    into Pennsylvania. At Green Castle on the road to Chambersburg, Several young
                    ladies were assembled engaged in scoffing at our men as they passed but they
                    were treated with contempt or derision. I heard of nothing witty said by any of
                    them. It was made evident however that they were not ladies in the Southern
                    acceptations of the word. The men I spoke to, acknowledged that the brutalities
                        practised by their troops, upon the Southern
                    people, fully justified our retaliating and were surprised at our moderation.
                    The poorer classes told me that our troops behaved better to them than their own
                    did. Arrived, <i>[deleted: but]</i> &amp; marched through Chambersburg on
                        28<sup>th</sup> a town of five thousand inhabitants perhaps more.

                    up the <i>[added: Rail]</i> road leading there to
                    Harrisburg. The people of Chambersburg are decidedly and decidedly hostile. The
                    men dare not show it but by their looks, the women tried to be <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    on varying occasions but succeeded in being vulgar only they are a
                    <i>[unclear: very]</i> different <i>[unclear: law]</i> from the Southern.
                    There is a coarseness in their manners and looks and a <i>[unclear: tenany]</i>
                    in their voices. which <i>[unclear: grates]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: harshly]</i> on the senses of our men, the distinction of <i>[deleted: ]</i> the poor &amp; sick is very marked. Every one speaks for peace at any price, and since has been brought
                    to their own <i>[illeg.]</i>, they look desponding to the last degree, and
                    begin to believe that they have been vastly deceived by engaging in it. I have
                    found no one to speak of Lincoln as a man of either capactiy or patriotism,
                        every one even the women think, <i>[unclear: we]</i>

                    that freedom should not be the lot of the negro. To day

                    employment for negro troops, had large <i>[illeg.]</i> works. They were burned
                    by our troops, however, and are now in ashes &amp; total ruin.</p>
