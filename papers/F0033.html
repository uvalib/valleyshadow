<p class="p10">April 19<sup>th</sup> 1864 </p>
<p class="p10">Hospital Dept. 16th Pa. Cav. Turkey Run, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife </p>
<p class="p10">There is a report this evening that after tomorrow our mail will be stopped for
                    60 days. I dont know whether it is true or false. If
                    true this letter will do no harm although not to get a letter from you for so
                    long a time will seem like parting. I was contented while I heard from you once
                    a week it seemed you were near. Now how differant.
                    Your cheering loving letter will not come. </p>
<p class="p10">Still no military orders can take your sweet beautiful picture from me nor
                    deprive me of the delicious dreams I have of a loving beautiful tender wife. My
                    object in writing is that you may not be dissapointed if this order be true. I want you to write regularly once a
                    week. The order may not be true &amp; I will still get your ever welcome
                    letters. Dont forget write once a week. My health is as
                    goood as usual. We are still in the old comfortable qrters. Dont know how soon we may move. The
                    Brigade was on a scout yesterday but saw no rebels. All is quiet yet. Give my
                    love to the children. Tell Josey that I am looking for another letter from him.
                    When Dr. King will send for me to go to Harrisburg I dont know. but I hope it will not be long. So that I can have the
                    pleasure of seeing you again. I would ask you to remember me at the throne of
                    Grace asking the blessing of the Almighty that I may not be led into temptation
                    but that I may be able to honor his name in my walk &amp; conversation
                    &amp; my petitions will be for you dear wife that you may be preserved in
                    this care, that his tender mercy may be over you keeping you from danger
                    &amp; temptation, that you may be sanctified &amp; be accepted holy for
                        Christ' sake.</p>
<p class="p10">Remember our vows to God in our baptism of our children, as you have all the
                    responsibilities now, watch over them, keep them out of bad company, teach them
                    the ways of Godliness &amp; may he bless you &amp; sustain you in your
                    labor of love. Dont forget to write whether the mail
                    will be stopped or not. A letter may chance to come through giving me pleasures
                    &amp; news from home. I promise to write all oppurtunities I get, whether you hear from me or not still be
                    assured that you have the tenderest love of all </p>
<p class="p10">of your most affectionate husband </p>
<p class="p10"><i>S. M. Potter </i></p>
<p class="p10">Morning this report may not be true. I hope not. I am
                        still hearty as usual.</p>
