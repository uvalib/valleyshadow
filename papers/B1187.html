<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: George B. Carse to
                    Orlando Brown, October 11, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Carse updates Brown on the murder case of Patrick Thompson and the escape of his
                    killer, J. C. Johnson, about which he originally notified authorities from
                    Staunton. According the the October 16 Stauton Spectator, Johnson escaped from
                    Lexington to Augusta County, where he was arrested in Fishersville.</p>

<p class="p10">October 11th 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Hd Qrs Lexington Va</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">On the 10th inst. I telegraphed to Br
                            Brig<sup>d</sup> Gen'l Horace Neide the information
                    that a freedmanm had been shot on the evening of sunday the 7th inst. by a law
                    Student at this place named J. C. Johnson -- it seems, from what I can learn
                    that Johnson was in company with a colored woman, named Milly, a freedman who
                    was nearby was accused by Johnson of watching him. The freedman, viz Patrick
                    Thompson denied that he was watching Johnson, some words passed, Johnson went
                    off and borrowed a pistol came back and called the negro a damned son of a bitch
                    at the same time discharging the pistol he had borrowed at him. Johnson
                    immediately turned and walked away, Thompson at first did not know that he was
                    shot, but after Johnson disappeared in the darkness the freedman placed his hand
                    upon his side and exclaimed I am shot.</p>
<p class="p10">This occured about 8 ock P.M.</p>
<p class="p10">The ball entered the body of the Freedman below the fifth rib and passed
                    downwards severing the intestines and lodging in the abdomen. Thompson died on
                    the day following (Monday) between the hours of twelve and one ock PM.</p>
<p class="p10">Owing to the indifference and want of energy manifest on the part of the civil
                    authorities Johnson was not arrested, on the contrary it seems that every
                    facility was afforded Johnson to enable him to make his escape, notwithstanding
                    the general opinion of the public pointed to Johnson as the guilty party, a
                    citizen of the town cashed a cheque for him, before bank hours, and he hired a
                    pair of fine horses at the livery stable connected with the Lexington Hotel, and
                    a freedman was sent to drive the horses for Johnson to Goshen, (a railroad
                    station on the Va.C.R.R. some
                    twenty miles from this point) and then to return the horses to the Hotel at
                    Lexington.</p>
<p class="p10">Johnson started at 1/2 p 7 or eight ock in the morning (Monday) so you see it was not
                    necessary for him to steal away, but on the contrary he was allowed to go off in
                    good style and in broad daylight, and according to all reports armed with a pair
                    of revolvers and a bowie knife.</p>
<p class="p10">When Johnson's guilt could be concealed no longer, a warrant for his arrest was
                    placed in <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>the hands of the town sergeant, but he was for a long time
                    unable to obtain a horse or any one who would consent to accompany him.</p>
<p class="p10">Finally he secured the assistance of a one legged Englishman (with two horses)
                    who consented to accompany him. Several parties attempted to dissuaide the town sergeant from pursuing Johnson,
                    stating that Johnson was well armed and would resist any force under six men.</p>
<p class="p10">Owing to the difficulty the town serg't met with in
                    obtaining horses and a man to accompany him, he was unable to start in pursuit
                    of Johnson until about 8 ock P.M. of the 8th inst
                    thus giving Johnson twelve hours start.</p>
<p class="p10">Now sir, if the above facts are not sufficient to prove that the mass of the
                    people were not desirous of bringing Johnson to justice, the fact that two men
                    were allowed to start in pursuit of him, one an old man of small stature, and
                    the other a man with only one leg, (while Johnson is a man six feet tall and
                    stout in proportion) I think is conclusive evidence that the pursuit if such it
                    may be called was only a sham.</p>
<p class="p10">And I am told by reliable white men who reside here that many of the citizens
                    express a hope and desire that Johnson will not be caught.</p>
<p class="p10">As his trial will only add to the expenses of the county, some again seem to
                    think it would be well if a few more were shot.</p>
<p class="p10">This is the second man who has been shot in cold blood in this place during the
                    past two months.</p>
<p class="p10">I trust troops will be sent here in a few days, as it is quite evident the civil
                    authorities cannot keep the students and cadets in subjection.</p>
<p class="p10">Should you desire a copy of the evidence aduced before the corroner, I will obtain it and forward it to you.</p>
