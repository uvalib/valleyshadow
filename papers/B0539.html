<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, November 3, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How files a report about the condition of blacks in his District. He writes that
                    there is a pervasive fear about what will happen once the Bureau ceases its
                    protection, citing the attitudes of their "implacable neighbors." His report
                    also discusses employment conditions and the situation of the poor and
                needy.</p>

                    Bu. &amp;c
                    Col. O. Brown<br>Asst. Commr. &amp;c
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Nov 3d 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester</p>
<p class="p10">
                        Col.
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to report that the condition of the freedmen in this district is
                    generally good, and that the operations of this Bureau have positively, and by
                    its presence negatively, added greatly to the attainment of such condition. The
                    freedman having learned that they will be protected in the exercise of
                    unquestionable rights and the former masters now knowing that they may not
                    ill-treat nor unjustly use them with impunity. The freedmen have however a vague
                    dread of being soon deprived of the assistance now given by this Bureau, and are
                    thus repressed in their aspirations for manhood through fears of being left at
                    the mercy of implacable neighbors, who now secretly vaunt the terrible things
                    they will do when "the yankees" and (with undescribable sneers) the "Freedmens
                    Bureau" are gone.</p>
<p class="p10">The freedmen are generally at work under verbal contracts
                    <i>[unclear: terminating]</i> at Christmas and are averse to written contracts
                    for a future period, because they can hardly be induced to look beyond that time
                    -- though I hope during this and the succeeding months to aid and persuade them
                    to the exercise of forethough and providence -- and the prospect now is that
                    effective labor will continue to be required in excess of the supply.</p>
<p class="p10">Among the old and infirm and <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>women with three or more little children,
                    there is now considerable suffering which will increase with the approach of
                    winter. Partial issues of rations prevents starvation but wood is also needed to
                    defend them from the cold. The local authorities profess inability to and until
                    compelled by law will not make any provision for the support of colored paupers,
                    and the former masters are only prevented from setting many adrift by the
                    knowledge that it is not permitted; although there are instances in which the
                    old ones are cherished on account of family associations, and for long and
                    faithful services.</p>
<p class="p10">The Board of Agents authorized by Circular dated Richmond Septr 27, 1865 has not been organized by all the Asst. Supts. because the citizens
                    will not act, nor serve, and can hardly be compelled to accept an invitation.
                    For Winchester, where there are a few loyal men a Board is in successful
                    operation with business enough for two half day sessions in a week. Its
                    decisions are respected and enforced.</p>
<p class="p10">The question of compensation is for the present waived but should be provided
                    for. In Woodstock a Board is organized but is without cases for trial.</p>
<p class="p10">The Mil. Authorities afford all the assistance in
                    their <i>[unclear: power]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>which in men, ways &amp; means is very limited.</p>
