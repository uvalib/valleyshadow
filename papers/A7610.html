<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Frederick Nadenbousch, October 27, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes to his son Frederick and praises him for going to school. He
                    says he has heard of his "wild and unruly behavior," however, and lectures him
                    on the importance of being a good boy. He gives him instructions for the care of
                    animals on the farm and procuring boots for the family. Nadenbousch also
                    describes life in Staunton, discusses his purchase of a hotel there, talks of
                    his desire to leave the army and see his family, and writes about friends and
                    relatives.</p>
