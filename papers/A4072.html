<p class="p10">My Dear Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">I thought I should have heard from you before now -- but I suppose you have written my letter
     has stuck by the way -- I have written twice, but know you expect another this week and I would
     not deprive you of the small amount of pleasure that lies in my power to confer on you -- We
     are now having fine weather &amp; expect to have active operations in a few days. Grant
     still employs himself in reviews &amp; changing his camps -- he has also been digging some
     entrenchments this side of Culpeper C. H. on Mrs. Green's land
     -- The grass here is quite green &amp; our horses are doing very well -- picking up after
     the hard winter they have passed through most of them are quite thin &amp; look badly. I
     have been much pleased listening to the songs of a mocking bird that sings every morning at my
     window &amp; calls around him all the varieties of birds that frequent the place by
     imitating their notes &amp; "calls" -- it is quite amusing to see a bird come flying up to
     answer the love call of its mate &amp; as suddenly turn &amp; dart off at a note of
     alarm seeming to come from an enemy -- The bird is a very plain looking one, but certainly
     quite wonderful -- I today packed up another box to send home, which I shall<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>send to
     Staunton to the care of Maj. Bell--. I enclose the demijohn &amp; one crock in the box --
     if any one goes to staunton in the course of two weeks they can get it, but do not borrow any
     trouble about it -- I sent back nearly all my clothes -- want to take as little baggage as
     possible so I may have room for something else if we succeed in getting anything. How
     cheeringly every thing goes on this Spring -- we seem to be favored in everything and if we can
     only whip the "Army of the Potomac" I think we shall be in a fair way to secure peace by the
     close of the year -- Mrs. Ewell has gone away &amp; the poor old General is almost
     disconsolate -- <u>gets up early in the morning</u> &amp; walks about
     nearly all day -- he is very active now &amp; in fine health &amp; sprints -- we are
     enjoying the butter &amp; pickles very much -- How comes on the garden -- the stock
     &amp;c &amp; &amp; especially how comes on my dear little wife &amp; my two
     babies -- Heaven bless them. It almost made me homesick last Sunday to thing that I was so far from home -- My kind regards to Mrs. Wise &amp; family -- I
     have been so busy I have not had tiem to call on Mrs. Stubblefield. Be sure &amp; write to
     me often -- &amp; tell me if there is anything you want &amp; how you get along -- I am
     so sorry I have to leave you thus all alone -- but our God will protect --</p>
<p class="p10"> Good bye my love &amp; kisses for you all </p>
<p class="p10">Your aff husband</p>
