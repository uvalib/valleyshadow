<p class="p10">Home [probably Brookfield]</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter has remained already too long unanswered but I suppose I had better
                    answer it now than leave it longer, yours was received just as I was on the eve
                    of starting to the springs and since I have returned my time has been taken up
                    with one thing and another until I have put it off until the present, it is now
                        Andrews time to write but as he has some other
                    letters to answer I will write supposing that it makes no difference to you so
                    it is a letter from home; I am sorry to inform you that mother is again very
                    poorly she was taken on tuesday morning last and has been quite unwell since we
                    have had the <i>[unclear: 
                        Dr
                    ]</i> in to see her he has been here twice I think mother is worse this
                    morning we all went to bed last night we left a candle burning in the room
                    father saw that he could give her any thing<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> she needed in the night I got up about two o;Clock an hour ago and found she
                    had rested pretty well until about 12 but since that time she has been restless
                    I concluded to stay up til morning, she bids fair to have a bad spell and I
                    think it impossible for her to stand a bad spell now as she is at best very
                    weak, I 
                        <i>[added: dont]</i>
                     see that there is much change on cousin Nancy Marshall she returned
                    about a week ago from Bath where she had been for two months nearly she is very
                    poorly and very feeble Tom is right unwell at this time and has been for two
                    weeks or more he was complaining of a disordered stomach and above (<u>or</u>
                    <u>below</u>) that his horse jumped with him one day and came
                    near smashing one of his privates it has been swelled terribly the Dr told him that unless he was careful he would have
                    to have it taken out it is now better but still he is not well he suffers
                    sometimes a good-deal of pain with it, the rest of the friends I believe are
                    well and not much sickness in the country I forgot W<sup>

                        </sup> Guthrie has been very unwell for a month or more past but is
                    now better and the friends are easy about him there was some time that they
                        though that he would not get well his disease
                    first was dysentery or flux and settled into inflamation of the bowels, you will perhaps <i>[deleted: will]</i> ask why I was at the springs I reply to get an apetite I have not had any apetite
                    hardly since I left Ga last spring a year. Mary was
                    going to her Uncle<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> Gamble's and as they are only 8 miles from
                    Stribling springs I went down there on a tuesday and came back on Saturday and
                    as father wants to go to Crawfords I went out with him and wednesday and came in
                    on Saturday he staid until last wednesday just a week
                    and came in on the <i>[unclear: cars]</i> I think you asked in your last what
                        <i>[unclear: Pancoast]</i> charges for the operation on his <i>[added: x (fathers)]</i> eye I am
                    surprised that we neglected to tell you as it was a question that was frequently
                    discussed in this neighbourhood and even persons
                    who we would have thought would never thought about it were perfectly indignant
                    at it and vowed they would never pay it, for my part I was not a great-deal
                    surprised it was only $500 five hundred dollars, they asked him a day or two
                    before they left what his charge was he told them they did not say any thing then but in thinking about it father said he
                    could not sleep for thinking about it he said that Pancoast had been very kind
                    to him and he wanted to compensate him but he really did not feel like he was
                    able to pay so much, Andrew in thinking about it was right out [MISSING SECTION]
                        <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>be satisfied Andrew told him that even that was too much he then
                    went and saw father and told him that if they would pay him $300 that he would
                    be satisfied they had but $200 with them they paid that and he told them to send
                    him another $100 whenever it suited him to pay it to take his own time about it.
                    Andrew says that he wont send him another cent father
                    says if he gets to see pretty well that he will send him another $100 father
                        cant see a bit better without his glasses than he
                    could before but with his reading glasses he can read very well his glasses for
                    going about dont suit him very well I think that
                    perhaps he can get a pair for that purpose that will suit him better, their
                    tavern bill in Philadelphia was very moderate the Landlord and Landlady were
                    very kind, It is now daylight I will stop writing for a while will add more
                    after while when I see how mother is</p>
<p class="p10">8 O'Clock We cant see that there is much change
                        <i>[unclear: on]</i> mother this morning This is a damp day and raining
                    some which we farmers are very glad to see though I am affraid it is too late for corn we have had no rain for five or six
                    weeks our corn for low ground would be perhaps pretty well made but bac<i>[added: k]</i>ward corn must be cut short we had a very
                    fine corn season <i>[deleted: for]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: came]</i> until spring time the ground is so hard that we have
                    got but little ploughing done we are ploughing now in our meadow which is
                        <i>[unclear: oat]</i> stubble and it breaks up very bumpy, we have threshed
                    some of our best wheat it weighs about 60 1/2 wheat is generally very
                    indifferent I have heard of some oats being threshed that weigh about 18 lbs to the bushel</p>
<p class="p10">Mrs Caldwell died a few weeks since of paralysis, John <i>[unclear: McLure]</i>
                    is sick at this time and they say is threatened with paralysis</p>
<p class="p10">We were sorry to hear that small pox had broken out
                    in <i>[unclear: Summerville]</i> we hardly know what to do about writing to
                    that office for fear [continued on side of first page] you wont have a chance of hearing from the office, I think we had better
                    not hear from one another awhile than to run the risk of catching the disease
                    though we are anxious to hear for fear the disease may get among some of our
                    friends</p>
<p class="p10">I believe I will add no more at present hoping to hear from you all soon if there
                    is no danger in your going to the office, I believe the people of Summerville
                    would have been perfectly justifiable in killing that little stuffed
                        <i>[unclear: not]</i> Joe Glen for his abominable fool hardiness, as I understand it was
                    through him that the small pox got to summerville, the family all join in love
                    to you and your little fellows We hope that little Ema has gotten stout before
                    this, Give my love to Mrs <i>[unclear: Rounsavalle]</i> and Mrs M<sup>c</sup>Ree's family</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate brother</p>
