<p class="p10">Oct 17<sup>th</sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I have been thinking of riting to you for some time
                    ever since the yanks were up to see us. I have a great Deal to tell you but
                        dont know whether I will get through this time or
                    not. In the first place we are all well. The yanks burnt both of our barns with about twenty five tun of hay in them &amp; all of our wheat excep about twenty five bushels that we had carried out. We saved allmost all of our farming utensils. The yanks took all
                    of our cows but too came back.</p>
<p class="p10">I refujeed over the mountain with four horses
                    &amp; our colts &amp; some old horses we left at home &amp; they
                    tried to drive the colts off but they ran off &amp; came back. They looked
                    through the house but dident take any thing except
                    some sugar &amp; one pair of pants from papa.</p>
<p class="p10">Their will be suffering times in the valley this winter
                    as the yanks have burnt all of the barns from hear down
                    &amp; all of the mills except <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>one occasionly, all of the barns in this neighborhood are burnt up
                    except two or three &amp; the worst of all every
                    body paid the yanks all of their gold &amp; silver. One thing we
                    never paid them one sent, &amp; if they never come
                    again we will do pretty well. Some people are ruined in
                        tirely. They liked to ruined Wm Pence
                    they took of both of his black men that he had bought
                    &amp; five head of horses &amp; all of his cattle &amp; sheep
                    &amp; burnt his barn he dident have a barrel of flour on hand. I tell you he is almost crazy
                    &amp; the worst of all he has to go in the army now he has to go to Staunton
                    to morrow to Start to Richmond the next day &amp; John Grove has to go also
                    &amp; all of the details. I tell you they are <i>[unclear: scraping]</i>
                    things now &amp; I think they ought <i>[unclear: for times]</i> looks
                    pretty squally but we will come out all right in the end. Some people think the
                    Confederacy is gon up all ready as the saying is.</p>
<p class="p10">There has a great many family <i>[unclear: members]</i> off to the yanks from
                    Rockingham &amp; some <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>men that had fine farms. People from hear down are very much discouraged every thing destroyed.
                    The yanks dident
                    got to John Grove. So all of the barns in that
                    neighborhood are safe. They were at Uncle Jacobs but dident burn anything in that neighborhood. The yanks stripped some
                    people of all of their stock.</p>
<p class="p10">I must tell you a little joke on Papy. Uncle John went
                    to hall some wood &amp; papy went over toward Mr. Reubushes to
                    stand picket so he could notify him if the yanks were a coming. So Mr. Reubush
                    joined Pappy &amp; they went out to the Keegle town road &amp; was a
                    looking for the yanks &amp; all at once a old yank road up in their rear &amp; asked them what they were a doing there
                    &amp; demanded their money &amp; as good luck would have it Papy
                    hadent but little &amp; he told him to go home
                    &amp; stay thier, but Mr. R. had about five
                    thousand dollars in confed &amp;
                        soime little speace
                    &amp; they robbed him &amp; as they told pap to go he left Mr R
                    &amp; cut out &amp; after he had gon the old
                    yank struck Mr R thre times with his saber &amp; so
                    he put out <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>home to with an empty pocket, a wonder the yank dident take both of their horses &amp; so that ended
                    their picketing &amp; I think it ought as they both might of been killed.
                    Nothing new except everybody so down in the mouth in Rockingham the yanks burnt
                    a good many houses the people in the lower valley will have to leave &amp;
                    go someplace this winter. One good thing almost every
                    body was done seeding &amp; the wheat is up &amp; looks very
                    fine. We hadent sowed as much as we had counted on
                    sowing but we will have to quit so ther
                    aint any to spare to mow. We had sowed some 40 bushels.</p>
<p class="p10">The people in the neighborhood are jenerlly well. I
                    tell you about that battle that we had in the valley when the yanks whipped our
                    men we were whipped very bad. I never saw such a demoralized set of men in my
                    life a heap of our men deserted some never will do us any more good but our army
                    has bin recruiting &amp; our army is in better
                    spirits than they were two weeks ago &amp; I think we will clean the yanks
                    out of the valley soon. I don't think they will be up this winter any more at
                    least I hope so. It was a bad arrangement to let the Yanks destroy the valley. I
                        dont see how our army is to live in Va this winter the valley has bin our main support &amp; that is nearly all destroyed. James D.
                    Schreckhise is safe yet at last accounts but the old company that I ust to belong to was all killed or captured except one
                    private &amp; that is Wm Sheets. Lieut. Joseph Frey was wounded &amp; ded he was <i>[unclear: dead]</i> three weeks yesterday.
                    That is his third Son for to be killed in this war. George
                    <i>[unclear: Baker]</i> has got back from Fort Delaware paroled as he was
                    wounded. A. B. is still their. Nothing more new to
                        right at this time right
                    soon &amp; a long letter. Let us know what you think of things in jenerale. Give my Respect to Amanda &amp; receive a
                    portion for thyself. </p>
<p class="p10">yours</p>
