<p class="p10">
                    <u>Circular</u>
                </p>
<p class="p10">In order to secure the utmost efficiency in promoting the welfare of the
                    Freedmen, and in executing the designs of this Bureau all its officers and
                    agents are expected to be earnest and assiduous in their efforts to render all
                    possible assistance and give good counsel to every freedman whither the limits
                    of their several jurisdictions and spheres of duty. They are also desired to
                        <i>[unclear: receive]</i> and report all facts which may come to their
                    knowledge relating to the present character, condition, capacity and needs of
                    the freedmen, and the disposition, requirements and treatment of them by those
                    who employ them, and among whom they now live as neighbors.</p>
<p class="p10">Remember that they are no longer to be driven, but encouraged to labor, and where
                    the advantage of industry, skill, and <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>knowledge are fairly set before
                    them, as essential to true manhood it is hoped that they <i>[added: will]</i> exercise their freedom and become useful members
                    of the community in which they live. Of course there are many dazed by the light
                    suddenly shining upon their darkened minds, and others who have imbibed
                        <i>[unclear: vicious]</i> tendencies, who can no more be expected to at
                    once enter upon a course of good conduct, than could a band of outlaws, suprised
                    by official pardon with the simple request of good behavior.</p>
<p class="p10">These are to be <i>[unclear: warned]</i> of the certain result of idleness and
                    vice, and if need be, treated as other criminals.</p>
<p class="p10">The destitute helpless ones are to be sought out, by personal inspection so far
                    as practicable, and if possible relieved. If the prescribed method is
                    inapplicable, state the case, and recommend a way.</p>
<p class="p10">The recent organization of the Bureau <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>renders it very probable, that
                    all contingencies are not provided for, hence every officer should be prompt and
                    careful in reporting every case not met by his instructions, and industrious in
                    collecting and transmitting facts which may in any degree add to the information
                    upon which instructions are based.</p>
<p class="p10">This circular is made suggestion for the purpose of stimulating each officer and
                    agent to the exercise of industry and zeal in the work intrusted to him, a duty
                    which should always be <i>[unclear: in operation]</i>, and is now especially so
                    in view of the near approach of the Christmas week in which many of the labor
                    contracts terminate, and idleness generally prevails.</p>
<p class="p10">Instant attention will therefore be given to the subject of written contracts and
                    their importance explained to and <i>[unclear: urged]</i> upon the employer and
                    the employed, with the object of securing the interests of all parties.</p>
