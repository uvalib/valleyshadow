<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">April 12, 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg, Pa.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Col-</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote you last <i>[unclear: evening]</i> that I had arranged for my Lumber. A
                    friend who is an old dealer, has kindly consented to supply me at cost, and I
                    will save much trouble &amp; some money by the arrangement.</p>
<p class="p10">i fully agree with you about the wisdom of <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    Bains very high. <i>[illeg.]</i> was 22 1/2, &amp; the new one will be the
                    same. I would have made it 24, but for the fact that it will, <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    at 22 1/2, be rather too prominent for the House.</p>
<p class="p10">I am going to rebuild my house this summer also &amp; it is a fearful
                    undertaking. I am sorely perplected about it &amp; the more I study the more
                    I get confused as to what kind of House I shall build. Mrs McC &amp; I have agreed that the roof shall be on the top
                    &amp; the cellar under the House, but that is about as far as we have got.</p>
<p class="p10">My grounds are such that I have but a certain amount of room each way, without
                    interfering with some tree or something else, so that I must locate it about as
                    the old one was &amp; cannot widen <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>out either way. I mean to
                    follow the general plan of yours which is something after the old one, <i>[deleted: ]</i> Library, Drawingroom, kitchen &amp; on one side &amp;
                    parlor on the other.</p>
<p class="p10">I will go down to Philadelphia next week, if I can then meet <i>[unclear: Jr
                    Rice]</i> &amp; will stay there until I worry out a plan, &amp;
                    then I will dismiss the subject &amp; put the contractor at work.</p>
<p class="p10">It is a jolly time to build. Home &amp; <i>[unclear: Bain]</i> will cost me
                    all of $20,000 &amp; then finishing is to follow.</p>
<p class="p10">I think the war is ended, &amp; the Order is safe. In that there is no army
                    in <i>[unclear: Vgnia]</i> for <i>[illeg.]</i> to <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>fall back upon,
                    they will soon be compelled to abandon their occupation, as the will be hunted
                    &amp; shot down wherever caught.</p>
<p class="p10">There will be <i>[unclear: restagnation]</i> in <i>[unclear: answer]</i> this
                    year. Gold will higher. <i>[illeg.]</i> to 1866 than now, &amp; I doubt a
                    letter at <i>[unclear: will]</i> at any time in the next three years touch so
                    long a <i>[illeg.]</i> as it did on Monday last.</p>
<p class="p10">Our debt is now <i>[unclear: $4,000,000,000]</i>. It is all very well as long as
                    the <i>[unclear: gvnmnt]</i> delivers $4,000,000 per day: but when that stops,
                    the <i>[unclear: severe]</i> ordeal for government credit will be at <i>[deleted: ]</i></p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AK McClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Hon Eli Slifer
