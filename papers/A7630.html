                    &amp; we could not get along as fast as might have done. We are here
                    located. Freddy seems much pleased and quite contented he makes himself quite at
                    home. all seem pleased with him. he rides out of evenings. I will try &amp;
                    improve him &amp; not spoil him. I find he will be of good service here to
                    me as messenger &amp;c &amp;c whilst I write tonight at 11 ohc he is beside me in bed sound asleep</p>
<p class="p10">We have a fair <i>[unclear: num]</i> of custom here now</p>
