<h4>Augusta County: John Scott to E. P. Smith, December 21, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Scott asserts that Sarah H. Davison--though helpful in the Sunday schools and as an assistant in the day schools--is ill-prepared for the rigors of teaching in the Valley.</p>

Mr Smith 
Staunton Va

<p class="p10">Dec 21<sup>st</sup> 1868</p>

<p class="p10">(Appendix to Vol. 1)</p>
<p class="p10">Being in doubt about the propriety of sending this letter, I have held it over until now to see what circumstances might be developed</p>
<p class="p10">This lady (Miss Davison) works <u>well</u> in the Sabbath school and is going to be, of considerable use in the day school.  Still it is an unfavorable place for a teacher to improve herself in the field, and particularly in <u>this</u> field, where even more seems demanded of a <u>competent teacher</u> than she would be able to perform;  And while I could get <u>along in some way</u>, by hiring a colored assistant, without any change or any more help from you, still the previous letter and the reasoning therin remains in nearly all the force in which I have written it.</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose that the church in <u>Chester</u> <i>[illeg.]</i> would pay Miss D's board in case another teacher should come, as these people would not <i>[illeg.]</i> than support two.  My Books have arrived and as soon as I can see if they are all right according to the Invoice--I will send the receipt.</p>
