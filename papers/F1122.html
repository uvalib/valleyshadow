<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to Rosenbery,
                    John Abraham (father) and probably Mary Jane Snider (Franklin's stepmother),
                    February 14, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rosenbery discusses strategy for crossing the Rapidan River and describes the
                    attempt to implement that strategy. Rosenbery anticipates heavy fighting in the
                    summer; he does not believe he will be able to return home after only nine
                    months of service. As in earlier letters, he still waits for his repaired watch
                    from home, and he also is still waiting to get paid.</p>

<p class="p10">February 14, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Stepheansburg, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father and Step Mother-</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself to inform you that your letter came to hand a few days ago.</p>
<p class="p10">I was glad to hear that you were all well. I am well at this time. Hoping that
                    these few lines may finde you all enjoying escellent health. I have not much to write if I were
                    at home I could talk more than I can write here for you would ask questions and
                    I would try and answer them.</p>
<p class="p10">On the 6th of this month we went out recconnonitering. We went down to the Rapidon
                    River.</p>
<p class="p10">We lay as a support. This is our Division. While the 3rd Division was taken
                    across the river by General Hays. He was supposed to be drunk and I do not doubt
                    it in the least.</p>
<p class="p10">General Warren has ordered General Hays to advance to the river and no further.
                    The object is view was to releave the Calvery Picket and draw the
                    attention of the rebs while General Kilpaterick would make a raid in order to give the
                        rebs a chance to throw down arms and come over
                    then that wished.</p>
<p class="p10">And others said it was to draw their attention while General Butler would try to
                    release our prisoners at Richmond.</p>
<p class="p10">Be this as it may it looked like a very foolish thing to me that General Hays
                    would take his men across the river in front of their artilery knowing at the same time that we could not get our artilery near enough to play on theirs.</p>
<p class="p10">The 3rd Division had to march by the flank while the rebs mowed them down with grape and shell.</p>
<p class="p10">As far as I can lean the rport states that there is 250 men killed, wounded and missing. But this
                    I do not believe. I hope that it is not so many but I fear that it is worse.</p>
<p class="p10">The engagement took place on Saturday 6th-Hays crossed in the morning. Then
                    recrossed in the evening on the night we returned to camp.</p>
<p class="p10">I look for hard fighting this summer. I wrote a letter to A. and Ashway sometime ago. I have
                        rec'd no answer as yet.</p>
<p class="p10">I fear that it is libious about my getting home when
                    my 9 months are up. Well, it shall not trouble me if I live I will get home
                        sometime.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, I wrote Brother John a letter some time ago. I wonder if he has got it.</p>
<p class="p10">I have sent a ring in a letter to Rachel that I made and I sent her a memorial.</p>
<p class="p10">I would like to have my watch if ever slow motion get its finished.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, write soon and I will write as often as I can. So farewell for this time.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
<p class="p10">I have no post stamps.<br> I can't tell when I will get
                        paid. I will sende a certificate home as soon as I
                        can.</p>
