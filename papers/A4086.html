<p class="p10">Hd. Qrs. V. D. Near

<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">We yesterday came back across the Potomac and encamped at one of our camps of 1862, before we
     went to Md -- I wrote to you from Sharpsburg -- when we left there we had no line of
     communication kept up -- so I have not written -- We went to Harperstown (the Cavalry)
     &amp; levied $30000 &amp; collected it in Greenbacks -- we crossed the S. Mt. the day
     we left S. &amp; went to Middletown collecting horses,
     cattle &amp;c and levied $1500 on that place, went to Frederick City on Saturday, levied
     $200000 on it &amp; collected it, there bought of the merchants what we wanted &amp;
     paid for it in their own money -- the enemy made a stand there &amp; we had a fight at
      <i>[unclear: Monocacy]</i> Junction, where we flanked &amp; routed the enemy and drove
     them with great loss towards Baltimore -- we went on the next day through
     <i>[unclear: Urbanna]</i> towards Washington, &amp; on Monday we went up to the
     fortifications, &amp; within 6 miles of the President's House, but our Men were so much
     exhausted by the intense heat (I never experienced warmer weather)that we could not go on to
     the assault of the works that morning, &amp; by evening the enemy had been re-<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>inforced by a Corps from Grants Army, so we only spent the next day skirmishing with the
     enemy, then turned round &amp; came back &amp; crossed the river -- our Cavalry went
     around Baltimore, burned up the railroad bridges, captured &amp; burned trains &amp;c
     &amp;c, they also did the same around Washington, cutting off all communications -- We
     whipped the Yankee Cavalry at Beltsville on the Washington &amp; Balto road &amp; captured a good many of them &amp; 300 miles besides -- We
     have been over 3/4 of the state of Md, scared "Old Abe" so that he has ordered a good portion
     of his force away from Richmond captured thousands of horses &amp; cattle -- whipped the
      enemy<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>in a regular battle &amp; with small loss returned safely to a position
     that threatens Washington &amp; Pa. at the same time -- ready to move in any direction by
     all odds the most successful expedition we have ever made into the enemys [CORRECT enemy's]
     country -- I have bought for you, which I shall send in one bundle to the care of Maj Bell
     &amp; by the first opportunity 6 yds, bonnet Ribbon, 2 pr. kid
     Gloves, 20 yds bleached cotton, 40 odd yds dark calico, 1/2 doz Ladies &amp; 1/2 doz Gents Hdkfs, 7 yds gray
     cloth for myself &amp; 2 undershirts &amp; 1 Pr. drawers
     &amp; I keep some underclothing here -- I also send a small piece of bleached <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>cotton which measure &amp; use as you may desire -- I also send your shoes &amp;
     Nelly's -- I could not go to buy myself -- was on duty &amp; had to do it by proxy,
     &amp; do not much like some of the articles, but you can exchange or make them suit you
     some way I hope -- I think I shall get some more things next trip -- everything is very dear
     &amp; costs high -- the cotton was 70 cts -- I wrote to Father, Nancy &amp; Allie from
     Washington &amp; the letters will be mailed there -- hoping soon to hear from you &amp;
      <i>[illeg.]</i> God's blessing for you -- </p>
<p class="p10">I am your Aff husband</p>
