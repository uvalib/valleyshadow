<h4>Augusta: William Brand to Kate Armentrout, September
                    15, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William describes some of the recent troop movements and engagements in northern
                    Virginia; he mentions some Union prisoners who seemed uninterested in continuing
                    the war. He also suggests that Kate does not take his affections for her
                    seriously.</p>

<p class="p10">Camp Harman Senterville

<p class="p10">My dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">As I have not hurd from you for a long time, I have
                    seated my self this beautifull Sabbath morning for
                    the purpose of dropping you a fiew lines. I have been
                    looking for a letter from you for some time past. Indeed, I have not recieved a from Augusta for the last three weeks. I
                    begin to think that I am <i>[unclear: uttrably]</i> forsaken no one can tell
                    the pleasure that it affords, a poor soldier on recieveing a letter from his friends &amp; acquaintances. It
                    enlivens his mind &amp; makes him energetick in
                    performing his duties thre is no<i>[deleted: t]</i>
                    news of interrest to write our advance pickets are
                    in two miles of the Arlington highths night before
                    last Stuards
                    Cavelry seen thare advance
                    guard across the river. Colonel Stuard said he was in
                    two miles of Washington <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    thay took fifteen or twenty Prisoners. John Plunket went
                    down to fairfax Court house he said he had an interview with some of the
                    Prisoners two Lieutenants &amp; some privates thay
                    said thay
                    ware glad that they had been taken prisoners for thay did not care which way the victory went that thay had been forced to come on the soil of Va.
                    thay said that old Abe promest to keep them in the city for to protect it and after he got them
                        thare he made them go whare
                        ever he pleased.</p>
<p class="p10">I have now doubt that thare will
                    be a forward moovement on our side before long.
                        Artilery is going down almost evry day it is said that we can burn Alexandria Georgetown &amp;
                    part of Washington from halls hill, that was taken the other night it is said
                    that we can knock the Washington Aquiduct all to
                    pieces. The red flag waves in full view of the white house evry day I reckon that it is very provoking to old Abe, when he
                    takes his spy glass &amp; looks over into Virginia and thare see what he cauls
                    <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> the rebel flag waving write under his nose.</p>
<p class="p10">We just hurd that we would have to move down the road
                    about four miles. I am glad ove it though we will be laveing a very nice camp and a healthy one. We will be
                        neerer the enimy.</p>
<p class="p10">Thare are three men walking up and down our regament
                    carriing
                    thare
                    napsacks as a punishment for thare misconduct. I <i>[added: would]</i> as
                        leaf be shot I believe thare is grate injustice done to our Company
                    since the battle of the 21th of June, enought to break
                    our Com. up but hope it will not have that affect for I hope yet to see the Augusta Grays march
                    back to Greenville after peace is made. I would like very much to see <u>you</u> and open my hold
                    <u>heart</u> to you put some times I
                        <u>think</u> you care nothing for <u>me</u> what <u>ever</u>, then it cannot be that <u>lover</u> so <u>pure</u> can be treated
                    with <u>coldness</u>
                    thare seems yet a happy <u>future</u> spread out before me. And I shall enjoy the Camy prize of freedom. I must soon bring my letter to a close. My health
                    is very good &amp; hope this short <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> letter will find you enjoying
                    good health. Your Brother is well and harty my
                    Brothers are both well your friend James V. is well &amp; harty.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to all inquireing friends. I ask an
                        interrest in your prayers that I may hold out
                        faith full
                    untill the end. Write soon as I am ever ancious to hear from you.</p>
<p class="p10">nothing more put remain your true and sincere <u>lover</u>,</p>
