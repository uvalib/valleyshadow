<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">As the most of the boys have retired to thare bed of
                    poles I have concluded to drop you a fiew lines, My
                    health is very good &amp; hope theese
                    fiew lines may find you enjoying the same blessing. Thare is no news of importance to write, we hafto go on picket tomorrow morning I suppose we will
                    get a peep at our enimies I hope we may have a plesent time while we are on picket, Thare has been a grate deal of snow
                    &amp; rain in the last two week I hope we may have
                    some more clear weather now The road are almost a bed
                    of mud. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>It is almost imposible to get
                        provitions from the debot to our camp I suppose thare is plenty of
                    snow in augusta now for sleighing if so I hope you
                    may have some plesent
                    sleighrides we take our fun in snowballing. We
                    have formed a Bible class &amp; meet on sundy
                    &amp; Wednsday nights to recite our lessings I hope it may be carried on and that some good
                    may come ove it we have a grand theatre in the Regt,
                    carried on by Capt Brown of the Marion Rifles he is a very good performer he is
                    a noble singer. Capt Newton started home this morning on furlough he is very
                    lucky in getting home though I do not envy him his good fortune I would have
                    written by the Capt if I had have had notice <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>in time. As it is I will
                        hafto risk another by mail hoping it may soon
                    reach your hand Well Kate did your cous, Lizzie make you acquainted with all her
                        secreets if so do you know who she is engaged to
                    I will tell you my reasons for asking you this question in my next letter if you
                    answer it I am a thousand times obliged to you for the cheese you sent to me I
                    assure you it was something I never look for I would like to be in a mess with
                    your brother but the boys would think hard of me for leaving my old mess I may
                    say we are almost one mess for whenever one mess gets a box the other is envited to share its contents but if Lieut Dempster
                    joines the officers mess I exspect to change well Kate
                    I wasent aware that I had <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>shown so many
                        sines of my weakness on leaving Greenville it goes
                    to show the feebleness of mans nature I was very sorry to hear of the perevements of the Harris famlies I hope the alwise God may do
                    unto them as he did unto jobe of old bless thare future years you said you wished you could take our
                    places down hear do you think you could stand out on
                        gard one of theese cold
                    nights and if you could dont you thin we would be as unhappy if all the Ladies ware
                    hear and we ware at home you
                    wrote as if you had been trying to get me to change my love for you but alass how could I you are constantly in my thoughts by day
                    and my dreams by night &amp; God forbid that I should ever love another
                    woman I have often thought dear Kate that you never loved me as I did you but
                    found the keys of my heart and took pity on me. It seemes to me that man is one
                    of Gods weakest instruments well Kate I have not entirely quit chewing tobacco
                    yet I have used one plug since I came back to the company I used to chew two a
                    week I hope I may entirely quit before long; uncle John was wounded at the sharpsburg fight in the arm, I exspect he is in buckingham. Bro John
                    had a letter for me from Sister when I came down She was well and going to
                    school I would like very much to see her Jake is well and looks harty cous, Jimmie is enjoying the same blessing I must
                    bring my letter to a close as it is afto twelve oclock
                    Abe stayed up and bothered me untill eleven trying to
                    find out who I was going to write to my respects to all; the family write soon
                    as I am always glad to hear from you let no one see this</p>
