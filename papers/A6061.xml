     <salute>Dear Brother</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I take my pen in hand this morning to write you a few lines <orig reg="having">haveing</orig>
     a good opportunity to send a letter. John Beard starts back <orig reg="today">to day</orig> he
     has been home better than two weeks I think he is anxious to get back to his company. We are
     all well at present but hear that you are sick, in the hospital with the <orig reg="measles"
      >measels</orig>. We heard that were sick from letters that were written to people out of the
     neighborhood. You I suppose meant it for the best not to let us know that you were sick, but I
     say never do that way again, truth is always better than uncertainty. It is two weeks yesterday
     since we heard from you I thought you might have written and the letter been <orig
      reg="miscarried">miscaried</orig> but ma was getting very uneasy and I dont know what she
     would have done by this time had we not heard you were sick. But enough of the measles I hope
     you will get over them well and never take them again I reckon when Tish had them and they were
     expecting us to take them you never would have thought you would have had them where you are
     now. But such are the changes of life The next time you get sick I hope you will not try to
     keep it from us I suppose you were sick time you had that fight near Martinsburg &amp; if
     you were like John Beard you would wish you had been there to give the enemy as many bullets as
     they would take, to operate well, But if you were in the hospital how did you escape being
     taken prisoner Sam Helms is in Middlebrook now he was taken prisoner &amp; I have heard is
     home on parole of honor and is waiting an exchange of prisoners &amp; that people about
      <abbr expan="Middlebrook">brook</abbr> are somewhat suspicious of him. others say he was made
     to take the oath if it is the former way I think it is very strange, <del hand="h1">that</del>
     It <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> agree with the general character of the North in <orig
      reg="their">there</orig> treatment of their prisoners. I suppose you have heard of Bob
     McChesney's being killed whilst out scouting by an ambush of the Northern troops. His brother
     &amp; Jack McBride started Tuesday for his body They are taking a<pb n="2" entity="Smiley30b" pid="uva-lib:503183"/>
      metallic coffin and intend bringing him home if they can get his
     body. but have returned without him fighting out there <orig reg="Bill">Bil</orig> Runnels was
     one of that scout also; but they all escaped with a loss however of their Lieutenant and
     several horses. I must tell you <orig reg="something">some thing</orig> now of this very
     efficient company the Newport militia or rather their Captain. Last Thursday was their muster
     day when the oath of allegiance was administered and taken by all except two Lacy &amp;
     their Captain Johnny. He was then turned out of office and <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr>
     Hite elected in his stead. Hutchens says he is too religious to fight he <orig reg="won't"
     >wont</orig> fight against his relations who are nearly all in the North. That if he went he
     wouldn't fire a ball at the Yankee's &amp; that he didnt know whether he would take his
     company North or South. <orig reg="Don't">Dont</orig> you think he ought to have the words
     Traitor to his country, branded on his forehead, as <orig reg="heretic">heretick</orig> was
     branded on in ancient times. I believe I have written nearly all I think of I guess you will
     hear all the news from John Beard <orig reg="probably">propably</orig> some that you also <orig
      reg="won't">wont</orig> be very well pleased with as John was not. We have heard that the
     stage has stopped running between Winchester and Staunton if that is the case I dont know how
     John will get back I hope though he will not have to walk. We have also heard that <orig
      reg="Charleston">Charlston</orig> is taken &amp; that Winchester is surrounded by the
     Northern army. &amp; again this morning that they have been driven back into Maryland which
     I hope is true. It is also reported that there has been a battle in Western <abbr
      expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> &amp; that our men have been driven back. Cannon reports are
     heard nearly every day by some person. The firm of Lincoln Seward &amp; <abbr
      expan="Company">Co</abbr> seem determined to prosecute the war from the Presidents message to
     Congress. The message says that a majority of the people in all the Seceded States are in favor
     of the Union. What a fool &amp; I hope to his sorrow he may find it out. But I must close
     Write soon and let us know all the particulars down your way</p>
