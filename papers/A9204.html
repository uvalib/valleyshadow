<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I havent
                    mutch to write as Jinnie hase
                    written but will say if you can get aney Beaver cloake cloth for Jinnie and I. we have our cloth at home
                    it looks very well now but when it is woren a while it
                        wont look well. I was at Staunton friday week saw
                    some cloth I could have got for one 100 and 25 dollars a yard is very hevey. since that time it was sold M<sup>rs</sup>
                    M<sup>c</sup>Cormac and I was thare last friday it was all gone but I could have gotten
                    off <i>[deleted: of]</i> several peases of brod cloth some cotten chain
                    and some all wool all the same price named a bove I was offered 50 for mine but
                    I wouldent take that I do not want to doo a foolish thing sell mine <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and get Brod. cloth sutch as men make coats of you
                    know that wont
                    doo unless it is well lined about the Baddie - if you cant
                    get for a fare
                    prise do not get at all. some get 4 yards for a cloake but I think 7 or sevin
                    and a half will make too
                    cloakes for Jinnie and I. the cloth is dubble
                    wedth I thaught you could
                    get good cloth thare for less than I could here. let
                        mee know what you can doo I will
                    keep the cloth untill I hear from you if you get cloth
                    send with some reliable person or fetch your self I think you mite be able to come home. Henry and B F M<sup>c</sup>Nutt come home last night on detail to get som things and our cattle they brot a wagon to take things in Apples and potatos and dry froot they have to go back
                    thursday or friday. Henry and all the detailed men are all as mad as they can
                        bee all can hardley keep our
                    stack of wheet men come
                    saturday four come yesterday to get wheet and some come last week and pressed
                    the tith corn. It maks H mad
                    to think they detail men out of the armey to thrash and
                    shuck corn insted of leaving the oners to attend to there
                    one
                    buisness try all you can to get home thare is a good deal of wool to card yet some have been
                    taken a way some say they are waiting on your geting
                    home Henry seems to think if the people would get up a pertion you could get off Ad Steel got off as Miller. write soon did
