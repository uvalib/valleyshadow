<p class="p10">Nov 3<sup>d</sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Willow Row</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Uncle</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of Oct 29<sup>th</sup> was received
                    day before yesterday. Jennie went to her father's last friday and has not yet
                    retruned. I went with her, was at church friday and saturday. She and Becca
                    expected to go down the country this week but I think it is doubtful whether
                    they have gone yet as yesterday was rainy, and today is cloudy and cool. Jennie
                    told us to open your letters if we received any in her absence. You spoke of
                    needing your overcoat but did not say whether we should it, if we have a safe
                    opportunity. I do not know that we will have an opportunity unless we box it up
                    and send by express to Camp Lee. You also spoke of a pair of boots but did not
                    tell us to get them made. I believe Rowe is not yet able to work, and if he was
                    we would not know which leather to take and I reckon Rowe has not your measure.
                    Uncle Henry did not get home but M<sup>r</sup>. Black saw him in
                    Staunton on saturday, he said they <i>[added: about 400]</i>
                    were sent up to Staunton under guard and kept there under guard left camp <i>[deleted: ]</i> about one oclock saturday. We have not heard from them since,
                    being kept under guard (M<sup>r</sup>. Black said) was right galling
                    to the men but they had to submit. They<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>did not like to be put with
                    and treated as deserters, and shirkers. Uncle H sent up the veil you sent, and I
                    sent it to Jennie on monday. We are all doing the best we can. Alex stays with
                    us and helps Alfred. There has been some cider made at the mill Alex attends to
                    it, Aunt Mag refused to let people make it at first but when she found that he
                    could attend to it she did not hinder. M<sup>r</sup>. Decker was here
                    last week, said he wanted to saw a stick this week for something about M H Mill,
                    but has not come on yet to do it. Mr. Taliaferro sent <i>[unclear: some]</i>
                    word the other day that he wants all the plank that is at the Mill, that he will
                    haul some sticks in place, he knew I was writing to Uncle H. at the time and
                    wished me to write about that, which I did, though I told Alex I thought
                    doubtful if he <i>[added: Uncle H]</i> knew any thing <i>[added: or much,]</i> about it and I thought it was your
                        <i>[deleted: understanding]</i> intention for him to have it, so I
                    thought I tell you and when you write you can say something about it, if you
                    think necessary. Are there many of your men found for light duty and assigned to
                    heavy artillery are you drilling any or learning how to fire your guns. I
                    suppose from what you say in your letter that <i>[deleted: 
                        men
                    ]</i>
                    <i>[added: you]</i> sometimes have to go in the trenches as
                    well as mind your guns. I believe I have no news to write when you please try
                    and give us all the news you can Take good care of yourself, keep in good
                    spirits. Put your trust in God, and I pray God to bless cure accept and take
                    care of (preserve) you, and bring you home in His good time may that good time
                    be soon.</p>
