                    the children here with me would be satisfied. I am trying to buy Some place here
                    for a home &amp; if can will try &amp; get you out it is impossible to
                    rent a house here now all are full up. See in the mean time if you will be
                    allowed to pass through the lines with all of your property
                    <i>[unclear: Come]</i> &amp;c. &amp; see if teams could be gotten for
                    the purpose &amp; if you can get a good trusty person to live in the house

                    well satisfied property &amp; everything else here are quite high &amp;
                    hard to get I am sick &amp; tired being by myself and must have a change I

                    difficulty in getting out</p>
<p class="p10">You put up all the fruit you can &amp; prepare well for the winter &amp;
                    spring if you do move I suppose you are as anxious as I am for a move. M<sup>rs</sup> Schoppert is quite anxious to see the girls &amp;
                    particularly Jane if you come out Jane or Mary or both must come out with you. I
                    will try &amp; get entirely out of the service so soon as I can My Physical
                    condition will not justify my remaining in service</p>
<p class="p10">This is a place not liked by most of people but the people have been exceedingly
                    kind &amp; courteous to me about all of the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    gentlemen here have call on me &amp; I the pleasantness of the place depends
                    upon a mansown conduct all have been quite attentive to
                    me. Tell M<sup>r</sup> Riddle that the tobacohere is all right. Write me soon &amp; all the news send out
                    by some safe person</p>
