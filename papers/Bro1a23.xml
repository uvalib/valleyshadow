Dear Sister,
</salute>
</opener>
<p>The time has again come round for <lb/>
me to write home.  And it must be done <lb/>
<orig reg="tonight">to night</orig> or you will not get one this week.  <lb/>
Because we have a little more spare time <lb/>
Wednesday night than any other, and <lb/>
precious little then, for in addition to our <lb/>
regular studies we have a poor chance to <lb/>
do for examinations; two of which <lb/>
we will have next week, Greek,
Mathematics.<ref n="1" target="n1">[1]</ref>
</p>
<p>We are very well.  The anniversary of the <lb/>

Graham Society <ref n="2" target="n2">[2]</ref> came off on last night.  <lb/>
It was such a pleasant and beautiful moonlight <lb/>
that there was a large crowd.  <lb/>
The anniversary address was delivered by <name type="person">Mr. <lb/>
Paxton</name> of
<name type="place">Rockbridge</name>.<ref n="3" target="n3">[3]</ref>
It was a very good <lb/>
address, well written and very well delivered. </p>
<p>The question, "If Turkey fails to protect her <lb/>
Christians <add place="inline" hand="h1" n="editor">should</add> nations interfere" was then <lb/>
discussed by four other members of Society, <lb/>
whose names it is not necessary to mention.  <lb/>
<pb n="2" entity="Bro1a234" pid="uva-lib:502869"/>

All the front of the college was illuminated <lb/>
and made a very pretty appearance. </p>
<p>The people of this county held a meeting at <lb/>
the Court house, Monday to nominate candidates <lb/>
for the convention which resulted in the <orig reg="nomination">nomi-<lb/>
nation</orig> of <name type="person">
<orig reg="Samuel McDowell Moore">S McD Moore</orig></name> and
<name type="person">James Dorman,</name><lb/>
two strong Union men, so that if the <lb/>
question of Virginia's secession depends upon <lb/>
their votes, she wont go out soon.  Who are candidates in
Augusta?<ref n="4" target="n4">[4]</ref>
</p>
<p>From all I can hear, I think that the <lb/>
secessionists are rapidly gaining ground <lb/>
in Virginia, and would not be surprised if <lb/>
that convention should declare Virginia out <lb/>
of the Union.  From present appearances it <lb/>
seems that we are almost sure to have civil war.  <lb/>
There are such extensive military preparations <lb/>
going on in the north and from the threatening <lb/>
and insulting way in which the Republican <lb/>
papers and from the overbearing and <lb/>
contemptuous actions <unclear> </unclear> <lb/>
of Congress in refusing compromises giving <lb/>
the South the barest justice, it must be
<pb n="3" entity="Bro1a235" pid="uva-lib:502870"/>


<name type="person">Lincoln's</name> intention to compel the South <lb/>
to remain in the Union, if he can.  <lb/>
And if he attempts that, the whole South <lb/>
will and ought to unite and oppose it.  <lb/>
A week or two ago, a few of the boys secretly <lb/>
made and hoisted upon top of College <lb/>
a Disunion Flag, bearing a single red star and <lb/>
the word Disunion.  But <name type="person">Dr. Junkin</name> very <lb/>
soon had it taken down and there has <lb/>
been nothing said about disunion
since.<ref n="5" target="n5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>
Yesterday was warm and clear, but now it <lb/>
is cold and snowing.  I never saw weather <lb/>
so changeable, or so much rain, or so many <lb/>
cloudy and foggy days in my life as we <lb/>
have had here.  It is hardly ever clear three <lb/>
days at one time. </p>
<p>
We have been looking for a letter from <lb/>
home for two or three days to tell us <lb/>
about the wedding, but haven't got one <lb/>
yet.  You must think we don't want to <lb/>
hear!  Does <name type="person">Uncle Andy</name> look like he <lb/>
is married?<ref n="6" target="n6">[6]</ref></p>
<pb n="4" entity="Bro1a236" pid="uva-lib:502871"/>

<p>Writing letters is the hardest work <lb/>
that I have to do at College and since <lb/>
there is nothing here that will interest <lb/>
you, and believing that I have done <lb/>
remarkably well in having written this <lb/>
much, I quit. </p>
<closer>
<salute>Love to all,<lb/>

<note n="1" id="n1" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg><p> Andrew Brooks attended Washington College (present day
Washington and Lee University) which was located in Lexington, Virginia.
During the antebellum period, the typical student at
Washington College studied the classics, mathematics,
physical sciences, and rhetoric (Crenshaw 80-81).
In the months leading up to the war, the issue of Virginia's secession
was hotly debated amongst the students and faculty (Bean, 3-9).
</p></note>

<note n="2" id="n2" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[2]</seg><p> The Graham Philanthropic Society, which was founded in 1809,
was a literary and debating society that
held weekly debates, hosted notable speakers, and maintained a
library.  Each January, the Society observed its
anniversary with a special celebration (Crenshaw 106-110).
</p></note>

<note n="3" id="n3" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[3]</seg><p> Andrew Brooks may be referring to James G. Paxton,
editor of the Lexington <hi rend="italic">Valley Star</hi> and
a Democratic delegate to the General
Assembly (Crenshaw 67-68).  "Mr. Paxton" could also refer to Col.
Frank Paxton, an alumnus of Washington College (Turner, 124).
</p></note>

<note n="4" id="n4" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[4]</seg><p>
Verifying Andrew Brooks' comments, James White wrote on
January 23 that "a convention of
conservatives" from Rockbridge County
had nominated Samuel McDowell Moore and James Dorman
as delegates to the State
Convention that
met to decide whether to secede.
On February 5, White reported that Moore and
Dornan had won those seats (Turner 34-35).   At the Virgina Convention, Dornan
supported and Moore opposed secession; the secessionists won
with a vote of 85 to 45 (Turner 38).
Both and Moore and Dorman
were members of the Virginia legislature; Dorman was also an alumnus of
Washington College. (Crenshaw 63-4; 67).

</p></note>

<note n="5" id="n5" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[5]</seg><p>  Rev. George Junkin, the president of Washington College,
was born in Pennsylvania and supported the Union, even though he owned
slaves.  Junkin, a Whig, argued that the introduction of slavery into
the territories was a non-issue and that secession could be avoided by
regarding it as such.  According to Junkin, Virginia initiated "a
rebellion without cause" when it joined the Confederacy (quoted by Bean,
5).  Junkin preached actively and passionately against secession and
silenced students who delivered oratories in support of it.  His
actions and attitudes caused students to rebel, as they scribbled
graffiti calling Junkin "a Pennsylvania abolitionist" on the columns of
a building and flew flags celebrating the Confederacy over a statue of
George Washington.  When, after Virginia seceded, the faculty overruled
Junkin's efforts to remove a Southern flag, he resigned and returned to
Pennsylvania (Bean 6-7).  Not all of his family left with him;
Stonewall Jackson was his son-in-law.
</p></note>

<note n="6" id="n6" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[6]</seg><p> On Janury 17, 1861, Andrew Stuart
(the brother of Andrew Brooks' mother Eleanor Tate
Stuart Brooks) married Sarah McClure near Greenville,
Augusta County (<hi rend="italic">The Republican Vindicator</hi>, February 1, 1861, p. 3).
According to the 1860 census, Sarah McClure was 36 in 1860;
her father was a fairly wealthy farmer.
