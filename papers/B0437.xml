                <p>In accordance with your request, I have made enquiry in regard to the application
                    of Richard Monroe (colored) for possession of a boy named James Cozzens, who is,
                    as he claims, a brother of his wife. It seems that said Monroe's wife, Sydney,
                    was originally the property of a Miss Polly Michie, and at her death, was willed
                    to a Miss Parrott, the daughter of Chas' H. Parrott, <abbr expan="Esquire"
                    >Esqr</abbr>, near Mechums River. Whilst I can obtain no certain information to
                    that effect, it must be the fact that said Sydney's mother, the mother also of
                    the boy James, because, by purchase, subsequent to Miss Michie's death, the
                    property of Peyton, the present holder of the boy. As to the relationship
                    between Monroe's wife, and the boy, James, the family of Charles H. Parrott, are
                    pretty certain in the the statement that whilst their property, Sydney spoke of
                    having a brother, very young, named James.</p>

                <p>As to the capacity of Richard Monroe, I can say that it is the united testimony
                    of all his neighbors, that he is a first-class hand, and entirely able to make a
                    judicious and sufficient provision for his family. For instance, last year, he
                    made a sufficiency of grain, to feed his family, and pay his house rent for this
                    year, whilst this year he has done equally as well, if not better. His wife,
                    Sydney, is also considered a good <unclear>manager</unclear>. If Richard Monroe,
                    gets possession of the boy, she wishes to use him mainly as a <unclear>
                        <hi rend="underline">nurse</hi>
                    </unclear>, it would enable his wife to be of valuable assistance to him,
                    otherwise than she now is able to be</p>
