                    the conclusion that you have forgoten me or must
                        <u>perhaps changed again ha ha</u> if so Willie let me
                    know, you know I cant think you that ficle. Your brother C said he would carry this note or I reckon I
                    would still wait for to hear from you why have you not ritten or been down do come down Saturday &amp; &amp; bring
                    me some good news for I havent got any good news but
                    I have bad news somthing that gave me the blues for three or 4 days but I am
                    quite cheerful now was a little sick this eve was
                    gathering cherries &amp; almost fell off of the tree the jar maid me sick. I cannot tell you what gave me the blues but
                    I am all right if you are one smile from thee will drive that gloom away Willie
                    I have <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>not got anything yet for my <i>[illeg.]</i> will untill I hear from you or see you &amp; much rather
                    see you the girls think best for us to have waters &amp; then for you
                    &amp; I to take a trip to Rockingham Ronoak or
                    Buckingham I think myself it would be very wise but of corse if it does not suit you I will not insist Charles has put me in
                    the notion of visiting Buckingham but enough of this. Dear Willie I am very
                    anxious to see you I hope you will not loos what Mr C
                    owes you but if you do dont let it greave you we can make a liven of corse we will have to commence unable in life but we
                    must trust in God he will help us if (I) we be energetick &amp; have faith Willie dont
                    promis yourself any thing but me I have got nothing
                    but I mean to strive to have you value me more than you wou value any other earthly thing I know dear one you are not going to
                    marry me for wealth for I cannot promis myself
                    anything from any the things that are mine now but I dont think that will make any diference
                    with you but I must close we are all well &amp; I hope this will find you
                    well &amp; happy yes happy in Christ yes Oh dear one strive to be a good boy
                    &amp; let us be happy together there is hardly any hour of the day but what
                    I think of those recent promises may God in his mercy help you to keep them this
                    is my only prayer Oh is good let us trust in him &amp; pray to him for more
                    faith Willie do come down with C Saturday <i>[illeg.]</i>
