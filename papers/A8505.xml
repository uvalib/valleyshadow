                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>Yours of the 17<hi rend="super">th</hi> Inst. was duly received. I forward to you
                    by mail of the 24th Inst. Policies for Messrs B. &amp; J Crawford and A. M.
                    Simpson, which you will hand over to the respective parties.</p>

                <p>Mr Woodwards application will be taken thus. Furniture of Hotel to amount of
                    Furniture $1500 @ 1 1/2 percent}<lb/> Hotel 1000 @ 2 1/2 percent} for one
                    year<lb/> Shed 300 @ 2 1/2 percent}</p>

                <p>Risks on Hotels and Stables are never very desirable and when taken we wish to
                    have as small amount as possible. The amounts stated above may be less than Mr
                    Woodward thinks ought to be taken, but we would not desire to take a greater
                    amount, and for a term of one year only. This will be best for Mr Woodward as
                    well as for this Company. He might want to make some alterations, changes or
                    additions onto the buildings, all of which according to the terms of the policy,
                    must be by consent of the Company in such cases, the Company and himself might
                    not perhaps agree on making an alteration and thereby submit him to
                    inconveniences. When property is insured for one year the policy can be renewed
                    without any other charge than the <unclear>note</unclear> premiums at former
                    rates unless there be some material change in the property or contiguous
                    building render a higher premium <del hand="h1">ne</del> necessary, and the
                    Company having an agent on the spot no inconvenience will attend the renewal
                    once a year.</p>

                <p>Yours of the 19<hi rend="super">th</hi> also at hand, we are satisfied to take Mr
                    Imbodens application at 1 1/2 percent as you think that a fair rate. Please
                    state the amount you will put on the house, and how much on the <orig
                        reg="household">House-hold</orig> furniture, Bedding and wearing apparel,
                    making up the $2000. I am in receipt also of yours of the 20<hi rend="underline"
                        >th</hi> Policies will be sent for Messrs White &amp; Co and Mr White.
                    You will please let me know what amount Mr White wishes insured on his stable
                    building, how much on Horses, how much on Carriage and how much on Forage and
                    Grain. it is proper that the policy should express the amount insured on each
                    particular subject -- it might happen that the stable might burn when the Horses
                    and carriage were out, and some difficulty might arise in adjusting the loss, if
                    the insurance covers the specified amount on all the <pb n="2"/>subjects
                    collectively, but when each subject is put down a certain amounts and one lost
                    there is no difficulty in settling the loss for it speaks for itself.</p>

                <p>In all cases where insurance is wanted on a building and contents let the
                    building be put at a certain amount, and the contents also separate amount this
                    prevents difficulty in settling the loss when it is partial, for instance a
                    building insured might be damaged by fire without any injury to the contents,
                    all that would be to do in the case would be to find what amount of damage was
                    done to the building without reference to any other subject insured, and not
                    damaged -- this is to be observed in insuring two or more buildings a specified
                    amount on each respective building should be fixed these things however you will
                    very soon attain to by practice and they will readily suggest themselves to you
                    whenever you are called upon with an application for insurance. I am now very
                    much occupied in preparing for the annual settlement of our business the 1<hi
                        rend="super">st</hi> February, after that time I will first <orig
