<p class="p10">Oct 17<sup>th</sup> 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Centervill</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father</p>
<p class="p10">I will this evening endeavor to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well and hope
     when these few lines reach you they may find you enjoying the same blessing. I would have
     written by M<sup>r</sup> Beard but we were ordered off on picket so sudden that I
     could not do so We went on picket last thursday and got back on the next tuesday evening about
     sundown eat our suppers and was preparing for a good nights rest when orders came to strike our
     tents and prepare for a march no one knew where we got ready and started at three Oclock on
     wednesday morning and soon found ourselves in Centervill and
     pitching our tents I was then detailed on guard duty and was obliged to lose two nights sleep
     so that I think you must excuse my bad writing I would not have written now but there is some
     excitement in camp to night so that I thought I had better wright when I have a chance We do not expect to stay long at this camp<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Smiley33b.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley33b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      it is reported that the enemy are advancing and that they are as
     far as Fairfax C.H. but I do not think that it is correct they
     have advanced a little I know but not so far the object of our falling back is to get a good
     place to attack them we have a very commanding position here and I think we can give them <i>[deleted: Hail]</i> Hail Collumbia if they do not come too soon.
     There is some talk of our brigade going to Winchester or at any rate some of the most
     influential citizens of the vally have petitioned that we may be sent
     there as there is a body of the enemy under the command of General Banks prowling about Harpers
     Ferry Martinsburg and the upper potomac generaly. I saw Andy
     Whipple to day he happened to pass our company and I recognized him he
     said he knew me the moment he saw me he made a narrow escape being taken prisoner by the
     yankees he had six balls fired at him and only at the distance of 30 yards a lieutenant was
     taken prisoner at the same time they had left their picket posts and gone a short distance for
     chestnuts when they were surprised by the enemy and taken I received the things you all sent
     safe except the tomattoes which were a little mashed the comfort is
     the very thing we need here but it is a little unhandy carrying about I suppose I need not
     write any more as M<sup>r</sup> Beard can give you the particulars of how we live
     and get along</p>
<p class="p10">so nothing more at present but remain your affectionate son</p>
