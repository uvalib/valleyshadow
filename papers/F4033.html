<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Eli Slifer,
                    August 24, 1854
        <br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McClure asks Slifer about the chances of a Whig Senator being elected by Juniata,
                    and expresses his belief that Sellers must win, but if he cannot, he should drop
                    out of the race.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Col-</p>
<p class="p10">Is it possible for you to elect a Whig Senator? If any person in Juniata can
                    carry the district it is Sellers, for he can command influences in a contest not
                    within the reach of any other man. He fears the district and if it is hazardous,
                    he will decline. Please inform me particularly how things are and what the
                    prospect is. If there is a way of getting things in a safe condition tell me how
                    it is to be done for Sellers must not be run and defeated. He is blamed, and
                    very justly for acting with me in yur favor three years ago and <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>if
                    defeat is inevitable it must fall on those who merit it more. An early reply
                    will be gladly received.</p>
<p class="p10">Pollock will have from 800 to 1000 in Franklin just as certain as the election
                        <i>[unclear: counts]</i> Will that do for the "Green <i>[illeg.]</i>?"
                    Take care that we don't beat Union.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AK McClure</i></p>
<p class="p10">PS.- My kindest regards to "jack" and lady. Tell him I am
                        looking for a letter soon for the paper as he promised.</p>
