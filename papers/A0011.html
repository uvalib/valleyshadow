<p class="p10">Dear Mag</p>
<p class="p10">I have just read your letter and was very glad to here
                    from you again, yours found me well and quite happy;; I receive your favour of october the 12th And rote an answer to it a few evenings after;; But on revewing it I concluted not to send you
                    that answer But rite another; defering it from time to time the present evening has arived with out it being answered; Not because I did
                    not wish to answer it + from the fact that I did not have time; As another
                    reason was that I did not know what to <i>[unclear: write]</i> to you,, you
                    still wish to come here to live, I have not heard any thing about Miss Lamb
                    going to leave I rather think that a misstake,; As I
                    have not heard any thing about any the <i>[unclear: attendance]</i> leaving, I
                    for my part do not know how long I may stay; or how soon I may leave, I have no
                    notion of leaving here now, if I should take the notion to leave why I will
                        rite to you and let you know you wish to know what
                    kind of a Christmas I had; May I first tell you it was as dry a Christmas as
                    ever a seen in my life; I have seen no Christmas yet; nor newyear either This night a week a go I was
                    at a party in town; the party was given by the Firemen of Staunton; They were
                    not many there that I was acquainted with; I enjoyed myself tolerable well
                    considering all things; The immusement of the
                    evening was danceing; of which in corse i did not take part in it; there fore did not do anything but
                    look on and say nothing, you rite as though Mag Potmer
                    was going it Strong with <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    some one, success to her; I wish that I may soon hear
                    the same good news from you; Bob Strawsburg is gone to the West <u>Why</u> I am not supprise to
                        here that you wish to come here, But my Dear Friend
                    there is no use to cry over spilt milk the best way is to take it easy Tell Mag
                    that she must ask me to her wedding when ever she gets maried you speak of the singing in West View being very interresting, I was glad to here that, We have no
                    sing here now nor have they had any scince I have bin here</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mag the thoughts crosses my mind of the time we had att Bethelham They are past and gone; But the joyous moments spent there
                    will never loose their influance over me; They are
                    days when my mind wanders back in the past; And gains streanth there from; oh shall we who name the name of Christ ever
                    grow wery in well doing I pray you that we may not Dear
                    Mag I must close for the present hopeing that I may
                    hear soon from you; So good night Mag pleasant dreames
                    throng thy brain Till I shall here from you again</p>
