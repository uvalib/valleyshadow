<p class="p10">March 4th, 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Moffett's Creek, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Miss Midie,</p>
<p class="p10">Rejoicing at the reception of your very welcome epistle not long since, conclude
                    to respond without any procrastination, as I was delighted to hear from you a
                    schoolmate &amp; a friend.</p>
<p class="p10">Oh! it affords inexpressible joy to me, when I get such informative news, from
                    such a kind one, about persons and the vicinity, so much appreciated &amp;
                    admired by one whose memory still points to Christian's Creek and its noble
                    fascinating commodity, with whom I <u>have</u> long roamed.
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I have not much of interest to write only I have been on the sick
                    list for some few days &amp; desire your sympathy.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to Miss Mat and Sister. Sorry to hear that so many ladies are
                    going to get married in that neighborhood, &amp; in fact <i>[added: in]</i> all vicinities there is nothing but marrying going
                    on: pity the poor wretches that are left single.</p>
<p class="p10">Have you any singings in your respective places, like you formerly have had, this
                    winter? I have been in some charming meetings of the kind. I have had a splendid
                    time attending singings this winter in New Port &amp; other places.</p>
<p class="p10">Ther is nothing like having big times on Pisgah's big hills. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>You asked
                    me to come down on valentine night to have a drawing. I suppose you had a
                    splendid time of drawing. We dad a drawing here, (at Mrs
                    Hull's) some few strangers came in, &amp; we passed off the time very
                    merrily. But I neither sent nor received any valentines.</p>
<p class="p10">Why are you not going to School this winter? or have you got your diploma. Just
                    come up &amp; see me &amp; my family; I tell you I am just training the
                    young ideas how to shoot.</p>
<p class="p10">The Turkeyhoe's must be prancing about like wild Turkeys. They have no business
                    coming over here &amp; taking all the <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>South River gals away. Glad
                    to hear that Miss Rachel is rising in the world &amp; in the estimation of
                    the young <i>[deleted: gals]</i> gents. Does Lucian still go to see you yet.</p>
<p class="p10">Did Mr. Munroe get any Valentines this year to give about?</p>
<p class="p10">I get very few letters. I wish the girls would all send me a box full. You must
                    excuse this short letter of not much note. I wrote in a hurry; so I conclude
                    with many wishes for your health &amp; happiness. Good evening.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Friend</p>
