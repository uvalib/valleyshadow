<p class="p10">July 20/59</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dr Sir</p>
<p class="p10">You are no doubt aware that Franklin County is the present home of one of the <u>great</u> and <u>good</u> men of the
                        Nation--Col.
                    A. K. McClure by name. I have every reason to
                    believe that you <u>know</u> this <u>extra
                        honest</u> individual, who stands a "head and shoulders" taller than his
                    fellows, equally as well as I do, and that you <u>like</u>
                    him no better.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not suppose however that you have been deceived as to his real popularity.
                    You hardly believe the story about offices being <u>forced</u> upon him. That's <u>his</u> way of talking. We
                        <u>know</u> the <u>facts</u> better.</p>
<p class="p10">That he has been in the Legislature two Sessions you know. <u>What</u> he did--<u>how</u> he did it--and <u>for what</u> he did it, you know better than I. He now
                    aspires to a seat in the State Senate. He <u>wanted</u> to go
                    to Congress, but McPherson licked him. He says he <u>does
                    not</u> seek the Senatorial nomination- that he has not made up his mind to
                    take it even if offered &amp;c, &amp;c. This is all <u>bosh</u>, we know he does want it, and that he has been
                        <i>[unclear: endeavoring]</i> to create the impression that <u>he</u> is the<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>only man who can carry the
                    district. To believe what his friends say would be to believe that he posesses
                    all the <u>honesty</u>--all the <u>capacity</u>--all the <u>statesmanship</u>, and all the <u>availability</u> of the District.</p>
<p class="p10">For the real opinion entertained of him by many, even of his own party here, I
                    would refer you to the "Valley Spirit" of this week. It will
                    <i>[unclear: repay]</i> perusal.</p>
<p class="p10">Now I wish to see him beaten for the nomination, I care not who by, and my object
                    in addressing you is to see if you could not aid in accomplishing this result,
                    and thus pay the <u>second installment</u> upon the
                    obligations of 1855. You have many friends in Fulton &amp; Adams Counties.
                    Neither county likes him very much. He has twice sacrificed his colleagues from
                    the former County for the Legislature--and the Americans of Adams do not love a
                    bone in his body. Could you not therefore array your friends against him. I know
                    he has been trying hard to get things smoothed away for his success with the
                    Connections of both counties by getting candidates to decline, by creating the
                    impression that <u>he</u> alone can carry the District
                    &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p10">I am not a candidate for the office. I did think of being a candidate last fall
                    at the solicitation of friends in this and Adams County.<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>The <u>latter</u> county, I was assured by the best men in it, I
                    could have gotten. In Fulton I know I could have done well--whilst here, at
                    home, my chances would have been as good as any other. But I knew the district
                    to be close, and I did not seek the office. McClure then said that he would not
                    under <u>any circumstances</u> be a candidate. Thus you see I
                    would have had the field almost to myself. But I did not want to be away from
                    home and my family. I had been long enough from my profession, and I preferred,
                    and am now a Candidate for <u>District Attorney</u> of this
                    County. What the result may be in this Contest I know not. I know McClure is not
                    my friend, and I am not his.</p>
<p class="p10">I have written thus freely and openly, because I feel that what I say will be
                    kept Confidential, and so shall I keep any reply that you may make.</p>
<p class="p10">Let me hear from you as soon as your convinience or inclination may allow</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>I,H,McCauley</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Hon Simon
                        Cameron
                    </p>
