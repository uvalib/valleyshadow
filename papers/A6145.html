      bin good since a prisoner but am deprived of many comforts that we
      wonce
     injoyed but i trust this crewel war will
     soon come to a close so we could injoy
     our selves as the past. The health of the camp is good at preasent. the Officers in charge hear
     spairs no pains in promting [promoting]
     the health and comfort of the prisoners. Our rations are of a good quality. Some complain that
     they they dont get enough but i think it is a
     nuff. Anderson Stombaugh, Knott, Jacob Michael Wright, E Samuels and A Hansberger are
     all well. Send brother David Rolston poast office address if you can. I
