<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, March 9, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife, alarmed by reports that necessity has compelled her
                    to do her own work. He urges her to hire help, and revives the idea of moving
                    the family to Staunton. He instructs her on making arrangements and mentions
                    items he needs. He also reports on the management of the hotel and discusses his
                    pending resignation from service.</p>

                    which pains me much. he states that you have no one to do your work, &amp;
                    that morning you were compelled to go out in the snow &amp; milk your cow
                    That some scoundrel had turned your cow entirely out from shelter This is too
                    hard for me to bear</p>
<p class="p10">Do try &amp; get some one to do your work. never mind the cost I think I will
                    be able to make smart money now &amp; if loose all these we will still have
                    plenty here. do make yourself comfortable if possible And if you can<sup>t</sup> get along comfortable put some
                    one in the house &amp; come on out to me bring the family &amp; such

                    Peggy or Uncle Jim- to move in the house with you, and a few days after you
                    start &amp; come out, &amp; we can still send for some of the things
                    &amp; get them out<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> You must not allow yourself to be imposed upon
                    or suffer exposure there, for the sake of our little property. let it go
                    &amp; you take care of your self &amp; family. I have not yet heard from
                    my resignation but expect to daily, &amp; so soon as it is accepted I will
                    write you and we will try &amp; make some <i>[added: arrangements]</i> for our future course I assure you I am soarly tired of this life</p>
<p class="p10">I want some <i>[added: bleached]</i> Muslin for sheets
                    &amp; pillar slips &amp; some calico for
                    servants dresses and some <i>[unclear: boned]</i> or plad cotton for bed spreads is there any chance by which any or all of
                    these things can be gotten I could get some funds here such as will pass there</p>
<p class="p10">Louise is furious at the idea of your doing your own work &amp; says the
                    first chance she get she will come home &amp; fight the yanks through we are
                    doing a good business here and making some money I received cousin B- letters
                    &amp; delivered them. John is well PS is walking about on crutches I have
                    sent several letters to you recently by ladies going through lines hope you will
                    get them all. I say more to persons to tell you than I write but I fear you <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                    dont get one half I send. I dont like to write somethings &amp;
                    tell them verbally but suppose they dont even see you.
                    So soon as my papers are heard from I will make some better arrangement for us</p>
<p class="p10">The people here are buisy funding their money under the
                    new law My fund<sup>s</sup> are all right in property, Bond<sup>

                        <u>s</u>

                    direct the eating sleeping and all other arrangements all persons say we keep
                    the best house in C. S. We have a number of our friends passing here daily have
                    house crowded every night rather slack during the day</p>
<p class="p10">Things here high &amp; scarce but we get plenty to do us</p>
<p class="p10">Cousin Mary Might make some arrangements to take our house &amp; to keep
                    others out or aunt Peggy either by moving in it some<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> days previous to
                    your moving out</p>
<p class="p10">M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>

                    &amp; Henry run it on shares for us I write to Henry &amp; Harry on
                    subject M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>

                    house at mill which Henry is in you could move there &amp; he would board
                    with you there &amp; you put some one else in your present house. But first
                    of all I want to hear from my resignation &amp; if get out of service I want
                    you here <i>[unclear: or]</i> me to be there &amp; if cant do this the next best to do I think is to make arrangements to
                    have some reliable person to live with &amp; take care of you &amp; the
                    interests He will tell you fully what I say on the subject &amp; if

                    you know your situation best &amp; can best Judge what to do. for some
                    reasons it might be best in town for others best out at mill Consider well
                    &amp; let me hear from you before moving</p>

                    you</p>
