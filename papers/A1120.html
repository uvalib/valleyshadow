<p class="p10">My dear sister</p>
<p class="p10"> As I didnt have time to write last Friday I will try
                    &amp; do so this morning. I had the headache pretty bad this morning
                    &amp; was beginning to think I'd have to go to bed, but when I was in class,
                    Nelie P. handed me a bottle &amp; told me to smell it. I did so &amp; it
                    pretty near knocked me down but it nearly cured me of my headache. I have
                    headache about half the time now. Carrie has headache this morning. The
                    Episcopal Convention met here last week. Kip Baldwin took the gals Friday
                    &amp; Saturday night, some few went Sat.
                    morning at 8 O'clock. They <i>[unclear: took]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> yesterday morning. we all went I reckon. The people would be
                    surprised when they saw 40 school-girls on the street before 6 o'clock. <i>[deleted: in]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: It]</i> as you know from experience how hard it is to get them
                    out of bed, Howe Peyton wasn't confirmed (according to expectation). We had
                    Episcopal service in our church yesterday morning &amp; evening. They got
                    along very well in the morning as there was a good many Episcopal ministers
                    scattered about over the church but last night there wasn't any one to respond at all. We had <i>[deleted: a]</i> very good
                    sermons <i>[deleted: -]</i> the preachers were just carried away with the
                    singing..thought they had never heard any voices like Miss
                    <i>[unclear: Arrow]</i>'s &amp; Miss Minnie Tupping's. Communion here next
                    Sunday week. Josie English is living in town now. she is just about the
                    prettiest young lady I have seen for a time. Our examination on
                    <i>[unclear: Butler]</i> came off last Sat week
                    We had a holiday on Friday &amp; all went to the decoration of the<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> soldier graves. that night went to "Cantata of Queen Esther' at the blind
                    Institution. 'Twas the grandest thing Ive seen for a
                    time. I am happy to be able to tell you that Butler class all got through
                    safely. we had to have an oral examination on Haven again. <u>Thanks</u>

                    </sup> Hoge, who is to deliver an address. The girls were saying at breakfast
                    this morning, wouldn't it be nice if Miss B would take the girls to Weyirs Cave, the next day after school is out. Laura H.
                    says aint you coming down to see her, before she goes
                    away, never <u>to</u>

                    <u>back</u>

                    this week. <i>[unclear: Head]</i> intended sending this with Mr.
                    <i>[unclear: Turk]</i> on Mon but I didn't see him.

                    Wednesday. &amp; I reckon will keep on if I dont
                    have my teeth fixed. Please ask Pa if I cant have them
                    fixed, unless it will cost too much. You needn't tell any
                    one my face is sore again, as people will ask you more questions than a
                    few. Mary ain't you coming down to see me before the session closes. I was
                    asking Mary Turk when you were coming, but she said, that you said, I never said
                    anything about your coming &amp; from that you reckoned I didn't want you,
                    Well now you know that isn't so, &amp; that I would be glad to see you any
                    time you would come Are you all done "planting corn, Lucy went down ordered a
                    bonnet. I am anxious to see it. the price she is to give $7. What did you think
