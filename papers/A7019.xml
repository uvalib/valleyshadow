                <p>It is with no small degree of pleasure that I attempt to address you for a few
                    lines, (without even having asked your permission) I fully intended to have
                    asked you to correspond with me, before you left Augusta, but still neglected
                    it, more from the fact that I feared you would not agree to do it than anything
                        <orig reg="else">els</orig>. I hope you will not be offended at this and if
                    so that you will pardon me. I have not much news to <unclear>report</unclear>
                    but will try and do the <unclear>best</unclear> I can. I had the misfortune to
                    have my leg cut yesterday <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> am not able to do much, but I think
                    it will be well in a few days as it is not a very dangerous wound.</p>

                <p><pb n="2"/>I saw your Georgie at Shemariah last Sunday he is quite <orig
                        reg="hearty">harty</orig> but looks rather lowspirited since you left
                    Augusta. He went home with Mary Jane from church so you had better watch or you
                    will be cut out I suppose you hear from him often so I need not write about him.
                    I wish you had been down here to have <orig reg="gone">gon</orig> to the
                    Spring's this summer. I know you would have enjoyed yourself very much. The
                    Suthern Guards (that is the company I belong to) were over there <unclear>on a
                    2</unclear> we went over on Wednesday and came home Saturday <orig reg="evening"
                        >evning</orig>. There were a good many of the Summerdean girls over on
                    Friday. I enjoyed myself <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> much <orig reg="especially"
                    >espeshily</orig> on Friday. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> wish you had been along you would
                    have been pleased and I know Billy Clemmer would have enjoyed himself a great
                    deal better than he did.</p>

                <p><pb n="3"/>Friday night. This is something I rarely do leave a letter unfinished
                    but it happened that I had no time to finish yesterday I will try and get
                    through this time. I saw a letter of your a few weeks ago from your old admirer
                        <unclear>Maddson</unclear>
                    <unclear>Kerr</unclear> I would like to have heard the <orig reg="contents"
                        >contence</orig> of that long <unclear>locked</unclear> for letter as I
                    suppose I gues it was very charming and interesting to you. I hope that if I
                    ever have the pleasing task of reading an answer to this letter that you will
                    give me the particulars. You had better come back to Augusta and go to school to
                    Cousin Ann. I believe her school about made up I do not know exactly when she
                    will commence but I expect <unclear>it</unclear> will be sometime next week.</p>

                <p>I believe all your schoolmates are well with the exception of <pb n="4"/>Willy
                    McChesney I understood this <orig reg="evening">evning</orig> that he was quite
                    poorly did not expect he would live but I do hope he is not so bad as that, he
                    has <orig reg="sore">soar</orig> throat.</p>

                <p><orig reg="There">Their</orig> in Sacrament at Shemeriah this week Mr Emerson has
                        <abbr expan="Reverend">Rev</abbr> John <unclear>Baker</unclear> to assit him
                    he preached to day. I believe I have written about all the news I can think of.
                    The folks are all pretty well in the <orig reg="neighborhood">naborhood</orig> I
                    believe.</p>

                <p>Excuse bad writing spelling etc. If this <orig reg="scroll">scrole</orig> is
                    worthy of an answer I would be happy to receive it But if it is not worth an
                    answer or if you do not want to write to me you can either return this letter or
                    burn it. Silence gives <orig reg="consent">concent</orig>. Good by.</p>
