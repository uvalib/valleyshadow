                    wrote to you before, the rebels, atacked our lines
                    the day that I wrote home, the fight lasted from morning till dark at night, the
                    fields lay full of wounded and dead rebels, over double the number of ours, and
                    we captured 54 peices of, artillery, our Brigade
                    captured 20 pieces of the 54, bully for our iron Brigade, also captured between
                    seven and eight thousand prisoners;<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and five hundred wagons and
                    ambulances, such a sight never before has been seen as this was, our Brigade
                    charged through a little village over the rebbs  and
                    captured the 20 peices of cannon, the road was coverd with dead bodys where
                    they charged, the rebels never was
                    whipt so bad before, this is the third time that we
                        whipt them very badly since the 1<sup>st</sup> of last month,</p>
<p class="p10">General Sheridan was at the head of his brave soldiers in the engagement, there
