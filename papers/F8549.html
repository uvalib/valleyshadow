                    son, E.'s potential visit to Baltimore, doubts of whether the Pages will go to

<p class="p10">Sep. 5<sup>th</sup>, 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Frederick</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Edwd--</p>
<p class="p10">I am under the impression that you are in my debt- yet, as it is a rainy day, I
                    concluded to amuse myself, by telling you, that you might not forget it, for it
                    strikes me, you are not as good a correspondent as you were some time ago; you
                    must have some more agreeable occupation for mind &amp; body, to be found
                    ever in Gettysburg. Is it so? I received &amp; thank you for your Lecture
                    which I read with much pleasure. Mr T- has not had time to do so, as he has been
                    busily engaged, preparing an Article for the "Princeton Review--" on Sir Wm. Hamilton-- Last week, we had a very short,
                    pleasant visit from Mr. Mchaffey &amp; Eliz<sup>
                            <u>th</u>
                        </sup> after their <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> return from Hagerstown. Mr. M. never
                    remained over night here before &amp; he thinks
                        
                        <u>Fred<sup>k</sup></u>
                     greatly before that place. We only regretted they could not remain
                    longer. E- received your letter, here. By this time I suppose they are in Phil<sup>a</sup>, as they left here
                    on Thursday last for Washington, intending to spend Friday there &amp; on
                    Saturday proceed to Phil<sup>a</sup>. to meet <i>[unclear: Phersey]</i>, who went there the week
                    before. They both look remarkably well &amp; were in fine spirits. I hope
                    you feel much better &amp; stronger after your visits to the different
                    watering places &amp; will be well prepared for the labours, &amp; pleasures of the coming winter, not <u>vain amusements</u>, for I have ceased to class them under
                    the head of real pleasure for rational beings.</p>
<p class="p10">Poor Cousin Susan has been again most severely afflicted in the death of her
                    youngest son, a very lovely &amp; promising youth, who died last week after
                    a few days illness. But they have much to comfort them in the belief that he had
                    the Christian's hope to sustain <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> him in a dying hour. About a year
                    ago he made a profession of religion, the <i>[deleted: third]</i> fourth of
                    the sons at home, who have done so, since their father's death. We have been
                    looking for you, in vain, ever since last Spring, &amp; now I would not be
                    surprised if you make your appearance during my absence. I hope to go to
                    Thorndale the last of this, or beginning of next week -- if by Emmittsburg,
                    probably about Tuesday next - I expect to remain there until the marriage of Mr
                    Birnie's daughter early in Oct. immediately after
                    which, I hope to return home by Baltimore to see Cousin &amp; her family. I
                    could procure a driver &amp; carriage if a good &amp; safe horse could
                    be had, but I am afraid to trust the livery stable horses, especially with a
                    youth not greatly experienced in driving. The only alternative then is to go by
                    Emmittsburg which would be very pleasant, if I had company, but I suppose that
                    will have to be adopted or give it up altogether. Mr. Page &amp; Nannie
                    expect to start for Louisiana next Monday week, though none would be surprised,
                    should they <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>draw back, at the last. He is so inefficient. He is
                    expected to start the school &amp; build it up. We fear for the result,
                    unless he bestirs himself. The Col's family have
                    been in the country nearly all the summer, so that, I have not seen any of them.
                    From Lizzie's account I would scarcely know Gettysburg, the changes in every
                    way, are so great. The state of things in the Church would be my greatest grief-
                    How truly sad it is! I may be mistaken, but I cannot think Mr Van Wycke's
                    friends, who absent themselves from the church, do right - it will only widen
                    the breach &amp; most probably end in a division which would be deplorable -
                        tho' I do not know, but what, that would be
                    better, than a constant warfare. However my comfort is, "the Lord reigns". Let
                    us hear from you very soon-- Love to all friends. Mr T &amp; your Cousin C-
                    join me in much love to you.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever affect</p>
