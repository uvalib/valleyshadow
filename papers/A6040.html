<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I take the present opportunity of writing you a few lines as we have not written to you for
     nearly two weeks. We are all well at present and hope when these few lines reach you they may
     find you well. M<sup>r</sup> Lucas got home last night. I reckon Mr Lucas was beggining to get a little uneasy he stayed longer that he expected and
     did not hear anything about what was keeping him. There hasn't any of us seen him yet but he
     sent your letter to Aunt Ellen down along with several others. we took the liberty of opening
     and reading it. We heard yesterday that you had left your camp near Gordonsville and were
     marching towards Mannassa. I pity you if you have to march this hot
     weather I think it would nearly kill you This is the hottest weather we have had this summer it
     makes a person nearly melt; M<sup>r</sup> Robert M<sup>c</sup> bride died
     on Saturday of Typhoid fever. and was buried yesterday. M<sup>r</sup> Junkin
     preached up at the Lutheran church yesterday evening which made the third sermon for him that
     day<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Smiley12b.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley12b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      M<sup>r</sup> John L Beard was here one day last week
     he appeared to be very uneasy about Billie. we told him the University Hospital ahad burn up. he wanted to know when we would be writing to you so as to request you
     to give any information concerning him that is if you knew any
     thing about him. But he got a letter Saturday from him and is sending him an answer
      to-day directed to Loringston Nelson Co I think he is anxious to keep
     up with D<sup>r</sup> White. He was talking about them having Billies name down as a
     deserter. He says D<sup>r</sup> White &amp; D<sup>r</sup> Smith drew
     up that detail and General Jackson signed it so it is all right he thinks. Pa has got all his
     grass cut he cut that and attended the mill. He has right smart grinding to do come <i>[deleted: ]</i> taking grain in that have not had their grinding done here for a long time.,
     William Wright expects to go down to see about getting a substitute for Henry. He has just come
     here now I dont know how it <i>[illeg.]</i> he got here before the stage. But I will have to
     scratch this up in a hurry to give it to him</p>
<p class="p10">Excuse all mistakes bad writing and spelling and believe me as ever your sister</p>
