<h4>Augusta: John Janney to Alexander H. H. Stuart,

</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Janney writes to Stuart about state and national politics, including debt
                    settlements between Virginia and West Virginia and the upcoming Gubernatorial
                    election.</p>

                        </p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I received yours of the 10<sup>th</sup> inst about 10 days after the
                    date &amp; I have taken 10 more to see if I could make up my mind
                    definitively on the subject of <i>[unclear: reorganizing]</i> my office. I have
                    concluded the next year in Richmond on the 1<sup>st</sup> of February
                    &amp; that day will meet you &amp; Mr <i>[unclear: Martin]</i> provided
                    the Legislature should meet before that time take the matter into their own
                    hands and settle it by agreeing to pay 2/3 of the debt and repudiating the
                    balance leaving the <i>[unclear: endebtors]</i> of the state to look to West
                    Virginia to pay the minimum. I think you have acted unwisely in <u>deciding</u> to take your seat in Congress at the present
                    session. Have the people any <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> upon the subject of the Gubernatorial <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>or is it time
                    to move? What are your own views on the subject? It is rumoured here that Ex
                        Gov Smith will be in the field.</p>
<p class="p10">Where should I find you in Richmond if I go--At Ballard, or the Exchange?</p>
<p class="p10">Please let me hear from you. I am so nearly blind that I cannot see here to write
                    and have much difficulty in seeing what I have written.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Truly Yours,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Janney</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Honble A H H
                        Stuart
