<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: George T. Cook to R. S.
                    Lacey, December 31, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In his monthly report, Cook notes that while violence against freedmen is
                    infrequent, low wages keep them in a state of poverty. One Freedman is
                    aggravated by the lack of room in poor houses.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dec 31<sup>st</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Captain:</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit the following Report of <u>Bureau
                        Affairs</u> in this Sub-Dist for the Month
                    ending Dec. 31<sup>st</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">But few complaints of Violence on the part of whites, have been made by Freedmen,
                    and those made are of a trivial nature. Complaints in regard to pay have been
                    quite frequent and I have assisted them all in my power by making out their
                    accounts and instructing them how to proceed. I have talked with several
                    Magistrates about such accounts and tried to convince them that the interests of
                    the County require them to see that accounts for services should be settled,
                    else the County will have the Freedpeople to care for as paupers.</p>
<p class="p10">It will, I fear, be difficult to make the Poor Commissioners attend to the
                    destitute Freedpeople there are many cases of whites, and it is hard for them
                    not to make a marked distinction in favor of the whites. I have a present
                    several cases of destitute Freedpeople in view of which <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I shall make
                    seperate, detailed Reports, if the Poor Com<sup>rs</sup> do not take them in charge.</p>
<p class="p10">The whites seem to think, so far as personal Violence is concerned that it is
                    better to let the Colored people alone but they are nevertheless retaining a
                    firm control of them through the system of low wages. The average according to
                    the Census returns so far as completed, will not exceed $9 per month for able bodied males, and between three and four
                    dollars, for females. This average is only among those who receive any wages.
                    Many do not get more than board and clothing.</p>
<p class="p10">Instances in which aged Freedpeople have been turned off by their former owner,
                    utterly destitute are quite numerous.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully<br>Your Ob<sup>t</sup> Servant</p>
