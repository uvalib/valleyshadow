<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Dews testifies to Tukey's character and comments on what he consideres to be the

<p class="p10">
                            Feb 8th 1867
                        </p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Augusta Co, Va</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Having heard that complaints have been against Mr F S Tukey, Asst Supt Freedman's Bureau at this
                    place, I hereby certify that I was appointed by Mr Tukey (immediately after the
                    order of Gen Howard organizing the Freedmans Court)
                    to represent the Freedmen in said Court; as soon after <i>[unclear: need]</i>
                    the appointment of Clerk in his office which places I held several months, and
                    during that time I considered he administered the affairs of the Bureau with
                    fairness and impartiality and I never knew or heard of his collecting any costs
                    from either Whites or Blacks, or that he was guilty of any unfair dealings
                    towards either party, and I am satisfied from what I <i>[unclear: conceive]</i>
                    to be reliable information, that Mr Geo. Graham of the U S Burial Corps has been
                    making himself very active in this matter, and as he has been making himself
                    very <i>[deleted: prom]</i> officious among the Freedmen in regard to these
                    complaints the inference I draw is that the whole thing is done in malice and
                    for the purpose of injuring Mr Tukey.</p>
<p class="p10">It may be proper for me to add that I have always been a Union man and have no
                    sympathy with Rebels whatever and have been much persecuted by them during and
                    since the war.</p>
