    </opener>

    <p>I have <abbr expan="received">rcd.</abbr> your three letters, a thousand thanks for them, the
     two first especially were fresh, sweet &amp; good &amp; I know you were wearied
     &amp; blue when you wrote the last &amp; I feel sorry that you have not all gotten well
     &amp; that you are <unclear>recruiting</unclear> slowly &amp; have to keep at home so
     closely. I had chances to send you word by Col Tusk, Bumgardner &amp;c. &amp; so have
     not written, why I will <orig reg="tell">till</orig> you. We had a very pleasant time after we
     left Monterey -- saving the black gnats on Cheat Mt. &amp; at Greenbrier River. I slept on
     the floor, simply wrapped in my cloak, at Greenbrier river, Yeager's, (the home of the fellow
     that came to came to go to school,) slept well, saving the gnat bites, as bad as fleas, The
     firs and yew pines on Cheat looked splendidly. I found it a good deal of labor to take proper
     care of my horses the next night, Saturday, we slept on the wagons 1 1/2 miles from Beverly --
     had a good sleep, wrapped in my cloak on the top of the boxes, was only awakened once by
     Crawford, who was sleeping on the ground, crying out, in his sleep, dreaming, that a snake was
     around his neck. We were up Sunday morning by 4 A.M. &amp; by 5 were on the way to Beverly,
     in the rain, by the way, at Huttonsville, we found the 1st troops, Mountaineers, about as dirty
     as the ground &amp; eating black victuals out of black dishes, tin, out in the hot sun --
     it gave a disgust for camp life. We rode across the Mt., Rich Mt., 9 miles to Capt. Sterret's
     camp, in the rain, Sunday, passing through Camp Garnett at 9 miles, Capt. <abbr expan="Sterret"
      >S.</abbr> being 2 miles from here, by himself. Mr. Arnold had got there &amp; announced
     our coming. We found the "boys" encamped in the yard &amp; occupying the houses of a Mr.
     Crane who is in the Wheeling Tory Convention, the yard has a good sod &amp; fine shade
     trees &amp; is a nice place. They fare well there, have good bread, &amp; good sleeping
     places, but their duties are severe &amp; they are always on the alert being an advanced
     post &amp; liable to be attacked at any time, though they cannot be <pb n="2"/> be
     surprised or cut off, for they have guards out 9 miles. It was noon Sunday when we got there
     &amp; we were very tired &amp; very dirty, got cleaned up &amp; was resting some
     towards evening when, just after dark, news came that we were to be attacked in an hour -- the
     wagons were hustled round, harness strung out, of course, &amp; things tumbled in in a
     hurry, I waded around in the mud &amp; rain, got my horses harnessed &amp; was ready to
     start, but no enemy came &amp; we slept on our arms, going to rest at mid-night. Was up
     Monday morning at reveille, 4 o'clock, &amp; fixed up the wagons &amp;c, got a letter
     from Capt. <abbr expan="Sterret">S.</abbr> to Col. Heck, commanding &amp; started on
     horseback with <abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr> Hanger &amp; came up here, the Col. said he
     wanted me very much &amp; would write to Gen Garnett at Laurel Hill to employ me for this
      <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> so we started on there, 24 miles from here, so we started
     on at noon, stopped at Beverly &amp; found your sweet good letter, the second one, it made
     me feel happy &amp; joyous, I sent it back to Sterrett, my love letter, that he might get
     the news as I had no time to write -- he told me afterwards that it was the best love letter he
     had seen for a long time, first rate (tell that to Allie.) We then went on to Gen Garnett's
     Camp, across Laurel Hill, though a mountain, we got there just at dark found the camp at the
     foot of the Mt with long lines of trenches dug around the sides of the Mt. for men to fire
     from, for more than a mile -- and hundreds of acres of trees cut down by the soldiers to enable
     them to have a fair field for a fight. We saw Gen. <abbr expan="Garnett">G.</abbr> -- spent the
     night at Capt. Jordan's the Quarter Master, with Parkins of Augusta, the Engineer in Chief said
     he did not need any assistance, so we came on back &amp; I found your 1<hi rend="underline"
      >st</hi> letter at Beverly, I got back Tuesday noon &amp; <unclear>fixed</unclear> the
     teams off as soon as possible &amp; started from <orig reg="Sterrett's">Sterretts</orig>
     camp at 4 P.M. &amp; drove to Beverly by dark, had a time generally at the one horse town,
     had a box to nail up, tore a board off the fence, cut it off with my knife, nailed it on with a
     shovel, with nails pulled out of a gun box got the wagoners encamped &amp; started back to
     camp Garnett at 9 A.M. <pb n="3"/> Just after starting I met a man who said they were making an
     attack on the camp &amp; he was running away -- I went on though with my gun on my shoulder
     &amp; came on to the top of the Mt. all quiet &amp; I turned in there to the tent of
     the guard there, &amp; slept with Donaghs -- Temperature 40 degrees &amp; nearly froze
     my legs -- got up at 4 &amp; walked 2 miles down to camp to get warm, got there &amp;
     the Col. said I must stay &amp; he would put me to work for him if no other way -- so I
     went to surveying the camp &amp; making a map of it -- am to make my own charge -- I shall
     finally get a good situation, but it will pay no better than this &amp; I am now one of the
     commander's Suite &amp; sleep &amp; eat at head quarters. Hoover is adjutant &amp;
     we are going to have a tent of our own -- near the commander's. I have been at work at the
     survey all the time -- as the map is wanted soon -- so I have not written <pb n="4"/> I hope
     you all are getting along well &amp; are made comfortable -- I was joking Mrs. Gooch about
     getting well &amp; taking a trip out here -- I saw her a minute only -- All the boys
     enquired after you. I shall send you some money by the first person that goes &amp; that
     will be only a few days -- Write to me what you want to do -- I do not want you to work <hi
      rend="underline">any</hi> so I will not say anything about putting up fruit. I suppose Augusta
     has been drafted by this time -- I must go &amp; level a parade ground now, and have it
     leaded. The Col., Heck is a good fellow. I have written to the Whig about the paper it comes in
     my name &amp; you see if Quidor keeps it because the postage is not paid. &amp; pay
     him. Take care of it &amp; all the papers for me. I told Stover &amp; Glossbrenner to
     pay you -- But I have money &amp; will send it the 1<hi rend="super">st</hi> safe chance.
      <abbr expan="Nelson">N.</abbr> has money now &amp; will get meat &amp;c &amp; I
     hope you will do better. I am glad you keep up so well -- try to keep in good spirits &amp;
     write often &amp; I will as often as I can. Bless the children how I want to see them --
     they must be kind, good &amp; think often of Pa -- &amp; mind Ma well -- My love to all
     -- I hope Allie is better -- Capt <abbr expan="Sterrett">S</abbr> seems much exercised about
     her -- My love to all. God bless you &amp; keep you -- Good bye-- </p>
