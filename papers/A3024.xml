                    <p>I received your letter dated May the 23<hi rend="super">rd</hi> on last <orig
                              reg="Sabbath">Sabath</orig> &amp; was glad to know that you had
                         not entirely forgotten your absent friend. I wrote you a long letter <orig

                         <orig reg="Heights">Hights</orig>" one <orig reg="Sabbath">Sabath</orig>
                         &amp; sent the same by Dr. McChesney, which should have reached you by
                         the time <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> McKanny arrived at home,
                         but I suppose you never received it. As you only spoke of receiving a note.
                         I have nothing of interest to write you now. Things are going on about as
                         they were when I last wrote you. I have seen some nice ladies this week. In
                         the evening when we go on Dress parade they begin to come in from the
                         country &amp; assemble on the <hi rend="underline">parade</hi>
                         <hi rend="underline">ground</hi>
                         <orig reg="until">untill</orig> it's a very difficult matter to get though
                         the crowdin consequence of their "<hi rend="underline">extension
                         shirts</hi>". Yesterday I had the exquisite pleasure of becoming acquainted
                         with a beautiful little girl, but she was <unclear>summoned</unclear> so
                         with <hi rend="underline">soldiers</hi> that I had no chance<pb n="2"/> of
                         cultivating it to any extent.</p>
                    <p>I have had so little to say to the ladies since I left that I hardly know
                         what way to conduct myself in their presence not being a lady's man.
                         &amp; this you know.</p>
                    <p> I got a letter from your dear Cousin Anne B - which I estimate very highly
                         indeed from the fact, that she is the <hi rend="underline">only</hi> lady
                              (<hi rend="underline">except</hi>
                         <hi rend="underline">your</hi>
                         <hi rend="underline">self</hi>) who has thought enough of one to write. I
                         also received a nice rosette from her that I will endeavor to keep as long
                         I possibly can as a token of her respect for me.</p>
                    <p>You wished to know the state of my health in your last? well I am in good
                         health. never engaged better in my life. I think that the <hi
                              rend="underline">camp life</hi> will agree with me firstrate if I can
                         only get plenty of <unclear>
                              <hi rend="underline">provender.</hi>
                         </unclear></p>
                    <p>You need have no fear of my coming to the conclusion you spoke of in your
                         last from the fact that I am no longer held (by you) with the<pb n="3"/>
                         same esteem that I have reason to believe I once was. This is my humble
                         opinion, which I drew from the winding up of your last. I had no idea of
                         ever hearing that thrown up to me again. I think you ought to let "by
                         gones" be "by gones". And not harbor the idea any longer. I am very much
                         obligated to you, for <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> you have done
                         in endeavoring to make my stay here comfortable &amp; agreeable. And I
                         sincerely hope that your pathway through this life may be strewn with
                         flowers, &amp; that you may have a peaceful entrance at last into
                         heaven above.</p>
                    <p>I must bring this uninteresting note to a close. hoping to hear from you
                         soon.</p>
