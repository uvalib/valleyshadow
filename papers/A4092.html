<p class="p10">Aug 15<sup>
        <u>th</u>
      </sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Fisher's Hill</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to you the day we left Winchester &amp; enclosed some Ribbons for the children
     &amp; one or two other things -- I have not heard from you for some days but knowing that
     you will hear all kinds of stories &amp; will be anxious to hear the truth I will write
     again, though briefly -- We came back here on Saturday the enemy advancing in force to the
     vicinity of Strasburg but halting to deliberate as soon as they found we had reached a place
     where we intended to fight them &amp; since then they have been lying on the banks of Cedar
     Creek, 3 miles beyond Strasburg &amp; we on the banks of Tumbling Run 2 miles this side of
      S.-g with an occasional forward movement of Cavalry &amp;
     skirmishers first on one side &amp; then on the other, with no results -- We have been
     having a signal station on the end of Massanutten Mt. above Strasburg -- yesterday the enemy
     sent up 60 men to capture it, but our men got away &amp; we sent up a company of
     sharpshooters &amp; drove them away, capturing three &amp; killing two of them, with no
     loss to us -- today they have sent up again &amp; we have sent to dislodge them -- <u>that</u> &amp; some little skirmishing is all that breaks the monotony
     of staying out here all day in the sun &amp; dust awaiting the advance of the enemy, or for
     "something to turn up" -- -- it is very<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>tiresome, but I suppose will not last longer
     than today, for Anderson with Longstreet's Corps, reaches Front Royal this morning &amp;
     Fitz Lee is already there, so we will soon be in Condition to assume the offensive again
     &amp; start Sheridan, who now commands the "Yanks" here, on the track so well beaten by
     Banks, Fremont, Shields, Milroy, &amp; Crooks &amp; Co. We just got a letter from Mosby
     in which he says he fell on the enemy's train day before yesterday at Berryville &amp;
     Captured &amp; destroyed 75 wagons, got some 200 prisoners &amp; some 600 mules
     &amp; horses &amp; killed a good many &amp; also he fell on a scouting party that
     was going to Culpeper &amp; routed them capturing &amp; killing a good many, Mosby is
     certainly one of the bravest spirits we have -- quiet &amp; modest, a fine looking fellow,
     but always in motion &amp; reaping a rich harvest of spoils -- William &amp; Sam.
     Chapman are both captains in his command -- &amp; are highly esteemed by him, I understand
     --</p>
<p class="p10"> We had a little rain last night &amp; it is pleasanter today than heretofore -- it has
     been intensely hot -- but we have managed<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>to stand it so far -- &amp; if we can
     whip the force that is now before us it will be a fine thing for the country. I think, as
     heretofore, that this campaign will go far to end the war &amp; do not think there will be
     much if any fighting after this campaign. No doubt the entire army will be here before long
     &amp; the field of battle be transferred to the Banks of the Potomac or North of it. Grant
     was at Harper's Ferry a few days ago &amp; is, no doubt, trying to get away from Richmond
     as best he can -- I got a very fine young horse in Maryland, it only cost me $100. in
     Confederate money, as Gen. Early let us have horses at the cost price there, paying in
     Confederate money the value fixed on them in Federal -- it was a good thing for me &amp;
     will enable me to sell one of my horses &amp; help to get along &amp;c whenever Charley
     gets in order I want to sell him if horses command a good price I hope there may be some
     cessation of active operations so I may get home for a few days early in Sept -- My shirts are
      <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>getting somewhat worse for wear &amp; I think I shall try to buy some ready
     made ones if we get where there are any, I believe white ones do as well as any others in the
     army &amp; they usually last longer -- I do not think it best to have any pants made of my
     cloth just now -- if you have not done anything to them just keep the cloth safely -- I will do
     all I can for your memoranda bless your dear little heart I wish you had all the things you <u>want</u> I hope Parkins carried up the box of cups &amp; saucers
     &amp; that you have gotten it by this time. Write me how the children like the books -- I
     sent them &amp;c &amp;c Write me my love -- I know you have hard times this hot weather
     &amp; wish I could be at home to attend to affairs but be of good cheer -- all will yet be
     well -- Love &amp; kisses &amp; blessings for you all -- </p>
