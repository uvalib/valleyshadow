<p class="p10">Camp Randolph</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Aunt</p>
<p class="p10">I take my pen in hand this morning to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well
     and hope when this comes to hand it may find you enjoying good health. I have nothing of
     interest to write. We are settled down in camp and if the present state of the weather
     continues we will be quiet until spring. Our brigade is on picket;went last Sunday but expect
     to return this evening. I did not go as my shoes are not very good for snow, and the wet, and
     muddy state of the roads. Our Generals are not looking for any military movements now I think,
     as they are giving furloughs pretty freely there is three of our company at home <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Smiley2b.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley2b.gif"></center></a><br><br> on furlough now, and three more expecting to go in a day or two.
     My turn does not come for some time yet but I expect to get home some time this winter or
     spring. Mr See has just been around he is speaking of building a chapel near the regiment
     expects to commence in a few days. It would be much more comfafortable then to attend preaching in the open air It has been rumored that part of
     our brigade went to the Yankees while on picket but I do not think it so. Yet it would not
     surprise me if a great many did not desert as the soldier is not getting what is justly due him
     There has been several days that they got no meat at all and when there is meat issued it is in
     small quantities our regiment has not suffered any however as we get a great deal from home </p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>T. M. Smiley</i></p>
<p class="p10">I will draw this to a close by asking you to give my love to Aunt Anna
      and Uncle James family and receive a due share yourself</p>
