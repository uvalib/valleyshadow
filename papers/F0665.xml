                <p>I received your letter last night or night before I believe it was <unclear>right
                        as the boys are almost</unclear> all sending some money home. I write to let
                    you know why I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> send any. we were <orig reg="paid"
                        >payed</orig> for four months but <orig reg="owing">oweing</orig> to a
                    mistake in <orig reg="signing">sighning</orig> my name, I with several others
                    did not get <unclear>counted</unclear>. When I enlisted I signed my name as I
                    always do S.W. North, but somehow my name was copied on the roll, Samuel J.
                    North, and has always continued so on the muster rolls and this time when I came
                    to sign the muster roll I put my correct signature to it and the paymaster this
                    time was very <del hand="h1">correc</del> strict and did not give us who had
                    mistakes in our names. There were several who did not get paid but we will get
                    it when we are discharged. there will not be the least risk of losing it. I had
                    just as <orig reg="like">liek</orig> have it then as now as I <orig reg="don't"
                        >dont</orig> need it and would run the risk of sending it home.<pb n="2"/>
                    when I do get it I will get six months pay at once. We had orders to move but I
                    will give you the whole account on Monday the 91<hi rend="super">st</hi>
                    <abbr expan="regiment">regt</abbr> with four men from each company of ours and
                    the 134 &amp; 124 started on monday morning. they are now at U.S. ford
                    &amp; Banks ford holding them. they are about six miles up the river. our
                    whole cavalry force has come out towards Warrenton. they are reported to have
                    had a fight. We were to have gone this morning but it commenced raining last
                    night and has been pouring down all day and this night - it is raining still. it
                    will raise the river and may delay the move. It seems as if providence was
                    against us all along. the mud march was defeated on <abbr expan="account"
                    >acct</abbr> of the weather. <orig reg="Burnside's">Burnsides</orig> plans were
                    disclosed another time now this move has just gone far enough to be exposed. I
                    think it is the plan <del hand="h1">is</del> to cross the main force below those
                    above were for a decoy though a considerable force may cross above the city.
                    This is my idea. Some of our boys were out to see those at the fords they say
                    they could not see many <abbr expan="rebels">rebs</abbr> at first<pb n="3"/> but
                    they soon came pretty thick. they are on good terms with our boys they made a
                    raft of cornstalks and put a Richmond Examiner on it and sent it over to our
                    fellows. one of the boys from our company got it the war news was torn off one
                    hollared will you let me come back again if i come over our boys said yes he
                    stripped off and was coming when one of the 91<hi rend="super">st</hi> officers
                    said I will have to make a prisoner of you he then stopped and went back our
                    company was at Stonemans <unclear>

                    they have splendid engines on the road the finest I ever saw tell pap to send me
                    some postage stamps as mine are most done. I sent the April agriculturist. I
                    might most as well have a sharp stick to write with as this pen. give my love to
                    all the friends. I will write soon again if anything is going on. </p>
