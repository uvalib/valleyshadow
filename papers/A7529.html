<p class="p10">Oct. 17. 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Mt. Solon, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. D.H. Evans,</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of the 15 is the dearest &amp; most affectionate you have Ever
                    yet written to me, just such a letter as I love to get from you &amp; I have
                    read it over &amp; over again thanking you from my heart for such
                    expressions of devotion Why do you not always write so freely &amp;
                    affectionately to me? My letters to you have Ever been dictated by the truest
                    &amp; deepest love, have they not? I am not complaining now but only showing
                    you that your last &amp; dearest letter met a loving welcome from her to
                    whom it was written &amp; that I prize it more dearly than any you have Ever
                    written to me</p>
<p class="p10">You ask me if I thought of you during your lonely homeward ride of Monday. I did
                    indeed think of nothing else. I sought my bed but could not sleep for thinking
                    of one I loved more than all others riding a dreary long road alone. I could not
                    rest when I knew you were travelling &amp; then I would so much rather have
                    been with you my heart &amp; thoughts were with you all the way, but you
                    knew it not. Do you remember I told you I would not sleep until I thought you
                    had arrived safely at home. nor did I either. I was glad &amp; thankful to
                    hear you reached Staunton for I was so fearful something might happen to you
                    that I was as anxious &amp; miserable<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>as I could be until I heard
                    from you. God is so Merciful to us ungrateful beings. I thanked Him fervently
                    for protecting your dear life &amp; person from danger. I bless His holy
                    name for loving &amp; caring for you during your many rides to, &amp;
                    from Staunton May God Ever guide your way is the daily pleading of Mary's heart
                    for you.</p>
<p class="p10">I am as happy &amp; rejoiced to know of the bright &amp; cheerful change
                    in your feelings &amp; manner as you can Ever be. do you believe me? do you
                    think it possible for the great change in you to make me just as happy? It does,
                    for all my unhappy doubts thinking you did not love me as my heart longed to be
                    loved by you in return for the deep &amp; undying devotion it had given
                    &amp; lavished truly upon you do you know, that I often thought one reason
                    why you seemed so thoughtful &amp; troubled was that you had
                    <i>[unclear: seen]</i> my affection &amp; found after calm consideration
                    that you were mistaken in your feelings &amp; did not love me. I told you
                    last Sunday night how often &amp; how deeply you grieved &amp; pained me
                    whilst in Staunton by your cold &amp; silent manner, because I thought you
                    did not love me &amp; I was loving you all the time with a true &amp;
                    unchanging love. I was loving &amp; thinking of none but you, wishing
                    &amp; praying Oh! so earnestly that I might know your true feelings for me
                    &amp; why you were so cold &amp; silent when you came in my<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>presence. I never was as unhappy, never suffered so much in all my past life
                    as I did then when doubting your love. I am glad of the happy change in you for
                    your own dear sake, for I know you are so much happier &amp; to feel
                    &amp; see that you are bright &amp; happy is to make me so also. If I
                    could give you uninterrupted happiness in this world you would never know one
                        moments trouble. I would keep all sorrow
                    &amp; anxiety far from your heart &amp; mind your face which I love to
                    look at should never be clouded with painful thought if the power were mine.
                    Your pathway through life should be sunny, glorious, happy &amp; beautiful,
                    but no mortal being ever has yet in this life tasted of the cup I would if I had
                    the power place to your darling mouth but any one can be very happy if they just
                    would try in the right way for there is joy for all who will have it if they
                    only try they will find it but I can't be happy when I think <u>you</u> don't love me. How I did wish to be with you when
                    you left Sunday. I felt so lonely &amp; sad when you were gone. If I could
                    see your dear, dear face to night &amp; have you
                    near me, I should be so glad &amp; contented. Oh! I do want to see you so
                    much so much if you could just come in now I would cry with joy for I would be
                    so glad &amp; even thankful to see you can't you come Saturday with Magnus
                    if Ella don't come? it is so long till Saturday a week I wish I could see you
                    every day like I once did<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I know since I love you that I never did
                    love truly before. I feel &amp; know it every hour of my life for I love you
                    more then I do my own life my Soul, or my God This is as
                    true as I know that My God looks down from His glorious Home in Heaven upon me
                    in sorrowful displeasure for making you my one Idol. I must love God best, if I
                    wish for our Earthly happiness. May God help me to love Him first &amp; you
                    next that is the way I would have it for His blessings upon us &amp; our
                    love for each other.</p>
