<h4>Franklin County: Samuel G. Lane to Edward McPherson,
                    March 16, 1860<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Lane replies to McPherson's letter presumably informing Lane of Cameron's refusal
                    to advance a loan. Lane's letter also refers to several issues, including his
                    position as a newspaper editor and his views on the Republican party.</p>

<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">Excuse me for not acknowledging earlier the receipt of your letter, and thanking
                    you for the prompt attention you gave to our request. The result was precisely
                    what I expected, and I fully appreciate the feelings of the General in writing
                    to avoid any complications of the sort. I am very glad that he did not
                    misunderstand the motives of our application; which was as honest as if made to
                    any one else. The boys urged me to write, or I should have declined.</p>
<p class="p10">They have been encouraged to hope for assistance in time to <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    their bacon.</p>
<p class="p10">I am an editor very much against my inclinations: it is a position for which I am
                    totally unfit, and I cannot take the time from my professional duties to inform
                    myself upon politics. The Salary alone entices me, and this is of some
                    consequence.</p>
<p class="p10">The Republican party will have a hard fight in this state. I wish we had less of
                    the <u>pigmentum nigrum</u> in our complexion. </p>
<p class="p10">Your Speech was timely and strong, plain and logical. The party are well-pleased with their representative.</p>
<p class="p10">I am gratified with your flattering remarks concerning myself. Please present my
                    compliments to Mr Cameron:</p>
<p class="p10">Respy Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Saml. G. Lane</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Hon. Edward McPherson
                        <p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br></p> If you have Macaulay's Essay on Slavery, will you be good enough
                        to send me a Copy. I was unfortunate enough to lose the Tribune containing
                        it, before I had time to read it.</p>
