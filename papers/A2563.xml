     <salute>My Dear Wife --</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I today <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> your letter of the 13<hi rend="super">th</hi>
     inst. and, though I wrote only a few days ago, I will write again, for I shall start away again
     tomorrow &amp; may not find time to write for several days -- I fear you did not tell me
     all about the fire you had, and that you got hurt, or something else unfortunate <orig
      reg="occurred">occured</orig> that you have <orig reg="withheld">witheld</orig> lest I might
     be worried by it, but I hope not, and that you told me the worst about it. I have heard much
     about the coming of the Yankees, towards Staunton but suppose we have fuller and more reliable
     information about them than you all have, and Gen. Jackson does not attach much importance to
     the reports -- he told me today that Imboden captured a company of them in Tucker Co -- which
     is way out beyond Beverly, and I have no doubt the anticipation of a fire in their rear will
     induce them to turn back and look after their line of communication. I came on to <abbr
      expan="Head  
 Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> Friday, going to Winchester first, to find where
      <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> were, and there heard of Maj. <orig reg="McCue's"
      >McCues</orig> loss, for which I was very sorry -- People speak of his being on a spec<pb
      n="2"/>ulating trip -- he wrote several letters to Gen. Jackson, while under the excitement
     incident to his <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> and what had happened, and I think the General put him down
     for a decided <unclear>sensationist</unclear>, and so replied -- though I know not -- The
     General dislikes rumors, exceedingly, unless he can get substantial facts -- I don't believe he
     likes to hear of anything. I found our camp 2 1/2 miles from Winchester, on the road to Front
     Royal, meeting the Staff just as they got there. Maj. Harman had his tent fixed up with a stove
     &amp;c, very comfortably, and had a plenty of good living, and moreover invited me to stay
     with him and so I have made my home in his tent for the two days I have been here -- It is very
     comfortable, about as much so as a room, only it gets too warm -- one would hardly suppose a
     cloth wall could be made such a shield against the cold. I shall start tomorrow, if it does not
     rain, for another trip that will land me at home in 8 or 10 days, coming up by the way of
     Conrad's Store &amp;c, so I think I had better not send you any money by letter, as you
     have <pb n="3"/>
     <hi rend="underline">some</hi> still -- If felt any alarm about the occupation of Staunton by
     the enemy, I would come up at once, but I do not feel any, knowing the situation of things -
     McClellan has been relieved from command of the Yankee army, and had gone to Trenton, where his
     wife is -- Burnsides has been put in command, and the Northern papers think much time has been
     lost by the change -- Lincoln has damaged his cause much by this act, but it is a good thing
     for us -- . John Van Buren said, in a speech the other day, that they must have an armistice to
     give the people of the South a chance to elect members to Congress -- that Old Abe's
     Proclamation might become inoperative in that way. I see Giles was elected to Congress as a Rep
     -- the scamp -- but he has Dickinson for company. I would not wonder if the soldiers we
     captured at Harper's Ferry were allowed to go home if they would vote the <abbr
      expan="Republican">Rep.</abbr> ticket, and that the few <abbr expan="Republicans"
     >Rep's.</abbr> elected in N.Y. were chosen by their votes. </p>
    <p> We have prisoners constantly brought in, four different squads in 24 hours -- The last batch
     was taken at Leesburg -- so you <unclear>see</unclear> have been back to the line of the
     Potomac again, or nearly so -- There was cannona<pb n="4"/>ding at Waterloo, on the
     Rappahannock yesterday, but we did not hear the result -- only a cavalry affair I suppose -- We
     are still stretched diagonally across the Valley below Winchester and below Front Royal -- I
     was much struck by the words of an Irishman of the 20<hi rend="super">th</hi>
     <abbr expan="Connecticut">Conn</abbr> -- who was brought here today, he having deserted from
     the Harper's Ferry army. He said he was <hi rend="underline">forced</hi> to enlist, and his
     heart was not in the war, he would not shoot at the Southern people -- he had received more
     kind treatment in the few days he had been with our troops than in all the time he had been in
     the Northern army and he wanted to get home and stay there -- Dr. McGuire asked him why he did
     not join the Southern army -- he pointed Northward and said "I have a wife and children there"
     and said no more -- putting an Irishman's expressive looks on at the same time -- It was a
     volume of argument in a single sentence -- </p>
    <p> Gen. Jackson fully approved of my plan of operations since I have been gone and told me to
     continue to use, diligently, as heretofore, the good weather and make up my notes of as much
     country as possible, and then I might go into quarters at home and fix up my maps -- Good news,
     which you will be glad to hear -- he said unless the fortune of war made unforeseen changes
     necessary I should have my wish; so, a kind Providence favoring, I shall be able to spend my
     winter at home -- <hi rend="underline">all</hi> at home -- and you will see much of me, for my
     work will be there. I will write to you if delayed longer that I expect now in getting home for
     a day or so -- I shall not probably get home for winter quarters before the middle of Dec -- I
     today sent up my old jacket and pants, some powder shot &amp; caps for Nelson and 1 1/2 doz
     -- hose - use them as you please -- If's more than you want let Allie &amp; Harriet have
     some -- perhaps you may <unclear>fix</unclear> some of them for the children -- the white ones
     are 62 1/2 &amp; other 50 c -- I forgot to send the <abbr expan="handkerchiefs"
     >hdkfs</abbr> I bought (over) I enclose you a couple of late Yankee letters, from <del
      hand="h1"/>, they show the inner life there -- we caught a Lt. &amp; <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>,
     Love &amp; kisses from Pa -- &amp; God's blessing for you -- </p>
