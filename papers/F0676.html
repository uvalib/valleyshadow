<p class="p10">Bowling Green </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother </p>
<p class="p10">I now take the oppertunity of writing these few
                    lines to you to inform you that I am well hoping that they may find you all
                    Enjoying the same blessing I Recieved a letter from
                    you some time ago but I never got a Chance to answer it for we have been
                    Marching ever since we stoped at Pinch Him Slyly on
                    the 25<sup>th</sup> of oct. and our
                    Tents came up to us there. the first time we saw them since we left Battle Creek
                    which is 2 month and five days ago and we had just got them Pitched when it
                    began to snow - it snowed the whole night and in the morning the snow was about
                    6 inches deep. <i>[added: it was]</i> the luckyest thing Ever happened us that they did come for
                    it was an awful cold night<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> we had four days skirmishing in which we
                    lost over 100 men Mike Huffnagle was among them but we heard since that he was
                    Paroled. Buell has been superceded by Rosenbrans Hambrights Regt is now about 2 or three miles behind us they
                    form Part of the left wing I see <i>[unclear: Nood Everly]</i> often he looks
                    first Rate and is doing well Hambright's men are sattisfied that the Rebels Dont fear gun
                    Powder and they say they Dont care wether they get in another fight or not they say they wanted to get
                    into one fight and they had that so they would just as soon not get in any more
                    - they fought well and its no telling how the Battle
                    would have went if it had<sup>nt</sup> been for the 79<sup>th</sup>
                    Penn<sup>a</sup> and the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    Wissconsin for the 24<sup>th</sup>
                    Wisconsin were supporting Terrels Battery and they Ran the first fire and
                    Hambright had to make a flank<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> Movement and <i>[added: thats]</i> where he got his men cut up so I <i>[deleted: what]</i>
                    dont know what forces were fighting on the Rebels side
                    for there was a dutchman of the 24<sup>th</sup>
                    Ala. that Deserted from Bragg's Army and he told us
                    that Bragg &amp; Kirby Smith was looking at us
                    crossing the Mountain at Lawrence Burgh They
                    had us Pend on the Mountain for about four hours. they
                        attacted our Rear and thought to draw us out
                    There was only our Division but Sills was to sharp for
                    them he hurried on the Teames but they made out to get
                    16 of our wagons and 551 Prisoners out of the Division 75 our of our Regt the Dutchman said that Kirby smith had 35,000
                    under him and that Bragg was laying there with a heavy force, he did<sup>nt</sup> know how many but he said
                    that Bragg had 52,000 under him at one</p>
