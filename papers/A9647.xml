                <p>I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> your letter yesterday, &amp; as we are
                    laying still this morning I will try and write a few lines in answer. I know not
                    when this will reach you as it is reported that a large Cavalry force has gone
                    up the Valley in our rear. The <orig reg="Enemy">Enimy</orig> have a large
                    Cavalry force in the Valley &amp; our Cavalry being afraid of them <unclear>
                        <orig reg="puts">buts</orig>
                    </unclear> us to a <orig reg="great">grate</orig> deal of trouble. We had to
                    march last night <orig reg="until">untill</orig> twelve <orig reg="o'clock"
                        >oclock</orig> through mud &amp; rain to meet an <orig reg="anticipated"
                        >antisapated</orig> raid on Winchester. We are camped this morning near
                    Winchester &amp; <orig reg="every">evry</orig> thing seems perfectly quiet.
                    It will hardly remain so <orig reg="until">untill</orig> night.</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>I suppose you are aware before this of the fate of your Cousin R. <del hand="h1"
                    /> our <orig reg="company">comp.</orig> is called to mourn the loss of one of
                    our bravest youths who like a young flower was cut down in early manhood. We
                    greatly <unclear>
                        <orig reg="miss">mis</orig>
                    </unclear> him. All his <orig reg="comrades">comrads</orig>

                    &amp; relatives. I have been under the fire of the <orig reg="enemy">enimy</orig>
                    <orig reg="twice">twist</orig> since I wrote at Sheperdstown &amp;
                        Smithfiel<add hand="h1" place="inline">d</add>. But by the mercies of a
                    great &amp; good God I have been spared yet a while <orig reg="there"
                    >thare</orig> has been no regular engagement since I come down, only heavy
                    skirmishing. We are ready for a fight almost <orig reg="every">evry</orig> day,
                    as both armies are getting near each other. But I will pray &amp; live in
                    hopes <orig reg="there">thare</orig> will be no more hard fighting in the
                    Valley.</p>

                <p>I am glad to hear that your Cousin L. is getting well but sorry to hear that your
                    health is still declining hope <orig reg="ere">ear</orig> this reaches you <pb

                    >Thare</orig> has been a great many deaths in old Augusta since I left. I

                    many as the sword. I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> a letter from sister
                    some time ago she said the Yanks <orig reg="were">ware</orig> in thirty miles of
                    Uncles &amp; was <orig reg="fearful">fearfull</orig>
                    <orig reg="they">thay</orig>

                        >thare</orig> neighborhood. She wanted to know <orig reg="whether"
                    >wether</orig> she ought to go a refugeeing or gird on the <orig reg="armor"
                        >armer</orig> &amp; go forth to meet the foe. I give her the <orig
                        reg="advice">advise</orig> I would to all women stay at home. I got a letter
                    yesterday from my friend John Sam he says if I <orig reg="were">ware</orig> at
                    home now I <add hand="h1" place="inline">could</add> not but help having the
                    blues as <orig reg="every">evry</orig> thing is so dull. I think differently I
                    am sure <orig reg="there">thare</orig> is one whose company I could always enjoy
                    let times be as <orig reg="they">thay</orig> please. Dear Kate you must have
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> me to have been musing or my mind wandering on some
                        imagina<add hand="h1" place="inline">ry</add>
                    <pb n="4"/> reflections. I was writing with two of three by my side &amp;
                    intended <unclear>sending</unclear> other finishing, but never thought of it
                        <orig reg="until">untill</orig> I had sealed it, but never thought you would
                    be so strict as to follow my example. This is a beautiful day but our camp is
                    not <orig reg="pleasant">plesant</orig> we have no shades to keep the rays of
                    the burning sun off our heads.</p>

                <p>Did not know that it was Sunday <orig reg="until">untill</orig> I was informed
                    this morning. We have been <orig reg="moving">mooving</orig> nearly <orig

                    hope before the cold blasts of winter sets in we may all be <orig reg="where"
                        >whare</orig> we can enjoy these <orig reg="blessed">blest</orig> of all
                    days at home. My health is very good. I have no reasonable right at <orig

                    all <orig reg="inquiring">enquiring</orig> friends excuse this spoiled paper it
