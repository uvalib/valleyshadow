<p class="p10">My Dr. Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">Your note &amp; the clothes came to hand by the bishop -- I found some flannel shirt in
     town wh. I bought am sorry I cd. not send
     you word of it before you spent so much labor to make my old one comfortable, but I will wear
     the old one and keep the new, because of your labor of love on it -- We have no additional news
     of any note -- The enemy made a stand Wednesday P.M. some 20 miles below Richmond, at Turkey Pt
     -- planted 26 pieces and recd. some reinforcements, and we had a
     bloody fight with them until 10 P.M. but finally took the artillery and drove them to the bank
     of James River, where they were getting to their gun boats &amp; transports as fast as
     possible, but they cannot possiby get away half of them, and we are
     after them with fresh troops -- There is no doubt of our ability, with God's blessing, to
     dispose of McClellan and his boasted army.</p>
<p class="p10"> I have taken a cold and do not feel very well today, but am better than I was yesterday. I
     shall come home tomorrow evening if nothing happens -- it will be late perhaps -- and I will
     stay over Sunday </p>
<p class="p10"> Love to the children May God bless you all </p>
<p class="p10">Your Aff. husband</p>
