<p class="p10">Dear EmmetDear Ma.</p>
<p class="p10">You may think I have de<br>
layed writing too long, but it has been<br>
caused partly by my waiting to get a letter<br>
from home, not having received one since<br>
your brief note of 11th informing me of 
An<br>
drew's return.<a href="#n1">[1]</a>
Our stay in camp after<br>
the fight was but brief.  Marched again<br>
on 16th to a point five miles beyond<br>
Orange C.H., and in sight of the
Yankee Camp<br>
and remained there four
days drawing and<br>
cooking rations almost every day so as to<br>
keep three days provisions on hand.<br>
Yesterday we again took up the line of<br>
march and advanced towards the enemy,<br>
our route being to the right of the railroad,<br>
and encamped near a little town called<br>
Stephensburg.  This morning <i>[deleted: morning]</i> we took<br>
an early start&#8212;crossed the Rail<br>
Road at Brandy Station and are now within two<br>
miles of the Rappihannock.
The enemy are<br>
on the further bank for the purpose of<br>
preventing or retarding our advance, and<br>
considerable cannonading has been going<br>
on across the stream.  The Yankees retrea<br>
ted from Culpeper
C.H. yesterday
lea<br>
ving twelve hundred wounded men.

<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Bro2h214.jpg"><center><img src="images/Bro2h214.gif"></center></a><br><br>

A cavalry skirmish occurred yesterday, in<br>
which sixty prisoners were taken and the<br>
Yankees routed.  Most of the dwelling hou<br>
ses along the road have been deserted by<br>
the whites and left to the fate of war.<br>
The country down here is generally flat<br>
and poor, but in the neighborhood of 
Or<br>
ange C.H. are many splendid
fields of<br>
corn, which continually tempt<br>
the soldier to trespass.  Our cavalry and some artil<br>
lery have succeeded in crossing the river<i>[unclear: .]</i><br>
Our cavalry have just captured twenty<br>
five Yankees and two Ambulances. 
Gen<br>
Lee is here in command. 
Gen Stuart and his Cavalry are
here.<a href="#n2">[2]</a>

<p class="p10">

I sent to Waynesboro last week by 
Mr Da<br>
vidson <i>[deleted: $2006]</i> $206.00;
$94.00 for Andrew<br>
and the remainder for myself.  You take your<br>
pay out of it, and as I am not getting<br>
home very fast will have to make the<br>
trade in pants we spoke of, which<br>
will leave me in your debt&#8212;$21.00. I<br>
would like to have the pants by the<br>
first chance you have of sending them.<br>
Mr. Hill declines going in as a
substitute<a href="#n3">[3]</a><br>
and I have heard nothing more of the<br>
man of 2nd Regt.;
dont think he has ever<br>
returned. Saw James White
<a href="#n4">[4]</a>
a few days<br>
ago; said Andrew was looking quite thin

having been reduced by scanty fare.  I sent<br>
the little sword I spoke of to Waynesboro<br>
by Harry Arnall, who is discharged.
Please<br>
say in your next <i>[added: letter]</i> whether you got the
money;<br>
disliking to carry it&#8212;I thought best to<br>
send it even by indirect means.  On Mon<br>
day All our wagons were taken from us<br>
except enough to have cooking utencils<br>
and officers baggage and our mess box<br>
es thrown out and bags substituted. So<br>
we have to tote our little all on our<br>
backs, which with gun cartridge box<br>
and haversack containing three days<br>
rations is quite burdensome.<a href="#n5">[5]</a> Four or<br>
five boys broke down yesterday. Tom<br>
White 
Jno
and Henry Myres are
in a very<br>
fair way of getting transfers <i>[deleted: of]</i> to Cav<br>
alry.<a href="#n6">[6]</a>
I forgot to say that James White<br>
told me that there were two men in his<br>
company who would probably be discharged<br>
who might be got as substitutes.<br>
I will soon need a hat and would like<br>
to have a pocket-ink stand and penn holder<br>
if <i>[deleted: they]</i> this can be bought.  Will also take one<br>
of your homemade pocket books if you<br>
<i>[deleted: can m]</i> have an extra one or
can convenient<br>
ly make one. Andrew had better have<br>
his knapsack as small as possible, they can be drawn here.

Suppose I may think of this as Aunt<br>
Mary's<a href="#n7">[7]</a> bridal day, if so, may it be an<br>
era of happiness in her life.
</p>
<p class="p10">Got your long looked for letter<br>
this morning.  Tell Andrew and
Mary I wish<br>
they were as good at writing as promising. We<br>
are still near the Rappinock, not crossed

A considerable amount of cannonading has been<br>
going on and some picket firing. Hoped the Yan<br>
kees leave last night. How much <i>[unclear: more]</i> pleasant<br>
it would be to be tasting Aunt Ma<br>
ry's wedding cake then eating hard crackers<br>
and listening at the whistling of <i>[deleted: that]</i> cannon<br>
balls, but it is all for the best.
Gen
Long<br>
street is on another road.<a href="#n8">[8]</a>
I dont think<br>
there will be much <i>[illeg.]</i> <i>[added: fighting]</i> just now.<br>
Would be very glad if Andrew
could change his<br>
branch of service or get a substitute. Three<br>
men were shot last Monday as deserters.<a href="#n9">[9]</a><br>
One by the name of Andrew G. Riddle of

<a href="#n10">[10]</a>
Your affectionate Son,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Charles</i></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b>Notes</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> Charles refers to Andrew's release from Federal prison
on August 5, 1862, as part of a prisoner exchange. He had been captured at
Kernstown on March 23, 1862 (Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia Infantry</i>, 41).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a> The events Charles describes are those leading up to the
the Second Battle of Manassas, which began on August 28, 1862. At the
time of this letter, Jackson's brigades had just fought the Federals at
Cedar Mountain on August 8, during which General Winder was fatally
wounded. Colonel Ronald took command of the Stonewall Brigade while
Lieutenant Colonel Gardner took over the 4th Va Infantry. On the 10th of
August, Jackson moved his men to Gordonsville, where they rested for five
days, as Charles indicates. Late on the 15th, the men moved through
Orange Court House and set up camp near Pigsah Church where they
remained until the 19th. For the next two days, they marched in the rain
across the Rapidan River and across the Bull Run Mountains, setting up
the flanking movement which Jackson and Lee hoped would trap Pope's army
and allow them to seize the Federal supply base at Manassas Junction.
Although victory at Second Manassas was claimed by the Confederates,
their losses were considerable: the Stonewall Brigade suffered over four
hundred casualties. By the end of the fighting, the 4th Va Infantry's ranks had
been reduced to one hundred (<i>The Stonewall Brigade</i>, 138-152 and <i>Fourth
Virginia Infantry</i>, 16-19).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> The First Conscription Act allowed a conscripted
(drafted) man to hire a substitute to serve his term. This
provision produced much division and tension between the poor and the wealthy.
Often, a substitute would desert a day after appearing in camp, then
agree to substitute for someone else. The First Conscription Act also allowed
each soldier who enlisted for three years to take a sixty day furlough
each year (Current, vol. 1, 396-99).
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> James J. White, or "Old Zeus" to his students, was a
professor of Classics at Washington College from 1852-1893. He was
commissioned as a Captain when Company I was organized on June 2,
1861, but he resigned on September 6 of that same year due to illness.
He returned to teaching at Washington College
(Bean 11; Robertson 1, 80). However, White's
correspondence of 1862 shows that he wanted to return to the service:
enrollment at Washington College was down, as only those boys who were
both exempt from service and could afford the tuition were able to
attend. White indicates in his March 20, 1862 letter to Colonel Reid
that he was seeking a staff appointment with General Jackson. It is
possible that he received some kind of temporary command, which would
explain his presence in the Jackson Brigade in the summer of 1862
(Turner, 87-96).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n5">[5]</a> From August 19 to August 24, as Jackson's army moved
northeast across the Rapidan River, the wagons carrying food and
supplies were mired miles behind the troops (Robertson, <i>The Stonewall Brigade</i>,
141).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n6">[6]</a> Thomas Spottswood White was born in Charlottesville,
Va in 1845. He joined the 4th Va Infantry, Company I in March of 1862,
but transferred to the 1st Va Calvary on February 4, 1863. John and
Henry Myers both enlisted in Company I in 1861. They were both
transferred to the First Virginia Cavalry on September 20, 1862
(Robertson, <i>4th Virginia Infantry</i>, 65, 80).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n7">[7]</a> "Aunt Mary" may refer to Eleanor's younger sister Mary
Stuart, born in 1828.  According to the Augusta County 1860 Census data,
she lived on property adjacent to the Brooks family.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n8">[8]</a> General Longstreet's units joined Jackson's brigades on
August 29 (Robertson, <i>The Stonewall Brigade</i>, 148).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n9">[9]</a> On August 18, Jackson had four deserters brought into
camp to be shot in front of the entire division. The men were
blindfolded and told to kneel in front of an open grave. The rifle balls
drove their bodies into the pit, and all of the troops were marched past
the grave, driving home the consequences of desertion (Robertson, <i>The Stonewall
Brigade</i>, 141). James Andrew Riddel of Augusta County, a private in
the 5th Va Infantry, Company A, was one of the men
executed. It is interesting that Charles notes this incident right
after expressing his wish that Andrew put in for a substitute; three
months later, Andrew would desert.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n10">[10]</a> "Uncle Ben" is probably Eleanor's brother, born in
1820. The Augusta County 1860 census data shows that Benjamin Stuart
lived next
door to the Brooks in the same dwelling as Mary and Martha Stuart.</p>
