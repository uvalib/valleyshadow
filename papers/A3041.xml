                <p>I received letter from you some two or three days since through <abbr
                        expan="Lieutenant">Leiut</abbr> Randolph And I now take the opportunity of
                    answering it. I was glad to hear from you &amp; to know that you were well.
                    I received a box of provisions from John some time since, in which was a cheese
                    that he said you sent. I am very thankful to you for it. &amp; must say that
                    it was the best I have eaten since I left home. you have no idea how much I
                    appreciate this present, in the way of eatables &amp; I hope by strict
                    attention to business &amp; duty to merit a continuance of your hospitality.</p>
                <p>I have nothing of interest to write you at this time. we are in tolerably good
                    spirits. We have had pretty hard times in the last few days, have taken up the
                    line of marching. We have made three trips to Fairfax, &amp; are now under
                    marching orders to some point. The troops are passing our camp this morning,
                    going in the direction of fairfax. I suppose there is where we will go. <abbr
                        expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Craig is still mending slowly, but is very low
                    yet. There is a <orig reg="good deal">goodeal</orig> of sickness amongst our
                    soldiers now. Caused by the damp weather. we have rain nearly all the time. it
                    is raining now &amp; has been for several days.<pb n="2"/></p>

                        >time</add> as times are very dull &amp; news hard to get. Our pickets
                    extend within five miles of Alexandria at this time. They have had several
                    little <unclear>
                        <abbr expan="skirmishes">mishes</abbr>

                    now busily engaged fortifying the same. It is said that he can see every move of
                    the enemy from this point with the aid of a spy-glass Washington &amp;

                    positiion. But I must close for the present. excuse brevity, &amp; all
