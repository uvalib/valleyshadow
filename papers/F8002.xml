                <p>I see by the papers, your name is being used as a candidate for the Presidency
                    for the campaign in 1860--I sincerely hope you may receive the nomination
                    &amp; then be elected,-I was the first to move in this county in favor of
                    Harrison--and again for <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Taylor and intend to
                    do something for you in our paper before long-</p>
                <p>Never will I forget your friend G.W. Brewer who, by and by, is one of the
                    cleverest of men I know. A short time after the Democratic Convention<pb n="2"
                    />met in Harrisburg at which you were- and using efforts <orig reg="there"
                    >their</orig>, to get the Democratic party to bring forward <abbr
                        expan="General">Genl</abbr> Taylor,</p>
                <p>Brewer met me, and observed, Seibut, do you know the Democratic Party are going
                    to nominate <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Taylor for President and Simon
                    Cameron for Vice President- <hi rend="underline">Can you go it</hi>-I observed,
                    I did not know it, he said it was a fact- I told him, I would go wherever <abbr
                        expan="General">Genl</abbr> Taylor went- yes, said Brewer, and they will be
                    elected easy- and you and I will go to Washington &amp; have glorious <orig
                        reg="pickings">pickens</orig>- In conversation with Brewer, a short time
                    back, I reminded him of it and told him if you were nominated <hi
                        rend="underline">he must go it</hi> and <del hand="h1">now</del> then<pb
                        n="3"/>we could go to Washington at your Inauguration &amp; &amp;c
                    that I intended to write to you, and would mention the occurrence I have
                    related, but he did not want me to do it- but it is truth- and a good Joke on
                    Brewer. for he <hi rend="underline">did not</hi> vote for Taylor--because the
                    party to which he adheres, did not nominate Taylor-</p>
                <p>My object in writing is simply to let you know I am your friend--and you can
                    command my slender ability in your service.</p>
                <p>If there is one thing on earth--fires my soul, more than another, it is to reap
                    honors on the Self Made Man--I have been sounding a <unclear>Workline</unclear>
                    the principle Editor of the Repository<pb n="4"/>&amp; Transcript-in regard
                    to his advocating your claim to the nomination-he said he had took so prominent
                    a part in opposing your election as Senator that he was afraid the Valley Spirit
                    would come down on him- I could plainly see he regrets his former course and I
                    think, all will be right yet,</p>
                <p>He is under some-(at least he says so) obligations to me, as a contributor to his
                    paper--&amp; will not deny me space to favor your claims- after this is
                    done-I will try and have <unclear>extracts</unclear> from other papers inserted-
                    and if I can get the Repository once committed to your cause it will work well.</p>
