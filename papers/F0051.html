                    Captain John Taggart, 9th Penn. Reserve Infantry 
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">October 11<sup>th</sup> 1862 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Sharpsburg Md.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear John </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the <i>[illeg.]</i> came to hand last night and afforded me the
                    gratifying intelligence that you were all well. Sam was over a short time
                    yesterday afternoon. He received a letter the night before from you. I was over
                    at the Camp of the 123<sup>d</sup> on Thursday evening, and there met
                    Cas. Carpenter, who like all persons in citizens clothes looked odd, but well
                    enough. Yesterday morning Jimmy Sutherland and Sol. <i>[unclear: 
                        Schoyer
                    ]</i> were in camp. They represent things pretty <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    Pittsburgh. Capt. Cushbertson of our Reg. returned for duty yesterday also Dr. Sowen of
                        Co A. The former was taken prisoner at the
                    Peninsula, and the latter at Bull Run. They are both perfectly satisfied with
                    trip to Richmond. The recent actions left some more vacancies in our Reg but only one above the position I now occupy.
                    That one a Captaincy, I might have had, but would not accept it because I
                    thought it would be injustice to an officer of the company whose bravery and
                    competency are beyond doubt; and in whom all the members of the company have the
                    utmost confidence but being so unfortunate as to get wounded on the Peninsula he
                    has been absent ever since and the boys were going to over-look what I
                    considered his just claim. </p>
<p class="p10">You make enquiry about Lieut Pierce. I cannot say how he is. When he left the Regiment at
                    Upton's Hill to go to Washington he was as hearty-looking as any man in the
                    Regiment, and had a good appetite. More than that there was no one, if he left,
                    to take charge of the Company, but a wounded Sergeant <i>[illeg.]</i> and <i>[deleted: ]</i> is very much blamed for leaving. There are times <br><br>[<i>page </i>]<br> when an
                    officer might not be blamed for "playing off" a little, but the purpose of
                    having a "good time" but I must say, in the case herein mentioned, had I been in
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> place I would have gone on Crutches rather than Sergt
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> should have gone with the Company. But in this war some men
                    fight on principle others for <u>money</u>. the past three or
                    four months have developed and exposed the true motives of such. <i>[deleted: ]</i> tendered his resignation. Resignations are not <u>now</u>
                    accepted unless accompanied by a Surgeon's certificate, or a certificate from
                    commanding officer of Regiment to the effect that the service would be <u>benefitted</u> by the <u>acceptance</u>
                    of said Resignation. I have not the last doubt but <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <u>will</u> be accepted.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Devore must have got with the 9<sup>th</sup>
                    P.V., and not the 9<sup>th</sup>
                    P.R.V.
                    Regt., two separate and distinct organizations.
                    The position of Ordinance Sergeant will just suit <u>Jim</u>.
                    He can ride, either on horse or on wagon, if so minded, and is not necessarily
                    exposed to fire. We have been looking for Genl
                    Jackson back and would be glad to hear of his return. I am not with the company
                    but still act Adjt, and will probably continue
                    doing so. My love to all the folks, Mary &amp; Charley. Respects to enquiring friends. And believe me</p>
<p class="p10">Your Affect Brother </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Bob </i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. We have just heard of <i>[illeg.]</i> being in
                        Chambersburg. Just take the "Reserves" up there will you, and you'll hear of
                        some of the biggest work yet done in the army. Bob </p>
