<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, May 5, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How writes to Brown before what appears to be his resignation from the Bureau.
                    How proposes a reorganization of the Sixth District due to conflicts with
                    General Terry, the Military Commissioner for the Valley. He suggests that two
                    counties be placed under the jurisdiction of West Virginia, where much more
                    progress has been made in terms of laws protecting the rights of free blacks,
                    and further splitting the district into two parts, one of which would be
                    commanded from Staunton. His letter constantly alludes to conflicts and
                    misunderstandings between the Bureau and the Military Commissioners.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">May 5th 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Va</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear General</p>
<p class="p10">It seems to me that it will soon be necessary to modify the organization of this
                    District and change its present anomalous relations to the Command of Genl Terry, to that of Genl Hancock and to the state of West Virginia. By the
                        <i>[unclear: deposition]</i> of Genl Ayres the
                    command of a District <i>[unclear: embracing]</i> Rockingham, Shenandoah, Page,
                    Warren, Frederick, Clarke, Buckley, Jefferson and Linden Counties <i>[deleted: ]</i> upon a Major, U.S.<u>A</u> who is apparently desirous of fixing the
                    <i>[unclear: precise]</i> relations in which Bureau officers stand to him and
                    he to them. And he does not understand how, for instance, I can be in and
                    exercise jurisdiction within the command of Genl
                    Hancock yet be under the direction of yourself and Genl Terry.</p>
<p class="p10">This is my interpretation of his remark that he does not understand the Bureau
                    arrangements and has written for instructions, and it <i>[unclear: seems]</i>
                    to me that the <i>[unclear: ordering transactions]</i> of the Bureau are
                    irregular enough without the continuance of such a complication as this.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: These two then]</i> are Buckley and Jefferson Counties in the State
                    of <u>West</u> Virginia.</p>
<p class="p10">So long as Harpers Ferry was a Military Post and occupied as such I felt secure
                    enough in the exercise of Bureau funtion with proper care and caution, but now
                    that the <i>[unclear: sunflower]</i> of Military Authority is withdrawn I feel
                    that the jurisdiction of the Bureau in these counties is liable to be
                    questioned.</p>
<p class="p10">By a law of W.Va passed Feby 27th 1866 it is enacted that "no person shall be incompetent as
                    a witness on account of race or color," and there is also a law establishing
                    free schools for colored children. These laws are not in full operation but soon
                    will be, I trust, and there will be no need for Bureau supervision, in fact it
                    may now be advisable to withdraw. Should this District be reorganized I suggest
                    a Supt at Winchester for Frederick Co and in charge of Clarke, Warren, Page &amp;
                    Shenandoah. Also a Supt at Staunton for
                    Augusta with (4) assistants for Rockingham, Rockbridge, Alleghany and Bath,
                    adding Highland to Augusta.</p>
<p class="p10">This as I think would be the best arrangement until the Valley RRoads shall be
                    completed, probably a year hence</p>
<p class="p10">I have given this information and <i>[unclear: thrown]</i> out these suggestions
                    in an informal way so that you might initiate any action in accordance with your
                    own opinions and desires.</p>
<p class="p10">I have hitherto managed to avoid conflicts that I now think are likely to occur,
                    for since I began this I have <i>[illeg.]</i> that Genl Terry had succeeded you, as I had expected.</p>
<p class="p10">It is a fact as far as my experience goes that the absence of an understood
                    organization of the Bureau has <i>[unclear: constituted]</i> its effectiveness.
                    The Army couldn't understand it and were afraid to oppose it. The people " " " " " " " "
                    "</p>
<p class="p10">If only they could have promoted to distinct, comprehensible positions they could
                    have kept us within them and given us trouble. As an illustration, just so soon
                    as orders come here from Genl Terry which affect
                    this post commander they will be referred to Genl
                    Hancock while an order from you as "<u>
                        Assist Comr
                    </u>" would be respected That - incomprehensible "Assist Comr" does the
                    business.</p>
<p class="p10">I am sorry your relinquished command but should yet never regret it did I not
                    think it a wise thing to do, and were I to remain.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope soon to hear of your action in my behalf and that you will send
                        <i>[unclear: Capt. White]</i> in <i>[unclear: Maj. Bates]</i> to relieve
                    me sometime between the 15th &amp; 25th.</p>
<p class="p10">With best wishes<br>yours faithfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W. Storer How<br><i>[illeg.]</i></i></p>
