<p class="p10">Hon Simon Cameron<br>Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">My letter of yesterday will draw your attention to our conversation in relation to our friend Taggart after <i>[illeg.]</i> election-  Taggart found <i>[unclear: out]</i> yesterday <i>[unclear: just commensing a court]</i> <i>[illeg.]</i> by people and <i>[illeg.]</i> engaged--He left in the evening so that I did not see him more than an hour- In the night I looked over his claims and the prospect of getting him the place he aspires to, and <i>[unclear: became]</i> <i>[illeg.]</i> to the conclusion that we cannot get it for him-  He will see you about the time this reaches you or I would have written him-</p>
<p class="p10">The merchants of Phla will claim the collectorship-  My friends in Phla could not be induced to <i>[unclear: fund]</i> his appointment, and I have great doubts if you could <i>[unclear: control]</i> yours  He was not as <i>[unclear: conspicuous]</i> in the context as others who will ask for the office, and the knowledge that we have selected him for the <i>[unclear: last]</i><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>place in the state will unite all the aspirants and their friends against him-</p>
<p class="p10">I write this because I wish to <i>[illeg.]</i> him and will do so with great pleasure but I am so fully <i>[unclear: convinced]</i> that our effort to place him in the collections office will excite a little fight and in disappointment to him and us, that <i>[unclear: unless]</i> satisfied that he can <i>[illeg.]</i> I will not got into it at all</p>
<p class="p10">He will not take a <i>[illeg.]</i> of a County--What do you say to the <i>[illeg.]</i> of the Patent office?  Anything you incline to believe he can certainly make I will write with you--I submit to your better judgment after you <i>[unclear: back]</i> the matter and write me-</p>
<p class="p10">I wish to be frank with Taggart and you will of course communicate to him what I write</p>
<p class="p10">Yrs truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>A. G. Curtin</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I must go to court and you must understand what I meant by my hasty letter</p>
