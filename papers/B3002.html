<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: H. H. Wilson to W. Storer How, May 7,
     1866<br>
</h4>

<p class="p11"><b>
     Bureau of R. F. &amp; A. Lands
     Maj W. S. How
    </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">May 7th, 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Va</p>
<p class="p10">Major,</p>
<p class="p10">My personal affairs have taken such shape that it is very much to my future interest to go to
     Pennsylvania, where very favorable inducements are held out to me; I regret exceedingly to
     leave the very pleasant family down here, but justice to my own obliges me to give up my own
     inclinations in the matter.</p>
<p class="p10">When I came down, Mr. Tukey very kindly advanced me some $25, to pay the Hotel Bill I had
     contracted here, and I shall in addition to that am't, be indebted
     to him for my boarding while in his family; I propose to leave about the 15th, and having
      <i>[unclear: free]</i> passes over the roads from Harpers Ferry, will take that route,
     stopping at Winchester, where I can sign your Receipts Rolls for my pay.</p>
<p class="p10">Is there any way in which it can be managed that I can draw my pay before leaving here, so
     that I settle with Mr. Tukey <i>[deleted: before]</i> at the time?</p>
<p class="p10">I should feel under considerable obligation if you could aid me in the matter, and would be
     glad to have reply as early as convenient.</p>
<p class="p10">I am my dear sir<br>Very truly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>H. H. Wilson</i></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
