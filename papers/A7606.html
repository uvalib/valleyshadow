<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, September 16, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife to complain that he has had no response to his
                    previous letters. He guesses she has not written out of fear that the letter
                    would not be permitted through the lines. He again asks her to write with
                    details on affairs at home. He reports renting a house for her, and his need for
                    a pair of shoes.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Heste</p>
<p class="p10">I have written almost daily to you since I have been here &amp; received no
                    answer from you. I suppose you fear difficulties in writing if so tell Cousin
                    Mary about our domestic &amp; private matters &amp; she will write me
                    say nothing of Military matters &amp; there Can<sup>
                        <u>t</u>
                    </sup> be any difficulty. I heard a few days ago that you were all well. I dont know what help you have whether the children are
                    being schooled or not whether you well provided for whether the mill is moving
                    or not &amp; a host of other little matters I desire to know which there is
                    no impropriety in the service in knowing if you can<sup>
                        <u>t</u>
                    </sup> write a letter just give a list of these matters, or write a family letter
                    &amp; submit to the Provost Marshal there for his approval &amp; with
                    his endorsement<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> it will come without difficulty I wrote you so many
                    letters that I suppose you know all about my position &amp; condition</p>
<p class="p10">I rented a house above this place for you but fear you can not get out with your
                    household effects just now have you tried let me know I can<sup>
                        <u>t</u>
                    </sup> say how soon I can get out of the service &amp; of course cant come home to stay until I am clearly &amp; honourably out of the service take good care of
                    yourself &amp; children provide well as can put a school in the office if
                    not no <i>[unclear: one]</i> there &amp; send the children to school</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote cousin Mary to get me a pair shoes if she will give her the money to pay
                    for them My love to you all</p>
<p class="p10">I am well</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever</p>
