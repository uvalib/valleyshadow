<h4>Augusta: John D. Imboden to Annie Lockett, December
                    12, 1870<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Imboden teases Annie about Miss Parke and a Long Island heiress who has been
                    pursuing him. He also mentions that his business in the coming months will
                    concentrate on land sales between Norfolk and Danville.</p>

<p class="p10">Monday Dec 12 /70</p>
<p class="p10">N.Y.</p>
<p class="p10">My own most darling,</p>
<p class="p10">I dont know when you will be at home again, but I reckon
                    you will not object to find this letter there when you come, even if it should
                    be several days old.</p>
<p class="p10">I write with the more pleasure to you as my hand is in from writing a long letter
                    to Miss Parke Perkins. Now wouldn't you like to see my letter to her? or at
                    least know its contents? If I thought it would make you really jealous, I would
                    send you a copy, for I like to see a jealous woman sometimes. But as a copy
                    would be very long I will give you the substance. I wrote to tell her how much
                    her poems were admired by several literary people to whom they were submitted. I
                    had to tell her what each one <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> said, about each little poem (three in
                    all) and as they said a great many pretty things - and I wished to say some
                    pretty things too it made a long letter. Then I had to tell her where I meant to
                    have them published. Then the news &amp; gossip of N.Y. took up a page or two and then I told her that I had made up my
                    mind to get married soon and wanted to know what she thought of it, with her
                    peculiar notions on that old institution matrimony. I told her if she had been a
                    marrying woman, as she ought to have been when I first knew her, she would have
                    caught me before I ever saw my other sweet heart who is now to be my wife - but
                    the gig is all up now - it is too late. How often will you kiss me when we meet
                    for telling you all this?</p>
<p class="p10">When Miss Parke's Poems come out I will send you a copy. They <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> are
                    mighty pretty.</p>
<p class="p10">Here I have been running on without telling you I have been sick all day. Took
                    Cold Saturday night, &amp; have not been to my office since. Getting better
                    and hope to be out to <i>[deleted: day]</i> morrow as usual.</p>
<p class="p10">Am going with Jennie &amp; Russie to see the Black Crook on Thursday night.
                    Wish you were here to go with us. By the way I dont
                    think I have mentioned before that the ugliest old maid I ever saw, who has
                    $300,000 in her own right is making the way easy for me if I am matrimonially
                    inclined that way. Previous engagements out of the way I dont think the three hundred thousand would be an equivalent for the
                    ugliness. She lives on Long Island and gives the most pressing invitations to
                    come out often &amp; see her, &amp; spend my Sundays there!</p>
<p class="p10">I am now a little hopeful that I will get back to Richmond next week, not to
                    return to N.Y. for a long time. I want now to
                    direct my labours to the Country between Danville and Norfolk for several weeks.</p>
<p class="p10">When you write to Sister Ella tell her I am as mad as a hornet at her long
                    neglect of my letter. She has not written me a line.</p>
<p class="p10">Bless your little heart how I do want to see you, and put my arms around that
                    little waist till you pant about it, and then kiss the panting lips till they
                    smile.</p>
<p class="p10">I wont write you any long letters till I get another
                    from you. All this love making on <u>one</u> side won't do.
                    You must say a little bit of it yourself. Now good night.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my love to all, and believe me as ever devotedly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>JD Imboden</i></p>
