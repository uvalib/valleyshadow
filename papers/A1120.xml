                <p> As I <orig reg="didn't">didnt</orig> have time to write last Friday I will try
                    &amp; do so this morning. I had the headache pretty bad this morning
                    &amp; was beginning to think I'd have to go to bed, but when I was in class,
                    Nelie P. handed me a bottle &amp; told me to smell it. I did so &amp; it
                    pretty near knocked me down but it nearly cured me of my headache. I have
                    headache about half the time now. Carrie has headache this morning. The
                    Episcopal Convention met here last week. Kip Baldwin took the gals Friday
                    &amp; Saturday night, some few went <abbr expan="Saturday">Sat.</abbr>

                    surprised when they saw 40 school-girls on the street before 6 o'clock. <del

                    Episcopal service in our church yesterday morning &amp; evening. They got
                    along very well in the morning as there was a good many Episcopal ministers
                    scattered about over the church but last night there wasn't <orig reg="anyone"
                        >any one</orig> to respond at all. We had <del hand="h1">a</del> very good

                    Sunday week. Josie English is living in town now. she is just about the
                    prettiest young lady I have seen for a time. Our examination on
