<p class="p10">February 1, 1854</p>
<p class="p10">A home Wednesday morning</p>
<p class="p10">Dear John --</p>
<p class="p10">I leave this morning for Panther Gap. You need not tell any
                        one where I have gone to. I will try and get back tomorrow night, if
                    it be midnight when I get here. I know of no care in Court in which I am
                    interested which will come up before my return.</p>
<p class="p10">Didn't you tell me that our $300 note in Bank wd. be
                    due to day? If so you must attend to its renewal or we
                    will be protested. I forgot the thing on yesterday, or I should have attended to
                    it. Mike Harman is our endorser. Renew for 116 days. You will find some blanks
                    lying on your Table. The note is drawn "Imboden &amp; McCue."</p>
<p class="p10">Bob Bickle has 294$ of mine which he told me last evening he would deposit to my
                    credit in the <u>Central</u> Bank this <u>morning</u>. I wish you would see him before court meets &amp; have
                    the money put there. I gave Ficklin a check for $300, &amp; two others
                    checks for $50 each last evening &amp; my account at bank may be <u>short</u>
                    to day unless this deposit is made this morning --
                    Don't forget it. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Tell any body who wants
