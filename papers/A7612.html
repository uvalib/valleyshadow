<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch has heard that the children have whooping cough and suspects that
                    will hinder his plan to move the family to Staunton. He gives directions to his
                    wife in case she does come, and includes a list of supplies to bring. He also
                    discusses preparations for opening the hotel.</p>
