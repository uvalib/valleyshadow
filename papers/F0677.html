                    of Nashville we got here on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Nashville is a Purty Place and it has the appearance of being a buisness Place at one time but Buisness is suspended There now. all the stores and Buisness shops are Closed and the City is diserted of nearly all its inhabitants except the
                        Ladys and they are all secesh and wear a secesh flag for
                    Aprons and have a belt around their waists with an Ivory handled Colt Revolving
                    Pistol of the best quality sticking in it. Nashville and all the surround Country is secesh and they dont try to hide it nether we was out on Picket

                    Rebel Cavalry there was about 300 of them in all but they stayed about 200 or
                    300 yards away from our Picklet line with the
                    exceptions of 15 that dismounted and Came up to within hailing distance of our
                    Pickets they where 5 or 6 abrest as we Could judge for it was dark and the minute our Pickets <i>[deleted: they fired]</i> Challenged them they fired one volly and Retreated our men fired on them while they were Retreating
                    but with what effect we Could<sup>nt</sup> hear if there was any of them hurt they was taking along by their Comrades on our side there was no body hurt but I must say they did some tall shooting
                    for random shooting Te only guide they had was the Direction the Pickets voice

                    about 50 yards apart and the Rebels took advantage of the Distance and took 4 of
                    them off their Post in Broad day light and Caried
                    them off as Prisoners and they aint got Back yet

                    yards of the Pickets taking care to keep behind a hill that the Pickets Could<sup>nt</sup> see them when one of
                    them dismound and to hide suspicion he had on one
                    of our uniforms on so he got to the Pickets without much trouble and got talking
