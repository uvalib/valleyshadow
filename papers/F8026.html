<p class="p10">Hon Simon Cameron</p>
<p class="p10">I commenced a warfare against Col. McClure before
                    his nomination I did not expect to succeed in defeating him in the nomination
                    (beginning too late to effect that) but I knew it would <i>[deleted: be]</i>
                    assist very much in getting up considerable opposition and defeating him in
                    October in that I have succeeded so far as to make him <i>[illeg.]</i> and he
                    appears to be alarmed, he called me into his office this evening, to make an
                    explanation of <i>[deleted: any]</i> personal matters I informed him that I
                    felt disposed to drop all personal difficulties his acknowledgments, but there
                    was a greater difficulty to be settled upon which I felt more keenly than my own
                    and that was his uncalled for abuse on your private &amp; Public character
                    &amp; that I would resent it so long as he required the suffrages of the
                        people<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>for any position, he then stated that his feelings
                    &amp; course towards yourself was changed &amp; hereafter he would
                    manifest his friendship, and that he and Joseph Casey of your place had an
                    interview &amp; that all differences would be reconciled, I then stated if
                    that was the fact I would refrain from further hostility, that I was committed
                    to my friend <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: rather]</i> had <i>[unclear: this]</i> committee to a certain
                    extent, and it would be a difficult matter to back out and retain their
                    confidence but yet I would make an effort in case what he stated in refference to yourself was true, I will now say you
                    candidly &amp; frankly that if it is so understood write me by Monday
                    evening next; as our Senatorial &amp; Legislative conferees meet on Tuesday
                    next. I think I can get up a difficulty with the Fulton delegates so as to
                    operate against McClure election in October <i>[deleted: I also]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> will not neglect writing so I may shape my words, and <i>[deleted: ]</i> letters shall be as sacredly confidential as if it remained in
                    your own hands</p>
<p class="p10">your Friend truly</p>
