<h4>Franklin County: Jubal Anderson Early to [Edward A.
                    Box], [no date]<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>This excerpt from a letter gives Early's justification for the burning of
                    Chambersburg in 1864.</p>

<p class="p10">The town of Chambersburg was burned on the same day on which the demand on it was
                    made by McCausland and refused. It was ascertained that a force of the enemy's
                    cavalry was approaching, and there was no time for delay. Moreover, the refusal
                    was peremptory, and there was no reason for delay unless the demand was a mere
                    idle threat.</p>
<p class="p10">I had no knowledge of what amount of money there might be in Chambersburg. I knew
                    that it was a town of some twelve thousand inhabitants. The town of Frederick,
                    in Maryland, which was a much smaller town than Chambersburg, had in June very
                    promptly responded to my demand on it for $200,000., some of the inhabitants who
                    were friendly to me, expressing a regret that I had not made it $500,000. There
                    were one or more National Banks at Chambersburg and the town ought to have been
                    able to raise the sum I demanded. I never heard the refusal was based on the
                    inability to pay such a sum, and there was no offer to pay any sum. The value of
                    the houses destroyed by Hunter, with their contents, was fully $100,000. in
                    gold, and at the time I made the demand the price of gold in greenbacks had
                    nearly reached $3.00 and was going up rapidly. Hence it was that I required the
                    $500,000. in greenbacks, if the gold was not paid, to provide against any
                    further depreciation of the paper money.</p>
<p class="p10">I would have been fully justified by the laws of retaliation in war in burning
                    the town without giving the inhabitants the opportunity of redeeming it.</p>
