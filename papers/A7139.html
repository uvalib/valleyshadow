<p class="p10">Jan 19<sup>th</sup> 69</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">The teacher for Mt Solon came last night.  Also a letter from his brother to whom you telegraphed sending my dispatch--<u>not to come</u></p>
<p class="p10">Enclosed was also the within telegram--sent by S C Logan formerly of Charlott NC and requesting him to be sent to Charlott.</p>
<p class="p10">Knowing that Mr Logan is Employed by you and believing him to be authorized to order this change and finding that he is personally acquainted with this Gentleman the teacher ( A C Blandin).--And also being convinced that he can <u>do much more good</u> there than here under the circumstances--and particularly in consequence of the lateness of the season--therefore I have asked him to proceed to Charlott N C--and to Call at the other places named in Mr Logans dispatch</p>
<p class="p10">The man is capable.</p>
<p class="p10">I have lent him $10 to proceed with<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>  He would be glad to ask for transportation for Staunton to Charlott but I thought you could collect it afterwards as it could come only to late</p>
<p class="p10">His church will be likely to help him in Case he needs it for board--I think--as he says provided <u>you ask them</u>--1st Pres. Ch  Honesdale Pa</p>
<p class="p10">They <u>may</u> pay more than for his board</p>
