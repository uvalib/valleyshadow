<p class="p10">June 19<u>
        <sup>th</sup>
      </u> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Hd. Qrs. V. D. near
       Berryville Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote you a few days ago from near Leesburg -- after we had crossed back to Virginia --
     Sunday we came on across the Blue Ridge -- there was not flour enough in Loudoun Co. to supply
     our wants, but Clarke &amp; Jefferson have an abundance in them -- our commissary having
     100000 bushels of wheat at his command -- The Yankee cavalry found a portion of our train
     exposed to attack as we came across the Blue Ridge &amp; they fell on it &amp; captured
     &amp; destroyed some 30 or 40 wagons -- but our infantry got up &amp; punished them,
     capturing in turn a piece of artillery from the Yankees -- the wagons captured all belonged to
     the cavalry -- Imbodens were nearly all captured -- Maj. McCue <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>lost his goods in one of Imbodens wagons -- I am sorry -- for he had a great deal of
     trouble to get them I sent my bundle up to Staunton by Maj. Braithwaite -- directed to myself
     care of Maj. Bell &amp; I will write to Maj. Bell to send it to you -- I hope to be able to
     get other things before the season is over -- a great many got nothing as the people of
     Frederick purchased immunity by paying $200000, &amp; only sold if they pleased &amp;
     they required "greenbacks" -- &amp; they were hard to get -- we were not in any other place
     where there was any thing -- I will repeat the contents of my bundle so you may know if all of
     it comes -- to hand -- I enclosed it in some linen &amp; sewed it up &amp; then put it
     in a bag -- There is an overcoat along - a very nice one - which Robinson captured at Harpers
     Ferry -- take care of it -- then 7 yds. of grey cloth, for a coat &amp; pants for myself --
     1/2 doz. Hdkfs -- (2 kinds)<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>2 prs shoes -- 40 yds. dark calico 20 yds bleched cotton --
     a piece of some 8 or 10 yds -- 6 yds. of bonnet Ribbon, 1 small cravat -- 2 undershirts, 1
      pr drawers, 1 bottle of brandy -- (a present to me from Maj. Hawks,
     which I send for your use) some <i>[unclear: gents]</i> socks -- that is all I believe --
     sorry it is no more but will hope for another opportunity. </p>
<p class="p10"> Yesterday, after we thought we were fixed for a rest in camp the Yankees came on across the
     Mt. &amp; attempted to cross the Shenandoah River -- in fact they did cross, but Gen. Rodes
     fell on them &amp; compelled them to go back with considerable loss -- we had quite a hard
     fight &amp; lost quite a number of men -- The fight was at Rock's ford some 6 miles N. E. of Berryville -- Today the enemy has been demonstrating
     towards Winchester<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>trying to induce us to go away from here -- I do not know how well
     they may succeed -- they have quite a large force -- the 19<sup>th</sup> Corps that
     has been in La. has been brought up -- the 6<sup>th</sup> Corps from Grant's Army --
     then all Hunter's &amp; Siegel's forces -- some 25000 men perhaps -- but I think if we can
     induce them to fight, by God's blessing we can whip them -- It is very dry here -- the grass
     completely scrorched -- I sent my watch up by Maj. McCue -- get it
     if you have a chance -- I have sent my horses home by Geo. Horger
     to go to Mr. Geedings -- say to him I hope he will do the best he can for them in the way of
     pastures -- I am riding over this county mapping it -- am very busy &amp; tired at night --
     so do excuse this -- Love &amp; kisses &amp; blessings for you all -- Write often -- I
     just got yours of June 12<u>
      <sup>th</sup>
     </u> -- Hunter filled it up -- Good bye my sweet one </p>
<p class="p10">Your Aff. husband --</p>
