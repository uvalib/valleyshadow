<p class="p10">We were yesterday mustered into the service of the Confederate States for the war, unless
     sooner discharged, a large number volunteered -- but we made up 380 &amp; a battallion was formed &amp; put in command of Maj. Pougue who is
     the senior Major I retain the Adjutancy for the present, and may keep it after the Regiment is
     filled up from other counties -- Formed a mess today with Col Sproul &amp; Ardh<sup>d</sup>
      Christian -- they have a black boy along &amp; a white boy hired so I shall do very
     well. Gen Jackson came over to see us Friday -- he is a fine looking fellow -- Baylor mustered
     us in. Gen. Jackson moved his army back down the Valley today, the enemy having fallen back, it
     is said below Winchester on account of the reported trouble in Maryland -- we have any amount
     of Rumors, but know nothing. We have orders to march this morning at 8 o'clock -- and I have to
     go to Col. Baylors at 7 -- and have writing to do before going, so
     excuse this --. I suppose we shall go to Strasburg, but will write. Its
     cold. Good bye -- love to all -- </p>
