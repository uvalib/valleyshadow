<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, April 20, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife with the good news that his resignation has been
                    accepted and he is out of the army. He will come home as soon as he is well and
                    able. For the moment, he will not because he does not wish to take an oath of
                    loyalty to the Union. He tells his wife not to worry about confiscation of their
                    property, as everything will be sorted out after the war. He expresses the
                    opinion that the coming campaigns will decide the issue and asserts that
                    Confederate forces are in good shape and highly motivated by such issues as the
                    enlistment of black men in the Union army. He also sends messages for his
                    children.</p>

<p class="p10">April 20/64</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I again have an oppertunity by which I hope to
                    send you a few lines &amp; of course embrace it as you may be glad to hear
                    from me though not anxious to write me</p>
<p class="p10">I have just received official notice of the acceptance of my resignation
                    &amp; yesterday turned over the command of this post I now am out of office
                    (a citizen) I feel like an uncaged bird after 3 long years of close servitude I
                    now am liberated (could say more here but won<sup>t</sup>)</p>
<p class="p10">I am still much crippled up with Rheumatism am hardly able to limp about the
                    house but hope so soon as the weather clears up &amp; settles to get better.
                    I have suffered amazingly for the last 5 weeks.</p>
<p class="p10">Well I suppose the next thing you want to know is when I am coming home This I
                        can<sup>
                            <u>t</u>
                        </sup> positively say but certainly so soon as the way is open</p>
<p class="p10">I must first now try &amp; get well &amp; then arrange other matters we
                    are doing a fine business here and would much prefer having you here with me,
                    which I think can be done before long And if the way is not soon <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    open we will try &amp; make some other arrangements for the best You wrote
                    me to come home This I 
                        <sup>
                            <u>cant</u>
                        </sup>
                     do now I would be compelled to take the Oath or be imprisoned this I
                    have not concluded to do yet &amp; hope there will be no necessity for it My
                    own opinion is that there will be some heavy fighting in Va this spring &amp; that this will about end the war I trust to
                    god it may for I am sorely tired of it Our troops are in the best condition and
                    much more determined than ever known. The negro soldier seems to fire them up. I
                    think this springs campaign will settle the question
                    of subjugation</p>
<p class="p10">I hope you have gotten over the mude you were in when I
                    last heard from you it pained me so to see you so low spirited &amp;

                    plenty to live on. take care of yourself &amp; family and dont bother about the property if taken it will only be temporarily

                    now &amp; dont let any one annoy you about it all
                    will be right I still have <i>[added: full &amp;]</i>
                    plenty here to <u>keep you well</u> if all other was <u>entirely gone</u> to which I am daily trying to add. I am
                    anxious now to know the exact condition of things as I have heard <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> so
