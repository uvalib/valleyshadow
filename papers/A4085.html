<p class="p10">My Dearest One:</p>
<p class="p10">We spent last night at Winchester &amp; today are marching on toward Martinsburg,
     Shepperdstown, through the dust as usual -- it has been very warm. -- We spent the first night
     after we left Staunton at Mr. <i>[illeg.]</i>, near Mt. Crawford -- he was very unwilling for
     us to encamp on him but that did no good -- he played the churl decidedly &amp; had some
     old shrew there that made the air vocal with her croakings. We went the next night beyond Big
     Spring, to Mr Cousins -- two of the red headed damsels there had gotten married since we
     stopped there in 1862 -- the next night we went to near Mrs. Jackson, to <i>[illeg.]</i> Mt
     Airy (Moe Jordan's daughter's) -- had a good supper there -- the next day brought us to
     Strasburg &amp; yesterday to Winchester -- I took dinner at Inck's in Harrisonburg, he did
     not <i>[illeg.]</i> Mr Kinney has not succeded in paying off his debts -- John T. Hams was
     about -- the people there speak bitterly of <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; Robert Gray -- say they
     shall bring them to an account for the same -- Mr. Inck lives in H -- in P<i>[illeg.]</i>'s house. I called yesterday evening at Mr.
      <i>[unclear: Hicoronineces]</i> to thank them for their kindness to Allie -- found them at
     tea &amp; took tea there -- they are very nice people indeed &amp; they have many
     beautiful flowers -- the two daughters are at home -- they are sweet girls -- The enemys cavalry made a dash into Winchester yesterday morning <i>[deleted: ]</i> stay was short &amp; we soon came in follow<i>[illeg.]</i> -- they are much
     alarmed along the border, but do not <i>[illeg.]</i> what is coming -- we got the Baltimore
     Papers of the <i>[illeg.]</i>st yesterday -- <i>[unclear: Mr. Lincoln]</i> has passed an
     emancipate act -- Chase has <i>[unclear: issued]</i> -- I saw a <i>[illeg.]</i> from Balte -- who says gold is four for one -- We encamp tonight at
     Leetown -- 8 miles from the Potomac -- We drove the Yankees out of Martinsburg &amp; away
     from the R. R. at Kernysville Our cavalry had a fight with them
     here we had some 25 killed &amp; wounded -- The enemy does not make much resistance<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>We captured some stores &amp; they burned some -</p>
<p class="p10"> I hope you are all well -- I am, thank the Lord, in fine health - </p>
<p class="p10"> Be of good cheer &amp; may the Lord's blessing be with you -- Love &amp; kisses for
     all -- Write soon </p>
