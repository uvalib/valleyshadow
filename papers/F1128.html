<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to John Abraham
                    Rosenbery (father), March 18, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rosenbery mentions that there may be a furlough in nine months; he also expects
                    to be paid shortly. He hopes for war's end, and, as in earlier letters, he tells
                    his father that he will meet him in heaven, if he does not survive the war.</p>

<p class="p10">March, 18, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Stephensburg, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father,</p>
<p class="p10">I seat down to inform you that I am hoping that these few lines finds you all
                    enjoying the blessing of health.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been looking for some time for a letter from you....But in Vain.</p>
<p class="p10">I expected my watch as you mentioned in your last letter that I received from you
                    that you intended to send it by express. But it has not come yet. I mentioned in
                    my letter some time ago that you need not send it if you have not-you not send
                    it till orders.</p>
<p class="p10">The talk is that we will soon get paide off again. There
                    is still some talk of us furloughed in 9 months and there is some talk or rather
                    Our Regiment going back to Guard Duty but I can't see it.</p>
<p class="p10">Did I tell you that Simon Shuman is in our Regiment-the one that helped to
                    plaster our house.</p>
<p class="p10">I will send you a letter that I got from Brother A.
                    and Ashway. They think in 16 months more they will be roosting for some time.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope the war will soon come to an end. I feel very well satisfied her and I presume that if I were at home I would be very
                    satisfied.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, I want you to feel contented about me. If I never get home try to meet me
                    in Heaven.</p>
<p class="p10">Write often as you can. I have no news to write at present. As soon as I get
                        paide I will sende you some
                    money.</p>
<p class="p10">My respects to all--<br> So farewell until the next time,<br> Yours
                        truly,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
