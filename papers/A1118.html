<p class="p10">March 7<sup>
                                <u>th</u></sup>, 1867</p>
<p class="p10">A. T. Seminary<br> Staunton V<sup><u>a</u></sup></p>
<p class="p10">My dear sister</p>
<p class="p10">I have been waiting for you to write to me about long enough, but it does seem
                    like you ain't a going to do it Well in the first place I am very well &amp;
                    will tell you how well your old sister did in examination yesterday. she passed
                    third best. I think I was doing very well when I got 90, considering the hard
                    examination. &amp; only 5 of us passed. There were 4 examinations on hands
                    yesterday. &amp; the girls all <u>dis</u>tinguished
                    themselves out of pretty near the whole school only 10 passed. Luce got 76 on
                    her Geom. we have two more books to study yet
                    before the final examination &amp; then all will stand together. Did you
                    ever in all your days see such weather not a single ray of sunshine for a week.
                    Mary Smiths party comes off tomorrow night. I believe
                    there are about 200 people to be there. The roads are so bad. the girls are
                    afraid she cannot send for them I believe there are twelve going from here.
                    &amp; if she dont send for them it will be a great
                    disappointment to some of them. Grandma has been sick for about a month. I dont think she is getting any better. M<sup>
                        <u>rs</u>
                    </sup> Waddell has been here for about two weeks. she went home Monday &amp;
                    Kattie went too, she had been sleeping in our room for a while. Has Bettie
                        <i>[unclear: Echard]</i> got home from her trip yet. I reckon she would
                    have a fine time &amp; in the end will go to Albermarle to live. Heard Bil
                    Anderson &amp; <i>[unclear: Kip]</i> Gullin were to be married at last:
                    reckon Becca would get to that wedding. has she been down<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to see you
                    yet? Give my love to her and tell her our old roomate Margaret Ann Louise hasn't
                    written to us yet; but that we heard she was flying around generally with the
                    boys. &amp; wonder if <u>she</u> is doing the same. We
                    had a stranger on the table to-day. all the way to
                    three turkeys, were <u>powerful</u> glad to see them. Lucy
                    &amp; Mary are going <i>[deleted: t]</i>home the last of March if the
                    roads are not too bad, I expect Annie Fulton will go with them if she does, she
                    will go down to see you. I dont care about going home
                    quite <i>[added: so]</i> soon, but will leave it to you all,
                        <i>[deleted: jus]</i> I am about as near out of clothes as people
                    generally get. when you send my clothes please send me some yarn to knit: I
                    think it is <i>[added: in]</i> that trunk up stairs. You see I want to have something to work at
                    on Saturday night when I go into the parlor to hear D<sup>r</sup>. Brown read. They didn't make much at their
                    concerts, <i>[added: here]</i> it was raining so that no one
                    could come. A quartette went from here over to Charlottesville the same week to
                    assist in a concert there. I believe they made about $500 clear there. I had
                    thought I would get a letter this morning; but it seems I was doomed to
                    disappointment. The girls have all gone to Mary Smiths at last I think Miss B ought to give us a holiday. Now if you
                        dont write to me soon, you had better. My love to
                    all.</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate sister</p>
<p class="p10"><i>L. R Smiley</i></p>
<p class="p10">Lucy got a letter from Mag this morning, she is suffering
                        with a felon her finger.</p>
