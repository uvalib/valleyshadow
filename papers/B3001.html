<p class="p10">My Dear General</p>
<p class="p10">I shall perhaps astonish you, but am sorry if it should in any way disturb you to say that I
     wish to leave your district and subsequently the service. I gave you a hint of this when last I
     saw you. No, not the <u>last</u>, but, the time before that. When I told you
     that I had <i>[unclear: met]</i> the one for whom I had long <i>[unclear: been]</i> seeking,
     and who was to go with me <u>through</u>
     <u>life</u>. It happens that <u>we</u> want to leave this
     part of the world about the first of June <i>[deleted: to the ----- to selt--i-- happiness in
      the Fall.]</i>
     <i>[added: guess at this]</i> So I wish you would provide a succession for
     this District and have me ordered to report from my place of residence, and should like this to
     occur between the 13th and 25th of May next. Can you manage it for me?</p>
<p class="p10">Lt. Col. Neide was here on Friday and I having just
     then decided the matter spoke of it to him and recommended Maj Carse
     as I now do to you for the position. After consultation with <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Maj Carse I found that he would quite as <i>[unclear: like]</i> remain where he is,
     and be perhaps more useful there. I could command no one else.</p>
<p class="p10">I have <i>[unclear: real]</i> regret in leaving you to whom I am so much indebted for
     kindess and consideration and with whom I have served so pleasantly, and shall hold myself
     always ready to give "<u>three times three</u>" at the mention of a name I
     know so well, and send you good wishes <i>[unclear: with]</i> bright hopes for present and
     future happiness.</p>
<p class="p10">Please tell me <i>[added: now]</i> what you think and can do</p>
<p class="p10">believing me yours sincerely and fraternally</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W. Storer How<br>Bvt Maj
      <i>[illeg.]</i></i></p>
