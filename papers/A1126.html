<h4>Augusta County: Unkown to Unkown, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Writings (perhaps a speech) by an unknown author, consisting of reflections about
                    the year 1865 and the feelings surrounding the "parting of schoolgirls." Several
                    large pieces of the paper are missing, including a rough square about 3" across
                    by 1.5" high on the bottom left of the first page; this, of course, means a
                    similar section is missing on the second page, which is truly the back of the
                    first. A long strip seems to have been ripped off of the bottom of the final
                    page. </p>

<p class="p10">Among the many sad changes that have taken place in our broad land in one short
                    year, to us the saddest is, our separation. At a time like this when our country
                    is shrouded in gloom, when so many heart-rending scenes have been witnessed,
                    when bitter tears are gushing forth from eyes unused to weep, to some the
                    parting of schoolgirls might seems so insignificant as not even to deserve a
                    passing remark. To us it is different; we feel it, oh! how deeply we feel it,
                    may be seen by the many sad attentive countenances that now surround me: and
                    still more plainly have we seen it in the gentle words and looks of the last few
                    weeks. The very thought of parting seemed to soften each
                    <i>[unclear: tone]</i>, and melt each breast, all past wrongs and injuries were
                    forgotten, each <i>[unclear: caused]</i> to forget her own case and comfort as
                    she eagerly sought the welfare of her compranion, remembering as she did so only
                    her good qualities, and the many pleasant scenes through which they had passed
                    together. A few months ago we met in this hall as strangers. And well we
                    remember that feeling of loneliness, that longing for home, which at first would
                    steal over us causing us to feel as sad and lonely as it was possible for
                    strangers to feel. But when at last our house was full, all restraint was
                    banished, and it was then that our happiness began to show [missing section]
                    bright faces of our little circle. [missing section] possible to feel lonely or

<p class="p10">The many pleasant remembrances of the blissful past will follow us through life!
                    How long will our memories dwell with rapture upon the gay winter evenings when
                    we gathered all around the firewood and so attentively listened to the reading
                    of some interesting book, that the dismal howling of the stormy wind, as it
                    mournfully swept through the deserted streets, scarcely reached our cars. The
                    dreary days of winter glided as quietly and swiftly by, that nothing intervened
                    but what seemed to concur in bringing some pleasure, some enjoyment, to animate
                    and kindle hope, was in the heart of the most cheerless. Can we ever forget the
                    merry old times we have had in the hall together, the many delightful walks we
                    have taken, and all those pleasures which ever throw a charm around school life?
                    No! each spot is consecratad by the remembrance of some pleasant scene that
                    occurred there, and our hearts will be forever bound to these old familiar walls
                    by all the endearing recollections of you. It was in this spot that those tender
                    ties which bind friend<i>[deleted: s]</i> to friend were first formed and
                    that pure and lasting friendship which will ever be remembered by us as pilgrims
                    remember the flowing fountain in the burning sands of the desert. Though the
                    life of a school girls may have some crosses, some inconveniences, yet it may be
                    truly said that the hours spent at [missing section] period of our lives. We may

                    changes must [missing section] stern, old age have some [missing section] when
                    the hair has turned [missing section] have give up their brightness [missing
                        section]<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> blasted and our hearts have been seared and blighted by
                    contact with the <u>deceitful</u>, outer world, then, oh!
                    then will we look back upon the happy days spent at school and sigh bitterly
                    that they can come no more. But while my heart would fain linger over those
                    endearing charms which ever throw a fragrance over the pleasant retreat and the
                    many dear friends tht we have formed there, time is hurrying us on and I must
                    muster to close. A few hours more the last farewell will have been spoken and we
                    will be travelling here and there, scattering far and wide, returning to the
                    loved ones at home. Some of us expect to return after vacation. Others of you go
                    hence to return no more, certain it is that we will never all meet here again.</p>
<p class="p10">I know that our minds have been improved by our short sojourn here, and that we
                    are better fitted to <i>[unclear: aslorn]</i> society and <i>[deleted: that
                        we]</i> to enjoy all the refined pleasures of literature. Can I not say
                    that our hearts have kept pace with our minds, that they [missing section] forth
                    into the world, purer, [missing section] <i>[unclear: which]</i> we may be
