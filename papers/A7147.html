<p class="p10">Feb 20 1869</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 18<sup>th</sup> came last night.</p>
<p class="p10">I am glad you will furnish the $30 for whether we ever return to this place or not, this little school building will be of the greatest use always or at least till the people can build a large house which will not be soon so far as things appear at present.  I will now endeavor to hurry this building as fast as I can</p>
<p class="p10">Some time ago I asked the address of Mr Smith with a view of asking him to come through Staunton that I might have his counsel in regard to what is best to do for a School House and Mission House, and to advise about<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> continuing our operations next year--I should still like to see him Yet as the people have purchases a large plot of ground on which to bury their dead it is not likely that they will get out of debt sufficiently to do anything about building a Mission House; and if they did they would be likely as they own the ground to claim full right to controll the building  So I don't see as Mr Smith could do much good if he came now, since it is already determined to build this little school house, and his time and money may be of more use somewhere else</p>
<p class="p10">Nevertheless I should like to see him, and his coming would do no harm and might do good.</p>
<p class="p10">Miss Burke says she would still like the "N Y Independent" to read.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Scott</i></p>
