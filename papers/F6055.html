<p class="p10">July the 5" 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Niar Alexandria VA</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I sit me down to answer your verey
     kinde letter wich I just received this
     morning. I was truly glad to hear that the children ware all well, but
     sorry to hear that you ware not well, but I hope you are well now, and
     do hope you all may remain in good health till I get hom, for it hurts me to hear that you or enny of the
     children are not well, and that I can not be there to see after you
     see that you get the attendance that you need, but I hope if you are not well that we have some
      freinds, but donte let trobble be your complaint I dont want you<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to trobble yourself about me not geting home for
     thats all wright I think I'<sup>ll</sup> get home pretty
     soon I think in two weeks from now I'll be at home if not before, the order is ishuede to muster us out as soon as they can so it must hit us some time before long, and if you can make shift without money till then I'<sup>ll</sup> not risk to send enny, some sends there money home in letters but there is so
      maney letters goes astray that I think id
     better carry it myself I do not think it will be enny longer than that
      till I will get home that money that I got from the butter man just
     let that stand as it is till I get home myself and then I'<sup>ll</sup> settle with him, and if you can shift without going to town till I get home do so then you can buy all you neede and I'<sup>ll</sup> take you in wright<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>away. so George W Foper thought he had better save his life and loose his money, but the scriptur says he that saveth his
     life shall loose it, I think that was A nice cowardly off come for
     Poper so that the people would give him wright in leaving, but I think
     he had better stade and got his pay and an onerable discharge wich he had so dearly earned for its
     something that may be throwed up to him and perhaps to his children, I always said that Id stay till I got that and if they would keepe me till my time was up, I have had no
     letter from Mr Keller yet I wrote to him before we left goldsboro and have no answer yet but
     the next one I write he'<sup>ll</sup> answer I give him my adress if I mistake not but he neglcted
     writeing so long that he thought that would hardly do enny more<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> he requested me to write and I did so and of corse I looked for him to to reply, but its hardly worth his while to
      comenc to write now enny mor for if he
     waits about two weeks more he can talk to me if he has enny thing
     to say for him self, I'm glad you got the hay made, tell Abraham I
     am very thankfull to him that he sees that you have plenty of flour
     and feede and he shall furnish you with fower
     and feed till I get home, and then I'<sup>ll</sup> pay
     all and I want you to feed your hogs pretty well so that they make good hogs till fall, when you write again tell me where you put your hay and how
     the hogs looks, you stated in your letter that I should not let myself be led into bad habbits you dont
     neede to be affraid god knows the army would
     never corrupt my morrols I believe the longe I am in the army the more morrol I get. for there is so
     much hard swarring and all kinds of bad works going on in the army
     that I get so disgusted against it so that it make me think about chaing my way of living and do better, you know that when I came home from the army
     before I did not <i>[unclear: Swe]</i> half as much as I did when I left but sorry to say
      that<br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br> got pretty well in the hang of swaring again
     before I left and swore by times yet if I get provoked but I hope god may give me grace to
      over come all such bad habits for we are raising A family and I do
     think we ought to chang our way of living for I finde in the testement what responcibility
     lise upon the parents I read the criptures
     daly now and you do so to and I hope we may be profited by it religion
     is what we all ought to have thats the only thing that is shure, I
      ofton
     studdy and consult my self about and I hope
     that I may hve to studdy and have no rest
      till I take holde of the work
     wright I think the best we can do is to cerch the cripture and try to get an understanding of it
     for that our guide, and the only<br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br> true guide we have god grant that we may take holde of the work write before it is to late, I'<sup>ll</sup> soon have to stop for I'<sup>ll</sup> soon have to go on gard you must excuse this bad writing for I must write in A hurry for I am
     on gard
     to day and must write inbetwene the reliefes but I hope I'<sup>ll</sup> not have many letter to
     write till I get home for the prospects are good the day our muster
     out rooles are here now to be made out but I dont know wether thats correct or not. but our mager said this hole division would be mustered
     out in side of two weeks and I hope it may be true, for god knows
     that I am anxious to get home I'<sup>ll</sup> now close telling you that I am well
     and do hope this will you all the same,</p>
<p class="p10">so much from ever loving husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>David Hafer</i></p>
<p class="p10">good bye write as soon as you get this<br> I for
      got about uncle Wall I can not tell you where is but he is
      discharged and I suppose he is at home<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 7</i>]<br></p> I did not get this letter backed and sealed
       till I had to go on poste so I'<sup>ll</sup> put A few words more in I said I did not know wheather it was true about the musterout being here but its tru enough they are hear and they will go to work in the
      morning, I'<sup>ll</sup> stop </p>
