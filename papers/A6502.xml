                <p>J. M. McCue writes Lorenzo Sibert to inform him of losses he sustained because of
                    a hail storm and complain that money he sent through the mail was lost. He also
                    discusses Jackson's campaign in the Valley, fighting before Richmond, saltpeter
                    production, the prospect of Federal victories, and mutual friends. In a notable
                    incident, a letter to a cousin in the Union army from Ms. Pillsberry of New
                    Hampshire, who once stayed with the Siberts, was found in the streets of
                    Winchester and forwarded on to McCue.</p>

                    in to expend--pay out--disburse--distribute--create debts and never get
                    re-imbursed. I am in no happy mood this morning 'tis true--Returned after dark,
                    last night from Richmond--where I went on the 25 May--and to find my entire crop
                    of wheat--the most promising I have had for years--Totally destroyed--by a hail
                    storm on this evening a week ago--also my fruit and trees injured--corn washed
                    out, land seriously damaged glass broken--in short have sustained a damage of
                    $3000. What is worse still the infernal Vandal yankees again almost at our
                    doors. Jackson has had to fall back rapidly before the forces of Fremont
                    &amp; Millroy from towards Romney &amp; from Shields &amp; Gary from
                    Front Royal, and the latter are now at Conrad' Store &amp; the former at
                    Harrisonburg or just before whilst Jackson with his large train of wagons with
                    the stores &amp; supplies &amp;c captured, with 2300 prisoners is near
                    Mt. Crawford &amp; the river higher than it has been for 40 years &amp;
                    bridges all gone there &amp; at Bridgewater--If he has to fall back to
                    Staunton we may all be over-run yet--when we falttered ourselves two weeks

                    we fear in groin &amp; arm and a third wound I do not remember where. Fight
                    has not been renewed since--I dont know why--but as we are said to have 105,000
                    to 90,000 of the enemy, I dont know why--as all seemed to be sanguine in Richm'd
                    that we are strong enough to whip them. The city calm &amp; quiet and no
                    excitement and not a large number of the citizens had left. Gen<hi rend="super"

                    amounting to about 10,000--and he thinks he is strong enough to clear out the
                    Kenawha Valley. In the fighting down the Valley our loss was comparatively small
                        <pb n="3"/> and no one from <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> neighborhood in the number,
                    that I know of. Your son Jno. was well a few days ago from this circumstance.
                    Last night on my return I found a half <abbr expan="dozen">doz.</abbr> letters,
                    among which was one sent me by Jno. E. Hamilton from Winchester, containing a
                    letter picked up in the streets containing this endorsement. "Thinking perhaps
                    this would be interesting to you, I send it to you. I found it in the street of
                    Winchester. yours Jno. E. Hamilton and on the other side he says young Mr Sibert
                    wishes his Mother to see this. The letter is postmarked Boscawen N. H. May <del

                    Miss Pillsberry. She calls him <abbr expan="cousin">coz.</abbr> Ned, and says in
                    one paragraph "The vicinity in which you are gave me a very pleasant home for a
                    year or two, and it seems like losing old friends (I spell <hi rend="underline"
                        >losing</hi> as she does--who has been a teacher all her life) to hear of
                    devastation going on there. I wish I could know if McCue, Sibert, Van Lear,
                    Hoover, Baylor and a long list more are names in arms to oppose our troops
                    &amp;c" In another she says "George has just come in to tea &amp; says
                    give my respect to the soldier and tell him to get me some <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    buttons. He is making a collection of the various kinds of buttons ancient
                    &amp; modern &amp;c." I doubt not her interesting relative has had good
                    chance to collect or will have good chances--as I doubt not he is one of the
                    prisoners taken by our men, as almost all the Vermont Cavalry was taken, and are
                        <orig reg="today">to day</orig> being made to cross the unbridged &amp;
                    swollen run at Mt. Crawford on their march to Staunton from which place he will
                    be sent somewhere South via Lynchburg. I intend to answer Miss Pillsberry letter
                    and send it to Harrisonburg, in the hope if the enemy will come so far--that it
                    can be mailed there--and she will get it--and I guess the reply will be one
                    somewhat different from what she anticipated. I will send the letter on directly
                    to your family--I <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> last night two letters

                    Is he any more honest than he ought to be? Is there any intimacy between him and
                    Ross--if so there may be some collusion between them and both will know my
                    hand-write--and hence may rob &amp; share the profits. I would like to know
                    all about it, as I do not feel like sustaining this loss. I do feel <orig
                        reg="disappointed">dissappointed</orig> at the small yield of saltpetre
                        <unclear>per</unclear> day of 30 pounds--as I think it a poor, unpaying
                    business. I have felt so badly about the manufacture that I had not <del
                        hand="h1"/> to go to the nitre bureau when I was in Richmond as I had no
                    information before--I could communicate, and have felt so much mortified at our
                    failure as I regard it, that I did not want to see them--Instead of our ability
                    to send in a few thousand pounds as I had hoped--to pay off our indebtedness <hi
                        rend="underline">first</hi>, to find <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> &amp; 30 pounds
                    going into the hands of the agent--to draw the pittance necessary to eke out a
                    miserable existence at the establishment--was more than I had the face to stand.
                    I feel so discouraged I do not know what to say. I some time since had Chas.
