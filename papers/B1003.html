<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: George T. Cook to R. S.
                    Lacey, July 31, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Cook's report talks about the inability of free blacks to receive fair trials, as
                    well as the local population's desire to keep freedmen "in their proper place."
                    Cook fears that justice will not be possible until attitudes change. </p>

<p class="p10">July 31<sup>st</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to make the following report of Bureau Affairs in this Sub-Dist.
                </p>
<p class="p10">There seems to be a growing spirit among the whites of resolve to keep the
                    freedpeople "in their proper place" as they term it, or in other words to keep
                    them as nearly as possible to their former state of servitude. Assaults have
                    been quite frequent and the Magistrates to whom the cases are referred for trial
                    do not give impartial decisions - the trials during the past month have resulted
                    unfavorably to the freedmen. I have talked the subject over with the Judge of
                    the Augusta Co. Court Common Wealth
                    Atty, and others, and feel convinced that it will
                    be impossible to get just decisions before Magistrates until the sentiment of
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>the people changes. The Magistrates holding office as a mere
                    honorary title will not give decisions contrary to the sentiment of the
                    communities in which they live, and until these preliminary trials are properly
                    conducted, the Freedmen cannot get justice.</p>
<p class="p10">Grand Jurors have in a very aggravated case refused to indite - the case has been duly reported. </p>
<p class="p10">Freedpeople have conducted themselves well during the month, labor has been in
                    good demand.</p>
<p class="p10">I have registered since last report in compliance with Circular No. 11 C.S. 37 Couples and 144 children making a total
                    of 758 couples and 213 children in the Co. of
                    Augusta.</p>
