<h4>Augusta County: C. E. Dewey to Samuel Hunt, January 31, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rather than provide a formal report for the month of January, Dewey offers Hunt what she terms a "written chat about matters + things in Staunton."  Among the many issues discussed, Dewey elaborates on her large class sizes and the laudable attendance record and behavior patterns of her students.  Commenting on Southern whites' changing perception of the freedmen's schools in Staunton, Dewey argues that though the AMA teachers are "without military protection we have had no trouble + I think the feeling towards 'Nigger Teachers' the little which we have the honor to receive, grows less bitter every day."

<p class="p10">Jan'y 31<sup>st</sup>/66</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mr. Hunt</p>
<p class="p10">I believe it will be much easier to write if I call this, instead of a report, a written chat about matters + things in Staunton + especially that part of it bounded by the four walls that incloses the "Whiting" School.  As I wrote you that I expected, my school has doubled its numbers since Christmas.  My day school, I mean my night school is not so full.  I began the month with sixteen scholars + today I had forty-eight. new scholars are added every day, + as few have been through the whole month, that must account for the <i>[illeg.]</i> of my average.  They are quite regular in their attendance of all that have been there for the last two weeks twenty one have not been absent at all, + few have been tardy more than once during the month  When<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I reach the school in the morning, I find my children all in their seats, either studying or with folded hands + as quiet + orderly as if I had been present.  I asked them one day who had told them to get in order thinking Mr Scott might have been up stairs, but they replied quite proudly "Nobody!  We's got ourselves in order."  My scholars as you will see number among them very few boys + of course are much easier to govern than Miss Williams department which is entirely without the civilizing influence of the gentler sex.  I have had but one serious case of discipline this month.  The girl a <i>[unclear: quadroon]</i> has tried my patience in every conceivable way ever since the school first commenced.  I have tried every way to win, at least, her obedience, but in vain + yesterday after deliberation, I suspended her from school for two weeks.  I think she felt it, for she seems fond of school though too lazy and vicious to learn much, + the discipline exercises,<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> will have a good effect on all the <i>[deleted: school]</i> rest.  I have one day scholar, a woman, who walks six miles to school, + back every day.  We have had some very stormy or muddy days when she is not able to get to school, but she is generally in her place + <u>never</u> late.  She is much interested in her book + told me she would be willing to walk twice as far for the privilege of learning.  The scholars both night + day are improving very fast + do not seem to lose their interest in school though the first novelty has worn off, + for myself I can truly say.  I love my work, as well as my people, far better than I did when I began.</p>
<p class="p10">Our night schools are none of them so full as they were before Christmas, but I have had as many as forty-seven one evening + always have <u>quite</u> enough to keep me busy through the session.  Since Christmas I have taken time to close with religious exercises, the people seem to like it + I think<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> I can detect signs of special religious interest here.  I have had conversations of a personal character with several + found their hearts very tender + some really in earnest in seeking the Saviour.  The morals of these people, like the colored race everywhere, are much worse than their religion + whenever I have an opportunity  I give advice on this subject feeling it equally necessary with <u>religious</u> advice.</p>
<p class="p10">Though we are without military protection we have had no trouble + I think the feeling towards "Nigger Teachers" the little which we have the honor to receive, grows less bitter every day.  One white lady, the former mistress of one of my night scholars has several times sent me kind messages + once or twice slight tokens of regard.  She is an invalid + lives too far out of town to visit us but she has invited us to come + see her.  Some of the ladies have even taken the trouble to write excuses when they were obliged to keep their hired people out of school.  And now Mr Hunt one word about that box of mine.  It was started from home (Auburn N. Y.) before Christmas directed to Mr. Tukey care C. L. C. Brown, via 61 John St. N. Y. Is it with you?  If so wont you <u>please</u> send it on immediately?  I want my own box, for there are things in it which I<br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br> have ordered and promised to the people here + they are much needed.  I have been expecting it for several weeks + the people come to me every few days with new pitiful stories + ask hasn't your box come yet?"  We want <u>two</u> boxes really + I suppose we could easily dispose of <u>five</u>--but If I can only have my own I wont complain.</p>
<p class="p10">Very truly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>C. E. Dewey</i></p>
