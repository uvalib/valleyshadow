James White to James Brooks, July 16, 1861

</b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">July 16, 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester,
Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">I am compelled from want of pen and ink to write a line in
pencil&#8212;seizing a moment now I may not have it half hour hence.  It is
my painful duty to inform you that your son William
died today after an illness of several days which appeared to me
something like conjestion
 of the brain.  Our brigade has been very much
exposed by forced marches through heat and dust, and by being compelled
to camp out at night without tents, not even the superior officers being
allowed to carry tents from the difficulty of transportation.<a href="#n1">[1]</a>
I suppose
it would be most agreeable to the feelings of yourself and your boy's
mother that his remains should be taken at once to his home, but we have
been

<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Bro1g16t.jpg"><center><img src="images/Bro1g16t.gif"></center></a><br><br>

drawn up
in line of battle this evening<a href="#n2">[2]</a>
and on application to our colonel<a href="#n3">[3]</a> he
assured me that it would be impossible to get permission from
Gen.
Johnston<a href="#n4">[4]</a>
for any one to leave at this time, and I ascertained that
permission had been refused to remove the remains of Lieutenant Patton<a href="#n5">[5]</a>
of the Rockbridge Grays who died this morning.
And although I had with
considerable difficulty made arrangements for
William's transportation
before speaking to Col.
Preston, I felt forced to abandon it, and have
provided for his decent interment in the Episcopal Cemetery here and
have directed <i>[added: a]</i> head board with his name to be provided
 so that at
some subsequent time his remains may be removed to the bosom of his
friends.  When I discovered that William was sick
I had

<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/Bro1g16s.jpg"><center><img src="images/Bro1g16s.gif"></center></a><br><br>

him taken to the
Hospital in Winchester which is in Charge of
M. H. Houston, formerly of
Rockbridge, late of Wheeling, where every attention possible under the
circumstances was provided.  I have done the best I could my dear Sir
and in communicating with the stricken parents of the most admirable
young man, it is but the simplest justice to say that whether as student
or soldier, I had nothing to complain of him, but believe in my
conscience that he did his duty modestly and conscientiously on every
occasion.  Your son Andrew has just mentioned
that the physician thought
the disease of his brother was spinal <i>[unclear: ]</i>to the
brain.<a href="#n6">[6]</a>
Excuse
the unavoidable haste of this letter, for I am hurried in every way
imaginable.

<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>

We are expecting the enemy here at any moment and I believe
that we are able to meet them.  With assurances of kind regards and
sincere sympathy.
</p>
<p class="p10">yours respectfully,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>James J. White</i></p>
<p class="p10">
Post Script Monday Morning:  I have sent my brother
<a href="#n7">[7]</a>
this
morning to ask Rev.
Mr. Graham to meet us at the Hospital at 10:00
o'clock to conduct such religious service as may be practicable.

<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> Colonel Thomas Jackson was the officer in charge of
the Virginia troops who gathered in the Valley in late spring/early
summer of 1861.  Not only did the soliders
endure grueling drills, but they did not
have adequate supplies&#8212;particlarly clothing and tents&#8212;which led to
widespread sickness among the regiments (Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia
Infantry</i>, 3-4).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a> Here White refers to the impending First Battle of
Manassas. On July 18, the troops were ordered to abandon Winchester and
head east across the Blue Ridge Mountains. On Sunday, July 21, Jackson's
troops engaged the Federals at Manassas (Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia
Infantry</i>, 5-7).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> Colonel James F. Preston was in charge of the Fourth
Virginia Infantry when it was organized. However, his poor health kept
him in Richmond while his troops were drilling in the Valley. Wounded at
First Manassas, he later died in January, 1862 at home (Robertson,
<i>Fourth Virginia Infantry</i>, 2, 68).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> General Joseph E. Johnston (1807-1891) received his
diploma from the U. S. Miltary Academy in 1829 along with his friend
Robert E. Lee.  He received praise for his service in both the Mexican
War and in the wars against the Seminole Indians.  In April of 1861, he
resigned from his position as a brigadier general in the U. S. Army, and
in May of 1861 accepted a commission as a brigadier general in the
Confederate Army.  He commanded the Army of the Shenandoah at Harper's
Ferry and led Confederate forces at First Manassas, August 1861
(McMurry, 859-61).  </p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n5">[5]</a> William Patton, a merchant, had joined the Rockbrige
Grays (Company H) as Second Lieutenant in April of 1861. Like William
Brooks, he died on July 16 of 1861 at Winchester. His remains are now
buried at Timber Ridge Presbyterian Church in Rockbridge County
(Robertson, <i>Fourth Virginia Infantry</i>, 67).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n6">[6]</a> See Andrew's letter to his mother of July 16, 1861,
reporting that William is very ill.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n7">[7]</a> Hugh Augustus White (1840-1862), whose brother James
was Company I's first captain, enlisted in the 4th Virginia Infantry
while a student at Washington College.
On September 13, 1861, Hugh White was named sergeant, and on April
21, 1862, he was elected captain.  Surprised that he
was elected captain, Hugh White accepted the position with a great sense
of responsibility.  As he wrote to his brother Henry, "Promotion in
itself brings neither peace nor happiness, and unless it increases one's
usefulness it is a curse.  An opportunity is now afforded for exercising
a wider influence for good, and if enabled to improve this aright I
shall then be happier than before" (quoted by Bean, 111).  White was
killed on August 30, 1862 at Second Manassas (Robertson, <i>4th Virginia
Infantry</i>, 80).
