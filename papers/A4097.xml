    <p>We are again after the enemy, moved yesterday from Waynesboro to this place &amp; today
     we are resting -- Keeping the Sabbath for once -- so I hope good may come of it -- We routed
     the Yankee Cavalry at Waynesboro, quite handsomely &amp; they retreated pell mell through
     Staunton &amp; by the way of Spring Hill &amp; Mossy Creek to Bridgewater, going in
     such haste that they did no damage, only tearing up the little bridges, for fear of the 10 men
     that followed them I send Mr. Robinson over to take my coat &amp; look after other things
     -- I send you $50, by him -- Have Miss Susan make my coat as soon as possible &amp; write
     me when I can send for it -- the one I have is coming to pieces rapidly -- have the coat lined
      <pb n="2"/><hi rend="underline">throughout</hi>, deep and strong pockets (you will have to
     send some of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> cloth for them I reckon) -- I want two pockets behind
     &amp; one on each side -- wide &amp; deep -- the left hand one on the outside, the
     right hand one on the inside -- keep the small buttons -- I do not want any on the sleeves --
     ask Miss Susan if she cannot <hi rend="underline">turn</hi> the coat I am wearing -- there is a
     tailor here that does it. Please send my Jacket to me by Mr. R. he will tell you all the news
     -- &amp;c Nelly gave him a hard account of "Pa." I am sorry he is getting so bad -- Get all
     your flour home as soon as you can -- I fear it is going to be scarce, so much wheat was burned
     -- Ask Mr. Geeding if he cannot spare me a load of his hay -- the government will get it all
     any way -- &amp; I will pay him the same -- <pb n="3"/>I send you some papers - read them
     &amp; send them up to Mrs. Wise to see, for <hi rend="underline">me</hi> -- tell Mrs.
     Stubblefield I saw her husband a few days ago &amp; he was well -- The Yanks burned J. C.
     Roler's barn &amp; stable -- I hope we shall soon be able to turn the tide on them -- I
     would come home today but I have only one horse to ride &amp; it needs rest -- &amp; we
     are so busy now &amp; the Gen. depends on me for routes &amp;c in this region so I
     cannot leave just now, but hope to get home again before long -- the Lord hasten the time when
     I may be able to stay there -- I send you a fine Spencer Rifle - - a present from Mr. Robinson
     -- just what you have wanted -- be careful of it &amp; keep it hid -- <orig reg="don't"
      >dont</orig> let it be known that you have it <pb n="4"/>Love &amp; kisses for the
     children Good bye my Love &amp; God bless your dear soul -- </p>
