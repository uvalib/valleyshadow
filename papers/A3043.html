<p class="p10">Resignation under Trials &amp; Afflictions.<br> Trials &amp; afflictions
                    are common to every age, state, &amp; degree, of mankind, childhood, youth,
                    &amp; oldage all have their turn. We often meet
                    with trials &amp; afflictions, both at home &amp; abroad, but
                        <i>[unclear: we]</i> should try and be submissive under them all. Even when
                    we are at school, and our lessons very long, or hard to learn, (especially when
                    we have them to <i>[unclear: learn]</i> over) we think it quite a hard task;
                    but these are small trials, in comparison with many others which we meet with,
                    while on our journey through life.</p>
<p class="p10">To alleviate our afflictions we ought to reflect how much more miserable we might
                    be than what we are. Tis true we have to encounter many severe afflic<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>tions, such as being visited by the messenger of death, and a great many
                    others; what a trial this is to part with one of our <u>nearest</u> and <u>dearest</u> friends, but when we
                        considder that it is our heavenly Father's will,
                    we should be submissive, and try to be prepared for meeting them in a better
                    world where afflictions and sorrows never enter. The chief source of consolation
                    should be that all our afflictions are known by God, and appointed by him.</p>
