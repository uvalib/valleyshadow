<p class="p10">September 26<sup>th</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Culpeper Va </p>
<p class="p10">
                        <u>Dear</u>
                        <u>John</u>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 22<sup>d</sup> &amp; 23<sup>d</sup> were
                    duly received one yesterday and one today. I will not promise you a long letter
                    in return as there is nothing going on here worth writing about. </p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday's papers brought us news of Roscrans
                    defeat. I was beginning to hope that our Army in the South west would be
                    successful, but now the worst is known, and we must make up our minds to make
                    the best of what I take to be a pretty severe flogging. Still I do not despair
                    of something turning up that may <i>[unclear: 
                        find
                    ]</i> to <i>[unclear: 
                        nulligate
                    ]</i> the disaster. </p>
<p class="p10">I think it was Lieut Walkenshan, formerly of the
                        9<sup>th</sup> and not Capt
                    Ballentine that received the appointment of Major on McDowel's staff in <i>[unclear: 
                        Kansas
                    ]</i>. Capt
                    B is now with the Regiment, and knows nothing of
                    said promotion falling to <i>[unclear: 
                        his
                    ]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: 
                        lot
                    ]</i>. I heard that Lieut.
                    W. had received such an appointment.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">If Lieut Hawkins only leaves Pittsburgh to day, he intends making the most of his leave of
                    absence. It was only for ten days in the first place, and it will be two weeks
                    tomorrow, since he left Camp. </p>
<p class="p10">Our Chaplain Rev McFarland left us to day. He was mustered out of the service, because of
                    the letters he wrote to the "Presbyterian." We are sorry to part with him, as he
                    was a very consistent and conscientious man, but the powers that be ordained
                    that he should leave. He will go to Washington and Philadelphia and probably in
                    the course of a week or two will be in Pittsburgh. He has promised call up at
                    the house. I sent <i>[illeg.]</i> home a "package of <u>old</u>
                    <u>letters</u>" which I wish you to put away. I also sent
                    that "locket" for fear it might get lost in our marching around. The "<i>[unclear: 
                        mark
                    ]</i>" accompanying it is one Sergt
                    <i>[unclear: 
                        Lively
                    ]</i> found and gave to me. I would like to be able to assist <i>[deleted: ]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> finding <i>[unclear: 
                        up
                    ]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: 
                        Preacher
                    ]</i> etc. but can't make a commitment just now. My love to all the folks</p>
