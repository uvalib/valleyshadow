                <p>Oscar Stuart's letter to Alexander Stuart conveys very poetic sentiment regarding
                    the death of Alexander's son and the nature of human suffering. He also asks
                    Alexander to relate what he knows about Oscar's two grandfathers on the Stuart
                    side, so that he may confirm the family's stories about their exploits in the
                    Revolutionary War. Oscar Stuart then writes at length about "sectionalism" in
                    Virginia and the poor state of national politics in general.</p>

                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>I have just <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> your favor of the 29th
                        <unclear>ultimo</unclear>, with a copy of the will of Armistead Blackwell,
                    deceased enclosed therein. If there was a cordial of consolation in human
                    sympathy, and a balm of healing in language, for bereavement like yours, I would
                    offer you such heart felt condolence for the loss you sustained in the death of
                    your son. As one taught to feel a lively sympathy in the woes of others, by many
                    realizations of them himself. But alas I know from sad experience in the loss of
                    many of those who were nearest and dearest to me, that, "Nature has her
                    habitudes, and they will have their way." The spring may again return "the green
                    boughs wave triumphant on the hills, the "voice of the turtle be heard in the
                    land" but no earthly sun can revive the withered hopes of the afflicted breast.
                    The Creator, the common Father of all, with whom "are the issues of life, and
                    death, who slayeth and maketh alive, who giveth, and taketh away, who tempereth
                    the wind to the Shorn lamb" can alone heal the wound he inflicts. I have learned
                    from a continuous repetition of heart rending bereavements in which the great
                    depths of thoughts, and feeling were broken up, and my mind staggered not only
                    under anguish, but a chaos of emotions, to Stand <pb n="2"/>as the apostles did,
                    in the contemplation of the Secret Counsels of God <hi rend="underline"
                        >solemnized in mute awe</hi> and silently and reverently adore him who loves
                    our children and friends, better both in wisdom, and intensity, than we are
                    capable of doing and who whether his Providence is manifested in the
                    Prolongation of their lives, or their Sudden death, arrange their destiny more
                    wisely, than our wishes could for them, if we had the power to render our wishes
                    efficacious.</p>

                <p>"Tis but a part we see not the whole." Life is an alternation of sunshine and
                    clouds. I was born under the latter and my life, has been
                    <unclear>checquered</unclear> by such a rapid succession of vicissitudes that I
                    have formed a friendly intimacy with gloom, and think there is as much
                    sublimity, as solemnity in the darkness of every diversity of fortune. The mind,
                    in a manner bringeth "light out of darkness." Darkness gives it occasion for the
                    exercise of its powers, and saves it often from the torpor of inaction. It must
                    make for itself the true sunshine of intelligence, virtue, that of the Soul, and
                    a continuously sustained energy that of fortune.</p>

                <p>As I know but little of my fathers family, I would be greatly obliged to you if
                    you would furnish me with a genealogy of it, so far as you know, lineal and
                    collateral. This I want especially for the satisfaction of my children. I know
                        <pb n="3"/>traditionally. that both of my Grandfathers, were Officers
                    belonging to the Virginia Continental troops in the revolutionary war, and that
                    my Grandfather John Stockton, raised, perhaps, the first Company of volunteers,
                    that was raised in the then colony for the war, in the County of Pittsylvania,
                    then a part of <unclear>Muhlenbuerg</unclear> and heard that both of them made
                    great sacrifices, not only of the 7 years of their time, but of their property,
                    in their efforts to sustain the Article, of the Continental paper. But of this I
                    have never had the means of obtaining any information, more authentic than the
                    oft repeated narratives, which I heard in childhood from the lips of my
                    Grandmother Stockton, and my mother. Can you furnish me with any memorial of the
                    facts in regard to either of them. I have thought, that perhaps the files in
                    regard to the Officers, and soldiers, of the army, at Richmond so far as they
                    showed any thing upon the subjects might furnish something, in corroboration of
                    the tradition. I also learned that my Grandfather Stuart was taken prisoner at
                    the battle of Guildford, which was fought about 60 miles from the place on which
                    I was born in Pittsylvania. My grandfather Stockton was also attached to
                    Greene's division, he then belonged to the Commissary department, and was at
                    home at the time of the battle, as I suppose for the purpose of Obtaining
                    supplies for the Army. It being his custom to exhaust everything that could be
                        <pb n="4"/>supplied from his own plantation of which he owned I think three
                    at the time, on Sandy and Turkey <unclear>Cook</unclear>, before he would take
                    any thing from his neighbors, and force the Continental paper, then greatly
                    depreciated, upon them.</p>

                <p>Such private memorials of a mans ancestors, although ridiculed by the masses of
                    mankind, who have nothing of the kind, and cannot appreciate their value, I
                    think are of more worth in their influence upon his posterity than the record of
                    those brilliant deeds performed amidst battle, and carnage, thunder and smoke,
                    which emblazen the page of history. Deeds of brilliant daring address themselves
                    most to senses, passions, and vanity of mankind, and those who acheive them are
                    in the fact of their performances, as well as in the elements of their being,
                    mere vulgar heroes. But those quite plain, every day achievements in point of
                    simplicity in which a man acts against the instincts of his Selfishness,
                    sacraficing his present and future worldly interest, not from a love of
                    approbation, but a love of principle, while they strike, not the senses of the
                    masses, and would be but poor materials, for the historian or biographer, who
                    would make his book sell, are like the "genuine diamond which shows best when
                    plainly set" and furnish an unalloyed incentive, to virtue, they constitute the
                    true beacon lights that guide the mind and affections to the acquisition of true
                    heroism and nobility of nature. For "the secret thoughts, the private acts of
                    men, if noble, are far the noblest of their lives."</p>

                <pb n="5"/>

                <p>The old line whigs of your State, made such a noble rally at the late election,
                    considering the long <orig reg="disorganization">disorganisation</orig> of the
                    party, that I am in hopes that they will try it again. Our old mother has been
                    playing the profligate in <orig reg="politics">polliticks</orig> ever since, she
                    cast her vote for <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Jackson for President, and
                    now that the baleful lights of a Bogus Democracy, and black republicanism, are
                    glaring in triumph every where else, she could make some amends for having
                    rendered the path of vice attractive by her example, if she should rear up on
                    high the light of old whig principles of the National Intelligences, Henry Clay,
                    Daniel Webster, Stamp, in their Conservative and Union features. So far the
                    dominant party in your State, have justified the remark of Mr Jefferson in
                    reference to the intelligence of the masses, when he spoke of her, as the "<hi
                        rend="underline">Barbary of the United States</hi> -- While the Country is
                    more in debted to the Statesmen of Virginia and Massachusetts for correct ideas
                    of government, than those of any other two States, I think that the Statesmen of
                    those two States, have transfused through the mind of the body <orig
                        reg="politic">pollitic</orig>, more abominable "isms" than those of all the
                    other States combined. In fact except to the Agrarianism of N. York, it is hard
                    to name a radicalism which is subversive of social order, and destructive of the
                    true tendencies <pb n="6"/> and proportions of the frame work of our government,
                    which has not germinated in Virginia or Massachusetts. Mr Jefferson is quoted
                    and has been, from my boyhood on both sides of nearly every question, and as is
                    apparent from his published writings with equal authority. Ignorance and vice,
                    has become as <orig reg="positive">posative</orig> elements in political
                    contest, as intelligence and virtue, and I am inclined to believe embraces the
                    largest number of voters in its classification. At any rate the theory of our
                    government, which presupposes the majority to be intelligent and virtuous, if it
                    has not already, become unsuited to the Status of the majority, is rapidly
                    becoming so. All of the hopes of my early life, in reference to the perpetuity
                    of our political institutions, vanished when Polk beat Mr Clay for the
                    Presidency. Except the Oasis, of Mr Fillmore's administration things, have since
                    progressed from bad to worse. Very inferior men fill the highest posts in every
                    department of the Federal government, and in that of most of the States. The
                    badge of office is no longer the insignia of honor, but of Servility, and
                    degredation of character in most instances Truly. "The old Knights have gone to
                    their <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, and the battle is left to be fought out by the Squires"
                    and truly it is a <unclear>lacquey</unclear> fight, as exemplified by the
                    bitterness, of intrinsic bitterness, with which it is waged. The leaders in <pb
                        n="7"/>the sectional contests, now being waged, in the primordial elements
                    of their being, and organic combination thereof are near about identically the
                    same. If Messrs. Seward, Hayle, Geddings &amp; Company resided in the South,
                    they would be such fire eaters as Toombs, Stephens, and Jones of Georgia, Rhett
                    of S. Carolina, and the late <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Quitman of this
                    State; and were the Southern Fire Eaters, I have named, transplanted into the
                    free states, they would soon rival the <unclear>Buchers</unclear>, Sewards, and
                    the whole Company of "Freedom Shriekers" in their denunciations of slavery, and
                    assaults upon the Union. Both sides assail the Union, and though they do so upon
                    different pretexts, yet the difference arises from their locality, not from a
                    different moral nature. One set is cut off of the Northern, and the other off of
                    the Southern end of the cloth, yet the chain, and filling is the same.</p>

                <p>In this repudiating State every Conservative influence is in a hopeless minority.
                    The only consolation left to the advocates of truth and right is the reflection
                    that "When iniquity cometh in like a flood, and overflows, the Lord will raise
                    up a Standard for the people" I have ceased to take an active part in <orig
                        reg="politics">polliticks</orig>, since the defeat of Mr Clay in 1844, save
                    in the contest upon the adjustment bills in 1852.</p>
