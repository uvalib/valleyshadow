<p class="p10">I will surprise you with a few words + jokes.</p>
<p class="p10">I am again in camp enjoying the pleasures &amp; braving the hardship &amp; dangers
     incident to such a life. As to any enjoyments they are many &amp; various consequently I
     will not endeavor to enumerate them. I have had some pretty hard times since I came down. I
     have marched over 100 miles since leaving Winchester <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Thursday morning Jan <i>[deleted: 29]</i> 30. We had to march yesterday morning and I didn't get time to finish your
     letter. We marched 8 mls. yesterday &amp; are now 5 mls. from Winchester on the <i>[unclear: Pughtown]</i> road. We are in
     winter quarters, are yet in our tents, but will continue building our cabins tomorrow. I think
     it probable that we may have some rest now for awhile</p>
<p class="p10">We left Romney on the 23rd. It rained all the time we were there &amp; was very muddy
     &amp; disagreeable. Romney is a very nice town I suppose in time of peace, but it is
     overrun with soldiers + abused now. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>There are a few pretty girls there; some of were
     very kind to me &amp; others were more <u>"union than secesh"</u> I
     think.</p>
<p class="p10">There are several pretty churches there &amp; a good many nice private residences
     &amp; also a very commodious Court House, though the Yankees have torn the floors &amp;
     every thing from the inside of the Court House. </p>
<p class="p10">The Federals left a great many things when they "vamoused" from there. I could have gotten a
     number of trophies but had no way of taking care of them. Its the most mountainous regions
     between here and Romney I ever <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>saw. There are 8 mountains between here &amp;
     there &amp; The Pastures about Burnissis Springs is a paradise to the be best part of
     Hampshire County. The people of some places can look up the chimney &amp; see the sheep
     &amp; goats on the hill side above. There are some children out there that never saw the
     sun. </p>
<p class="p10">The Yankees have burned all the houses for 20 miles in this side of Romney. But I guess they
     won't burn any more soon</p>
<p class="p10">Write to me soon. Direct to Winchester. In care of Cpt. H. J.
     Williams, Comp'y D. 5th reg'mt Va
     vol. </p>
<p class="p10">-Yours truly-</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
      <u>James R. McCutchan</u>
     </i></p>
<p class="p10">Tell Lizzie I will write to her soon. Give my love to all. Write
      soon....</p>
