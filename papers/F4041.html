<p class="p10">Dear Sister Emma</p>
<p class="p10">One week ago today I received your letter and was very glad to hear from you as I
                    had not received any <i>[deleted: word]</i>word for five weeks and you may

                    <i>[added: us]</i> to leave which is not very likely I have
                    had very health ever since I left home (not been sick one day) and I hope that
                    these few lines will find you all enjoying the same blessing</p>

                    of <i>[unclear: rebels]</i> yesterday. I met some of the seventy seven 77th
                        Reg and also 26th artillery from what I can
                    learn none for Chambersburg were killed or wounded in the fighting yet</p>
