                <p>As you know that <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> I am sick and in the Hospital. I would suppose
                    that you are anxious to hear from me how I am getting and so on. Well I cannot
                    say that I am much better than I was when I wrote to you last although I <orig
                        reg="believe">beleive</orig> I am a little better. I have still a pain in
                    the side of my head - somewhat like a neuralgia. I think it arises from a bad
                    tooth which must be extricated if it <orig reg="doesn't">dont</orig> behave. I
                    had, also a pain on the breast but I had a blistering plaster, - a terrible hot
                    one, too it <orig reg="burned">burnt</orig> a little <orig reg="like">lik</orig>
                    Greek fire - laid on my breast and that put a stop to that. I am not confined to
                    bed and when the weather permits I can run about through town. Emanuel
                        <unclear>Carster</unclear> is in the hospital, too.</p>
                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>I received a letter from Eveline the other day. Tell her <orig reg="I'll"
                    >Ill</orig> write as soon as I get a little better. She said she soon be at home
                    again. If my old red shirt is pretty good yet and you get a good chance suppose
                    you send it down Maybe Nathaniel will take a notion to come down and bring me a
                    Christmas gift. I wish he only could or poor us will have to do without a
                    Christmas again. I would not invite <unclear>any</unclear> women
                    <unclear>down</unclear> here because you could not get a place to stay over
                    night among so many <abbr expan="secessionists">sesh</abbr>.</p>

                <p>I would like if somebody would see after that money that I sent with Joseph
                    Spangler ($60.00) and let me know as soon as <orig reg="possible"
                    >possable</orig> if it arrived safely. If it is not at
                    <unclear>Raineys</unclear> or <unclear>Pisels</unclear> some one had better go
                    over to Spanglers and get it.</p>

                <p>I hope to be able to go back to camp in a few days <abbr expan="although"
                    >altho</abbr> my <orig reg="medicine">medicin</orig> keeps me
                    <unclear>middling</unclear> weak.</p>

                <p>Give my well wishes to my dear parents, brothers and Sisters. Write soon.</p>
