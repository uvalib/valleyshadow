<h4>Augusta County: D. V. Gilkeson to Gilkeson's brother
                    (probably Hugh Gilkeson), August 31, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Gilkeson discusses the year's crops and resignedly mentions that labor is "all to
                    hire." He delivers news about the family and suggests that his brother try the
                    nursery business, to avoid the bad luck often attached to farming.</p>

<p class="p10">My Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">Yours written and mailed wednesday 21<sup>
                        <u>st</u>
                    </sup> and postmarked same date reached Staunton Saturday the 24<sup>
                        <u>th</u>
                    </sup> that shows the importance or advantage of living near the R.R. where we could hear from one another so quick.
                    My dear brother I am very sorry to hear of your having another dry season and
                    another failure in crop. You have been truly unfortunate in that respect for the
                    last few years I dont wonder at your having an desire
                    to leave. It seems to me were I in your place though I dont like to advise I would try and rent out my land to some good
                    reliable man that would take care of the place and keep it up and would try and
                    get into some safe and honourable
                    buisiness for a few years, some buisiness that would pay better than farming, I think I told you
                    when I was there that I thought you had a turn for the nursery buisiness if that would suit your taste you might pay
                    us a visit and get an insight into the buisiness and
                    see what you could do this man Davis who has a nursery near Staunton has made a
                    great deal of money. he and Tom Calbreath went into the buisiness<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> together below Richmond were raising peaches
                    and sending to the New York Market I think before the war and were making money
                    at it by the way <i>[unclear: J.]</i> Calbreath has turned out badly is
                    carrying on a distillery on the old place and is in the habit of drinking
                    himself A great many persons think there is nothing to be made here farming now
                    when labour is all to hire but when we are so
                    successful in cropping as we have been this year I think we can make something
                    although our expenses are very heavy there was finer crops of wheat made in this
                    country <i>[added: this year]</i> than has been made before
                    I suppose for ten years and then we may calculate again for ten years more there
                        wont be near as large crops of corn made as there
                    was last year My crop started very badly in the spring and I had almost
                    despaired of a corn crop this year but rains set in about the right time and has
                    been showery so I will make a good-deal of corn having cut about 40 acre if
                    frost keeps off long enough though last night was very cool and so is to night I saw John Hamilton to
                    day and he said there was frost last night said there could be no mistake
                    about it that he examined closely and saw some on clover but there was certainly
                    none to do any damage, but I dont like to hear of it am
                        affraid it may come before corn is out of the way
                    of it</p>
<p class="p10">The health of our family is generally good though I have been suffering for a few
                    days past with one of my spells but hope it is now wearing off Willie has been
                    unfortunate of late snagging his feet on nails has been poulticing them some
                    they are now better they dont keep him from running
                    about all he can if he has to limp, he and Emma were both terribly long about
                    writing I have been at them all week about but they never done it until this
                    morning when I told them they must do it to day so they
                    went at it Sallie has not taken up her school yet as she wanted to visit some
                    while not teaching but will take up in a few days I suppose, talking of going up
                    one day next week to <i>[added: see]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: Frank]</i> Gilkeson and his new bride he was married a few week
                    ago some day who lived near him in Culpeper said to be quite inteligent and refined but not rich, A letter a few
                    days ago from Carrie to Sallie she writes quite discouraging is anxious for
                        W<sup>
                            <u>m</u>
                        </sup> to leave I dont wonder at her, I
                    believe it will be all the same to James he will get along by himself about as
                    well as with any lady he can then have every thing
                    his own way. My paper is full give our love to all friends and write soon to</p>
