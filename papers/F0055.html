                        <u>Dear</u>
                        <u>Tilly</u>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">As it is late this evening and I feel a little sleepy, you need not fear being
                    bothered with a long letter. We have had another heavy fall of snow, but today
                    the sun carried it all off.</p>
<p class="p10">Mayor Snodgrass' wife, daughter, and adopted daughter arrived in camp today and
                    took lodgings. It was rather odd to sit down to the table with ladies but I
                    suppose we will get used to it. One of the Officers today insisted that <u>I</u> would have <u>my</u> wife out
                    here before ten days, and wanted to bet me so many dollars that his words would
                    come true. Don't you think I would have won? There is something strange going
                    on. My love to all the folks</p>
