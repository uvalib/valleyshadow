<p class="p10">June 20<sup>th</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Fairfax Courthouse </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister </p>
<p class="p10">I take the present opportunity to write you a few lines hoping that they may find
                    you all in good health. I wrote you a few lines on the 13<sup>th</sup> at Catletts Station, but I had no opportunity to send it as we marched
                    from there that evening. I suppose you have heard of the cavalry fight we had at
                    Beverly Ford on the 9<sup>th</sup><i>[illeg.]</i> Our Regt. was engaged there and we lost 109 men killed
                    wounded and missing. Since that time we have been moving nearly all the time. We
                    went from Catletts Station to Thoroughfare Gap, from there to Manasses Junction, then to Bull Run<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>from
                    Bull run we marched up towards Leesburg and encountered the rebel army at Adlia
                    at which place we left all our cavalry yesterday, it is about 20 miles from here
                    "Fairfax C. House." Regt. was sent with our supply
                    train, we expect to get <i>[illeg.]</i> tonight. most of Hookers army is above fairfax, some of them
                    were sent up to our cavalry last night. we expect to have heavy fight shortly
                    again. By all accounts some of the rebel cavalry is in Penn. again. and I expect that there is great
                    excitement up there now, but I dondt think they will
                    stay there long. I can write no more at present. Give my respects to all
                    inquiring friends. </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate Brother. </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Christian Geisel </i></p>
<p class="p10">Please excuse haste and mistakes. </p>
