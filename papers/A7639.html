                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> Herring in laying in a stock of good<sup>s</sup>. I intend
                    trying merchandising this winter any how &amp; see what it will do. I think
                    there is more made at that than anything else here. If I find it dont pay I will soon drop it but as sales are all cash
                    here &amp; good<sup>s</sup> going up daily I cant see how one can loose if cautious</p>

                    our <i>[unclear: fire]</i> talking &amp; it is quite lonesome. If spring
                    brings no change in National affairs I will make some change in mine. it wont do to live this way. Jack &amp; Ellen &amp;
