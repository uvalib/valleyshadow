<p class="p10">Wytheville Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mary</p>
<p class="p10">I have received both of your letters and was very glad to hear from you all but
                    was very sorry they were written under such painful circumstances. when I
                    received your first letter I was in hopes that Florence would recover, but the
                    Lord seen fit to take her from this world of sorrow and trouble and therefore we
                    ought not grumble or complain she has escaped all trouble and suffering that is
                    to come on us yet if the war dont soon end. There is no
                    sign of it ending very soon, oh that it would end before every body is ruined,
                    it is much better for little Florence to die and have her Ma and Pa than for
                    them to have to leave her, for there is no one like a Mother to her babe, no one
                    has lost a dearer babe than I it is a hard trial to know that she is gone from
                    me forever, but I can go to her and therefore I am reconsiled, and know that she is better off. Mary I have no news of
                    importance to write to you to night I am looking for Sue Perkins this week give
                    my love to your Ma Pa and all the family Tell Lizzie I will write to her soon I
                    wrote to Mother to day George is not well yet but is
                    getting better every day <i>[unclear: sis]</i> is as fat as ever they both
                    kissed me for you before they went to bed give my love to your brothers wife and
                    tell her I sympathise with very much I was very sorry to hear of her little
                    girls death. I am so lonesome to night Will has gone to the Saltworks I would
                    like to spend another winter in old Augusta, Will talks very strong of coming
                    down in the spring to live if nothing happens, you must excuse this badly
                    written and uninteresting letter write often and with all the news.</p>
<p class="p10">Your aff friend</p>
