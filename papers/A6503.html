<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Your moddle of gun is so incomplete that it will be
                    useless to take it Richmond in it present condition &amp; I haven't time to
                    have one made. I have left it in Farmers Bank with Mr. Lo. Norvell. I think you
                    had better come here &amp; complete the Moddle
                    &amp; take it Rich'd But I have assertained that you can do nothing with the
                    government or any one else unless we can furnish the metal for its manufacture.
                    I can get up a large company here if we can furnish the mettal. So I think you had better go to Oronoco at once &amp; put
                    things through there &amp; then start the gun nearly at the Armory works in
                        Rich'd are stopped for want of mettal. Some very wealthy men are anxious to go into the
                    iron business at Orono we get the iron &amp; then we can go ahead with the
                    gun <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I would have written to you sooner, but have been worked half to
                    death by gen'ls in &amp; around Lynchburg ever
                    since I parted with you. Keep me acquainted with your movements In haste</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly<br>Yours</p>
