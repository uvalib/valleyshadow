<p class="p10">Friday July 18<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Gordonsville Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dr Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">We got here today, through the mud and rain &amp; have pitched our tent and are trying to
     get dry, though it is doubtful, if the rain continues, for the ground is very wet We came to
     Mechum's River the day we left Staunton, slept there in an empty house, soundly, after our long
     and weary ride in the hot sun, I think I never felt the sun as hot as it was coming up the Blue
     Ridge, when it caused a violent pain in my head, which I was afraid would be sunstroke, but we
     stopped at the Mountain House and staid several hours, got dinner,
     and then went to sleep, after wh. I felt better, and we went on
     through a heavy thunder shower that came up -- we rode some 30 miles. Thursday we came on
     through Charlottesville, across the S.W. Mts. on wh. Monticello is
     situated and then on nearly along the line of the Va. C.R.R. and spent the night with the Rev.
     Mr. Boyden, next neighbor to Wm C. Rives -- we were very kindly
     treated by him -- he is pastor of an episcopal church nearby; a beautiful <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> stone
     edifice, one of the neatest I ever saw -- We heard in the night that the Yankees were near
     Gordonsville, but find today that they are still some distance away, though threatening this
     direction -- Our cavalry brought in fourteen of them today, that they took. Gen. Jackson has
     not yet arrived, though I supposed he soon will -- The troops are coming in and some of them
     have gone out on the Orange and Alexandria Road -- the Cars went up to Staunton today, the
     first time for several days, so I suppose you will get the papers again now -- We are on the
     hard fodder line now -- some of the troops have not been fed for 24 hours as they were brought
     up on the cars and their supplies came by wagon -- or rather their wagons had to come up to
     them over the common roads. I saw young Blair, James today, some one of the boys had stolen his
     boots and he was barefooted -- so I found a pair of old shoes and gave them to him --</p>
<p class="p10"> I do not know what is to be done --There are all sorts of extravagant stories in circulation
     -- some say that Jackson is to have 80000 men and go to Pennsylvania by the way of Harrisburg
     -- and some that he is to go to Washington &amp;c &amp;c. But I do not presume to know
     anything about it as yet -- though I doubt not he will be allowed to have his own way -- You
     will see all the news there is, in the papers. I will write to you often, and you can write to
     me through Major H.M. Bell who is now the chief Q.M. at
     Staunton. You can keep my clothes until I write to you where to sent them. My Love to all God
     bless you and keep you safely -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your Aff husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to you from Staunton -- and left the pitcher and letter at Dr.
      Young's</p>
