<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Orlando Brown, January 31, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In his report, Jackson comments on the continuing problem of contract negotiation
                    and disputed wages between employers and laborers. He also worries about
                    conservative whites' efforts to "defeat the Constitution."</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Jan 31, 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Circular Order No. 6 S. 1866 B.R.F.&amp;A.L. I have the honor to submit the following report of
                    condition of Bureau affairs in the 4<sup>th</sup>
                    Div. 9th SubDist.
                    Va. which includes the counties of Augusta and
                    Highland.</p>
<p class="p10">Numerous calls are daily made at this office by Freedpeople, to obtain settlement
                    of disputed accounts for labor, or to ask aid to compel payment of wages
                    acknowledged to be due. I still find in a majority of these cases, a trivial
                    money balance to the credit of the laborer, or a claim against him for over
                    payment in produce or goods, which it is difficult to refute, by reason of his
                    having no counter account of his own to show.</p>
<p class="p10">Few contracts for labor by the year are being made at this office, partly owing
                    to unwillingness of employers to come to the Bureau, and partly to indisposition
                    of laborers to make contracts for the year. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>This last is much to be
                    regretted, and I use all exertion to induce the Freedmen to make permanent
                    engagements, but in most cases, without success. Wages offered are about as last
                    year, $8 c $10 per month for good hands, with rations house and fuel. Boys are
                    little wanted. There have been no special breaches of the peace during this
                    month, by or against Freedmen on the part of the Whites. In the case of assault
                    with a hatchet by John <i>[unclear: McNeish]</i> (cold) upon Moses Lowell (cold), McNeish was
                    fined $1 only by the magistrate and released, but next morning I brought the
                    case to the notice of the Mayor, and he had McNeish rearrested and held to
                    answer indictment at March court.</p>
<p class="p10">Political matters between white and colored are quiet, but I can report little or
                    no change of feeling. The conservative organization is active and general, every
                    preparation being made to defeat the Constitution, no matter what it may be, but
                    so far no impression has been made upon the masses of colored voters, who see
                    now quite clearly that the <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>success of the conservatives will result
                    in depriving them of all privileges of freedom. Temperance organizations cannot
                    it seems be effected, but there is little drunkeness among Freedmen, except in
                    the country near distilleries or low <i>[unclear: groggers]</i> in town. The
                    colored churches do not take up the Temperance movement earnestly, if at all,
                    and until this is done I do not look for much progress in organizing societies.</p>
<p class="p10">Both town and county authorities seem to extend impartial relief to the poor
                    Freedpeople, and since the settlement of the question as to who should furnish
                    temporary relief, there is little ground for complaint.</p>
