                        </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I have your letter of yesterday, and can only say that I have been
                    misrepresented, as usual, and that you have been imposed upon. Have you seen
                        Col. Curtin? All I have consented to do, was in
                    accordance with his views, his knowledge &amp; his approbation.</p>
<p class="p10">I was called on by local gentlemen of the "republican club" of the city and asked
                    and asked to object <i>[illeg.]</i> in organizing for the campaign which I
                    consented to do only on condition that we should in no manner interfere with you
                    or your committee.</p>
<p class="p10">So for have <i>[unclear: infecting]</i> to get <i>[unclear: fired]</i> from the
                        national<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>committee one of the <i>[unclear: express]</i>
                    conditions made by me was that we should express all offers of aid in money or
                    otherwise from persons outside the state.</p>
<p class="p10">It is time I heard from all <i>[unclear: sides]</i> in Phila that you had given up the hope of
                    obtaining friends, and that you had said you would not again call your committee
                    together. I regret <i>[unclear: foilcars]</i> and was willing to forgo my own
                    comfort and neglect my own business to <i>[illeg.]</i> you and others, in
                        <i>[unclear: victory]</i> harmony, and to bring about such a victory as we
                    may all be proud of.</p>
<p class="p10">I can only account for your misapprehension of my <i>[unclear: vices]</i> by
                    believing that you have not <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">I have <i>[unclear: planned]</i> to be in Phila Tuesday next, when I will be the gentlemen whom I proved to act
                    with and will also have a <i>[unclear: frank]</i> and cordial conversation with
                    you. I desire, however that you will write Mr. Curtin to be present, and will
                    not consent to be misunderstood by him.</p>
<p class="p10">Vly <i>[illeg.]</i></p>
<p class="p10"><i></i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Col.
                            A K McClure
