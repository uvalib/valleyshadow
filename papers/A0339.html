<p class="p10">Dear Brother </p>
<p class="p10">I again seat myself to inform you that we are all tolerable well my children I
                    fear are about to take the whooping cough they all take coughing spells except
                    Martha Mother, Jane &amp; myself are well and I hope when these lines reach
                    you they may find you well we have a snow here now about four inches deep it
                    fell yesterday 24th. today is pleasant Sunshine R. F. Lisner &amp; Ambrose
                    Moyers are now at home on furlough Bob staid all night with us. today he is
                    making a pair of wooden stirrups in your shop I have not worked in the shop
                    three hours since the middle of July consequently I keep it locked after I came
                    from the mountains I found it necessary to take that precaution your tools are
                    all safe and in the order you left them except a few not very valuable ones
                    which were hooked Whilst we were in service I have a boy now hired by the name
                    of Geo. A. Back son of James sixteen years old he is a great help to me I had
                    expected to have been out there to see you and my friends and acquaintances
                    before this but did not meet with the chance however I will now state that
                    Samuel Plecker and myself will come out there in a few weeks in my one horse
                    wagon and bring you some rations along that we think you stand in need of </p>
<p class="p10"> I Received your letter some eight or ten days ago you stated you wished me to
                    tend to that affair between yourself and H Frye I have done so. Mrs. Hary Fry
                    Paid Esq.Fulton $142 independent of the note or bond of John Craun's
                    consequently Harry Fry now owes $42 on his lot Esq. Fulton holds the Bond of
                    John Craun it is now left to you whether I shall take Craun's Bond back or leave
                    it in Fultons hands the other Bond that Fry has taken and paid Click I know
                    nothing about. you and Fry for that I seems that Fry is now quite able to pay
                    for his lot I wonder if he made any of that money by gambling. Esq. Fulton
                    explained the case to me about the lot you are safe I think in every respect In
                    your next letter I want you to State whether this affair was transacted as you
                    wanted it Samuel Whitmore said I must write to you to inform you that he wishes
                    to settle for his yearly Rent if you wish me to tend to it I will do so We are
