<p class="p10">April 4<sup>th</sup> 1870</p>
<p class="p10">Riverside</p>
<p class="p10">My Very Dear Lora;</p>
<p class="p10">I was delighted to get your letter of March 8<sup>th</sup> I really
                    thought I should answer it right away, but I have been suffering a great dial lately from Neuralgia, &amp; my eyes pain me when
                    I write at night. But I am determined another week shall not pass, and find your
                    dear letter unanswered. So although it is <u>Monday</u>,
                    &amp; I act in the capacity of <u>Bridget</u>, while my
                    girl is <u>Washing</u> I will sit down and write until time
                    to get dinner for the farm hands. When I rec'd yours, I had just mailed a letter to Sarah
                    in which I sent some messages to you, little dreaming I should so soon receive
                    the letter I had looked for so long and vainly. I am so glad you are so happy
                    and very thankful that you have given <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> your heart to the blessed
                    Savior, and <u>with</u>
                    <u>your</u>
                    <u>husband</u> have professed Him before the world. I know by
                    happy experience what an increase of joy and peace, <u>religion</u> has brought to your wedded hearts I pray that you both may
                    prove "bright and <u>shining</u> lights" in this world of
                    darkness, sin &amp; sorrow.</p>
<p class="p10">I had the pleasure of seeing Stiles a few weeks since at Uncle Jed's. He had
                    changed so much in the years since I had seen him, I could scarcely recognize
                    the handsome mischievous, baby pet, in the tall boy before me. I wondered if he
                    wasn't homesick, for he said he wanted to see them all at home right badly. I
                    had a very cool reception from <u>our</u>
                    <u>Aunt</u>, and have concluded not to give her the oppurtunity to treat me so, soon, again.</p>
<p class="p10">May just came to me for permission to take her doll and walk on the lawn. So I
                    put on her little hood, &amp; red cloak <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> and she kissed me "bye".
                    She will be <u>three</u> years old the 14<sup>th</sup>
                    inst. She grows rapidly, &amp; becomes daily
                    more interesting as her mind develops. She is a <u>world</u>
                    of comfort to her Pa &amp; me. I received a letter from Ma last week, and
                    she says sister Emma, (Mrs. Geo. P. Holman) has a
                    beautiful little daughter! How I would like to see Emma and her <u>bridling</u>! She has an excellent husband, and a lovely
                    home Our family were all well, and still delighted with the climate, soil,
                    scenery, &amp;c, of <u>Oregon</u>, and especially with
                    the celebrated Willameth Valley, where they live. I am very anxious for brighter
                    skies natural, financial, and political. Are not you? By the way, is "<u>Mayor</u> Ellyson" your husband's father? I was very much
                    interested in the correspondence between Gov.
                    Walker &amp; Canby, in which <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>
                    reference is made to Mayor Henry Ellyson, &amp; wondered if he and your
                        fatherinlaw were not the same.</p>
<p class="p10">Do you know that Nannie was in Richmond last week? Yes; she was there from
                    Thursday eve.g until Saturday morning. It rained
                    Friday and she didn't get anywhere except to Capitol Square. She stopped at the
                        <u>Exchange</u>. About a month ago she went to Salem,
                    Roanoke Co. to visit a school-mate, and while there, here uncle William was appointed a
                    delegate to the Valley Rail Road meeting in
                    Baltimore, &amp; wrote to her to meet him in Charlottesville, &amp; he
                    would take her on with him. She did so, and they spent one week in Baltimore.
                    There she heard <u>Carlotta Patti</u> sing, and <u>Ritter</u> the great Pianist, played. She was quite <u>carried</u>
                    <u>away</u> with the concert From Balt <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br> imore they
                    went to Washington, where they spent two days, visiting all the public
                    buildings. Georgetown, Arlington, &amp; Mt.
                    Vernon. Went by water to Richmond. Nannie was so <u>sorry</u>
                    she did not know your address, for she was anxious to see you. She enjoyed her
                    trip mightily, and <u>declares</u> she has been <u>half</u> around the world! She came home last Saturday
                        eve,g, and we certainly were glad to see her.
                    She is well, and sends a great deal of love.</p>
<p class="p10">Do you ever see Maggie Eidson, alias, Mrs. Pete Wilson? I hope when I visit
                    Richmond I may see both of my old scholars, Lora and Maggie.</p>
<p class="p10">I have stopped to get dinner for the hands, and "snack" for Frank, and now as I
                    have a chance to send this to Churchville, I must close. <br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br> Give my
                    love to your Ma &amp; Pa when you write, and all the family. I do not feel
                    as if your husband were exactly a stranger, and shall therefore follow the
                    promptings of my heart, &amp; ask you to present him with my kindest
                    regards.</p>
<p class="p10">Will you not write very soon? I do want to hear from you often.</p>
<p class="p10">Goodbye</p>
<p class="p10">Your loving friend</p>
