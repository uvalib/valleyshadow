<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: J. W. Sharp to R. S.
                    Lacey, July 18, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Sharp responds to a complaint passed along by Jackson regarding money owed to a
                    Staunton resident. Sharp describes his efforts to resolve the situation and the
                    possibility of repayment.</p>

<p class="p10">Respectfully returned to Capt. R. S. Lacey Agent in
                    charge 7th Sub-Dist of Va with the information that I have repeatedly called on C.W. Oltman and
                    demanded payment of the entire $8.50. He acknowledged the correctness of the
                    account and each time promised to pay it as soon as he had gotten money which he
                    was then expecting. These repeated promises were the cause of my delay in
                    returning the papers as I had hoped (over) <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to enclose the money with
                    them.</p>
<p class="p10">Oltman is a foreigner and has no property here, nor are there any means of
                    recovering the money by force as I have now good reason to believe that he
                    neither has any, nor is there any due him by anybody in Lexington.</p>
<p class="p10">I understand he expects to get a position in Washington College and, if he
                    obtains this his salary can be garnished.</p>
