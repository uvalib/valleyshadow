    <p>I received your very kind letter yesterday and also the one you sent by J Berry but I had no
     time to answer it on account of the almost incessant marching and countermarching since we left
     Winchester. We are getting a little rest now since the enemy have come to a stand at Edinburg
     Our troops burnt the bridge across the river there &amp; the enemy cannot get across
     without rebuilding the bridge they have built it up once or twice already but Asheby tears it
     down with cannon as fast as they build it up<pb n="2" entity="Smiley4b" pid="uva-lib:503089"/>
      We have had a hard time since the battle our tents were all sent
     away and we only got them again yesterday it is now sleeting and has been for three days We
     have had a great deal of wet weather lately which set hard with our new recruits and the
     militia there is a great many of the militia sick and complaining while there is no sickness
     among those that have been in service the last year. The election of officers takes place in
     our company tomorrow if the day is such that we can be out I have no idea who will be elected
     <orig reg="captain">captan</orig> but I think that<pb n="3" entity="Smiley4c" pid="uva-lib:503090"/>
     Lieut M<hi rend="super">c</hi> Henry will stand a good chance for
     the office he will be more suitable than Lieut Randolph as he is a man of steadier habits than
     the latter Colonel Horman obtained a list of our wounded prisoners who are in Winchester James
     Payne is said to be living and doing well the ladies about Winchester have taken them in their
     houses and treating them with the best of care We heard that Sam Beard was in the hospital at
     Harrisonburg but do not know whether to believe it or not as I think he would have certainly
     written &amp; let it be known where he was. Colonel Raylor received a dispatch yesterday
     saying that<pb n="4" entity="Smiley4d" pid="uva-lib:503091"/>
    the Yankess made an<del hand="h1">d</del> attack on Yorktown sunday
     morning &amp; were defeated with a dreadful slaughter &amp; also that the enemy were
     defeated at Corinth in Tennesee with a great loss in men and lost eight <orig reg="batteries"
      >baterries</orig>. I think the tide is turned again &amp; our arms will be successful in
     the end. I must draw my letter to a close. Give my love to aunt Ann Uncle James family and
     receive a due share yourself. </p>
