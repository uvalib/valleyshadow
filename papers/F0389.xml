                </opener>
                <p>I received your welcome letter of Jan. 9<hi rend="super">th</hi> enclosed in a
                    letter from sister Louisa, and as I answered her letter soon after I received
                    it, I suppose you have been informed that I received yours also. I have also
                        <orig reg="written">wrote</orig> a few lines to Father since, which I hope
                    he has received. </p>
                <p>We are still on guard along the Rappahannock River. last week we had a snowstorm
                    here, the snow was about a foot deep, but it is all melted by this time, and the
                    weather is very pleasant. I suppose you must have sleighing up there. I have not
                    much news to tell you, our army is all laying in their camps, and the roads
                        <orig reg="are">is</orig> so bad that I <orig reg="do 
 not">dondt</orig>
                    think, they<pb n="2"/>will move for a while; for my part I am very well
                    satisfied here, as long as our army lays here, but I wish the war was over. I
                    heard yesterday that a good many men of this part of our army will get furloughs
                    for ten days, but I <orig reg="do 
 not">dondt</orig> think we will get any,
                    while we are on provost guard, but if there is any chance of getting one, I will
                    apply for one, for I would be very glad to you all. I must now bring my letter
                    to a close, hoping that it may find you all in as good health as I enjoy at
                    present. Give my kindest regards to Father, mother, brothers, and sisters and my
                    compliments to all inquiring friends. I hope to have the pleasure soon to hear
                    from you again. <pb n="3"/>
