<h4>Augusta County: Cyrus Alexander to John H. McCue,
                    December 12, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Dr. Cyrus Alexander writes John H. McCue, saying that a Miss Lucy has left
                    Virginia for Ohio with her "Catnip." Alexander also writes of a possible nurse
                    for McCue, John Brown's Raid, and expresses his support for Millard Filmore and
                    opposition to Wise, Seward, and Douglass.</p>

<p class="p10">
                        DrJno
                    </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of --- is to hand, and I am sorry to say that your friend Miss Lucy is no
                    longer an inhabitant of this Commonwealth, for some unknown cause -- probably
                    because the "<u>Species</u> were not propagated fast enough
                    in this region. She emigrated to Ohio last Spring, with no intention of <u>ever</u> returning. Does it not make you <u>weep</u> to think that you have forever lost the services
                    of Lucy &amp; her "<u>Catnip</u>". As she has <i>[added: always]</i> been a necessary <u>institution</u> in your Domestic affairs, I see no other channel for you
                    in the future, than to "shut up shop" and discontinue the Business. Tell Liz.
                    that I have some idea of paying her a Visit about the first of the new year,
                    &amp; that if she will make her <u>arrangements</u> to
                    that time, that I will carry with me some Catnip, &amp; that you &amp; I
                    will put her thro all the phases of Lucy &amp;
                    the Catnip.</p>
<p class="p10">I know of no one whose services as nurse could be had, except your Aunt Ginnie
                    Martin -- she is a fine woman &amp; an excellent nurse, but I do not know
                    whether she could be induced to go so far from home. Sarah is quite smart, but
                    is slightly afflicted with the same epidemic under which <i>[unclear: Liz.]</i>
                    is labouring.</p>
<p class="p10">No news of interest. Times are Dul &amp; weather
                    cold. There is considerable War Spirit in this country. We are seeing in the
                    Harpers Ferry affair, the legitimate consequences of the Jno
                    Letchers election -- that result justified Old
                    Brown &amp; friends in believing that a Majority of Virginians were ready to
                    join them. The Democracy are responsible for it, &amp; should be held so,
                    for all this slavery agitation they have kept it alive for years. Elect Millard
                    Fillmore President, &amp; I would guarantee that before the expiration of
                    his term all would be quiet. I would like to see Wise, Seward, Douglass and a
                    few others Hanged as high as was Jno Brown.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Why Dont</u> you come over. all
                    Well. Love to Liz &amp; children</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>C. Alexander</u>
                    </i></p>
