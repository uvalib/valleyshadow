                <p>The letter gives an update on daily life, discussing for example a concert and
                    the fashion choices of the writers' friends and family. The letter also mentions
                    a recent "mournful" ceremony, without elaborating. Note the date of the letter:
                    perhaps this ceremony was related to the Civil War's end.</p>

                <p> Some say it is a mark of disrespect to write with a lead pencil; but I <orig
                        reg="don't">dont</orig> mean it as such. It is so much easier to write in
                    this way as I can do it at times when I could not write with pen ink. Mrs Turk
                    &amp; Mrs Anderson got here about half after nine. I got my bundle and a
                    note from you. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> only a note have you got so delicate that you
                    can write no more than a note? I expected my letter to go up Friday evening. I
                    sent it to office Thursday. I think Lucy &amp; <orig reg="Mary's"
                    >Marys</orig> dresses are mighty pretty <orig reg="Lucy's">Lucys</orig> in
                    particular. I thought <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> that Mrs Turk said you <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">had</add> got the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> for yourself. <orig
                        reg="don't">dont</orig> let me <unclear>take</unclear> it from you if that
                    was the case I think if I <unclear>would put</unclear> a
                    <unclear>faring</unclear> on the dress and <unclear>brinch</unclear> with a <del
                        hand="h1"/> braid dresses are made very wide so I expect there would not be
                        <unclear>through</unclear> for a hem I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> like
                    hems unless they are tolerably deep. I am very much obliged to you for sending
                    my clothes as I <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> know that they were clean. I
                    believe my purple callier is not here. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>I expect I will get a
                    bonnet. Uncle <unclear>Jess</unclear> was here yesterday and gave me $5 to get
                    me a bonnet or hat said Aunt Lizzie sent it, wasn't that so good, and kind of
                    him. Mrs Turk wanted me to go down street <orig reg="today">to-day</orig> with
                    her but I was afraid to ask Miss Mary I know she wouldn't be willing for me to
                    go. &amp; now I am certain she would have refused to let me go<pb n="2"/></p>
                <p>Ella Allen has gone home. we miss her so much she was so lively that she kept the <unclear>
                        <orig reg="balance">ballance</orig>
                    </unclear> of us <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>. It is only five weeks until school closes and
                    we <add hand="h1" place="inline">will</add> have some four or five examinations
                    in that time</p>
                <p>Why didn't brother come down yesterday I think he ought to have been here He
                    could have appreciated the speeches &amp; ceremonies. I could not go was
                    very sorry of it. I heard the bells tolling &amp; the band playing. The
                    sound was mournful indeed. I was at the D, D &amp; B Institution a few
                    Saturdays ago to a rehearsal <del hand="h1">concert</del> that the blind had. I
                    enjoyed it immensely. Some of the blind were examined. I thought they
                        <unclear>shamed</unclear> us, they stood theirs as well. We had quite an
                    excitement here a few nights ago. <orig reg="Someone">Some one</orig> got into
                    one of the rooms (my old room by the way) and was feeling under the pillow and
                    passing the hand down over the face of one of the girls they raised the alarm
                    and <orig reg="whoever">who ever</orig> it was hustled out in a hurry. Some
                    think it was a servant who was here last winter I have no idea who it was or the
                        <unclear>affect</unclear> of the visit. The effects of it were that locks
                    were put in the doors next day. It amuses me to think that in our room we have
                    been keeping open house all winter &amp; now are <unclear>locking</unclear>
                    down. <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> Miss Agness would be glad to have some dried apples or
                        <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig>
                    <orig reg="edible">eatible</orig> if you have more than you want to use. I told
                    her we had no apples last year &amp; today she asked one of the girls if
                    they had any beets <unclear>parsonips</unclear> at their house I <orig
                        reg="don't">dont</orig> know what she would give for them but if she had
                    them soon she would be glad to get <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> of the
                    kind as we <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> have any extra variety now Nothing more
                    at present</p>
