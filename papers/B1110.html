<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, August 9, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How reports that he and his staff have been sick of late, and unable to complete
                    all of their duties.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Aug 9/65</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I send an apology for a report which is the best I can do under the
                    circumstances.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been ill ever since I have been here and quite unfit for the transaction
                    of a novel business. The Mountain air, from which, as I told you I hoped so
                    much, has had anything but a good effect upon me, and but that I earnestly
                    desire to be of yet further use on the cause of the oppressed I should at once
                    ask to be relieved indeed if you have anybody ready to go right to work I wish
                    you would send him here. I am mending slowly now, and hope within a week or so
                    to be in <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>condition for active service. I have never before been sick
                    enough to interfere with my duties and so make a poor patient.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Tukey has also been sick and is now, though he is recovering, and with care
                    will be at work next week, Another Assist came
                    back sick after a weeks absence so you see that this is not altogether the
                    "healthy region" I imagined it. However we will do the best we can. Trusting a
                    Kind Providence for the result.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours feebly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W. Storer How<br>Capt &amp;c</i></p>
