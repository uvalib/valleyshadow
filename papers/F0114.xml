                    that we had a great battle for seven days and I let you know that we had very
                    hard times during the fight <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> We had to follow the generals
                    wherever they went and some times they took us in the thickest of the fight and
                    one day as I was riding past our <orig reg="breastworks">Brstworks</orig> amid
                    the roaring of Cannon and the rattle of musketry I <orig reg="heard">hurd</orig>
                    a fellow say to me Peter how do you do <orig reg="when">wen</orig> I looked
                    around and saw <orig reg="Daniel">Denyel</orig> and <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> Eackerd
                    coming towards me I let you know that it makes a fellow feel good to see his
                    brother and friend in such a time as that was<pb n="2"/> I must soon come to a
                    close for this time Write soon again and write often I give my best respect to
                    you and all my friends</p>
