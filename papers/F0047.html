                        <u>Dear John</u>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">Notwithstand this is a very warm day. I will try and exert myself sufficiently to
                    answer yours of the 26<sup>th</sup>
                    inst. which came to hand this morning. Nothing
                    definite has yet been done towards our leaving. This place, but the troops now
                    here, are changing position so often that it would take a very sudden and
                    unusually strange movement to surprise us. Genl's
                    Ord &amp; Shields, have both returned, it is supposed to the vicinity of <i>[unclear: 
                        Carletts
                    ]</i> Station Kings division, has also gone some place, no one knows
                    exactly where. There was considerable excitement here for a day or two over the
                    retreat of Gen Banks and knowing ones anticipated a
                    little warm work for our division. We have not had a ha<i>[added: n]</i>d at it yet, but are ready any moment.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">Warm and all, as the weather is here, we still keep up Company &amp;
                    Battallion drills, and I tell you it makes the boys sweat.</p>
<p class="p10">By the way, when I think of it, I left my "letter box" at home, unlocked. I wish
                    you would take it in charge, and lock it some way or other, so that <u>no one</u> can get hold of or read any of the letters
                    therein contained. Should I not return <u>burn all</u> the
                    letters.</p>
<p class="p10">I visited the Fourth Cavalry the other day. A portion of each company is still in
                    Washington but they have been expected out every day for a week past. Bacon,
                    (now "Ordinance Sergt." for the Regt)is amongst those from Blood's Company in the
                    city. The Regt is now joined to our division. They
                    marched some place last night with three days rations. They started on the road
                    to Richmond. Don't know where they are going, or when they will be back. My love
                    to all at home. Respects to all friends</p>
