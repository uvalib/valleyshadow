<p class="p10">My Dear David</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to you by Mr. R. this morning. hope you have rec'd it safely. As Hamie is going to your town in the morning I will
                    write you a few lines by him, &amp; if you did not get my letter to day this note will tell you that I wrote. Hamie will
                    stay in Staunton until Saturday evening. Can you not come home with him I do
                    wish you would then you would not be so lonely riding. Can't you come? I do want
                    to see you my love. This week has seemed very long to me as you were not here
                    last Sabbath. I wrote a long letter to Rennie on <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> yesterday the first
                    one I have written to her since my arrival at Mountain Palace. I tried to give
                    her a description of my new home but failed in the attempt.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. John Rippeton &amp; Miss Ella Stafford are to be married next Thursday if
                    they live. I wish you were here to night my love. You
                    must come Christmas if you live &amp; stay all the week. I know we shall
                    have a delightful &amp; happy time. Pa will be at home then. Cousin Gordon
                    is coming to go on a hunting tour over the Mountains with you &amp; Hamie.
                    he May not come, but I want you to come my love. We are looking for papa this
                    week.</p>
<p class="p10">I love you with all my heart &amp; soul &amp; think of you every hour
                    &amp; wish I could see you &amp; be near that you could come to see me
                    often. I love to have you with me my heart is light &amp; happy when you are
                    near My love Can't you come with Hamie Saturday evening? I want to see you so
                    much more then I can tell I hope you will come with him
                    your ride will be so much more pleasant to have some
                    one with you I do not like to think of you coming that road so late at
                    night alone. I am always anxious about you until you get here safely I love you
                    with all my heart &amp; soul &amp; ever shall while I live. Come my
                    heart says come. I send you a loving kiss. God bless you my love &amp; let
                    you come.</p>
