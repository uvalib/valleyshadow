<p class="p10">My dear sweet brother</p>
<p class="p10">I received your very dear letter several weeks ago &amp; can say some part of
                    it made me very happy; I thake this leasure hour to respond but how must I respond not knowing whether
                    my letters are welcome or not but hoping they are I will try &amp; interest
                    you. My health is very good &amp; I must not murmer of my happiness for my dear Father only knows what I have borne;
                    the chastning rod has been severe but I rejoise in Christ that he has been with me or this
                        feble frame would have sunk beneath the rod. yes
                    brother you no nothing when the last earthly friend
                    forsakes you then &amp; not till then will you know (what) what this sis of yours has borne I have felt that I was like
                        Jobe forsaken by all but thank God he has never
                    forsook me I hope you will never know what it is to be forsaken by all <u>for there is one that</u>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I dont think will ever forsake you no neve
                    <u>I will still remember thee</u>. I hope ere this letter
                    reaches you that you may be enjoying the best blessing that God ever bestowed on
                    man &amp; that is religion for it is the cheaf
                    <i>[unclear: unsorn]</i> of mortals here below &amp; our only <i>[added: sure]</i> happiness what would I have done if it
                    had not been for it. cast down forsaken by all but God I ask what would I have
                    done I know not. brother are you happy I ask the question I hope to get an
                    answer from you personaly soon if you are not let
                    me as a sister tell you where I fear you are rong you
                    said in you letter you had heard reponse from old
                        Ang; that has cased
                    you cheek to light up with anger dear bro do you think
                    that is right for you to let that anger rise what does our bible teach us not to
                    get angry at those that persecute us. let me here cast a verse or two.
                    "Wherefore my beloved bro let evry man be swift to
                    hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man work Ah not the
                    righteousness of God you must lay a side all such things &amp; recd with meekness the engrafted word will change
                    any dear dear Willie if he has not <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>which is abe to save your soul". note brother I do not think you have heard any
                    thing compared to what I have heard but thank God it did not make me angry it
                    made me pray for those that talked about me &amp; you &amp; treat them
                    kindly &amp; I feel that God will help me to live right though my
                    temptations are great do pray for me that I may be able to withstand all these
                    trials.</p>
<p class="p10">You said in your letter that you knew that my concience did not reprove me for what I had done to you with out it was
                    for loving you Oh Willie you are cruel to think that my concience (would) would reprove me for that which God has put in my
                    heart did I not love another or have you forgotten; &amp; did I not pray to
                    God to change me if it was his will &amp; how soon did the change come I do
                    not remember of ever haveing one regret let alone <i>[added: reproof]</i> of conciense for loving you no I believe that it will all work together for
                    our good I rejoice brother that I have more confidince in you this day than I have had for many month for God is able to change our enemys if we trust him &amp; I believe that he already I am resigned
                    to his will what ere that be <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>My concience never told me that I had done the rong but most evry person told
                    me so &amp; I wrote to you to know if it was so &amp; you made no reply
                    so I thought I would confess &amp; see if that (would) would clear me just
                    so you dont blame me I care not for others. You say let
                    the past be forgotten can you forget it I will join with you in improve the
                    future; but are you <i>[added: we]</i> doing it I hear you
                    have quit the distilery &amp; then I heard for
                    a short time that you would go on if you had grain brother where is concience does not the cry of some poor little child
                    cry for bread move your heart when you put that grain in the hopper to crush Ah
                    perhaps that father has spent his wages this day for the liquor that you have
                        sole &amp; that dear little one is crying for
                    bread Oh dear brother cant I persuade you to to reflect
                    for one moment if you can &amp; think then go on if you are going to improve
                    the future commerce now not for my sake do I ask you to do it but for you own;
                    now brother dont let this make your cheek flush with
                    anger but forgive me if I do any do it with the best of motives for your future
                    happiness. dear brother it greaves me very much to
                    think that you came home &amp; did not come to see me but perhaps Walker did
                    not tell you that I wished to see you I am very anxious to see you &amp;
                    hope you will come at the reception of this letter I was told last Sabbeth by a friend that they thought you was afraid to
                    meet me Oh Willie what have I done have I committed murder that any one should
                    shun me or fear me &amp; especially the one that was once my best friend
                    brother I think it would be best for us to meet the sooner the better cant you
                    take time enough to spend a day or night I do ashure
                    you I shant hurt you I will treat you as a sister
                    would a brother &amp; I wish to have a talk with you not injure you or hurt
                    you I will avoid evry thing that will go to hurt or
                        wont in the least now dont
                    let it be said that as brave a man as you have been is a
                        fraid of a girl let me ask you to come for my sake as soon as you get
                    this so that may not make people talk I have much to right but will wait
                    &amp; tell you when you come I will tell you all about the
                    <i>[unclear: infare]</i> when you you come please excuse all imperfections</p>
