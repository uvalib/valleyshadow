<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Statement of George
                    Partridge, February 6, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Partridge writes that he has known Tukey for some twenty years, and worked with
                    him in Portsmouth, Virginia before Tukey was transferred to Staunton. He
                    testifies to Tukey's character and reputation among the local population and
                    suggests that the accusations against Tukey are the product of a conspiracy on
                    the part of George Cook and George Graham.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Feb 6th 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Having heard with regret that complaints have been made against Mr F. S. Tukey,
                        Asst Supt Freedmens Bureau at
                    this place it gives me much pleasure to say that I have been intimately
                    acquainted with Mr Tukey for the last twenty years. I was at Portsmouth Va during the whole of the time that he was Asst. Supt. of Freedmen there which
                    according to the best of my recollection was about twenty one months and during
                    the whole of the time was in the service of the U.S. Government and had in my
                    employ about fiftly colored men nearly all of whom drew rations from Mr Tukey
                    and being then as I am now and always have been an ardent friend of the
                    oppressed colored people I was much among them and not only them but all their
                    Teachers and consequently had a great opportunity to learn their sentiments with
                    regard to Mr Tukey, and can say that he was universally beloved and respected by
                    all parties.</p>
<p class="p10">I left there soon after the <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>surrender (on account of sickness) and
                    went to Mass where I remained until the first
                    of last Nov., when I came to this place and soon
                    after received the appointment of US Inspector of Spirits and have as in
                    Portsmouth mingled freely with the colored people both publicly and privately
                    sometimes speaking to them of Mr Tukey, and they invariable spoke in the highest
                    terms of him and I never had heard one single word of complaint against him by
                    anyone until Lieut
                    Geo T Cook was relieved from duty here and nothing
                    since only what I have reasons to believe come from him. I have known since I
                    have been here of a greater degree of intimacy existing between Cook and a Mr.
                    Graham of the Burial Corp and two of the female Teachers then what a sence of propriety would allow and am satisfied in my own
                    mind that these charges against Mr Tukey are malicious and originated with and
                    have been made by Lieut Cook or the said Graham
                    acting as his agent, and have been skilfully
                    carried out thus far by a combination of these four persons.</p>
