<p class="p10">Friend Mary:</p>
<p class="p10">you are doubtless thinking that I have forgot you but I asshure you that I have not, and have had so much fighting and hard
                    marching to do since we come over here that I haven't had time to do anything. I
                    suppose you have heard all about the fighting in the papers, better than I can
                    tell you, it beat all the fights that I ever was in. I could stand in place and
                    count fifty dead yankees without moving out of my tracks some of them wasn't
                        burried for five <i>[illeg.]</i> days and some
                    wasn't burried at all I don't believe. The Battle
                    field was a horrible sight. To hear the wounded and dieing moaning and calling <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> for water and for some one to
                    take them away. We layed
                    rite in amongst the dead &amp; wounded in the field
                    that night it was the dreadfulest night I ever spent. Capt. W H Randolph was killed dead and John Bowers &amp; James
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> also was killed dead. Lieut
                    W H McKinney was wounded after the fight was over by accident. We was left
                    without a oficer Charlie had to take command. I
                    couldn't give you a full account of it for it would take one too long. Lieut Carson has got back we left him at
                        <i>[unclear: Brower's]</i> Gap he is in command and our company is getting
                    small now all that is over thirty five years is getting off that didn't Volinteer or reinlist. I
                    reckon Berry <i>[unclear: Bonty]</i> will get off today or tomorrow if every
                    thing goes right. All the Boys is well as <i>[unclear: common]</i> we had <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> many away sick. <i>[illeg.]</i> got back the other day and John
                        <i>[unclear: Buret]</i> got back yesterday. I got a letter from home
                    yesterday evening I havent heard from my <i>[unclear: Duck]</i> for some time I
                    expect she has forgotten me but I hope not give her my <i>[illeg.]</i> when you
                    see her. C W. Mc. is here - he got back
                    some time ago. You ought to see us making black berry pies and eating them I
                    would like to be up there eat some that you bake for I expect you can beat us.
                    There is plenty of Blackberries over here the fields is full of them that is all
                    there is over here we are camped about five miles from Gordonsville. we have a
                    firstrate camp I expect we will stay here awhile if the yankees dont run us out
                    - we come up on the <i>[illeg.]</i> C.H. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> and marched from there
                    here. we had a fine shower of rain yesterday morning I must close as it is
                    getting most <i>[unclear: dinner]</i> time write as soon as you can and give me
                    all the news for I am always glad to hear from you. Give my <i>[illeg.]</i> all
                    inquiring friends and take a portion yourself. Direct your letter to
                    Gordonsville, Jackson's Division 1st Brigade 5th Regiment Va <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    nothing more at present but still remain</p>
<p class="p10">but still remain your old friend as ever</p>
