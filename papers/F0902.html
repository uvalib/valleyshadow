<p class="p10">Wenesday December the
                                14<sup>th</sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp in front of PetersBurg</p>
<p class="p10">Kind and respected Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I take the oppertunity this evening of in forming you that I am well at presant. I receved your letter on Satterday the tenth and was glad to heare from you and that you was all well. I
                    would have answered your letter sooner but we have not been in camp since Friday
                    evening about six oclock only a little while on
                    Monday morning and last night we came in to camp again about Eight oclock but we dont know how
                    long we will stay We have been out on a rade. We started
                    on friday evening at about six oclock and marched
                    about two miles<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and encamped for that night and the next day it comenced to sleet and rain when we was putting up our
                    tents and it sleeted the whole night and rained part of the next day. I tell you
                    that we had a rough time of it we was encamped in a field and it was nothing but
                    mud. Well now before I go any further about our rade I
                    must let you know what I seen that day. It was satterday the day I received your letter. There was two men had deserted
                    our Army and went to the rebles and took up arms
                    against us and they were captuer sometime ago and on
                        satterday they were both hung between one and
                    two oclock. They were marched in <i>[deleted: in]</i> front a regiment and a bras band and <i>[deleted: ]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: their cofins carried alongside of
                        them.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> There cofins was set
                    down along side of the gallos and they were marched
                    up on the platform with two officers and a preacher. The officers talked to
                        theme awhile and then the preacher prayed for them
                    and then the officers put the bandage on there eyes and
                    the rope around there neck. I tell you that it was not
                    many seconds to they were dead. You had better beleave it was a pretty hard site. Well now I
                    will leave that subject and go on with our rade. So we
                    started that evening about four o'clock and marched the whole night through the
                    mud halfway up our boot legs and after we got through our picket line our
                    Regiment was ahead and then we was halted and ordered to load our guns and then
                    the two front Companys was ordered to go ahead that
                    was Co A and Co F <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> and we marched on to five oclock on
                    Sunday morning and then we encamped on the bank of the
                    <i>[unclear: Nottoway]</i> river. We did not cross the river but the sixth
                        corpse had crossed the river sometime before and
                    that day about 10 oclock they commenced coming back.
                    The first that come was the pioneers on the waggons
                    with the pontoon bridges and then a lot of cattle that they had captured and
                    then the cavelry. There was a pretty long string of
                    them. I was standing on the bank of the river and I seen John Boggs and he said
                    that your brother got wounded. He did not say that he was bad or not. I seen
                        severall of the boys that I new. They were all well and in good spirits. There was some of them had
                    geese and chickens tied to their sadles. They had a
                    little of everything with them.<br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br> Well now I will give you the balance
                    of our trip. We did not capture anything but some sheep. There was a flock in a
                    field with them in it. You may know that our two companys went into them. We got all of them. Bill Sibert got one hind
                        quartre and Phillip got the other one and then
                    Jacob Shearer got at and cooked some of it for that was all we had to eat that
                    and a little perched corn. We eat some of it and then we
                    started back. It was about 3 oclock and then I only
                    seen part of ther army. We could not see anything but
                    horses and men. There was some of the Cavelry in
                    front of us and they did put<br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br> fire to all the buildings along the road
                    and some of them was most splendid houses but they are paying them for burning
                    Chambersburg. We came into our camp that night. It was about 2 oclock when we landed in camp. There was some of the
                    boys did not get in that night at all. Phillip was one of them that did not get
                    in and there was a good many others that did not make it in to camp that night
                    but I made out to get in and night watch at that for my feet was most awful sore
                    and the <i>[illeg.]</i> in my shouldier but them
                    that did not get in to camp that night had it better than we had for we had to
                    march right back in the morning again about 2 miles and they<br><br>[<i>page 7</i>]<br> saved
                    saved that and we encamped in the woods that morning and stayed there until
                    yesterday evening to about 6 oclock and then we
                    marched back to our camp. You had better believe that we slept good after we got
                    our supper. There was some of the boys feet got that sore and some of them froze
                    that they could not put on their shoes. My feet did get a little sore but I
                        maid it to camp.</p>
<p class="p10">Well now if we stay here I will try and hunt him up and see how he is now. I have
                    wrote once a week to you since I cam out and I want you
                    to do the same and then I will know if you get them all or not. You sent me your
                    likeness and little Annys. I did not get Marys I dont know if you sent
                    it or not.<br><br>[<i>page 8</i>]<br> So I think that I will bring letter to a close for this
                    time and when you get this letter and reads it you may give it to Father and let
                    him read it. So nothing more at presant but remains,</p>
