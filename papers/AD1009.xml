<head>Biography

</head>
<p>Robert P. Bryarly kept a diary from November 1863, when he
turned 20 years old, to November 1864.  He titled his diary
"Notes of my twenty-first year," and in it he provides
accounts of his service in Company B of the 1st Virginia
Cavalry.  Bryarly briefly chronicles troop movements,
skirmishes with the enemy, visits to relatives while on
furlough, and the deaths of comrades.  The diary ends with an
injury in late 1864.  According to a register of the
Confederate Hospital at Charlottesville, Virginia, Bryarly
returned to duty on April 7, 1865.</p></div1></front>
