                    from carrie, I will now write again and I hope you may get it soon have Sad sad
                    news to communicate I told you in my last of father being as well as usual but
                    alas alas I now have to tell you he is no longer with us his chair is vacant his

                    walked into the parlor and came in and set on the foot of the lounge <i>[added: about 12<sup>oclock</sup>]</i> asked
                    what the boys were doing laid down on the loungle Lillie put the cover on him

                    matter called Mary she was up stairs she came as
                    quick as possible but he was gone we applied mustard to his wrists &amp;
                    ankle rubed his breast with spirits, hurried some on
                    for the doctor but nothing could be done his pulse beat awhile after we all got
                    to him but he was gone and distressing is the thought to think that he went off
                    almost without my knowing it and I was setting beside him, but it is a
                    consolation to know that our loss is his eternal gain, we buried on yesterday

                    dear brother we would like to see you and your little family in Va but it is hardly worth
                        while to ask you to come now in these troublesome times when there is
                    so much dificulty in travelling and I dont see how you could come as they are taking every one
                    now nearly in the army perhaps you are now in, This is really a gloomy time now
                    for our confederacy the last news we had the yankees had captured the salt works
                    and if so will destroy them I suppose as much as possible but cant help them long I dont think and
                    Savannah was evacuated it is really dark and gloomy but I still have hope that
                    we will eventually come out Victorious and free, when this war does close I hope
                    we will all be spared and meet again. I suppose we will continue on as we are
                    not make any change I dont expect while the war lasts I
                    think I told you when out that father has made a will it has not been altered
                    that I know of the Bank stock is intended for you we will try and manage it
                        <i>[unclear: for]</i> you until we meet Give our Love to <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    Gambles folks and all enquiring friends [onto top
                    of first page] I hardly know how to direct this so that you will get it soon I
                    told Mrs <i>[unclear: See]</i> yesterday to write to Mr <i>[unclear: See]</i>
                    and tell him to write an obituary and put it in the Central and request the
                        <i>[unclear: southern]</i> Presbyterian to copy and perhaps you would get
                    one of the papers before you would get <i>[illeg.]</i> letter</p>
