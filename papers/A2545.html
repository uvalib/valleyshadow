<p class="p10">Tuesday, 10 P.M.<br> July 15<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dr. Wife</p>
<p class="p10">We have just been ordered, by telegraph, to report at once to Gen. Jackson at Gordonsville,
     with wagon, maps &amp;c, so we are obliged to be off early tomorrow morning, and I shall be <i>[unclear: 
      deborred
     ]</i> the privilege of coming home to see you before I leave, which I am very sorry for, I
     had hoped to have a days notice of a movement, and then I could have
     slipped home, but it is too late to think of now, and my horse is not feeling very well either
     and will have a long ride to make tomorrow. The enemy has made some demonstration towards
     Gordonsville and Gen. Jackson is moving up that way I suppose, from the order <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to
     us. I will leave the pitcher at Dr. Young's so you can get it from there -- I shall miss my
     clothes some that I left at home, but I may have a chance to send for them, or I will direct
     you how to send them to me -- I can get along for a time. The cars are not running up to
     Staunton now -- they are all employed for army movements. I suppose it will not be long until
     they run again, but I shall find some way to write to you, which I will be sure to attend to. I
     must go to rest, for I shall get little enough at best tonight -- May God bless and keep you
     all safe -- do not despond, but trust in him that doeth all things well &amp; wisely, and
     who ruleth over all.</p>
<p class="p10"> A kiss for my children and my love to all -- </p>
<p class="p10">Good bye -- Your Aff husband</p>
