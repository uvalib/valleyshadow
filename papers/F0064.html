<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">January 23<sup>d</sup> 1864 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Manassas Junction Va </p>
<p class="p10">Dear John: </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of The 18<sup>th</sup> came duly to hand, and found us all in
                    usual good health. At present there is not one man in the Regiment on the sick
                    list, and, in fact, for the past six months, our sick report has only averaged a
                    fraction over one man per- day.</p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Murdock of Pittsburgh. He reported
                    all well, when he left the city. He left Camp on the noon train to- day, for
                    Washington.</p>
<p class="p10">One regiment of our Brigade (The 5<sup>th</sup>) started to- day for
                    Alexandria, where the go to do guard duty at Government
                    warehouses &amp; RR Depot. The right wing of
                    the 9<sup>th</sup> has been detailed to take the place of the 5<sup>th</sup>, at the "Junction" about a mile and a half from this
                    place. The boys did not<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> much like the idea of leaving their
                    comfortable quarters here, to occupy those built by another Regiment. Still they
                    will be much better off, than if they had no quarters to go into.</p>
<p class="p10">During the past few days we have been having very mild &amp; pleasant
                    weather. It has been very comfortable either in the house beside a fire, or
                    outside in shirt sleeves. The delightful weather is the only redeeming quality I
                    have seen in all Virginia. </p>
<p class="p10">Will forward an application for leave of absence, latter part of next week -- no
                    intervening Providence. Well, probably, hear from it about the latter part of
                    the week following. </p>
<p class="p10">My love to all the folks. Respects to enquiring
                    friends </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affect Brother </p>
