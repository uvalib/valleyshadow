                <p>I have not heretofore congratulated you upon your success. I do it now, but I
                    never for one moment doubted it. Your people are <hi rend="underline"
                        >appreciative</hi>, and of course you could not fail.</p>

                <p>I did not expect <unclear>Jenkin</unclear> to make it, but are greatly
                    disappointed at <unclear>Longeneck's</unclear> defeat, and fear it is mainly due
                    to inertness and inactivity. I believe from all I have heard, that much energy
                    and industry as were exhibited in your district and mine, would have moved him--
                        <pb n="2"/>We must however make the most out of what we have, and rely on
                    South Americans, and Douglassites, to help us out if we are in a minority, as I
                    fear we will be in the next Congress.</p>

                <p>I have just returned from <abbr expan="Philadelphia">Phila</abbr> have been
                    looking over the <hi rend="underline">Senatorial</hi> ground, and have very
                    decided convictions upon the subject. I know your love and admiration for Old
                    Thaddy, he is worthy of it. He will however be <unclear>overlooked</unclear> by
                        <orig reg="McClure">M'Clure</orig>, as will all other Eastern candidates,
                    and the contest will rest between him and a certain man. But here again I am in
                    your own district and <orig reg="McLure">M'Clure</orig> told me with <del
                        hand="h1"/> evident votes <unclear>position</unclear>
                    <pb n="3"/> what a splendid fight <hi rend="underline">they</hi> had made for
                    you.</p>

                <p>One thing I do know about you, that is your honor and integrity are legend <del
                        hand="h1"/>. I can therefore <unclear>un</unclear> myself to you without
                    prejudice, if you <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> agree with me.</p>

                <p>Cameron can not afford to let <orig reg="McClure">M'Clure</orig> be elected. He
                    will beat him if he can with somebody and I have reason to believe he prefers
                    me. Our friend Alex Cummings told me he thought I could make it without doubt,
                    if I worked for it. I have many influences East working for me, &amp; some
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> that I am not detail, enough however I can <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <pb n="4"/>to make a less sanguine man than myself look upon the prospect as
                    good.</p>

                <p>What I want to know of you, is what you think of it? and whether in any
                    contingency you can or will do <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> for me? You
                    may rely upon this (I think) that the struggle will be between <orig
                        reg="McClure">M'Clure</orig> (<hi rend="underline">your constituent</hi>)
                    and myself, unless I throw my aid to some person more likely to beat him --</p>

                <p>Write now, fully &amp; frankly -- the letter shall be treated as I know this
                    will be by you, sir as strictly confidential.</p>
