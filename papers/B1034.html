<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: George T. Cook to R. S.
                    Lacey, June 30, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Cook's report on the court system notes that the main problem in securing justice
                    lies with the local magistrates, who are reluctant to pursue complaints against
                    whites made by blacks.</p>

<p class="p10">June 30<sup>th</sup> 1866.</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to report in compliance with the requirements of Circular No 10 C.S. from H<sup>d</sup>qrs
                    Asst. Com<sup>r</sup>
                    State of Virginia - that I have attended all Criminal trials to which I have
                    been summoned before the Civil Courts of this Sub-Dist., in which colored persons were concerned. The result to
                    the interests of the freedman of restoration of jurisdiction to the Civil
                    Courts, has been to make it very difficult for him to obtain preliminary hearing
                    before local Magistrates who seem to dislike taking notice of complaints of
                    Freedmen unless directed to do so by this office. I do not know of an instance
                    in which the complaint against a white man has been noticed upon application of
                    the freedman.</p>
<p class="p10">In the Circuit Court the Judge has treated all cases in which Freedmen were
                    concerned with impartiality and fairness, and the law respecting their testimony
                    has been carried out in good faith.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Sir<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your Ob<sup>t</sup> Servant</p>

                        Lt and Asst. Supt</i></p>
