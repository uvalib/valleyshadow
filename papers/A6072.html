<p class="p10">Camp near Hamiltons Crossing </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">You have no doubt heard of the battle of Chancellorsville before this and you may feel uneasy
     about me I will now try to quiet that uneasiness by writing a few lines to you for the purpose
     of letting you know that I am safe with no broken bones. but I made a very narrow escape
     indeed. There was a shell exploded a few yards from me one of the pieces of which struck in the
     ground by my side throwing the dirt and gravels over me my eyes were blackened and bruised up
     and my right hand was struck bruising and swelling it so that I could not do duty for a couple
     of days but I am thankful that I was permitted to escape from any worse wound. I am now in the
     company but my hand is still right sore. The last letter I wrote I stated that every thing was quiet so far as I was able to judge but the next
     morning the cannon began to roar near Fredericsburg we were
     ordered out and got to the old battle ground that evening. we
     lay<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Smiley59b.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley59b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      at the same place on Thursday and on Friday we started and marched
     to within a couple of mile of Chancellors. There was a
      prety heavy skirmish that evening but we were not engaged. on
     Saturday our division and Genl A P Hills division started around
     the enemys right and came out above them at the junction of the Culpeper &amp; Orange
     &amp; Fredericksburg turnpike roads. Hills division and the third brigade of our division
     were sent on in front and attacked the enemy driving them out of their position and
     entrenchments which were well chosen &amp; strengthened considerably Saturday night was
     spent in maneuvering and occasional skirmishing in one of these skirmishes General Jackson lost
     his arm which we all feel to be a sore bereavement to us Sunday morning found us fronting the
     enemy they being sheltered by breast works which they had thrown
     up during the night nothing daunted however we charged them they breaking and running like
     frightened sheep we charged them thus out of two diferent works
     the last one being a very strong work it was here that we lost the most men as our
     reinforcements did not come up in time they planted a battery and graped us driving us back<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/Smiley59c.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley59c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      a short distance but our support coming up at this time we drove
     them from every part of the field and all that kept their defeat from becoming an utter route was the difficulty of getting through the thick growth of bushes
     between that and the river. On Sunday night both armies formed another line of battle and
     commenced fortifying. Monday &amp; Tuesday was spent in working on breast works. &amp; Wednesday we received the joyful news that the enemy had
     crossed the river. We then started for camp with light hearts, yet, still greiving for the loss of many brave &amp; good men Among them I will mention the
     name of our General. Paxton from Lexington. in our brigade the loss was over six hundred about
     fifty of these were killed dead others will die of their wounds. In our company Sergt J B. McCutchan was wounded in the head Lieut Carson in wrist Corporal Cochran in ankle severly
     James T Beard in foot Robt Wiseman in hand M Smith in hand J Runkle
     in leg Joseph Black and Sam Hite and several others slightly the list will be in the newspapers
     of Staunton soon as it was sent this morning Cyrus Strong was wounded severely it is<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="images/Smiley59d.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley59d.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      thought doubtful by some whether he will get over it or not Hugh
     Beard was wounded and Jim Reece is wounded again. Lieut Charles
     Calhoun had his leg taken off, and many others are wounded but I will not name them We captured
     about ten thousand prisoners took a good many peices of cannon
     fifteen thousand stand of small arms and many other things such as knapsacks
     <i>[unclear: Gum]</i> cloths, &amp;c. they also left five
     hospitals in our possession containing near a thousand patients the most of them very badly
     wounded. but I will close for this time by asking you to write soon. Excuse all mistakes as
     this was hastily written. Give my love and best respects to all enquiring friends and relations and receive a due share yourself </p>
<p class="p10">from your affectionate Brother</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Thomas M Smiley</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S When you write let me know whether you have got the blanket I left
      in staunton or not and anything else of interest. I suppose that the same directions will
      answer for letters sent to us now, we are nearer hamiltons crossing than Guinea but I do not
      know that there is a post office at Hamiltons<br> Write Soon<br> Thomas M Smiley</p>
