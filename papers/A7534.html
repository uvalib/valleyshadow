<p class="p10">Dear Bro.</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter is to Hand Your suggestion is good, but never think of coming to
                    Winchester to do business as it would not do from the fact H. &amp; E. are
                        hear &amp; Bro's.
                    being opposition to Each other is rediculos More
                    So in the town they were raised I think with you We ought to go into business
                    and I am willing to go if We had the money. Martinsburg would be a good points
                        possesing all the advantages Winchester does
                    &amp; I Suppose Staunton Would but John is there, dont depend on no one doing any thing for
                    you but let us save our Mony &amp; do for
                    our-selves that is best dont think because John has
                        mony he will help you<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>if you do you are
                    mistaken as I am better acquainted with Human nature than to Expect such a
                    thing. I know what I can do but poverty prevents me from carrying it into
                    execution I know I attend to all the business hear that
                    is the most Important Business, &amp; I know I am fully competent to do
                    business all I want now is mony and that I am
                    determined to get some time or other in my life I have now given you my opinion
                    &amp; if you can get John to rent us the Store in Staunton I will come I
                        dont
                    wont him to give me any thing I would spurn it I wont to make it and All I ask is a chance. Write Soon love
                    to all My letter is Written in a Hurry</p>
