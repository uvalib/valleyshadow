<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Pastor writes that his Company, without him because of an illness, traveled
                         to destroy a dam but was unsuccessful. He says that he and his fellow
                         soldiers are considering joining the regular army so that they can have

<p class="p10">Dear Annie,</p>
<p class="p10">[picture of a cannon firing beside a "Stars and Bars" flag with 10

<p class="p10"> I am again seated by the same old fire place, where I was when I last wrote
                         you. We have just returned from one of the severest marches we have had
                         since we came into the service - namely a trip to the potomack. <i>[deleted: 2]</i> Two weeks ago yesterday there
                         was a detachment of 4 companies from our Regiment sent to <i>[illeg.]</i>
                         so 4 on the Potomack, for the purpose of
                         breaking up the dam. I was unwell at the time, consequently was left behind
                         to take care of the baggage in company with three or four others who were
                         in a like condition. Our company was one of the 4. they took the cars at
                         Stephenson's Depot which is within a few hundred yards of our camp. from
                         thence they went to Charlestown, where they stayed a day. from thence they
                         marched through Shepards Town on to the dam<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> which was for the
                         time to be the scene of action. They had two pieces of the Rockbridge
                         Artillery with them for the purpose of scaling the walls. But oweing to the fact of their being so many Yankees on the opposite shore, &amp; the
                         almost impossibility of breaking the dam, they returned to martinsburg
                              (bring<i>[added: ing]</i> with <i>[added: them]</i> 8 prisoners - Consisting of 1 Capt, 2 Srgts
                         &amp; 5 Privates. They had been sent out as a scout &amp;
                         unfortunately for themselves were discovered by our <u>galant</u> &amp; <u>brave</u>
                         Coln. Ashby who with a detachment of his
                         Cavalry soon surrounded them &amp; in a few moments they were our
                         prisoners. They fought like heroes till the very last, &amp; even after
                         our men had taken them, one of them attempted to shoot, but it was no use.)
                         Our men remained in Martinsburg untill the 16<sup>th</sup> at which time the rest of the Regiment joined
                         them in Company with the whole of the Brigade. We then went to <i>[unclear: sam
                              so]</i>
                         <i>[illeg.]</i> - which is still higher up the river. For the purpose of
                              breaking<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> it, in which we succeeded nobly, loosing but one man. he was a member of the
                         Rockbridge Rifles by the name of Parks. It would be useless for me to
                         attempt to give you a full discription of
                         all that we saw &amp; heard, whilst on the afforesaid
                         expidition. suffice it to say that we had the
                         pleasure of seeing a goodly number of Yankees. <i>[unclear: paid]</i> the
                         compliments of the day by throwing <u>bomb</u> shells at
                         each other &amp; many other attractive scenes to
                         numerous to narrate at present I must haten on to
                         a conclusion as it is verry cold this morning so
                         much so that I can scarcly write. I recognize a letter from Tom B. last
                         night, was glad to hear that he was enjoying himself so much with the
                         ladies. Hope he may <i>[added: be]</i> successful in
                         winning the affections of some fair maid.</p>
<p class="p10">I wish I could be with you all tomorrow to get something good at eat for
                         dinner, but alas; it cant be so. How great the
                         contrast will be with<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>
                         <u>many</u> of <u>us</u> this
                         Christmas to what it was last. But I hope this will not be your lot. May
                         you have a merry time in the <i>[unclear: prayers]</i> of us all.</p>
<p class="p10">A great many of us have almost come to the conclusion to join the regular
                         army, as there is no prospect of us ever getting home any other way. I we join the regular service we will be allowed
                              <i>[unclear: 60]</i> days furlough &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> of 50
                              <i>[illeg.]</i> which is considerable <i>[illeg.]</i> to many - Well
                         I must stop for the present &amp; make some arrangements for dinner.
                         Give my best respects to Miss Jenni &amp; Mollie &amp; all the rest
                         of my lady acquaintances.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours in haste</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Tony P</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S.<br> Let me hear from you after the hollyday, &amp; give me a full history.
                              I had forgotten to say that I had received your last, the perusal of
                              which was a source of <u>much</u>
                              <u>pleasure</u> I assure you<br> Tony P<br><br>
