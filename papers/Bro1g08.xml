<salute>Dear sister:</salute>
</opener>

<p>Knowing <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> your anxiety <lb/>
to hear from us at this time, after receiving <lb/>
<name type="person"><orig reg="Andrew's">Andrews</orig></name> letter,
I write to inform you that we <lb/>
are both well, except that <name type="person">Andrew</name> is somewhat <lb/>
wearied &amp; broken down from a march of about 11 <lb/>
miles on yesterday, under a broiling sun &amp; some <lb/>
dust &amp; but a little water,
we forming the rear of about <lb/>
ten or twelve thousand soldiers &amp; consequently were <lb/>
crowded out from the wells, that being
the <orig reg="principal">prin-<lb/>
cipal</orig> source, until the middle of the evening <lb/>
when we fell back from the main body. <ref n="1" target="n1">[1]</ref><lb/>
<orig reg="We&mdash;">We</orig> <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">that is
<name type="person">Jackson's</name> brigade,
<name type="person">Johnston</name>
having gone to <name type="place">Winchester</name>
</add> <orig reg="&mdash;camped">
camped</orig> in the woods
last night &amp; this <lb/>
morning marched to this place about 3 &half; miles <lb/>
below <name type="place">Winchester</name>.  At our last encampment we <lb/>
were placed in an open field, under a burning <lb/>
sun &amp; orders to be at your posts &amp;
had to stay <lb/>
there for four days.  The enemy were all the while <lb/>
stationed at <name type="place"><orig reg="Martinsburg">Martinsburgh</orig>
</name> 6 &half; miles off.</p>

<p><name type="person">General Johnston</name> sent <del hand="h1">illeg.</del>
to <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Patterson</name> <lb/>
who is in command of the <orig reg="enemy's">enemies</orig>
 forces <lb/>

<pb n="2" entity="Bro1g084" pid="uva-lib:502881"/>

to send away the women &amp; children from
<name type="place"><orig reg="Martinsburg">Martins
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">burgh</add></orig></name>
<lb/>

but he refused &amp; sent back word that if
he (<name type="person"><add hand="h1" place="supralinear">Johnston</add>)
</name> would <lb/>
lay down his arms &amp; return home <orig reg="then">the</orig>
he (<name type="person">Patterson</name>) <lb/>
would forgive all past offences.  <name type="person">
<abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Johnston
</name>
offered him battle for four days, if he would <lb/>
come out of <name type="place"><orig reg="Martinsburg">
Martinsburgh</orig></name> but he would not do <lb/>
it and

<name type="person"><orig reg="Johnston">John
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">s</add>ton</orig> </name>

thinking his numbers too great <lb/>
being at <orig reg="least">lea<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">st</add></orig>
 twenty five &amp; perhaps thirty thousand <lb/>
&amp; a reinforcement of 5 thousand at the
<name type="place">Potomac</name> <lb/>
at some point between <name type="place">Harpers Ferry</name> and
<name type="place"><orig reg="Sheperdstown">Shepherds-<lb/>
town</orig></name> and his position too strong, thought it <lb/>
advisable to fall back &amp; so we have had no <lb/>
battle yet, but on Saturday evening<ref n="2" target="n2">[2]</ref> a dispatch <lb/>
was brought to the General that our pickets <lb/>
had been driven in &amp; that the enemy
were <orig reg="advancing;">advan-<lb/>
cing:</orig> we were soon drawn up in battle array <lb/>
&amp; advanced to a position,
after having been <lb/>
on the field about <del hand="h1">illeg.</del>
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">two</add>
 hours, we were taken back <lb/>
to quarters, it having turned out to be simply <lb/>
a fight between the pickets; the enemy not coming. <lb/>
<name type="person">Jackson</name> on that morning received a letter <lb/>
from <name type="person"><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Lee</name>
congratulating him upon his <lb/>
promotion to brigadier General, the letter<lb/>

<pb n="3" entity="Bro1g085" pid="uva-lib:502882"/>

came in advance of the official announcement.  <lb/>
While on the field the two Generals made <lb/>
a review of the <orig reg="troops,">troops</orig>
<name type="person">Johnston</name> of all of the forces <lb/>
&amp; <name type="person">Jackson</name> of the Virginia brigade. </p>
<p>
I like <name type="person">Johnston's</name>
appearance very well; I think <lb/>
he is a very prudent commander: indeed the
same is <lb/>
true of both: you know "prudence is the better part <lb/>
of valor."<ref n="3" target="n3">[3]</ref>
  What is going to be done I don't know; <lb/>
the soldiers never know the intentions of their
<orig reg="commanders">com-<lb/>
manders</orig> until it comes to execution; so we here in <lb/>
camp have as little idea of an intended action <lb/>
as you. I suppose the Yankee papers will glory over <lb/>
our falling back as an inglorious <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">
and <orig reg="precipitant">precipitan</orig></add>
retreat; but <lb/>
call it by what name you please I think that <lb/>
<name type="person">Johnston</name>
knows what he is about &amp; am very willing <lb/>
to obey his orders, although it did pester me a good <lb/>
deal for a while &amp; does yet somewhat, to go at <lb/>
things as it were blindfolded. <del hand="h1">illeg.</del>
Even <orig reg="supposing">suppo-<lb/>
sing</orig> that we could have whipped them, it would <lb/>
have been at too great a loss of life &amp; consequently <lb/>
it is more prudent to retire.  How soon we <lb/>
will have an engagement I can't tell you; but <lb/>
there must be one at some time or another. </p>

<pb n="4" entity="Bro1g086" pid="uva-lib:502883"/>

<p>
The result of the fight that took place on Tuesday <lb/>
the <orig reg="second">2<hi rend="super">nd</hi></orig> I suppose
<name type="person">Andrew</name> gave you very correctly; <lb/>
on our side <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> three killed &amp; four or five
wounded.  <lb/>
The most reliable report we get <del hand="h1">illeg.</del>
in regard <lb/>
to the loss of the Federal forces comes from <lb/>
<name type="person">
Mr. Boteler</name>, a brother of
<name type="person"><abbr expan="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> Alex
Boteler</name>, <lb/>
who says he had it from the quartermaster of <lb/>
their army to this effect: that there were <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> <lb/>
from three to five hundred in killed &amp;
<orig reg="wounded;">wounded</orig> <lb/>
however true this is I think that there is no <lb/>
doubt that their loss was considerable.<ref n="4" target="n4">[4]</ref><lb/>
 The number engaged on our side was <del hand="h1">illeg.</del>
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">the whole (except

<del hand="h1">illeg/</del> of <name type="person">Harper's</name> regiment

was supposed to
be about 3000 a great many <lb/>
of them being regulars.<ref n="5" target="n5">[5]</ref>  </p>
<p>Since writing the above I <del hand="h1">illeg.</del>
hear through one <lb/>
of our company who has been at <name type="place">
Winchester</name>, that <lb/>
they are throwing up a breastwork about one mile <lb/>
on this side of town; which looks very much like <lb/>
making a stand here, I didn't suppose however <lb/>
that we would retire beyond <name type="place">Winchester</name>.</p>
<p><name type="person">Billy Wilson</name>

<note n="1" id="n1" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg><p> On July 2, 1861, Federal troops under the command of
General Robert Patterson crossed the Potomac and moved toward
Martinsburg, West Virginia, prompting General Johnston to order Jackson
to have his troops advance and meet the enemy.  The advance guard of
Patterson's forces skirmished with Jackson's forces at Falling Waters, a
village on the south side of the Potomac.  Ultimately Jackson's brigade,
outnumbered, withdrew to a camp below Martinsburg (Wallace 15; Bean 33;
Robertson, <hi rend="italic">The Stonewall Brigade</hi>, 29-33).  Although the Liberty
Hall Volunteers acted in support of the Fifth Virginia rather than
participating directly in the battle, Captain James J. White was pleased
with their performance, bragging that "[t]he boys were cool as you
please, with shells bursting around them and bullets whistling around
their ears" (quoted by Turner, 57).  After Patterson took control of
Martinsburg on July 3, Johnston's forces remained encamped at Camp
Stephens, awaiting an attack.  But on July 7, as William Brooks reports,
Johnston, fearing that Patterson had greater numbers, ordered his troops
to fall back to Winchester (Bean 34).  </p></note>

<note n="2" id="n2" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[2]</seg><p> Saturday was July 6, the day before the troops were
ordered back to Winchester.

<note n="3" id="n3" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[3]</seg><p> General Joseph E. Johnston (1807-1891) received his diploma
from the U. S. Miltary Academy in 1829 along with his friend
Robert E. Lee.  He received praise for his service in both
the Mexican War and in the wars against the Seminole Indians.
