                <p>Waddill discusses the profitability of publishing a newspaper and feels that

                <p>Dear Sir; I recd. yours this morning, and I am sorry to trouble you so much in my
                    behalf, but I must, you know, get all the information I can, where nearly <hi
                        rend="underline">my all</hi> would be at stake; Therefore I am in hopes you
                    will excuse me for intruding on your time. My object in requesting the
                    subscription of a dozen citizens for the <hi rend="underline">first</hi> year
                    was merely to put the paper in a firm footing; I did not wish it in advance, for
                    there are but few villages where there are not a dozen men to be found, who
                    would not be willing to advertise to the amount of $30 each during the year. But
                    if 500 subscribers, (good) can be obtained, to <unclear>convince</unclear> with,
                    the thing would be settled. I never was there, but it strikes me that that is a
                    wealthy section of country, and that a paper could succeed well there. If we
                    succeed in getting the subscribers, I am in hopes we will be able to remunerate
                    you in some way for your kindness in taking such an interest in the enterprize.
                    If you say so, I will send my son-in-law there next Court-day, and get you and
                    your friends to make a strong pull and we will have an office there, and I
                    believe your<pb n="2"/>citizens will support it liberally. Of course your
                    Clerks, Lawyers, Merchants &amp;C., would do all they could to keep it up.
                    500 subscribers to begin with would establish the paper on a firm footing. I
                    have all the material, <hi rend="underline">and all of it paid for</hi>. I think
                    a neutral paper would succeed better than a political one, but I am <hi
                        rend="underline">Whig to the core</hi>. I presume you will be there at your
                    court day. How near Lovingston does the Railroad run? I mean when it is done,
                    and how far is Lovingston from Charlottesville? When is your court day? </p>
