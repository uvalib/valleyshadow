<p class="p10">My dear Mrs. Langhorne </p>
<p class="p10">I received your kind note by Kent and will send a few lines in reply in his
                    letter to you. After giving Kent an opportunity of seeing the Regt I recommended him to join the Wise Troop, now
                    commanded by Capt.
                    Wm Steptoe who promised me to take Kent into his
                    mess with him. I consider him second to no man in my Regt. In every way a gentleman he looks after his men &amp; sees
                    their wants are supplied. Your noble boy I am sure will do well and you may rest
                    assured that any assistance that I can give him will be cheerfully rendered. If
                    he needs anything at any time I will see that he is provided for. <i>[unclear: For
                        the]</i> cavalry have to carry all they have on their horses and have
                    but few wants.</p>
<p class="p10">I think we will have an active campaign and hope the vandals may soon be driven
                    across the Potomac again. With my kindest regards to Mr Langhorne, Lizzie
                    &amp; all of the little ones believe me very truly </p>
<p class="p10">Your friend </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Thomas T. Munford </i></p>
