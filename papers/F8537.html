<h4>Franklin County: Edward McPherson to The President
                    and Directors of The Bank of Gettysburg, January 18, 1858<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>As prescribed for in his father's will, Edward McPherson offers to sell the bank
                    building to the Gettysburg Bank and mentions his father's attentive involvement
                    in the affairs of the Bank</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Jan<sup>y</sup>. 18. 1858.</p>
<p class="p10">Gettysburg,</p>
<p class="p10">To the President &amp; Directors of<br>The Bank of
                    Gettysburg,</p>
<p class="p10">Gentlemen-- My Father's Will authorizes his Executor to sell, at public or
                    private sale, that part of <i>[added: his]</i> property not
                    specifically devised or set apart for a particular purpose.-- I accordingly
                    offer you, at private sale, the Banking house property.</p>
<p class="p10">My Father preferred, as we do, that this property, should be purchased by the
                    Bank; and he presumed that the Bank would prefer to buy it, in view of the
                    conveniences of the Establishment, the Eminent fitness of the house, the long
                    association of the location and the Bank, and the numerous disadvantages
                    incident to removal.--He also thought that the Bank would buy soon after his
                    decease; and the bill was drawn in expectation of that Event.-- He further
                    thought that the Bank, in considering the price, would be influenced by many
                    circumstances, to deal liberally with his Estate.</p>
<p class="p10">He gave all his Energies and abilities to the Bank, whose interests were the
                    subject of almost constant thought and watchfulness.-- When choice was to be
                    made-- as was the case in later years--between neglecting his own or the Bank's
                    business, he unhesitatingly and unselfishly chose the former; and those
                    conversant with his private business can easily see how it suffered from this
                    Enforced neglect. This may not be a merit in an individual; but is a rare
                    occurence, and illustrates how wholly he devoted himself to his trusts. From
                    this fidelity, the Bank has reaped large profits.</p>
<p class="p10">I suggest these things, in this <i>[unclear: comottion]</i>, with all respect
                    because they appear appropriate to the subject; and I believe they will receive
                    from the <i>[added: President and the]</i> Board the weight
                    to which they are Entitled.</p>
<p class="p10">I offer you the property at $6,500.</p>
<p class="p10">Various considerations render it desirable that we should Early know your
                    conclusion upon the proposition.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours very respectfully,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Edwd. McPherson<br>Executor of J. B.
                        McPherson</i></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
