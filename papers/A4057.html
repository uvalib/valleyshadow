      </u> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Brandy Station</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear:</p>
<p class="p10">I recd. yours of the 14<u>
      <sup>th</sup>
     </u> today, so long, on my way up here to see if Mrs. Wise's daughters had heard from home --
     &amp; as Uncle Jeff goes up tomorrow I avail myself of it to write you a few lines. I am
     much gratified that Allie has recovered from her worst state &amp; reason has resumed its
     sway -- I think she has done right &amp; am ready to sustain her -- I wrote fully in my
     letter of a few days ago &amp; hope that has come to hand. As to Lora you must do as you
     please &amp; charge as you please, I have not a word to say, only I fear you would have too
     much to do -- I want you to use your<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>own judgement, for I
     am not at home to aid you &amp; all the trial would be your own -- I know you have enough
     to do &amp; unless you were helped at the same time I fear you would only add to your cares
     &amp; I do not want that -- but as I said I cannot advise - I wrote to you to send the
     butter I hear from you that Reed has butter &amp; Cheese for me at quite a reasonable rate
     -- I am much obliged to him &amp; now the getting of them -- the ladies tell me that Mrs.
     Wise is coming down next week -- perhaps she would take charge of them especially if she has
     any one with her &amp; I will be under many obligations -- or Mr. Reed may find some one
     coming to the army who will bring them to<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Brandy Station -- where Maj. Hawks will
     take care of them -- he is at Dr. Harris' house a short distance from the depot -- have Reed
     box them securely -- &amp; I want them to come by some safe charge --</p>
<p class="p10"> Mr. W. J. Points comes down day after tomorrow &amp; if Reed can get them to him he will
     bring them down. We are on hard tack, bread &amp; meat but in very good quarters, in a
     roomy old house -- "Berry Hill", 4 miles from here -- full of broken furniture which the
     Yankess destroyed -- If my butter &amp; cheese get here I shall live very well for a long
     time &amp; they will be as cheap as any thing we buy. Get him to get you some if you can --</p>
<p class="p10"> I am very well &amp; very hard at work -- I heard today that Imboden captured 480<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Yankees at Charlestown but was retreating up the Valley Much love &amp; Kisses for
     all may our merciful God bless you -- </p>
<p class="p10"> Write to me soon - the young ladies here send you much love --</p>
<p class="p10"> My regards to Mrs. Wise &amp; family -- Tell Allie to be of good cheer.</p>
<p class="p10"> I will write to Mr. Bear in a day or two -- I am waiting to hear from some of the officers
     of the Eng.
     Rgt It was a roll of flat cap paper I wanted to send to Lt.
     Koerner -- the thick white &amp; I had put 40 sheets in one roll -- not the thin but the
     thick</p>
<p class="p10"> Good bye my love </p>
<p class="p10">Your Aff husband</p>
