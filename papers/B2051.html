<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: R. M. Manly to A. B.
                    Corliss, September 8, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Manly recommends that Corliss (who is apparently interested in a teaching post)
                    go to Staunton, which is currently without a teacher because the agency which
                    supplied them last year is unable to do so again. Manly highly recommends
                    Staunton as a pleasant place to live, and points to the relative prosperity of
                    its African American community.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    Rev. A.B. Corliss
                </b><br></p>

<p class="p10">Sep 8 ---- 8</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 4th rec<sup>d</sup>. This
                    city is already fully supplied with schools and teach. Consulting with General Brown it is concluded that Staunton is
                    the best place for you. It is a delightful place to live in, the colored people
                    are comfortable and well to do, and yet there is no provision whatever for any
                    schools for them unless you go there. The N.Y.
                    Branch F.U. Com. had schools
                    there last year, but are not able to continue them. The col'd people themselves will contribute about half a support. That
                    being the case, you had better commence school Monday the 5th of Oct. if possible.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
