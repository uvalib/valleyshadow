<p class="p10">Dear Papa </p>
<p class="p10">I received your letter a day or two ago and have commenced to answer it once or
                    twice but was interrupted. I had my mare valued at 650$. My arms have not cost
                    me a cent. One of the men gave me a rifle captured at Chancellorsville and I
                    drew a pair of pistols from ordnance wagon which I will return as soon as I can
                    capture one. I bought a sabre for 3$, the best one I have seen. Capt Steptoe sends his regards to you. He has just
                    ordered us to strike tents and I have to close. Let me know when Jimmy Langhorne
                    is coming. Love to all, </p>
<p class="p10">I remain your attached son, </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Kent. </i></p>
<p class="p10">Send me some stamps. J Kent.
                    </p>
