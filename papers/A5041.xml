                    this time. I received your note the other day and was very glad to get it. We
                    just got back to camp <orig reg="yesterday">yester day</orig> evening we went
                    down on picket today <orig reg="week">weak</orig> ago, we could see Arlington
                        <orig reg="heights">hights</orig> from Masons hill; we could see the Capitol
                    at Washington and the <orig reg="steeple">steple</orig> at <orig
                        reg="Alexandria">Alexander</orig> and all their breast works, they <orig

                    <pb n="2"/>have it fortified. We could see the steam boats going on the river be
                    low Washington. The river is a mile wide it was four miles from us to the river.
                    We would go on picket in the morning and stand until the next morning and had
                    about ten on one post, we <orig reg="were">ware</orig> in sight <orig reg="of"
                        >off</orig> their picket often but we <orig reg="didn't">dident</orig> shoot
                    not they <orig reg="didn't">dident</orig> - friday night about ten oclock we got
                    orders to to bring in the pickets and fall back about a mile to a little town
                    named <orig reg="Annandale">Anna dale</orig> and we stayed there till in <pb
                        n="3"/>day light very near in the morning and then we came about three miles
                    farther back to <unclear>Secutank</unclear> crick at the border and there was a
                    brigade of <orig reg="Mississippians">Miscippians</orig> throwing our breast
                    works and the next morning we came back to Camp. we could see their old <orig
                        reg="Balloon">Baloon</orig> go out every morning and <orig reg="evening"
                        >eaving</orig> it looked as large as a tent and as white.</p>

                <p>I don't <orig reg="know">no</orig> what we fell back for without it is to get
                    them away from their breast works out toward ours; President Davis came here to <unclear>

                    boots that are at home have some holes in the leg and they would not do me much
                    good, for I would like to have a good pair. I think that I will send my <orig
                        reg="measure">masure</orig> the next time I write. I must stop writing for
                    this time, for it is time to put on a <unclear>doger</unclear> for <orig
