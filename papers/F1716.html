<p class="p10">June 29th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg, Pa.,</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Ma:</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose you saw in the "Progress" newspaper a notice of my appointment to this
                    regiment. It was quite unexpected. I had made a request to Capt. Nicholson of this reg't to
                    recommend me to the Co. but did not expect any good
                    result. When I read the appointment in the newspaper I was under arrest in my
                    old company. In a day or two came a note from Col.
                    Barbour of the 37th asking Col. Baker to send me to
                    him as I had been appointed in his regiment. Col.
                    Baker released me from arrest and sent me on with many expressions of goodwill,
                    and wishes for my future success. The occasion of my arrest was this. Col. Baker gave an order that the 1st sergeants
                    should call out the men and make them clean out the camp - cut down the trees
                    and pile up the brush. It was Sunday and I was acting as 1st Sergent of Co. E. I refused to obey the order. I wouldn't make
                    the men work on the Sabbath, and I was order to go to my tent and consider
                    myself under arrest. It was less than a week before I heard of my appointment.
                    The reg't had two fights with the Yankees while
                    was under arrest. I didn't have to fight. They had taken my arms from me and
                    sent me back to the wagon train. So it was a good thing at last.</p>
<p class="p10">On my way to join my reg't. I came by Winchester
                    and saw Kate. She had rec'd. a letter from you
                    date in Jan. and was preparing to answer it. She
                    and I are engaged. Tell my Papa that I don't know much her father is worth.
                    Don't know whether he is worth anything or not - couldn't come within ten
                    thousand dollars of the amount to save my life. All of his good instructions
                    lost! Well, "a fool will have his own way." Quick courtship wasn't it? A weeks
                    acquaintance last September, and two days in June. I congratulate myself on
                    promptness. Great qualities in a solider. When I left Winchester Kate gave me a
                    bundle of provisions, a paper of candy, raisins, etc., some hankerchiefs,
                    trimmed my hat and did a great many things to captivate me.</p>
<p class="p10">I sold my horse for 350 dollars and my saddle for fifty. So I have 400 cash with
                    me. I wish I could get a chance to send it to Raleigh and settle Mr. Lovejoy's
                    account. I am so extravagant that I am afraid I shall spend all my money here
                    and have none, or if I get knocked over by a Minnie I would not like for the
                    Yankees to get my Confederate.</p>
<p class="p10">I am the only officer present in my company. The men are very clever. There is
                    not one among them who swears or uses any profane language. There are about
                    twenty four. When the co. started from N. G. it
                    numbered 126. At Sharpsburg last September only five. The Capt. went back a few days ago on business expecting to join us in a
                    few days. I fear that the Yankees have got him. He is a member of the Baptist
                    Church. When the company was first made up, the captain, the three lieutenants
                    and one private were all preachers. Every regiment in the brigade has a
                    chaplain; I heard a sermon yesterday. In this brigade there are the 18th, 7th,
                    33rd, and 37th and 28th reg'ts. I find a great
                    many old acquaintances among them, and on the whole have quite a pleasant time.
                    Everybody told me that my feet would be blistered, but I have been marching
                    nearly a week and have experienced no inconvenience, though several men have
                    fallen by the road. There is no straggling. All are compelled to keep up. Those
                    who are too weak or sick ride in ambulances or wagons. Lee has fully double the
                    number of men he had at Sharpsburg. Our regiment for instance had only fifty at
                    Sharpsburg, there are about two hundred and seventy give now. The other
                    regiments are the same way.</p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday and the day before our soldiers plundered far and wide - taking butter,
                    milk, apple-butter, fruit, chickens, pigs and horses and everything they could
                    lay their hands on. The people are frightened out of their senses. "take
                    anything you want but don't hurt us" is there cry. They are afraid to protest
                    against anything. It is the most beautifuly country you ever saw, the neatest
                    farms, fine houses, good fences. The whole country is covered with the finest
                    crops of wheat, such wheat as is not seen in our country.</p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday, however, Genl. Lee sent an order around
                    that all stealing and plundering should be punished in each case with <u>death</u>, that officers should be held accountable for
                    the execution of his orders, that he made war upon armed men - not upon women
                    and children. The plundering will be stopped now. I never saw people so
                    submissive and badly scared as these people in my life. It must be conscience.
                    They know how their soldiers have desolated Virginia and they fear that ours
                    will retaliate. But I can't bear it. I hate to take anything when it is given
                    from fear. Quartermasters and Commissaries and Surgeons are empowered to impress
                    everything necessary for the use of the army. But men are not allowed to have
                    anything but what they buy.</p>
<p class="p10">I heard but don't know how true it is that nine of our soldiers were shot
                    yesterday for taking jewelry from off the persons of the women. The articles of
                    war make a death the punishment for stealing, and in an enemy's country a
                    regimental court-martial has the power to inflict this punishment. Gen. Lee seems determined to stop all marauding. I
                    don't know what place we shall attack, most seem to think Harrissburg. For my part I want to stay here until the war is over,
                    and take their towns and beat their armies and live on their people. Lee's men
                    have unbounded confidence in him. The Yankees are in great perplexity - don't
                    know what point to re-inforce - don't know whether Lee will attack Harrisburg,
                    Pittsburg, Baltimore, or Washington. I want to take them all. It is glorious.
                    All the fences that are burnt now are Yankee fences. They'll be willing for us
                    to stay out of the Union hereafter. We've come back to the Union, but not as
                    they expected. Write soon. Direct to Lieut. Iowa
                    Royster, 37th N. C. G. Lane's Brigade, Pender's Division, Hill's Corps.</p>
