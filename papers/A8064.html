<p class="p10">My Dear Son</p>
<p class="p10">I was greatly surprised to find from your letter, that you were under the impression I 
was dissatisfied with the family having to pay their portion of what is due the estate.  The 
only objections I ever heard [] were from Jefferson, who objected on two points, the 
Kentucky Lands &amp; the Granny Miller Lot.  . . . As to myself I never intended to charge her 
a cent, believing the Lott was to be the consideration for her maintenance, &amp; for all the 
difference it will make to you, I would let it be settled in that way. . . .  Moreover Archy 
had the burthen of four old negroes Old Cato Esther Ben &amp; Stafford, &amp; Ben was a 
Loathsome cripple with a sore leg, but lived with Archy 15 years.  Sowers[?] estate gave 
three hundred for the keeping of a man, who was said to be a good gardener.  You are all 
my children &amp;amp;amp; I wish for nothing but justice among you.</p>
<p class="p10">//. . . .I have always my dear Son given you all due credit for your industry tact, &amp;amp; 
general good management, But then your dear Father preceded you in good management, 
or you would not have had the property which admitted of such good management &amp;
profitable results [] &amp;amp; your Grandfather also, who gave me the Land, which was 
exchanged for the aforesaid Kentucky Land.  My dear beloved Child, do justice love 
mercy, &amp;amp; walk humbly with your God.  Give yourself no unnecessary uneasiness about 
wealthy children, for in ninety nine cases out of a hundred they are the most thankless of 
human beings.  I approve of your writing to Harrison on the subject of selling Archy's 
Land. . . . I am induced to believe that it will pay Archy's debt to you . . . .What little 
money Archy has at interest, I do not wish touched, It requires no management, &amp; will 
always be available for the schooling of his children, &amp; a final resort in case of a state of 
starvation. . . . I am also anxious Gerard should sell off his surplus Land &amp; relieve himself 
of debt.  I will from time to time remind him of the necessity, but you 
can do more than any 
person on earth. Whenever I allude to his affairs, or my anxiety about his debts, he will not 
even make me an answer, or if at all, only yes or no.//. . .I do not 
think in all my life, I ever 
felt so perfectly depressed, &amp; unfit for business or social intercourse.  Every thing seems to 
me in a state of confusion &amp; helplessness. . . .Baldwin left me the day after his Mother &amp;amp; 
family went off.  If you should ever need a plain faithful industrious clerk, I can with a 
good conscience recommend Sam Dyer.  &amp; Roscoe Stuart hes just left here.  he seems to 
have a good opinion of Baldwin's sense[?].  I am pleased to see they appear attached to 
each other.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope when you receive this scrawl, you will have Fanny &amp; little ones around you.  
God bless you all my My dearest Son</p>
