<p class="p10">July 2</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg,</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Genl</p>
<p class="p10">I have your favor of the 30th ult, and am glad to learn that I misunderstood you,
                    With your letter, I received one from Mr Dull, for whom I was to appear at
                    Harrisburg today, informing me that I need not come until Friday. I will
                    therefore not be down until that day.</p>
<p class="p10">It is possible that Casey &amp; Mann would attempt to Inform testimony to
                    defame you? I certainly would not act hastily on such information<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>for
                    the man who would be brought to defame you should be
                    <i>[unclear: conoleated]</i> as a <i>[unclear: untress]</i> against any one, I
                    know that Mann has been <u>personally</u> bitter against you;
                    but I did not suppose that Mr. Casey was so, I should like to see you before you
                    take any decisive steps in the matter, for while I would not under any
                    circumstances interfere to protect any one who could be guilty of
                        <i>[unclear: having]</i> another to defame you--I would have to be very
                    conclusively assured of the correctiveness of the charge before I would<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>take any <i>[unclear: full]</i> action. Dr Eckert
                    I do not know: but Mann &amp; Casey are men from whom I would even expect
                    better things.</p>
<p class="p10">Cant you be at <i>[unclear: Cresson]</i> on Tuesday the
                    10th. I am sure that you would be warmly welcomed into our counsels, and your
                    presence would certainly be no disadvantage to you personally. I think that now
                    is the time of your life to dissipate the unfounded prejudice that has been
                        <i>[unclear: chisled]</i> against you in certain sections of our State by
                    our own political friends, Write me often</p>
<p class="p10">Truly thine</p>

                        Gen
                            S Cameron
