<p class="p10">Saturday -- Aug. 16<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Near Orange C.H.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dr. Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">We are now again on the move -- Gen Lee is with us &amp; Gen. Longstreet &amp; a host
     of men &amp; I suppose we shall make a big move now -- I have been working very hard
     &amp; until quite late, as I have not been able to write you a long letter, as I intended
     -- but now while we are lying by the road side, waiting for the army to move on, I will write
     you from under a tree My barrel came, but, poor me, the bottom fell out of the pitcher
     &amp; the butter all melted &amp; greased the potatoes before they were cooked
     &amp; they have since taken the rot and all gone to corruption -- The bread was excellent
     -- I gave a loaf of it to the Gen -- who is very fond of light bread. The onions go finely
     &amp; I carry them, while on a march to quench thirst they do it admirably. I wrote to you
     the day after the battle of Cedar Run -- there was no fighting on Sunday -- we held the Battle
     field, gathered up our wounded, buried the dead, collected arms &amp; watched the movements
     of the enemy -- we had about 900 men killed &amp; wounded &amp; I see by the late
     northern papers that they admit a loss of 1500 killed &amp; wounded. It was a very hard
     fought battle and I felt very thankful that I escaped unhurt. Monday morning the surgeons of
     the enemy came out under a white flag to carry off their wounded -- who were still on the field
     -- &amp; just after they got them a large cavalry force was seen advancing -- Gen. J. E. B.
     Stuart (Cavalry Maj. Gen. -- the noted one) who was in our front -- sent word to them that if
     they advanced any further he would seize their ambulances -- and -- "Either <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> respect
     your flag &amp; go back, or come on -- It makes no difference which" They said --
      (<i>[unclear: Bugard]</i>, the Yank Cav. Gen. in command) that
     they would go back until they could see Gen. Pope &amp; they then asked for a truce until 2
     P.M. which was granted, &amp; they came &amp; gathered up their dead &amp; wounded
     while we kept gathering arms upon the same field. When they first came on, one of Siegle's
     staff began to gather arms too &amp; one of our officers told him that was contrary to the
     rules of a truce &amp; he got mad at it, when an officer of his own army came up &amp;
     wanted to know what he was doing &amp; by whose order -- he sd he
     was one of Gen. Siegle's men &amp; was gathering up those arms by his order -- he the cursed him &amp; told him Siegle had better send some one there that
     was not a d-d fool --. The fellow succumbed &amp; went off -- Many Yankee officers came to
     the field &amp; they &amp; our men conversed freely -- Many of them were quite sick of
     the war -- They asked to have the truce extended to 5 P.M. -- which we granted -- We then sent
     back our baggage train &amp; came back that night, unmolested, to near our old camp. Since
     the battle a good many deserters have come in from the enemy -- 12 at one time -- from Western
     Va -- they say that many of them intend to desert -- even whole Regiments -- Gen. Jackson
     paroled these men &amp; let them go home. One of the 5<sup>th</sup>
     Regt in the fight was met by 3 Yankees -- he had lost his bayonet
     &amp; had no cap in his gun -- he clubbed his gun &amp; knocked one of them down (here
     he stopped --) &amp; what of the other two, said the Adjutant -- Why I ran away from them
     as fast as I could -- There was quite a scene at the preaching which Gen. Jackson ordered day
     before yesterday: he had been to <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> the 5<sup>th</sup>
     Regt to preaching &amp; was coming back, passing by the
     Brigade of Gen. Taliaferro where Mr. Ewing was preaching -- Gen. T -- says, in the midst of a
     splendid <i>[illeg.]</i> -- but at sight of the old Gray Cap coming down the road the men all
     broke &amp; rushed to the road side to cheer the Gen. as he passed -- leaving Mr. Ewing in
     amazement in the height of his eloquence. Gen. Taliaferro says he intends to have Gen. Jackson
     arrested for disturbing a religious meeting &amp; a Presbyterian one at that! We took 19
     wagon loads &amp; one car load of arms from the battle -- Gen. J. says that is the best way
     to get arms -- to go &amp; take them. Capt Lilley behaved gallantly in the action -- he
     seized to colors of the wavering regiment waving it in advance of them rallied them &amp;
     hurried them on to the fight -- Andrew Newman behaved well too &amp; was wounded in the leg
     -- Esq. Gamble lost his right arm &amp; one of the Korncofe's of North River his leg --
     Grady, son-in-law of 
      Humpheys
      was taken prisoner it is said -- There is quite a commotion in the 1<sup>st</sup> Brigade as to who shall command it now that poor Winder is no more -- the officers
     some time ago united in a recommendation of Wm Harman, at the
     earnest solicitation of his brother, for a Brig. Generalship -- from mere charity they say, of
     course not expecting him to command them -- but as soon as he hears of Winder's death they (His
     friends) press his case at Richmond &amp; produce this recommendation as evidence that the
      1<sup>st</sup> Brigade wants him -- thus caught, the officers back out &amp;
     send a counter petition that they do not want him -- &amp; ask to have Baylor made
     Brigadier &amp; so it goes -- My bottle of ink came safely -- &amp; says the welcome
     word on it that you are well -- It will be of no use to send any more provisions till you hear
     from me, but write through Maj. Bell &amp; I shall get it -- I will write as often as I can
      <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> There is no telling where we shall go to, but our faces are Northward &amp; we
     are moving -- I have money but do not see any way to send it -- so get the check cashed that I
     gave you if you need any before I send to you -- I will send the first opportunity -- Any of
     the men around you will cash the check --</p>
<p class="p10"> May God bless &amp; keep you all -- I hope to come home, if spared after this move --
     Tell the children to be good &amp; remember their Pa -- Tell Allen I hope he will be a good
     boy &amp; do what is right -- </p>
<p class="p10">Good bye -- Your aff -- husband</p>
