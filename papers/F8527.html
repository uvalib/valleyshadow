<h4>Franklin County: Edward McPherson to John B.
                    McPherson, August 26, 1857<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Edward McPherson writes to his father that he plans to profit from the recent
                    "panic in the money market" by buying shares of Reading Railroad while the price
                    remains low.</p>

<p class="p10">Ag. 26. 57.</p>
<p class="p10">424 Walt. Street<br>Phila.</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Father --</p>
<p class="p10">You will notice there is a panic in the money market -- out of which I think some
                    money can be made.-- Reading Railroad stock has fallen to 24 @ 30 -- the lowest
                    price it has reached for years.-- Its purchase at those figures is perfectly
                    secure, and sure to be money-making.-- It will rise again in a few weeks when I
                    will sell.-- I was to see Mr. Drexel, to-day. He will
                    buy me 10 shares tomorrow -- for which I will give him a check on you.-- I do
                    not recollect how much I have on deposit, but more than enough to pay this
                    bill.-- I have connected with several persons, &amp; all advise the
                    investment.-- I would not make the experiment if not considered perfectly
                    safe.-- I hope you will approve it.--</p>
<p class="p10">I saw Sheriff Thomas yesterday eve-g.-- He was at
                    the St. Lawrence in the aftn.; but did not leave
                    a card, &amp; I would not have known he was in town, but for meeting Jake
                    Ziegler on Chest. Street after tea.-- I went to the Allegheny House, &amp;
                    talked with the Sheriff for a half hour or more-- I regretted I could not spend
                    the evening with him; but I had an engagement.-- This evening, I intend going up
                    Old <i>[unclear: Patterson]</i>, in Arch Street.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        Edwd
                    </i></p>
<p class="p10">Love to Mother.--</p>
