<p class="p10">September 4th /62</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Stonewall</p>
<p class="p10">My dear friend,</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your letter yesterday, &amp; as we are
                    laying still this morning I will try and write a few lines in answer. I know not
                    when this will reach you as it is reported that a large Cavalry force has gone
                    up the Valley in our rear. The Enimy have a large
                    Cavalry force in the Valley &amp; our Cavalry being afraid of them <i>[unclear: 
                        buts
                    ]</i> us to a grate deal of trouble. We had to
                    march last night untill twelve oclock through mud &amp; rain to meet an antisapated raid on Winchester. We are camped this morning near
                    Winchester &amp; evry thing seems perfectly quiet.
                    It will hardly remain so untill night.</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose you are aware before this of the fate of your Cousin R. <i>[deleted: ]</i> our comp. is called to mourn the loss of one of
                    our bravest youths who like a young flower was cut down in early manhood. We
                    greatly <i>[unclear: 
                        mis
                    ]</i> him. All his comrads
                    sympathise with his grief stricken parent
                    &amp; relatives. I have been under the fire of the enimy
                    twist since I wrote at Sheperdstown &amp;
                        Smithfiel<i>[added: d]</i>. But by the mercies of a
                    great &amp; good God I have been spared yet a while thare has been no regular engagement since I come down, only heavy
                    skirmishing. We are ready for a fight almost evry day,
                    as both armies are getting near each other. But I will pray &amp; live in
                    hopes thare will be no more hard fighting in the
                    Valley.</p>
<p class="p10">I am glad to hear that your Cousin L. is getting well but sorry to hear that your
                    health is still declining hope ear this reaches you <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> you may be enjoying the best of health. Thare has been a great many deaths in old Augusta since I left. I
                    believe a desease cuts of as
                    many as the sword. I recieved a letter from sister
                    some time ago she said the Yanks ware in thirty miles of
                    Uncles &amp; was fearfull
                    thay
                    ware going to make a raid through thare neighborhood. She wanted to know wether she ought to go a refugeeing or gird on the armer &amp; go forth to meet the foe. I give her the advise I would to all women stay at home. I got a letter
                    yesterday from my friend John Sam he says if I ware at
                    home now I <i>[added: could]</i> not but help having the
                    blues as evry thing is so dull. I think differently I
                    am sure thare is one whose company I could always enjoy
                    let times be as thay please. Dear Kate you must have
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> me to have been musing or my mind wandering on some
                        imagina<i>[added: ry]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> reflections. I was writing with two of three by my side &amp;
                    intended <i>[unclear: sending]</i> other finishing, but never thought of it
                        untill I had sealed it, but never thought you would
                    be so strict as to follow my example. This is a beautiful day but our camp is
                    not plesant we have no shades to keep the rays of
                    the burning sun off our heads.</p>
<p class="p10">Did not know that it was Sunday untill I was informed
                    this morning. We have been mooving nearly evry day last week &amp; the days slipt by unnumber<i>[added: ed]</i> by me. I
                    hope before the cold blasts of winter sets in we may all be whare we can enjoy these blest of all
                    days at home. My health is very good. I have no reasonable right at presant to complain of any thing. My kindest regards to
                    all enquiring friends excuse this spoiled paper it
                    got wet in my knapsack &amp; thare is none to be
                    got hear. Your brother is enjoying fine health also the
                    Company. I have not hurd from eather of Bro<i>[added: s]</i> since I came down.
                    Remember me as one that loves you dearly &amp; wishes you nothing but pure
                    happiness.</p>
