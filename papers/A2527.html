<p class="p10">Ap. 10<sup>th</sup> 
 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Rude's Near Mt. Jackson</p>
<p class="p10">My Dr Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote you a line this morning by mail but I have a chance to send a line by  
 private hands as far as Harrisonburg so I will write again, as I did not answer  
 your questions.  I <u>do not think it worth</u> while for  
 you to draw the money on the check I gave you -- I prefer you should not yet,  
 for you would only get Confederate notes &amp; they would be of but little use  
 to you if the enemy came to Augusta -- so say nothing about it until I write to  
 you -- I am in hopes I shall be able to come home before long and look after  
 things.  It is not worth while for you to borrow any trouble about putting  
 things away or to apprehend any danger -- I do not think the enemy will get to  
 our county -- I feel assured they will be kept back and that our county will be  
 held -- I have great confidence in our Generals and think the Valley will not be  
 given up.  Try and keep in good spirits -- tell Allen he must be a good boy and  
 do what is required of him, or I shall have to put him with some hard master  
 that will make him work.  I hope tho' there will be no  
 need of that.  <u>Have Nelson straighten him</u> if he  
 needs it -- try &amp; keep up a friendly spirit -- it will do me so much good  
 while obliged to be away -- Take care of your funds &amp; when I draw my 1<sup>st</sup> month's pay I will  
 send you more.  Do not think about being cut off from me -- for I do not  
 apprehend any such thing -- I am doing office work altogether now -- Say nothing  
 to <u>anyone</u> about your monetary affairs --</p>
<p class="p10">	Send me 30 sheets of flat cap paper (same as Herborium) it is in the table  
 up stairs  Direct as usual &amp; to New Market <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Send to Gen. Jackson's  
 Head Quarters -- I hope Anna is better -- the 3 days storm has cut off  
 communication.  I see the daily papers -- Send mine up to the House for them to  
 see &amp; they will send them back -- I will have the paper kept on -- No news  
 on this line -- we are waiting for more from the Peninsula &amp; West Send the  
 paper to Capt. Bell A. Q. M. at  
 Staunton &amp; ask him to send it in at once to Head Quarters --</p>
<p class="p10">	My love to all -- and Kisses for Anna &amp; Nelly --</p>
<p class="p10">	Good bye God bless you 
 </p>
<p class="p10">Your Aff. husband</p>
