<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Garrick Mallery, June 3, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson's monthly report to the Bureau is relatively optimistic. He writes that
                    the local population is coming to accept the fact that freedmen are citizens,
                    and that they are more willing to settle contract disputes justly. Jackson also
                    discusses the improving prospects of the poor, and the general lack of
                    drunkenness, although medical care is still in short supply.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">June 3, 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Cir. 6 S. 1866 (BR.F&amp;A.L) I have the honor to report on the condition of Bureau
                    affairs in the 4th Division 9th Sub Dist
                    comprising the counties of Augusta &amp; Highland. The condition of
                    freedpeople is improving slowly it is true, as the large majority of Whites who
                    are employers are in straitened circumstances themselves but surely they are
                    being thrown more and more on their own resources, and are learning the value -
                    here at least - of time and money. The fact that the Freedman is now a citizen
                    is generally recognized and he is spoken of and treated with more consideration.
                    Employment is readily procured on farms, public works and lumbering at fair
                    wages and the large crop of grain and grass which will soon be ready for harvest
                    must place labor at a premium in this Valley. Numerous complaints are made at
                    this office of refusal to pay for labor under old contracts or sharp practice in
                    settlements under them but as a general rule I find the parties willing to
                    settle promptly and justly. Threats of discharge of Freedmen vote contrary to
                    the wishes of employers are very common but I attach but little importance to
                    them for the Freedmen will vote Republican almost <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to a man and the
                    farmers of the two are the most dependent upon the other as with their large
                    prospective harvest <i>[added: they have]</i> the most at
                    stake and they will care less how the Freedman votes than how he works. The
                    feeling between the Freedmen and their <i>[unclear: former]</i> masters is
                    friendly with remarkably few exceptions. The condition of the sick, aged and
                    helpless both old and young has been much improved by the issue of rations
                    received at this Station and I am hopeful that with the incoming of garden
                    vegetables, further assistance from the Bureau will not be necessary as most
                    have small garden or corn patches and these will supply considerable food, while
                    friends will be able to help also.</p>
<p class="p10">As to Medical attendance I respectfully renew my remark as to the needs of
                    freedpeople in this Division. Dr. S.C. Harris completed this month twelve month
                    gratuitous prescriptions and supply of medicine to the most indigent and
                    afflicted colored people in Staunton. I have been personally cognizant of these
                    services since my assignment to this station and I regret much that Dr. Harris
                    informs me this morning he cannot afford his services and medicine longer,
                    without remuneration sufficient to pay for the latter.</p>
<p class="p10">I received a copy of Genl.
                    O. O. Howards Cir.
                    Lett. of May 15/67 with reference to establishment
                    of "Lincoln" Temperance Associations and the general discouragement of drinking
                    intoxicating liquor and have made a suggestion in accordance therewith to some
                    of the leading <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>colored men in Staunton. If a copy of the constitution
                    and bye laws of the Central Society at Washington can
                    be furnished I have no doubt a branch organization can be established here. I am
                    happy to state that in Augusta &amp; Highland, drunkenness is much more
                    prevalent among White than colored people and <u>quite
                        exceptional among</u>
                    <u>the Whites</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Generally the future of the Freedman in my Division is full of promise. The aged
                    and orphans, of whom there are many, must continue dependent upon local or
                    National charity for some years, but the able
                    bodied male and female will shortly be able to take care of themselves,
                    physically and politically.</p>
