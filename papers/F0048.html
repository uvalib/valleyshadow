<p class="p10">June 24<sup>th</sup>/62 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Richmond </p>
<p class="p10">
                        <u>Dear Sam</u>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I will now commence to answer yours of the 17<sup>th</sup>, but it is
                    a hard matter to tell how long I may be permitted to write without being
                    interrupted by the sound of the "long roll," or the cry of "fall in." <i>[deleted: ]</i> usual thing here to form "line of battle" three or four times a
                    day. At the present moment the arms of our regiment are all "stacked," ready to
                    be grasped and used whenever on guard. </p>
<p class="p10">On Tuesday the 17<sup>th</sup> we resigned the indolence of camp life
                    near Fredericksburg, and marched to a point on the River Rappahannock 7 miles
                    below the city, expecting to there <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> and proceed to join the "Army before Richmond." It was Friday
                    however before we shipped and <i>[illeg.]</i> on Saturday at 3 P.M. disembarked
                    at Whitehouse landing on the <i>[unclear: 
                        Parum
                    ]</i> bay. I enjoyed the trip down the Rapphannock down the bay, and up the
                    York, very much, the scenery along the banks of those <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> waters is
                    beautiful, but on entering the <i>[illeg.]</i> everything seemed to suddenly
                    change. The shore land, so low that it could be <i>[illeg.]</i> distinguished,
                    covered with swamp weeds. Vegetation looks sickly. Swamps abound, and no signs
                    of improvement or civilization are visible as far as the eye could reach. Treked
                    out Charter's creek being a crooked stream, <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> as we were steaming up the Rapphannock over appeared at anchor
                    right before us I thought about 300 yards. Imagine my surprise when after more
                    than two hours sailing at the rate of ten <u>miles an hour we
                        found <i>[illeg.]</i> schooner at anchor</u>, and on looking back, could
                    see other schooners which we had <u>passed early in the
                        morning</u>, apparently right behind us. I must have been <u>twenty-five miles around</u> this peninsula -- so I
                    understand from hands on the boat -- and only a <u>few hundred
                        yards across</u>. Our regiment occupied the steamer "Georgia," having in
                    time two schooners <i>[illeg.]</i> baggage &amp; train.</p>
<p class="p10">Whitehouse station is a miserable look <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>ing place. The only thing to be
                    seen are "Government Hospitals" "<u>Undertaker's</u>" shops,
                        <u>Embalmers</u> of the dead, Suiters, &amp; niggers.
                    I felt no reluctance on Sunday morning -- the day after our arrival -- as we
                    packed up and started out the Richmond &amp; West Point R.R. Just as we were about leaving I met Dr. Gilmore
                    who looked well and reported the healthy condition of Woodville and vicinity. On Sunday evening we bivouaced at <i>[unclear: 
                        Huntlett's
                    ]</i> Station, getting our shelter up, just in time to protect us from a
                    heavy rain. On Monday, we marched to "Dispatch" Station 13 miles from Richmond.
                    Remained there until Wednesday morning and started out again after marching
                    above 9 miles <i>[illeg.]</i> right in front of Gen. Porter's division a little less than a mile from Col. Black's Regiment. During our stay, Tom Douglass
                    &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> called on us. They both look well. Thursday morning we marched
                    out to this place. One mile from Mechanicsville, &amp; about 4 1/2 miles
                    from Richmond. Our first encampment here was on a field five or six hundred <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> yards front of where we now are. We had to vacate it and an
                    encampment on account of its proximity to certain rebel fortifications on the
                    other side of the Chickahominy. We are now in a dense woods and concealed from
                    the view of the enemy, but still within range of their guns. </p>
<p class="p10">Well, Sam, this looks, feels, and sounds like active service not a single half
                    hour in the day passes without the sound of musketry or artillery breaking upon
                    the Earth <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> the shots in such quick succession and awaken apprehensions of
                    a general engagement. Every morning before day break the different regiments are
                    arroused and made to put every thing in order for instant action, formed in line
                    of battle, marched to one point &amp; then to another <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> and all conducted with the regularity and indifference of a
                    country <i>[illeg.]</i> hearing recitations.</p>
<p class="p10">Our <i>[illeg.]</i> and those of the enemy line the banks of the river, at some
                    places only few yards apart and stationed <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                </p>
<p class="p10">Yesterday the enemy's pickets fired at some of our men. Gen Seymour ordered the Mt. Jackson boys, <i>[unclear: 
                        Swarton's
                    ]</i>, and a regular battery in position on the hiss this side the river.
                    The 9<sup>th</sup> was formed in their rear, ready to support.
                    Companies "C." &amp; "G." were sent out as skirmishers, with orders to
                    approach the bridge unobserved, make a dash across, and "<u>feel</u><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>marked" by the enemy. there is a probability that we
                    may stay here longer than eight days and as there is only a chance occasion of
                    sending letter to Washington, you must not be disappointed if you don't hear
                    from me soon. I wish you would get and send me (directed as usual) some sort of
                    a <u>diary</u> in which to "take notes." the article can't be
                    got here and I often find myself at a <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br> loss for such a thing. I begin
                    to like the Gipsey life a little better than at first,
                    and don't care much if they do keep us here a little time longer. My health is
                    very good.</p>
<p class="p10">My love to all the folks. Respect to enquiring
                    friends. </p>
<p class="p10">Your Brother </p>
