<h4>Franklin County: Edward McPherson to John B.
                    McPherson, June 11, 1857<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Edward McPherson notifies his father of his arrival in Philadelphia and describes
                    a visit to the Mint to purchase large amounts of cent notes and to order a
                    plate, for printing.</p>

<p class="p10">Monday, June 11. 57.</p>
<p class="p10">
                            Phila.
                        </p>
<p class="p10">My dear Father</p>
<p class="p10">I arrived here safely last night about 1, &amp; stopped at the St. Lawrence.
                    This morning after breakfast, I went to the Mint -- <i>[illeg.]</i> before it
                    Sunday <i>[illeg.]</i>, <i>[illeg.]</i>, &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp;
                    inside a crowd of probably 200 in a row; each waiting his turn.-- The officer
                    politely invited me to take my place in the rear, informing me that it would be
                    2 o'clock before I would get through.-- Of course, my back rebelled at the idea
                    of such a martyrdom.-- I went to the office, talked with the clerks &amp;
                    discovered (what I now recalled having read in the circular of the Director of
                    the Mint) that the <i>[unclear: Adams]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: Express]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Company would deliver cents in quantities of $50 &amp; upward
                    free of charge on all the notes.-- This is done by arrangement -- the Mint
                    paying the expence.-- I will go at once to the office
                    of the Company, deposit the money with them with proper instructions, take
                    receipt &amp; have <i>[illeg.]</i> the box sent to my address, N. York - to be there called for by
                    <i>[unclear: Stockholders]</i>. This will cost the Bank
                    less freight <i>[illeg.]</i> than if I had the box to take home with me.
                    &amp; is a better plan.-- I was glad to be reminded of the possibility of
                    this, for it at once releases me of what <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> would prove a tedious
                    detention. I will go also to the <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp;c. this morning,
                    &amp; do all the business I can.--</p>
<p class="p10">Our Comte. meeting will be full, from appearances.
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> is here.</p>
<p class="p10">The Injunction will be argued <u>here</u> next Tuesday. <u>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    </u> will represent the company. The public appear to anticipate a refusal, but
                    I have no reliable information.--</p>
<p class="p10">We found Mr. Drexel an agreeable companion as far as York <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> day. I expect to call in a moment to see him.</p>
<p class="p10">Sarah found all at home about as well as usual.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope Aunt <i>[unclear: Polly]</i> has <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> recovered.-- Give my love to
                    her &amp; mother.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        Edwd
                    </i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I open this letter to say that I have been to the
                            <i>[illeg.]</i>.-- He preferred decidedly the picture taken in Phila, thinking it would make the best of
                        me. The magnifying glass revealed the superiority of the former &amp;
                        the defects of the latter, very clearly. -- They think the Bank should have a steel plate. The
                        additional cost is but $50 &amp; it will last while the Bank does.-- I
                        will go back to the Mint in the morning. This has been supply day for the
                        city, &amp; the crowd has been greater than usual.-- Adams Express men
                        think I can have the cents forwarded more promptly dealing directly with the
                        Mint than through them.-- In either event, the <i>[illeg.]</i>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> expense to York. I hope to effect an arrangement, and there
                            <i>[deleted: will]</i> may be some delay in getting the money.-- I
                        was at the stationer's &amp; have everything fixed.-- The blanks will
                        not cost over $5 a ream on an average.-- The envelopes $3.25 per 1000. I
                        ordered 1000.-- I have Mother's Gelatine &amp; corn starch &amp;
                        after dinner will attend to other small matters.--<br>Edwd</p>
