<h4>Franklin County: Edward McPherson to John B.
                    McPherson, September 2, 1857<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Edward McPherson writes from New York, where he is on business related to a trial
                    case in Maryland. He nonchalantly mentions that stocks continue to fall
                    drastically, but is not worried.</p>

<p class="p10">Sept. 2.</p>
<p class="p10">
                            N.Y.
                        </p>
<p class="p10">My dear Father --</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote you briefly from Phila. Sunday
                    morning.-- On Monday, I read a letter from Mr. <i>[unclear: Mchaffey]</i>,
                    requesting me to come to N. Y. on a matter of
                    business connected with some trial case in Allegheny County, Md., the particulars of which I will tell you when I
                    reach home. I arrived yesterday aftn., &amp;
                    expect to leave to-day at five o'clock-- Mr. M. is
                    well, though worked hard.</p>
<p class="p10">There is a great panic in the city, &amp; stocks have fallen largely. They
                    will rally, but probably not for some weeks.--For many years, there has not been
                    such an excitement in Wall Street as there was yesterday, &amp; every kind
                    of talk went down.-- This morning, matters look better.-- The country is too
                    rich for a serious breakdown to occur.-- Fortunes have been lost by fall of
                    stocks. Some have fallen from 73 to 10!-- Others are coming downward.-- There is
                    a novelty in these movements, which is quite exciting.</p>
<p class="p10">I am stopping at the Bard St. House. The City is
                    crowded, &amp; I shall be glad to get back to more quiet quarters. Love to
                    Mother.</p>
