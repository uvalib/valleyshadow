<h4>Augusta County: John B. Baldwin to Alexander H. H.
                    Stuart, December 5, 1869<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>John B. Baldwin writes to Alexander H. H. Stuart regarding Stuart's former
                    personal secretary, Briscoe Gerald Baldwin (1828-1898). B. G. Baldwin had been a
                    captain, major, and then lieutenant colonel in the Confederate Army. In the
                    letter, John B. Baldwin addresses his concerns about B. G. Baldwin's impending
                    discharge, presumably from the Western Lunatic Asylum in Staunton, Augusta
                    County, Virginia.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dec 5/69</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Stuart - </p>
<p class="p10">I send you a note just received from Briscoe - the second since yesterday - He
                    complains I think with great force of being turned loose with his judgment
                    overhanging him that he is "incurable but harmless"</p>
<p class="p10">If the authorities cant give him some other clearance I think they have no right
                    to turn him loose upon the world - &amp; such seems within law - Code <i>[deleted: ]</i> 440 <i>[illeg.]</i>35 for it is there required that such a
                    person shall be delivered to any friend who is willing in the opinion of the
                    board able to take care of him.</p>
<p class="p10">Who is ready to make such an undertaking in regard to Briscoe - especially if he
                    is let out under the head <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>of "harmless incurable."</p>
<p class="p10">If let out in a way to avoid irritating and hurting him there might be a fair
                    prospect of his going to work &amp; making a living - but otherwise he will
                    go with his old condition &amp; be wholly unable to take care of himself.</p>
<p class="p10">I certainly did not intend &amp; am not willing to make any such undertaking
                    as is required by the law refer<sup>d</sup> to - &amp; I shall expect the authorities if the asylum is
                    then to discharge him in a manner to make him to care for himself - or to keep
                    him in custody until some one is found to undertake <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>the care of him -
                    or until he is perfectly restored -</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John B Baldwin</i></p>
