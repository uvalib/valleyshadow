<h4>Augusta County: Millard Fillmore to Alexander H. H.
                    Stuart, February 9, 1854<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Fillmore invites Stuart to accompany him on a tour of the South, then discusses
                    the Kansas-Nebraska Act which he thinks will be passed by the Senate, although
                    he fears the consequences.</p>

<p class="p10">February 9. 1854,</p>
<p class="p10">Buffalo</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 3o ult. came duly to hand but I have delayed
                    writing you from day to day, and week to week, 1st. because I had nothing
                    apparently worth communicating and 2ndly because I
                    was trying to make some arrangements to take a Southern tour this Spring and if
                    I did so, I was <i>[illeg.]</i> that it might suit your convenience to
                    accompany me. I have written to our mutual friend Mr. Kennedy who consents to
                    go, and I have also written to Mr. Granger who will go if he can arrange his
                    business so as to leave it, but of this he expresses considerable doubt. I think
                    a party of three or four would be most pleasant. Will you consent to make one of
                    it? I can assure you that I should be greatly gratified to have you, and I know
                    Mr. Kennedy would.</p>
<p class="p10">Our intention is to go down through the Southern Atlantic States, to Mobile and
                    thence back to Savannah where we will take a steamer for Havanna, and possibly
                    visit some other of the West India Islands, and thence to N. Orleans, and up the
                    Mississippi through Tennessee and Ky. to Cincinnati
                    and thence home. This route, however, may be shortened, lengthened, or varied to
                    suit circumstances. We would rendezvous at Baltimore, about the 1st of March,
                    and might hope to accomplish it all in from one to two months. Will you not go?
                    Can you spend the same length of time more pleasantly or even more profitably in
                    any other way? It seems to me not, so let us calculate on the pleasure of your
                    society.</p>
<p class="p10">This Nebraska matter presents a new phase to things in Washington. But is it wise
                    for the South to set the example separating the compromise of 1820? If one
                    compromise be disregarded will not another be, and will not the South in the end
                    be left to the <u>tender mercy</u> of Northern fanaticism
                    with an overwhelming numerical majority? These are<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> Serious questions
                    for the South and yes it may be difficult for her to resist the proffered favor
                    of Douglas' Bill. She may suspect the motive; she may see its fatal consequences
                    and its delusive benefits, but can she resist it?</p>
<p class="p10">I think the measure will pass the senate by a decided majority, but its fate is
                    doubtful in the house, and there is reason to apprehend that it will reopen the
                    slavery agitation, <i>[deleted: much]</i> with all its bitterness, if not all
                    its dangers to our Union. We had fondly hoped that this question was at rest,
                    for a time at least, but I fear we are to be disappointed.</p>
<p class="p10">My children are very well, and join me in kindest remembrances to yourself and
                    Mrs. Stuart.</p>
<p class="p10">I shall write Mr. Kennedy today that I have invited you to join us.</p>
<p class="p10">I am truly yours,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Millard Fillmore</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Hon.<br>A. H. H. Stuart<br>Staunton, Va.
                    </p>
