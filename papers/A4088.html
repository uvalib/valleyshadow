<p class="p10">My Dear Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">I have a chance to send a few lines by a direct carrier -- Mr Points, who came from Staunton
     yesterday -- Maj. Bell wrote to me &amp; said he had sent my bundle home -- I am glad it
     got safely there -- We left Strasburg last Sunday morning (today is Wednesday) met the enemy
     under Crook, (Hunter having been displaced) &amp; defeated &amp; routed them &amp;
     have pursued them across the Potomac at Williamsport -- capturing several Hundred, killing
     &amp; wounding a large number, captured some wagons &amp; caissons &amp; caused
     them to burn over 70 wagons -- they went in great confusion &amp; rout &amp; our
     infantry, some of it, marched 30 miles that day -- we had a hard rain at night which made it
     too dark to pursue &amp; so the wretches got away -- but they got a good threshing
     &amp; that too in the Valley where they had so misbehaved -- I saw Mr. Trotter &amp; he
     gave me an account of your troubles with Jordan -- glad they are over, but do not like the <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>way it had to be done -- I hope he may get his deserts -- I
     have reported him to the enrolling officer at Staunton &amp; hope he will do something for
     him &amp; his son -- but do not say anything about it -- We had a fine rain Sunday night --
     &amp; it kept on until noon on Monday I tell you it did a vast amout of good -- I hope you had a rain too -- &amp; that things are growing -- I
     have not heard from you for some days but hope to hear soon. I am in excellent health -- but
     get very tired marching as much as we do -- but I like it better than lying idle in camps -- We
     are now destroying the R. R -- 5 days after they got it started
     -- send me a new list of little things you want for I have lost the one you gave me -- Excuse
     my short note -- for the courier is going -- Love &amp; kisses for you all -- Write soon </p>
<p class="p10">Your aff husband</p>
