<p class="p10"> April 23<sup>d</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Capitol Hill Md.</p>
<p class="p10">
                        <u>Dear</u>
                        <u>John</u>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I am back at the Regiment once more. Everything looks quite natural, and I feel
                    perfectly at home. The boys seemed all very glad to see me and I can assure you
                    I was no less glad to see them. They have been making many and anxious enquiries
                    about Mrs. T. and some of them seem disappointed
                    that I did not bring her to Camp. But, of course, when she went off and married
                    another <u>feller</u> I could not well ask her to come along. </p>
<p class="p10">We are encamped on "Capitol Hill" about a quarter of a mile from the "Capitol."
                    The <u>site</u> for a Camp is very good<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and we
                    have quite comfortable quarters. My house is not quite as good as the one I
                    left, but it can be greatly improved at very little expense. The men are much
                    better fixed than they were before, and they have so far conducted themselves
                    very creditably. We will be put on Provost duty in and around the city.</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose Col. Anderson has started for Pittsburgh
                        ere this. It seems that the Secretary of War has
                    positively refused to act in his case. It is really a shame that such a <u>man</u> and such a soldier should be so sent home. I am
                    told that when the Col started from camp, there was
                    no little stir amongst the boys. and many of them actually <u>cried</u>. He left Camp a day or two before the Regiment started for
                    Washington. As they were<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                    <i>[deleted: were]</i> marching along the "Avenue" to this place, the Col was standing in the door way of some public
                    building near the Treasury Department. Someone in the first company spied him.
                    The word soon passed along the line and such other <u>cheering</u> it is said our boys nevery gave, except
                    to General McClelland himself. and not only <u>our</u> Regiment but all the others of the Brigade joined
                    with a hearty good will. Some of the big men of the City, behind whom the Col was trying to conceal himself (for he is very
                    modest) thought they were the object of the enthusiasm and commenced to
                    acknowledge the compliment; but the men soon set them right by crying, "not you,
                    not you, its Col Anderson" until at last the old
                    Man had to come out on the steps and take off his hat. I think if the Sec. of War had witnessed the scene he would have
                    altered his determination. I promised<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> to write to Brother Herdman,
                    and let him know how the case stood. But as the Col
                    will be home before a letter would arrive, there is not much use in me writing.
                    Please call on Brother Herdman and tell him why I have not written that he may
                    not think I have forgotten my promise.</p>
<p class="p10">It has been raining all day. Give my love to all at home. Respects to enquiring friends, and believe me </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affect Brother </p>
