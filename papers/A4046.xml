    <p>I send back today the most of my baggage -- we have a general cutting down so as to reduce
     our wagons from 4000 to 2000, I send, let me see, here is the invoice:<lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">1 Carpet Bag</hi> full of sundries, some fine cotton &amp; <abbr
      expan="Handkerchiefs">Hdkfs</abbr> &amp; Gloves &amp; Coffee &amp; tea &amp;
     soap &amp;c for you &amp; the Key enclosed, also 2 bunches of S.C. Soup of <del
      hand="h1"/> is a fine seasoning for a pot of vegetables -- 2 striped tick you can use<lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">1 Box</hi>, Key enclosed, containing books, papers &amp;c, part public
     property &amp; 3/4 of a ream 3 bundles of note paper, sell to Mr. Cowan 2 bundles, they are
     worth $20 each I suppose keep one, the broken one, for your own use, I owe Mr. Cowan some
     &amp; wish to pay him &amp; Dr. Young $10 -- that he paid for binding for me - pay him
     from the proceeds -- you can judge what is mine &amp; what public -- have all cared for -- <lb/>
     <hi rend="underline">1 Long box</hi> of Maps and Drawing paper<pb n="2"/>have it taken care of
     --<lb/> 1 Mess Box and Contents -- One Comfort, in it, jars, tin &amp;c &amp;c<lb/> 1
     Stove Pipe<lb/> 1 Tent Fly }Have them put away --<lb/> 1 A Tent, new, }<lb/> 2 Knapsacks which
     two of my friends wish to have stored --<lb/> 1 Bundle of maps, wrapped up in my bed tick --
     you can use the tick I do not want it -- My jacket's in my carpet bag, you can use it for Allen
     -- <lb/> 1 Shade &amp; 1 pick --<lb/> If my bundle did not reach home before it will go by
     my wagon &amp; you will get that the -- driver will get it in Winchester -- I also send a
     bottle of <unclear>Copperas</unclear> -- a fine article -- I write to you about the indigo --
     You can send to Mrs. <abbr expan="John">Jno.</abbr> Harman for it --. I have been so busy
     assorting &amp; fixing that I have not much <pb n="3"/>Writing humor in me -- If you <orig
      reg="make">mak</orig> me some shirts make them <hi rend="underline">"long tailed"</hi> Write
     how the goods suit &amp; how much there is of them so I may know if it is necessary to buy
     more if opportunity offers -- We passed safely over the river, with but little loss -- less
     than we inflicted on the enemy that pursued -- and are now encamped near Darkesville &amp;
     Bunker's Hill -- the <orig reg="enemy's">enemys</orig> cavalry making some demonstrations near
     the river, all else quiet -- Our wagon train is so large as to impede greatly the movements of
     the army &amp; by reducing it we promote the efficiency of the army &amp; we are all
     ready to do any thing to promote that -- I hope you are all getting along <hi rend="underline"
      >comfortably</hi>, pleasantly I cannot expect, in the gloom of the present -- the seemingly
      thick<pb n="4"/>darkness that envelopes us -- but I do not despair in the least -- &amp;
     only look upon it as the darkness before the dawn -- looking for the Republic to come brightly
     out of all its tribulations -- it is no time to think of coming home, else I would apply for
     permission &amp; try &amp; come -- Wait in patience my Love, for the days of peace must
     come -- write to me often &amp; tell me if there is anything I can do to lighten the burden
     of your cares &amp; add to the comfort of my loved ones at home -- " O! had I the wings of
     a dove, how soon would I fly away &amp; come to you -- I have no news to write -- so be of
     good cheer -- heartily thank God for his many mercies &amp; implore the continuance of his
     favor -- My kisses for my dear children -- and love &amp; prayers for you all Write soon -- </p>
