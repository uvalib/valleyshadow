<p class="p10">Dear Frank,</p>
<p class="p10">I was taken down with fever at New Market about the middle of August and sent to
                    Staunton for treatment. Two weeks ago I was sufficiently recovered to come to
                    this place. I am now well and will return to duty in a few days. Mary is with
                    me. Her health is still very delicate. She recd.
                    your letter of July 28<sup>th</sup> &amp; answered it at once.
                    This week I recd. your letter of July 14<sup>th</sup>. I am endeavoring to carry out your request but doubt
                    my ability to accomplish anything. I have written to Gov. Wise invoking his aid &amp; hope it will be more potent than my
                    efforts. Some of your friends have been killed since your capture, though I
                    believe none with whom you were very intimate. Col.
                    Lang &amp; Thornhill were killed below Winchester week before last. Poor
                    Lang we shall miss him greatly. George &amp; Jimmy &amp; Geo. M<sup>c</sup>Phail were well at last
                    accounts. The 18<sup>th</sup> won the distinction of a special report
                    from the Division Commander a few days ago for gallantry. I would say more if it
                    were not contraband. Ma was to see me in Staunton. All were well at home. I
                    expect to see them next week. I have laid aside a Salem letter for you which I
                    suppose will "keep" till you get back.</p>
<p class="p10">Col Massie of the Institute is here &amp; sends
                    his regards to you. His brother Rodes is a prisoner. If at Johnson's Island make
                    his acquaintance. I shall endeavor to get Mary to winter in S.C. or Ga. for
                    her health.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my kindest regards to Ginnevan, Ervin, Warden, <i>[unclear: Mattely]</i>,
                        <i>[unclear: Remen]</i>, Capt. Imboden
                    &amp; all other friends with you. I spend many an hour thinking of you all
                    and hope ere long a general exchange may restore you to your friends esp.</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate brother</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John</i></p>
<p class="p10">Mary unites in love to you. Russie,
                        Frank &amp; Nannie are all at school at Mr M<sup>c</sup>Phail's.</p>
