<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, August 9, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife and reports on how he and Freddy are doing. He
                    asserts that he can't stand the thought of his wife doing her own work, and
                    discusses the possibility of sending her an Irish servant girl. He itemizes the
                    things that were lost in his trip to Staunton.</p>

<p class="p10">Aug 9/64</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">Your favor came to hand by M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> H- the money also came but I have not counted it but suppose it is allright. I have had so much to do tonight that I could
                    not get to look at it I stayed up last night until 3am
                    waiting for the train and am quite sleepy now but must write you a few lines.
                    Freddy has written you fully, and leaves me but little to say to you. I am
                    trying to get ready to come down again &amp; hope to be able to stay longer
                    next time</p>
<p class="p10">We are well &amp; Freddy is getting fat eats harty.
                    he enjoys himself here very much. all seem pleased with him, and make much of
                    him</p>
<p class="p10">I only wish that you were all <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> here with us. And I really begin to
                    feel that it would be best for you to move up I can<u>t</u> think of you being there doing your own
                    work. this is too hard for me to stand and I cant see
                    how you are to do much better there being no servants there to be had</p>
<p class="p10">And for you to leave there now I fear our property would be more or less distroyed, &amp; again I feel as if this must be
                    the last campaign of the war &amp; then we may <i>[added: be]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: be]</i> able to be together constantly. I hope for that time to
                    come</p>
<p class="p10">There is a Irish girl Just come here a few days ago who was
                    formerly a chambermaid in the house, who wants a situation here I will see her
                    she may be willing to go down &amp; live with you <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> if she will go
                    she may be a good girl and suit you If she will go I will try &amp; get M
                    Harris to take her down with him for fear I may not get down for some days and
                    might be too late. she is used to work and may do well but dont be too free with her as she may not stand familiarity. if she
                    come let her sleep in one of the rooms on porch or in small room at head of
                    stairs. If I fail in getting her to go I will try &amp; get some one to come
                    down with me You must have <i>[illeg.]</i> some one if can<sup>
                            <u>t</u>
                        </sup> do otherwise I must send you Louise as much as I dislike to
                    spare her here dont stint yourself in money in buying
                    things for me <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> the things left at B- were all lost but the Bar<sup>
                            <u>l</u>
                        </sup> Molasses 1/2 Bar<sup>

                    hats &amp; some of Freddy's clothing all gone but we can get along here I
                    have had him shoes &amp; shirts made here &amp; have still plenty of
                    stuff for his clothes his yarn socks are all gone- but I will try &amp; get
                    him some knit</p>
<p class="p10">I will come down as soon as can. write me often give love to all</p>
<p class="p10">May god bless &amp; protect you</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever</p>
