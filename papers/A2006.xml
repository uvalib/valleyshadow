     <salute>Dear Sallie</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I rec'd all of your letters and have neglected writing to you but you must excuse me for I
     have been tolerably busy. I rec'd your letter by Pa was glad to hear from you. We have a very
     good time it is a rough life but I like it. We have companies of cavalry here &amp; expect
     two more today one from Point Rocks Capt Ashby Black Horse cavalry 100 men. I don't know where
     the other is from. I will give John Lipscomb the 80cts you owe him. He &amp; Ned Waddell
     will be here today. I will be commissioned in a few days &amp; will be quartered with Capt
     Patrick. How are all the ladies in old Waynesboro. I would like to see some of them very much.
     I suppose Andrew Darnall is still in town. I would like to see him. I gave Ned Waddell your
     letter. He seemed very glad to hear from you. I suppose he is busy or he would write. I will
     send you my likeness the first time I get to Martinsburg or Shepherdstown. I am very much
     tanned &amp; am getting fat we have plenty to eat. Mollie Rawlins seems to have plenty of
     beans here in the Shepherdstown Co. They all send their love to you &amp; Ma. Mr Irvine
     myself &amp; two others were down at the river between Williamsport &amp; little
     Georgetown on Monday. There was 4 shots fired at us by some <orig reg="rowdy">roudy</orig>
     boatmen on the Maryland side but they did no damage. The balls whistled over our heads. We had
     no trees near to get behind &amp; had to get out of the way. We would have fired on them if
     we could have had some shelter. It was at least 5 or 600 yds from where they fired. I intend
     trying my sharps rifle on some of them if they fire again. It did not feel very comfortable but
     I was not the least frightened it will soon be put a stop. You all need have no uneasiness
     about me. If I am to die by a bullet I will try &amp; be prepared. Pa will give you all the
     news. I will write you a longer letter Sis. Give my respect to all. Write soon. Tell Clinton
     &amp; Chas I will write to them soon. I suppose Charley had a nice time in Richmond.</p>
