<h4>Augusta County: H. Brown to Elen Martin, January 27,
                    1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Brown discusses the food and conditions at camp, the health of soldiers and
                    prisoners, and his experiences preaching to both. He also notes that morale is
                    rising, as a result of the apparent newfound humility of President Jefferson
                    Davis.</p>

<p class="p10">Richmond</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10"> Yours of the 24<sup>th</sup> with $150, enclosed, was received today,
                    and the money disposed of according to <i>[deleted: the]</i> directions. The
                    Tracts have been procured and will be forwarded by the first opportunity. I am
                    very glad of the prospect of a box, and hope there may be an opportunity to send
                    it. Such acts of kindness not only add greatly to my comfort <i>[deleted: comfort]</i>, but effect me very sensibly. Although we should never be
                    distrustful of the good providence of our Heavenly Father, yet what shall we
                    eat, and wherewithall shall we be clothed, must, while we live, occasion anxiety
                    and care. I get along <i>[deleted: this]</i> much better in the eating
                        <i>[unclear: line]</i> than heretofore. Our bread is <i>[deleted: baked]</i> quite passable--much better than at any time since I have been
                    connected with the army. It is baked by Yankee prisoners, who prefer to do it,
                    to remaining in confinement, or to going home to be sent back to the army. I eat
                    by myself in my room, <i>[illeg.]</i> bread, and occasionally <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    meat is brought to <i>[illeg.]</i> the beef is so poor however that I rarely
                    eat <i>[added: it]</i>; but the bread, with such additions
                        <u>as I make to it</u>, leaves me no ground of complaint.
                    Under these circumstances you can see that a box from friends is likely to be
                    valued highly</p>
<p class="p10">I am glad to be able to say that at this time, the number of sick soldiers, in
                    and around this city, is very small. In this camp the number at the beginning of
                    the present month, was about 65. It is now about 35. To<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> these I
                    endeavor to minister in holy things <i>[deleted: on]</i> in various ways, and
                    have reason to believe that my labors are not in vain. Within a few days past,
                    two I trust, have passed from death unto life. A few weeks ago one died in about
                    as happy a frame of mind as I ever knew. On last Saturday, that bitter day of
                        <i>[deleted: sl]</i> rain and ice, <i>[deleted: more than]</i> 570 <i>[unclear: 
                        parrolled
                    ]</i> prisoners came into camp Soon follows, wet and cold, (two of them
                    with nothing that <i>[unclear: resembled]</i> the name of shoes or stockings,)
                    how it touched me to see them. Nearly all however have since been paid, and
                    clothed, and furloughed, and have gone home. Except these, we have had but few
                    in this camp for some time. Not <i>[deleted: therefore]</i> having much to do
                    in my own charge I often go abroad. Within the past two weeks I have preached 10
                    times. Of these, discourses, two were preached to the Yankee deserters, who have
                    come over to us under order 65. <i>[deleted: I have preached also]</i> Near
                    me, and indeed all around the city, is a <i>[unclear: hive]</i> of breast
                    works, all along which pickets are stationed. Several miles of these I visit
                    once a week with religious newspapers and Tracts I have preached also in each of
                    the hospitals attached to the Liby prison All this, in addition to my daily
                    duties in this camp and hospitals does not leave me entirely unemployed.</p>
<p class="p10">I have preached twice recently to our own people in Castle
                    <i>[unclear: Theenden]</i>. On each of these occasions most of those who were
                    not inclose confinement attended and were <i>[deleted: entirely]</i> orderly. The Yankee deserters, with<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> some
                    exceptions <i>[deleted: all]</i> attended, and those who did attend <i>[deleted: were]</i> behaved very well. On each occasion I noticed several
                    in tears. At the close of service some of them introduced themselves, and others
                    gathered round for a chat. They gave me many thanks for coming, and many
                    requests to repeat my visits. of course I said nothing about the war but in a
                    very general way Those to whoom I preached have, as I
                    understand all left for their own land, and as many more are in their places</p>
<p class="p10">In the hospitals attached to the Liby prison, some were attentive, and some were
                    not. One sobbed through nearly half the Sermon, but quite a number seemed to say
                    in their countenances, "Well, this is an effort to heap coals of fire on our
                    heads for the devilment we have done in Virginia"</p>
<p class="p10">On the whole, as long as I have as much as I can do among our own people I will
                    preach to them "Let the children first be <i>[unclear: fine]</i>; <i>[deleted: ]</i> after that I <i>[illeg.]</i>, as far as possible, "preach the
                    Gospel to every creature". It can do the Yankees no harm, and may do them good.
                    The tendency of a little kindness to them in their distress may be to soften
                    their feelings.</p>
<p class="p10">For war news I must refer you to the newspapers. Our President <i>[deleted: has
                        evidently]</i> after <i>[added: having]</i> well nigh
                    ruined the country, has evidently<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> largely laid aside his annoying
                    self conceit in his own abilities, and his mulishness. This, and the appointment
                    of a Commander in chief, has wonderfully revived the spirits of the people Col
                    <i>[unclear: Ould]</i> told an acquaintance of mine two days ago that he now
                    entertains strong hopes of a speedy general exchange of prisoners. The 570, who
                    came last Saturday <i>[deleted: have nearly all gone home on furlough.
                    They]</i> were in bettter flight than any I have seen. We have no late letter
                    from my son Remember me very kindly to your Sister, and to your brother
                    &amp; family</p>
<p class="p10">Yours very Sincerely</p>
<p class="p10"><i>H Brown</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. There is no doubt of a great effort for peace on
                        both sides at this time, :Stevens Hunter, and Judge Campbell have gone to
                        Washington for that object</p>
