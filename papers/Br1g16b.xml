<note n="1" id="n1" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg><p> It was at Winchester in June of 1861 that the Liberty
Hall Volunteers were incorporated into the Army of the Shenandoah as
Company I of the 4th Virginia Infantry regiment, commanded by Colonel Thomas J.
Jackson. The army drilled for several weeks at Camp Stephens near
Martinsburg until General Patterson's Federal army crossed the Potomac.
When Patterson occupied Martinsburg, the Army of the Shenandoah fell
back to Winchester on July 7th. They remained in Winchester until the
18th, when they were instructed to move towards Manassas Junction to aid
General Beauregard in his engagement with the Federals (Bean, 31-37).
</p></note>

<note n="2" id="n2" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[2]</seg><p> Charles Brooks (1839-1920) enlisted in the 4th
Virginia Infantry, Co.  I on July 7, 1861. He was perhaps en route to
join the company in Winchester (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">Fourth Virginia
Infantry</hi>, 41).</p></note>

<note n="3" id="n3" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[3]</seg><p> William Brooks (1838-1861) enlisted in the 4th
Virginia Infantry, Co.
I with Andrew in June of 1861 (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">Fourth Virginia
Infantry</hi>, 41). He became quite ill sometime in early
July of that same year. In a letter to James Brooks also dated July 16,
1861, Captain White reports that William passed away due to "congestion
of the brain." See White's letter to James Brooks, July 16, 1861. </p></note>

<note n="4" id="n4" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[4]</seg><p> Quinine, an antiperiodic drug, was often dissolved in
whiskey and used against malaria. Calomel is a mercury compound.
(Freemon, 8-9).</p></note>

<note n="5" id="n5" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[5]</seg><p> William Wilson (1843-?) enlisted in Co. I on June 2,
1861. He was also a student at Washington College.  Captured at
Kernstown on March 23, 1862 (as was Andrew Brooks), he was exchanged on
Aug 5, 1862. Wilson was reported as a deserter on Nov. 27, 1862
(Robertson, <hi rend="italic">Fourth Virginia Infantry</hi>, 41).</p></note>

<note n="6" id="n6" place="end"><seg type="note-symbol">[6]</seg><p> The troops stationed at Winchester were impatiently
waiting for Patterson to advance (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">Fourth Virginia
Infantry</hi>, 33); however, on July 18,
they received orders to evacuate Winchester and travel eastward through
the Blue Ridge Mountains towards Manassas to serve as reinforcements in
the defense of the Railroad Junction. On July 21, the First Battle of
Manassas was fought. The 4th VA was pivotal in the counterattack which
carried the battle, yet sustained the highest losses of any of the
regiments in the brigade: 31 dead and 100 wounded. Besides its role as
an important victory for the Confederates, the First Manassas gave birth
to two Confederate legends: the "Rebel Yell," and Jackson's
nickname&mdash;credited to South Carolina General Barnard Bee who, upon
perceiving Jackson's brigade behind him, shouted to his troops, "Look,
men! There stands Jackson like a stone wall! Rally behind the
Virginians!" (Robertson, <hi rend="italic">Fourth Virginia Infantry</hi>, 5-7).</p></note>
