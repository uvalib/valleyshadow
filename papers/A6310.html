<h4>Augusta County: David H. Evans to Mary Anna Sibert,
                    July 21, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Evans states that Sibert's behavior in meeting Sam Ferror on the road caused him
                    to doubt her love for him for the first time. Her letter, however, reassured
                    him. He reaffirms his love for her, and discusses plans for an upcoming
                visit.</p>
