<h4>Franklin County: Christian Geisel to Louisa Geisel,
                    October 30, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b> Christian Geisel writes home to his sister Louisa about camp life and potential
                    movements of his unit in Northern Virginia. He makes special note of visiting
                    the camp of a Pennsylvania unit that contains many people from his native area.
                    He also describes a prayer meeting that took place while he visited the camp. He
                    makes several inquiries into how certain relatives and friends back home are
                    doing. </p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">October 30<sup>th</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Germantown, Va. </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister Louisa </p>
<p class="p10">I received your welcome and interesting letter of the 17<sup>th</sup>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> and I was happy to hear that you were all in good health. </p>
<p class="p10">I will now try to write you a few lines to inform you of our whereabouts and to
                    let you know that I am among the living yet and in good health. We left
                    Washington again on the 11<sup>th</sup>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> and were with the army while they fell back from the
                    Rappahannock, but we were only engaged once in a scrimmish at Bristol Station.
                    Since then we have been on duty along the Railroad from Bull Run down to
                    Warrenton Junction. Our monday night last we marched from Manassas Junction to
                    about two miles below Warrenton<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Junction and expected to have a fight
                    near the Rappahannock on tuesday but for some reason it did not come of, and we have been encamped here since. On wensday one division of the third corps came up and
                    encamped near us and next morning we found that the 139<sup>th</sup>
                    Pa. was among them. John Markley was over in our camp yesterday afternoon; he
                    looks as fat and hardy as ever; <i>[illeg.]</i> seen Henry's step brother who
                    is in the same Camp. he is in good health. I was ever in their camp last night.
                    they had a prayer meeting while I was there, and they had quite a large
                    attendence. I was delighted to see so many of my old aquantences, I believe
                    there is more of them in that Regt. than in any other I know of, a good many
                    from Montgomery County and some that were out with me in the three month. John
                    Markley seemed to be very much pleased to see me he said<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>I was the
                    only aquatence he seen from our neighbourhood since
                    he has been out. We have not orders to move from here yet, but dondt expect we will lay here long. The rebels destroyed
                    the railroad from Bristol Station to the Rappahannock, and our men are at work
                    repairing it as speedily as possible, and as soon as supplies can be transported
                    on it again I think our army will advance again. </p>
<p class="p10">We have had nice, clear weather for the last week, but it is cold at night, today
                    it looks as if we might get rain soon. Give my kindest regards to Lydia Brand. I
                    am glad that she thinks of me yet, but sorry to disappoint her in her request as
                    it would be impossible to get a photograph taken here, but tell her I would be
                    pleased to see hers, I have no doubt you young folks have changed a good deal
                    since I saw you last, and also give my best repsects to all the rest <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>
                    of Brands family, and all inquiring friends. I must now close with my love to
                    all at home, hoping that this may find you all in as good health as I enjoy at
                    present, and write soon again to your affectionate Brother. </p>
