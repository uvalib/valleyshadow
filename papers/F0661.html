<p class="p10">Dear Brother - </p>
<p class="p10">I received yours of the <i>[unclear: 6<sup>th</sup>]</i> but have not
                    had time to write since as we have been marching for the last week or so. on the
                        10<sup>th</sup> we were drawn up in line to <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: take]</i> hear gen
                    Mclellans farewell it was short and he rode along
                    the lines with his hat off we saluted him at a present arms then gave him three
                    cheers. on the 12<sup>th</sup> we had Gen
                    Porters farewell he too rode past with his hat off
                    and as he shook hands with Gen Tyler the tears came
                    into his eyes we marched through Warrenton on the 17<sup>th</sup>
                    there are some very fine buildings there passed through Warrenton Junction we
                    have been marching pretty hard for the last few days it has been sunny for the
                    last two days and it is raining now the roads are miserable som places the wheels sink into the hubs someplaces the axels scrape the mud<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>the teams often staul and have to double team it. it is a miserable place
                    on horses and mules there is some kind of a disease got amongst them it is from
                    the shelled corn they get too much of that kind of strong feed and not enough of
                    hay some say it is a contagious disease their feet and mouths get sore some of
                    their feet get fairly rotten and some of them come off so I hear I saw a great
                    many with sore feet and saw a great many condemned ones drove back it is supposed they will be taken to washington and sold.
                    tell mother I drew two pairs of government stockings and a pair of new shoes
                    which I will carry with me till my boots <i>[deleted: are given]</i> give out
                    that wont be long. We are <i>[added: camped]</i> within six miles of Fredricksburg Va this is a poor country that is, the land is poor but it
                    is level around most of the houses there are lots of<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> shanties for
                    their darkies. the farms and fields are very large. the winter is very bad. I
                    wrote two letters to Mother one at Snickers Gap &amp; the other at White
                    Plains did she get them. we have no regular mails but just get our letters once
                    in a few days. Direct your letters to Washington. it would be useless to write
                    any general news as you have a better chance to get them than I have. if you
                    have a chance to send with anyone coming here you may send my boots but if not
                    do not send them there will be very little chance of my getting them I drew
                    shoes and leggings which will keep my feet comfortable. When you write tell me
                    all the news from home and town tell me every
                    thing that happens as any thing from home
                    will interest me. We are in the first Brigade of the third Divission of the fifth Army Corps under the command of Gen Hooker<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> so you can tell by the papers
                    where we are Hooker has command of two corps, the Second and fifth. write soon
                    &amp; direct to Washington.</p>

                    teams are gone for rations but the roads are bad &amp; the teams are poor.
