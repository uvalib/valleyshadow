<p class="p10">9th May 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Hd. Qrs. Paxton's Brigade</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">The report has reached me that you had <i>[unclear: ]</i> that Paxton's Brigade had
                    disgraced its-self upon the field on the morning the 3rd refused to go forward
                    when ordered and permitted other troops to run over them. I'd hoped the brigade
                    had sustained its reputation on that occasion. Genl
                    Rhodes <i>[unclear: section]</i> was under the same impression. But when
                    informed of the facts has admitted he was mistaken on the brigade - I also hope
                    you are mistaken. I will briefly state the facts.</p>
<p class="p10">At the commencement of the engagement we were in the 2nd line on the left on our
                    right resting <i>[illeg.]</i> the <i>[unclear: felands]</i> road. After
                    sunrise we were ordered on the road and placed upon the extreme right advancing
                    over some <i>[illeg.]</i> works behind which lay a brigade - we confirmed our
                    advance over the line of battle where we were <i>[unclear: warmly]</i> engaged
                    some twenty minutes our right being enfiltrated,
                    and forced to fall back some hundred yards when Gen'l Paxton fell - here we reformed. When Genl Stewart ordered me to take command and put the brigade in motion to
                    relieve (as I understood) our brigade who were out of ammunition. I immediately
                    advanced to the relief of the line in front who were gallantly holding their
                    ground with <i>[illeg.]</i> ranks and empty boxes. we continued the charge up
                    the <i>[unclear: hill]</i> driving the enemy from his fortification in rear of
                    the log house a half a mile of Chancelorsville.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not remember of any troops passing over us or they refusing to move <i>[deleted: ]</i> when requested or commanded our casualties speak for us, losing
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> there one third of what we took in the engagement.</p>
<p class="p10">Aside from the above statement of facts, you will find you are mistaken in the
                    brigade. Please favor me with an immediate answer </p>
<p class="p10">In haste I am sir very respectfully <br>your old servt</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J. H. S. Funk Col</i></p>
<p class="p10">In haste I am sir very respectfully your servt.</p>
