<p class="p10">My once friend</p>
<p class="p10">I come to the conclusion last Sabeth
                    neve to send <i>[added: that I had
                        writen]</i> or write to you a gain but not untell I heard from you a gain
                    as you thought perhaps but to quit corisponding; but your dear brother was here last night &amp; we
                    talked about you; he asked when I had heard from you I told him &amp; also
                    said I did not expect to reply &amp; he gave me one condiming look &amp; I have thought ever since that I heard a
                    soft low voice saying Kate dont give him up. Oh my poor wayward boy whose voice
                    is it Ah me thinks it must be he that of thy dear mothers &amp; feel very
                    thankful this evening that I have heard it yes I can thank my heavenly Father
                    this evening that I am very happy yes happy in the Lord &amp; I ask my self
                    why can't Willie be happy why is he grieving over this worlds happiness
                    &amp; not looking forward as he once did to <i>[added: a]</i> world beon the <i>[unclear: dark]</i> why is
                    it that there are no brightness no sunsine that this
                    world is dark &amp; dreary not a charm to bind you to earth I ask why:
                    &amp; I believe that I can give you the answer will you allow me yes I bileve you will <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I will tell you what I think
                    it is your sins Oh dear one you are brooding over my sorrows trouble &amp;
                    thinking how you will make me happy now let me beg of you dear one to forget me
                    for a while <i>[added: &amp;]</i> think of yourself yes
                    if I could come to you to night &amp; fold my arms around your neck
                    &amp; pray for you I believe my earthly happiness would be compleat (not that I want to winn back your affections to me for I leave that with God) but Oh that I
                    could win you back to the foot of the cross &amp; get you to cast your care
                    on Jesus he is ablee &amp; willing to turn your
                    darkness in to day you know the head of him yes dear one I believe he is kocking at the door of your heart &amp; ere this
                    yes when you wrote before I think he had been there Oh Willie I have fasted <i>[added: &amp; prayed]</i> every Wednesday since I got
                    your discard &amp; I have been very very happy I believe that the good Lord
                    has melted &amp; moved your dear heart ere this yes in sever instances my prayers have been answered in less than a week is
                    not this joy enough yes I have spent one Sabbeth
                    <i>[added: in]</i> fasted &amp; prayer besides
                    Wednesdays &amp; I can say with <i>[added: joy it was the]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: a very]</i> happiest day I believe I ever spent. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>no
                    one knows that I done this but Lord &amp; thee I (fas) done it for you &amp; I think you ought to know it or for the
                    salvation of your Lord yes I am willing to sacrifice my life for <i>[added: it]</i> (that) but that is not nesessary for Jesus Christ was sacrificed for our sins. Oh dear one

                    felt that God was with you &amp; he is with you now dont refuse his
                    pleadings he loves you dearer than he did then dont think that your sins are too
                    great he bigs you to cast your burden uppon him he is ablee to engulft you in Christ again but deare dear
