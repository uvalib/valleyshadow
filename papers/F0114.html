<p class="p10">Central Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father</p>
<p class="p10">I take my pen in hand to let you know that I am well at present hoping that these
                    few lines may find you in the same state of good health Further I let you know
                    that we had a great battle for seven days and I let you know that we had very
                    hard times during the fight <i>[illeg.]</i> We had to follow the generals
                    wherever they went and some times they took us in the thickest of the fight and
                    one day as I was riding past our Brstworks amid
                    the roaring of Cannon and the rattle of musketry I hurd
                    a fellow say to me Peter how do you do wen I looked
                    around and saw Denyel and <i>[illeg.]</i> Eackerd
                    coming towards me I let you know that it makes a fellow feel good to see his
                    brother and friend in such a time as that was<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I must soon come to a
                    close for this time Write soon again and write often I give my best respect to
                    you and all my friends</p>
<p class="p10">So no more at present but remain</p>
<p class="p10">Your Son </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Peter Boyer </i></p>
<p class="p10">A few lines to my mother I was very glad to hear that you
                        are enjoying good health and I saw in your letter that you would like to
                        know how my boarding is It is good at present but during the fight we had
                            predy hard times We got cofee enough and I make my own cofee,
                        I make it how I like it and we get sugar enough so I must come to a close
                        for this time<br>your son Peter Boyer Mother 
                    </p>
