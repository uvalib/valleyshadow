<h4>Augusta County: John Scott to W. E. Whiting, December 9, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Scott offers a typical request for materials, but he stresses the need for candles and lamps as the classrooms suffer from inadequate lighting.</p>

<p class="p10">Dec 9/65</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Treasurer</p>
<p class="p10">I ordered one dozen <i>[unclear: Lid]</i> lamps with chimneys and wick in sufficient numbers,-- also 3 or 4 bells to call our different schools, and a few Testaments for family use,  Those things cannot be had at Staunton; therefore <i>[unclear: I]</i> sent to the rooms.</p>
<p class="p10">But for the want of these things I have sent home to Connecticut for a bell to call my school together and have received it.  But as to the Lamps--we are to borrow one and place it upon a table in the centre of the room for 40 or 50 scholars.
</p>
<p class="p10">In another room it is almost impossible to write by our tallow candles and yet scholars are bending over their books and writing with no other light;  Yet to furnish sufficient light from tallow it requires nearly as many candles as there are scholars,</p>
<p class="p10">Now if you have not sent the lamps will you do so at your earliest convenience.  I am unexpectedly obliged to send another order as we are nearly out of some kinds of books and are wanting some not sent in our last <i>[illeg.]</i> box.</p>
<p class="p10">You will please send by next Steamer or express without fail the following--invoice<br><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
