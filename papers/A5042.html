<p class="p10">Oct 31st /61</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Centerville</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">I received a not from you last night, asking me if I knew
                    anything about George, I don't know much about I heard last week that he, S.
                        <i>[unclear: Runolds]</i> &amp; S. Harlow are in Richmond at the
                    Hospital &amp; that George was getting along very well, at that time.</p>
<p class="p10">he is there with a first rate fellow &amp; I know if he was to get worse he
                    would either write to me or the Captain about him, though I think it strange
                    that he don't write back to some one of the company. but it seems if they just
                    get away from the company that they never think worth while to write back to let
                    any one know anything about them. I thought yesterday of writing to him but we
                    had to turn out in honor of Old Whiskey Barrrel (Gov Letcher) so I did not
                    write. I think I will write a few lines to him to day, but I have been looking
                    for him to come to <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> ever day for three or four days. Well I must
                    bring my letter to a close, tell Mary that I will write to her in a day or so,
                    Good bye, may God bless you all, </p>
<p class="p10">Your Aff Brother</p>
