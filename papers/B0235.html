<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Since I arrived here here, I recd a letter from
                    Jesse Robinson the colored man of whom I spoke to you. He is now at New Market,
                    but is not settled yet, and is not certain of <i>[illeg.]</i> in <i>[deleted: ]</i> a <i>[illeg.]</i>, I have not seen him but he is well recommended to me. Now
                    if the people of Waynesboro can board him and pay him ten cents per month he
                    will do well enough.</p>
<p class="p10">If you <i>[illeg.]</i> him to by his skill at Waynesboro just
                    <i>[unclear: invite]</i> him at New Market to come <i>[unclear: about]</i> to
                    Staunton (I have written him who you are) and if it is necessary for you to pay
                    his fare, or help him a few dollars in any way, which cannot be got from the
                    Bureau, I will see that you are <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>. Please advise me if you <i>[illeg.]</i> so that I may know
                    what to do.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours in haste</p>
