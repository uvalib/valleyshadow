<h4>Augusta: William Brand to Kate Armentrout, April 6,
                    1862<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William tells Kate about recent casualties in his company and the re-organization
                    of the company under new officers. He also says that, while things look "gloomy"
                    at the present time, the soldiers in his regiment are in good spirits and ready
                    to fight the enemy. He is less impressed with the militia.</p>

                                side<br>Campt on Ruge Hill</p>
<p class="p10">Freind Kate</p>
<p class="p10">It has been some time since I recieved your kind
                    letter and would have answered it sooner if we had have been campt at any one plase long enoughf to write it.</p>
<p class="p10">My health is very good &amp; hope this may find you enjoying the same
                    blessing. Thare are no news of importance to write. Our
                    Company <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> reorganized to day for the War; our Commissioned officers
                    are as follows, Capt.
                    Jas. W Newton, Lieut
                    Chas. W Grills 2nd Lt
                    <i>[unclear: Churgus]</i> Grills &amp; <i>[unclear: 2nd 2]</i> David F
                    Eachord. We have a very large Com. I hope that our
                    Army may soon be able to give the enimy a death blow. I
                    suppose you have hurd all the perticulars of the battle of the 23 I was in six feet of Gray when
                    he fell he was shot in the head and never mooved after
                    he was shot. Lieut Willson <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> was some
                    three our four yards behind me. I miss him a grate deal
                    he always was a grate friend of mine he was a brave and
                    honorable man &amp; died fighting for his liberty, evry thing looks gloomy at presant but the
                    soldiers seem willing and ready to fight them at any time that we may be ordered
                        to wurds them.</p>
<p class="p10">The enimy are in <i>[unclear: Edingburg]</i> six miles
                    below Mt Jackson. The Malitia look like thay are already whipt all thay think about is
                        <i>[unclear: running]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">Samuel Lightner has Volenteered in our Com he has some resemblance of his late Bro J.P. Our Regt.
                    numbers near eight hundred it will not take a very larg
                    draft to fill it <i>[deleted: out]</i> up. I would like very much to come
                    home for a week or two but thare is no chance for
                    furloughs at presant. Your Brothers are both well I
                    think Jacob likes camp life very well. Nothing more at preasent write soon.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain friend &amp; well wisher,</p>
