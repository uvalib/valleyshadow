<p class="p10">March 30, 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Mt. Solon, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear David,</p>
<p class="p10">I was so much disappoined last Friday after I
                    found out the Mail had gone to Staunton without my letter to you, which I had
                    ready for the Office Thursday. Capt Curtis started
                    for Sanger's Ville came back saying the river was too high to cross, &amp;
                    that Mr Jones could not get to town the next day. Hamie &amp; others said
                    the river was too full to ford, &amp; there would be no mail the next day. I
                    did not like for my letter to lay in the Office until Saturday Evening so I did
                    not send it over, but thought I would watch for Mr. Jones in the morning
                    &amp; if he went give him the letter to mail at Spring<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Hill to my
                    utter surprise &amp; great disappointment he left sooner on that morning
                        then he has done since carrying the mail. I was so
                    sorry, &amp; grieved about it that I have not felt happy since, &amp; if
                    Jim had been here I would have sent the letter to you. You must not be angry
                    with me or think that I no longer love you, &amp; if you could only know how
                    deeply I was grieved, &amp; disappointed by you not getting my letter, you
                    would never think unkindly of me. I did wish I could see you &amp; tell how
                    it was. I hoped &amp; looked for you Saturday &amp; Sunday. when the
                    horse &amp; buggy came without you &amp; Magnus, the disappointment was
                    so bitter that I cried all the morning I was lonely<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>&amp; truly
                    miserable, because you did not come &amp; my letter was not sent. I knew the
                    roads were bad, but still I wanted you to come. Oh! how Earnestly I did wish for
                    you to come it seems that I never felt more anxious to see you then this time you did not come, &amp; my heart ached under the
                    disappointment it was so hard. I wondered what you would think of me for not
                    answering your last dear letter, &amp; if you did not come it would be so
                    long before you could know how it was, &amp; all that time would he think
                    unkindly of me I only hope you did not blame me. If I did not love you I should
                    tell you so &amp; not treat your dear, &amp; welcome letters with
                    indifference. I<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>could not be so unkind to one I had loved so devotedly
                    as I love you. the neglect was not caused by any change in my affection for you.
                    You are the same dear &amp; beloved object of my heart, &amp; thoughts,
                    just the same only if possibly more dear, for the past four days of suffering by
                    not seeing your dear face &amp; what you would think of me by not getting my
                    letter taught me how necessary you are to my happiness, &amp; how keen the
                    anguish would be for me to give you up, &amp; your precious love. I feel in
                    the deepest recess of my Soul that I love you only with a love that I never gave
                    to living man before, &amp; cannot love another as I love you, &amp;
                    nothing but death can take it from you, &amp; then I will love you in
                    Heaven, for I am trying with God's aid to live a life He loves, so I can go to
                    that Land of rest when called away from Earth, &amp; my loved ones,
                    &amp; My daily prayer</p>
