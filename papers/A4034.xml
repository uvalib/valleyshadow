    <p>I must write to you again upon the eve of an expected battle, that must be one of the most
     sanguinary of the whole war -- The enemy commenced crossings at an early hour this morning,
     lower down the river than before, about a mile &amp; they had quite a fight with our picket
     there &amp; captured a company by flanking them -- we opposed them &amp; opened some
     artillery on them with marked effects keeping them back under the cover of the bank, but this
     shore is commanded by the other &amp; as soon as the fog cleared away we retired to our old
     position &amp; they have been massing troops in our front all day -- &amp; had over
     20,000, over, at dark, and will probably get most of their army over during the night -- and
     tomorrow, O! tomorrow, Death will hold high carnival -- but I am sure, with God's blessing, we
     shall whip them -- they made a demonstration also up in Culpeper, as if they thought of
     advancing towards Richmond by two routes -- I think we have men enough for them &amp; they
     are all in fine spirits -- they cheered Gen. Jackson heartily as he rode along the lines - - he
     sent his wife back to the Junction this morning -- she has only been a week with him --
     enjoying the bliss of conjugal affection &amp; he especially delighted as a father -- I did
     not call to see her -- expecting to do so today -- she is about your size, perhaps a little
     taller, and slenderly formed -- I do not expect to be about much in the fight tomorrow, as
     there are enough to carry orders, unless something should happen to others, when I shall take
     the place of some of them -- but it is somewhat remarkable that not one of Gen. Jackson's Staff
     has ever been wounded seriously -- his prayers are a safe shield -- &amp; he prays much for
     his own military family -- I shall send you some money $50, in a day or so, as soon as the
     month ends, and I want you to buy all the meat you want, cost what it may &amp; <pb n="2"
     />anything else you need -- what is money good for if not for buying what we want -- I can get
     the money to buy Lindsey's place &amp; think I shall buy it -- it can do no harm -- for it
     is worth what he asks for it, and if you prefer staying where you are I can rent it, but it is
     so much more convenient, water, wood &amp;c and then you are not off so by yourself -- Mr
     Earitt is in hearing distance -- &amp;c &amp;c -- you do not say what you think of it
     since you have heard the price -- I want to write to Mr. C. Bear to condole with them for the
     loss of Willie, but they should not mourn -- he was taken away before "the cares of this world"
     had damaged the purity of his character or contaminated the well of goodness that in him was an
     ever flowing fountain -- and he has been transferred to Heaven while his ardor for truth,
     purity &amp; goodness was in its prime. -- and of him I can say, as much as of any one I
     ever had as a pupil, that of him I knew no guile -- peace to his memory he is one of the <hi
      rend="underline">blessed</hi> martyrs in the cause of liberty -- he has gained by his exchange
     of worlds -- &amp; though they "miss him at home" let them remember that "a correspondence
     fixed with Heaven is aye a noble anchor."</p>
    <p> I am sorry you had such a time with Nelly after she ate alum -- she should not eat anything
     unless you tell her she may -- </p>
    <p> I would like to see you all so much -- and I do pray earnestly that we may soon be able to
     end this war and that I may again return to the bosom of my family -- I know you pray so too --</p>
    <p> I feel hopeful for the morrow &amp; will write to you after it has passed --</p>
    <p> Love &amp; kisses for you all -- Write soon -- excuse brevity -- we breakfast at 3
     tomorrow &amp; I must sleep -- God bless you -- </p>
