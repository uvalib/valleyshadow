<p class="p10">Octo. 1st, 1862. </p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My dear friend, </p>
<p class="p10">Having just returned from my imprisonment in Washington I hasten to offer my deepest sympathy
     in the sad bereavement which has fallen upon us in the death of yr. noble Husband. On the fatal
     day of his immolation upon the altar of Patriotism, I was guarded by hireling Yankees, in full
     view of our forces; compelled to witness their heroic sufferings, without being able to offer
     aid or consolation to my wounded and dying companions.</p>
<p class="p10">Late Saturday evening a prisoner was brought into our crowd, who informed us that Col. Baylor
     had fallen, mortally wounded, that day; while lifting the Colors of his his Regiment from the
     ground where they had fallen wh. the gallant color-bearer of the 5<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p class="p10">I can not describe my emotions on receiving this intelligence. I felt as if my own brother
     had been stricken from my side. I <i>[unclear: rebelled]</i> at the Providence that denied me
     the privilege of being by his side and following his remains to their final resting place. I
     recalled the hours wherein we had <i>[unclear: communed]</i> together upon our beds; and
     remembered the deep anxiety which he always expressed in the success of my efforts to awaken a
     religious interest, in the regiment; how he cheered up, as I would tell him of one and another
     of his men, who had come to converse wh. me, on the subject of
     religion; and said wh. earnest emphasis "I would rather a revival of
     religion in my Regiment than to realize any temporal advantage whatever" This solicitude for
     the conversion of souls, manifested by word and acts, is one of the most satisfactory evidences
     of a change of heart. It is the first impulse of a renewed heart to long for<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>the
     conversion of others.</p>
<p class="p10">Another characteristic struck me as very indicative of a saving change. I never knew a man
     addicted to swearing that could refrain from profanity when provoked, without Divine
     assistance: and yet I have seen Col. Baylor under the most harrassing provocations, without
     yielding to the promptings of his old habit. He had completely mastered, at least, that habit.</p>
<p class="p10">Before I had indulged the hope of his conversion, I was frequently astonished at his
     discriminating views on the subject of experimental piety. He seemed to delight in spending
     hours, after others were asleep, in analyzing the emotions of his own heart and repeatedly said
     that he would make a profession of religion; but for his fears of being <i>[deleted: again]</i> ensnared by the world. He also expressed a preference for the Ministry as a
     profession above all others.</p>
<p class="p10">But his conversation during the last day<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> we were together (Tuesday before his
     death) furnished the strongest proof of his concern on the subject of religion and his faith
     the power of <u>Prayer</u>. He asked not less than half a dozen times,
     during the day, an interest in my prayers, in view of the impending conflict, and the last
     words that he spoke to me were "Walton, I do hope that Christians are praying for us, at home."</p>
<p class="p10">He frequently conversed with Gen. Jackson on religious subjects. It is well known that the
     General indulged the warmest feeling of esteem and affection for your Husband. On one occasion,
     when he thought that Col. Baylor was absent from his command and a severe engagement was going
     on he expressed fears that the Brigade would not maintain its reputation; but when he was told
     that your Husband was at his post, he replied "all is right, they will prove worthy of their
     commander."</p>
<p class="p10">Our whole Brigade mourns with you his irreparable loss. I have sent a short obituary to the
     Religious Herald and will forward a copy to you.</p>
<p class="p10">Now dear Gawsey, Harken to this solemn call, learn its fearful teachings and cease more
     entirely from earth &amp; the joys of earth, that you may obtain a firmer hold upon those
     joys that are eternal. Love from Jeanette &amp; self to all your Mother's family.</p>
<p class="p10">Yrs, warmly </p>
