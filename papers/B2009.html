<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: N. C. Brackett to R. M.
                    Manly, December 17, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Brackett reports on the schools in his district, which encompasses the Shenandoah
                    Valley. According to Brackett, Staunton has the most black students in the
                    Valley, and Waynesboro still needs a place to hold classes.</p>

<p class="p10">Chaplain</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to report that the schools under my charge were generally very
                    prosperous during the month of November. The following places, have each about
                    one hundred different pupils in day and evening schools, viz. Harpers Ferry,
                    Martinsburg, Shepherdstown, and Front Royal. They are all making commendable
                    progress. Charlestown has no school, it being impossible to obtain board. I am
                    trying to secure a colored teacher who can board with colored family.
                    Winchester, Harrisonburg and Lexington have each about two hundred pupils. We
                    meet less opposition and more cooperation on the part of the white people in
                    Harrisonburg than in any other town in the Valley. I may add also that the
                    colored people do more for themselves than in any other town.</p>
<p class="p10">In Staunton we had about three hundred <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and fifty pupils in all.</p>
<p class="p10">Several other towns, as Woodstock and Waynesboro are greatly in need of schools,
                    and would have them if buildings were prepared for them.</p>
<p class="p10">In these schools we have a good number who by a little extra training might
                    become competent teachers. We are already beginning to <i>[unclear: fit]</i>
                    the need of a Normal School where the more advanced pupils may go and be
                    properly <i>[unclear: classified]</i> and instructed. I have in my district one
                    teacher sent by the National Freedmens Assn
                    over by the A.M.A., four by
                    the Old School Presbyterians, and twenty by the Baptist House Mission Society.
                    One or two colored persons are also teaching in the district. About fifteen
                    hundred persons in all are daily receiving instruction in this Valley.</p>
