<p class="p10">Dear Father </p>
<p class="p10">I take the present pleasure to let you know that I am well at present hoping you
                    all the rest are the same Further I let you know that we are still at this place
                    There are rumers every day that we would leave I am
                    very much disapointed about staying out hear  so long if there was any fighting fights I wouldn't
                    think of going home but now battles are fought and they <i>[illeg.]</i> but
                        Victory's are won and now they keep us still
                    out hear
                    joust for nothing and make us drill evry day We are now out here nearly three years and since we are out
                        hear there was nothing but fighting almost all <i>[deleted: ]</i> the time<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and we have always done our duty and evry fight we was in we done our share and never was at
                    home once but now the battles are fought and the rebels are driven away now they
                        dont care for the poor soldier when he gets home or
                    if he gets home at all last summer when the rebels were at the gates of
                    washington there <i>[unclear: was]</i> fighting were glad for us then they had
                    a great cheer about Sheridan's cavalry then they were almost scared to death
                    when they hard a few shots fired but now they are out
                    of danger Now they hate us when they see us I don't know when they will do us
                    that favor to muster us out and pay us of but I heard
                    last night that we would be discharged untill October I
                    don't think we<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> will get home before our time is out The paper says
                    all those that there time is out till the first of
                    October will be discharged now, but the rest has to stay till there time is out and they our regiment will
                    be discharged from the time when it was organised
                    and it was organised
                    some time in October I also let you know that the
                    soldiers are getting very rugh they charged on a <i>[deleted: ]</i> last night and took every thing he
