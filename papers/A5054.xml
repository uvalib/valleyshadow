                    for better than a week indeed his recovery was thought very doubtful but is now
                    improving &amp; two of our neighbors children have died with it &amp; I
                    had to be in attendance there so you see I have not had much time for writing. I

                    know what I think of it when you only took three for yours. I was sorry indeed
