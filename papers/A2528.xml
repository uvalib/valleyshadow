     <salute>My <abbr expan="Dear">Dr.</abbr> Wife</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I <abbr expan="received">recd.</abbr> yours telling me that the children are better, for
     which I am truly thankful, and am sorry that I cannot be at home to relieve you of the severe
     burden of care that rests upon you and that I am fearful will make you sick too -- be careful
     &amp; get some one to relieve you as much as possible. I feel sorry for poor <abbr
      expan="John">Jno.</abbr> Harman, he has lost two children and told me this morning that he
     expected two more to die today --when will the pestilence of Scarlet Fever cease from our
     county. I have just been reading the Spectator, it has a good deal of interesting news in it.
     We caged and ironed today the leader of the militia rebellion in <abbr expan="Rockingham"
       >Rock<hi rend="super">m</hi></abbr> he is a tigrous looking fellow: also a Dutchman of a
      <abbr expan="New York Regiment">N. Y. Regt</abbr> was brought in -- he had on him quite a
     number of letters, one from his wife, all in German, in which she berated him soundly for not
     writing to her, but got over her wrath before she ended &amp; wrote to him like a loving
      <orig reg="Frau">Vrow</orig> - - she had come on to Alexandria to see him -- he had several
     letters from others in which they all spoke of being <hi rend="underline">infinitely</hi> tired
     of the war and desirous of getting out of it. O! by the way Sam. Hernsberger, the tall young
     man from McGaheysville that went to school, is here in a Cavalry Co -- he was in Western Va.
     last summer with Wise and he has just told me that Brodt was in the army a member of a <orig
      reg="Kanawha">Kenawha</orig> Co, and furthermore that he was at Roanoke island and was
     probably taken a prisoner there -- good for old B-- <pb n="2"/> that he proved true at last --</p>
    <p> It rains here all the time -- I hope you have a better spell of weather. We are kept in
     doors most of the time of late by it. I am very much pleased with Gen. Jackson and his staff --
     he is at times very chatty, but usually has but little to say -- Sunday he went out through one
     of the Brigades with a bundle of tracts and distributed them -- he stays by himself most of the
     time -- eats very sparingly -- does not drink tea or coffee and hardly eats any meat The <abbr
      expan="Adjutant">Adj.</abbr> Gen -- Lieut. AS Pendleton, son of the Rev. Col. Pendleton of
     Rockbridge -- (the famous Manassas Artillery Capt.) is a young man of about 22 -- light haired
     -- has taught in Lexington, graduated at Wm Coll, &amp; was at the <abbr
      expan="University of Virginia">Univ. of Va</abbr> when the war broke out -- he is talented,
      <orig reg="an">and</orig> admirable talker &amp; man of fine sense &amp; acquirements
     -- he is the one spoken of in the Spectator as carrying off wounded men -- he says he did many
     things he does not remember, at Kernstown, but he knows he did not carry any body off the
     field, and Berkely, the Surgeon of the <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> was not there Dr.
     McGuire says, so it is hard to tell who the surgeon was. Dr. McGuire the Medical Director is
     also a young man of fine talents -- is not more than 26 &amp; has been a <abbr
      expan="Professor">Prof.</abbr> at <abbr expan="Philadelphia">Philad<hi rend="super">a</hi>
     </abbr> &amp; also in New Orleans in a <abbr expan="Medical College">Med. Coll.</abbr> he
     is a son of Dr. <abbr expan="McGuire">McG.</abbr> of Winchester you have often heard of him.
     The Dr. is one of Bro. George sort of men, blunt good humor &amp; full of honest life. Lt.
     Col. Baylor is a good fellow -- first rate, good natured and accommodating -- he will, no
     doubt, be elected Col. of the 5<hi rend="super">th</hi>
     <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> -- we shall miss him much, Lieut. Boswell, the chief of the
      <abbr expan="Engineer">Eng.</abbr> Corps, is an excellent good natured honest Presbyterian of
      <abbr expan="Alabama">Ala.</abbr> formerly of Fauquier <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> -- is
     well off -- has a sweet heart in Fauquier where the Yankees are and he talks much about her --
     he is my bed fellow -- is one of your good fellows that everybody likes and of course I like
     him too -- <pb n="3"/> Lieut. Douglas is from Maryland and has lately been on the staff -- was
     a lieut. in a Company -- he is quite young but has been <orig reg="practicing"
     >practising</orig> law in St. Louis -- is one of your wide awake smart young men -- I like him
     too. Lieut Meade is from Clarke <abbr expan="County">Co.</abbr> he was <unclear>a
     private</unclear> at Manassas and lost his right arm -- he has had a Lieutenancy given him
     because of that -- and is a good negative sort of man, kindly disposed and willing to do all he
     can -- then there are two clerks detailed from the Washington Coll. Co. Logan and Laird -- they
     are good fellows too -- Sergt. Brown is engaged with the <abbr expan="Engineer">Eng.</abbr>
     Corps -- he is Co. <unclear>Surrey</unclear> or of Jefferson, &amp; is an excellent
     surveyor, a big stout fellow -- accommodating &amp; pleasant, but a mass of facts -- a
     painfully matter of fact man, at times, painfully exact, but I really like him nevertheless --
     then add a half dozen darkies of all shades and natures -- &amp; put in your <pb n="4"/>
     husband -- Mr. Lipkiss as one of the Dutch girls here calls me, Mrs. Rude says, that <orig
      reg="can't">cant</orig> say Hotchkiss, and you have the <orig reg="General's">Generals</orig>
     staff described after a fashion. </p>
    <p> I will describe mine host if we stay here much longer. I have nothing of interest to write
     -- the enemy still at the same place, being reinforced we hear -- what a set of cowards they
     must be to want any more troops to oppose our small army. The militia have all been drafted
     into Volunteer Regiments, officers &amp; all. I have the same place I had last year with
     Gen. L. and am <abbr expan="Topographical Engineer">Top. Eng.</abbr> on Gen. <abbr
      expan="Jackson's">J's</abbr> Staff -- I may get a commission as the <abbr expan="Engineer"
      >Eng.</abbr> Corps is to be increased -- I shall get the same pay I did before I suppose. We
     get the papers here every day &amp; the news often comes here from over the Ridge by
     express. I wish I could come in and see you all -- the little darlings -- kiss them for pa --
     Tell Allen to have a good garden well worked and everything done like a good boy that I hope he
     is. My love to all our relations &amp; friends -- read them my letter <hi rend="underline"
      >or</hi> send it up -- for I have not much time to write. Write often. God bless you all </p>
