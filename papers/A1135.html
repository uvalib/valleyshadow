<p class="p10">Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself to drop you a few lines to let you know that I am well hoping these
                    lines will come to hand in dew time &amp; find you
                    all well. I am at Stanton. Our Regment come from Winchester with 19 Hundred prisoners. We had a
                    hard March from Winchester to Stanton. It is 92
                    miles they got on the cars for Richmond &amp; part of our Regment went with them &amp; we are staying here
                    till they come back. We will then start back to Winchester &amp; then on to
                    Maryland I expect for our army is gong there now. There
                    is prisoners coming our army is cuting a big swag at
                    the present is the scale. Dont think we had a good time
                    coming through the Valley. We could get milk &amp; butter, plenty milk, 5
                    cents a quart &amp; butter 50 cents per pound. I spent money every day for
                    mild. I cannot tell you how much was captured from the Yankees at Winchester
                    &amp; Martensburg but it was a great deal of
                    property &amp; 5000 prisoners. I dont know of any thing strange to write that would intrest you so I will close with but few lines. I have
                    stood this March only my feet blister &amp; get very but they are getting
                    better. I must close for the present hoping to see you this fall. Write soon
                    &amp; Direct your letter as before. I may get them I have Rec. one letter from you since you heard I got back
                    to my Regment. I was glad to here you was all well.</p>
