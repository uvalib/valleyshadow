<p class="p10">December 24<sup>
        <u>th</u>
       </sup> 1861</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Miss Mary A. Sibert</p>
<p class="p10">On, on to the rescue, the Vandals are coming--<br> Go meet them with bayonet, sabre and
     spear;<br> Drive them back to the desolate land they are leaving--<br> Go, trusting in God,
     you'll have nothing to fear.<br><br> Confederate States of America</p>
<p class="p10">On the 15<sup>
      <u>th</u>
     </sup> of the <i>[unclear: present]</i> month I recived a note from
      <i>[illeg.]</i> containing a tribute of respect to my much lamented cousin Clinton Hatcher
     with a request to have it published in one of the Leesburg papers which request I complied with
     so far as I was able.</p>
<p class="p10">I took it to the Editor of the Washingtonian and he gave me a promise to have it published in
     the next issue of his paper but it failed to appear for reasons entirely unknown to me.</p>
<p class="p10">I will see him before the next issue and learn the cause of it being delayed and will forward
     the copies desired immediately after its appearance.</p>
<p class="p10">You asked for particulars concerning his death.</p>
<p class="p10">I will give them so far as I know them. He fought like a hero all day with his company and in
     the evening <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> in making a charge on the enemy he rushed on and became separated from
     his company and fell in with the Hillsborough Border Guards whare he
     did good service until just at dark when my Brother who fought with him during the day and was
     then detailed to bring off our <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> Howitzers saw him and Clinton waved his hat to him and cheered him on.</p>
<p class="p10">The fight was just <i>[unclear: closing]</i> and Clinton going on to the river bank, when
     within thirty yards of the bluffs the enemy discharged one more and the last volley when
     Clinton fell with a ball shot through his heart.</p>
<p class="p10">His last words were come on Boys let's give them one more charge. He fought fearlessly and
     well, but poor fellow, I fear he was too rash.</p>
<p class="p10">I sometimes think if he had have had less courage he would not have been killed.</p>
<p class="p10">He thought it his duty to defend to the uttermost his native country and in so doing
     sacrificed his life.</p>
<p class="p10">Poor Clinton, He sleeps his last <i>[deleted: sleep]</i> long happy sleep May he rest in
     peace I will plant the rose as you requested.</p>
<p class="p10">Your sympathetic friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Thaddeus A. Hatcher</i></p>
<p class="p10">P. S. <i>[illeg.]</i> was directed 8<sup>
       <u>th</u>
      </sup> Reg. Va. Vol. <i>[illeg.]</i> forwarded to Centerville and as I was not in the service
      it had to be returned to Leesburg before I recieved it. My office
      is<br>Hamilto<br>Loudoun Co. Va.</p>
