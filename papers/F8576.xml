                <p>The secret is that Lincoln has been compelled to <hi rend="underline"
                    >reconsider</hi>. The pressure is <orig reg="too">to</orig> strong. Had a letter
                    from Lincoln yesterday, unmistakably indicating a change of news on the subject:
                    but not positively excluding Cameron.</p>

                <p>I urged Lincoln to appoint either yourself or Wilmot; but told him that Cameron
                    would be preferable to either <unclear>Pollack</unclear> or
                    <unclear>Reeder</unclear>, as they would be but mere subjects of Cameron. I
                    pressed him strongly to take either Wilmot or yourself on the ground that you
                    both had a creditable national fame, and both were free from the disturbing
                    complications in our State. I put it squarely to Lincoln, why such <pb n="2"/>
                    an appointment could not be made. I told him also that if there were
                    unforeseeable objections I was entitled to know them as he had appealed to: me
                    most earnestly to help him to reconcile matters in our State. He finally
                    answered that <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Cameron">C.</abbr> would <hi rend="underline">not</hi> consent to
                    any other appointment than himself in <abbr expan="Pennsylvania">Penna</abbr>.
                    My answer was -- that I considered that fact the strongest evidence that he was
                    unfit for the trust in a political sense.</p>

                <p>I found that the Cameron retainers about Springfield, of whom Dr Leib &amp;
                    Judd are the chiefs, are against you, &amp; do not fear Wilmot. They
                    doubtless believe that <abbr expan="Wilmot">W.</abbr> would go to the Senate;
                    but I found rumors rife there that you had an odious history in <abbr
                        expan="Pennsylvania">Penna.</abbr> politics. I think you <pb n="3"/> have
                    been struck there as far as that element could do it; but I do not know that it
                    has to any extent succeeded with Lincoln.</p>

                <p>Lincoln told me that to revoke <abbr expan="Cameron's">C's</abbr> appointment now
                    implied his disgrace hence his painful anxiety &amp; hesitation. He doubted
                    much that I said, as he had been led to believe that I was waging a <hi
                        rend="underline">personal</hi> war on <abbr expan="Cameron">C.</abbr> and it
                    may be that I was a little <unclear>taken</unclear> in power even beyond that
                    when I went there: but I made the chances for credibility pretty nearly even
                    between <abbr expan="Cameron">C.</abbr> &amp; myself before I left.</p>

                <p>I <hi rend="underline">think</hi>
                    <abbr expan="Cameron">C.</abbr> is driven out;-- will know positively from
                    Lincoln as soon as it is determined. If he makes the change merely in deference
                    to the opposition sentiment of the State, he will not cloud Cameron by <pb n="4"
                    /> appointing any one in the State: if he becomes convinced fully of my bold
                    allegation, that the Cameron movement here was <hi rend="underline">his own</hi>
                    movement, &amp; managed by stealth while he was declining all the time to
                        <unclear>throw</unclear> honest men <orig reg="off">of</orig> their guard,
                    he will feel like resenting the trick, &amp; either you or Wilmot will be
                    called. As things now are, I would think the chances in favor of Wilmot: but
                    that is not certain. Lincoln asked very specifically as to your position here
                    with regard to our discussions &amp; I need not say that my answer was all
                    you could desire.</p>

                <p>I think at all events Lincoln will not act <hi rend="underline">hastily</hi>
                    again.</p>

                <p>I hope that the arch scoundrel of the State is thrown, &amp; if I am entitled
                    to any credit for it, I am willing to retire. I shall have done my State
                    essential service.</p>
