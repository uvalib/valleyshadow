<p class="p10">Dear Sister Louisa </p>
<p class="p10">I received a letter from you some time ago, which I have neglected to answer as I
                    have been very buisy this while past. I have in my
                    charge 25 new recruits belonging to Co. L, a new
                        Co. which is being formed for our regiment, and
                    it keeps me buisy from morning till night to attend to them. In the fornoon I have to go out with them
                    on a foot drill, and in the afternoon we have a mounted drill. This morning
                    about 9 O'clock it commenced to snow, and it is still snowing yet, 4 o'clock
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> and we will therefore not go out on drill this afternoon,
                    so I thought I would write you a letter, although I have not much news to tell
                    you for we are now almost in the sea of our army and hardly know what is going
                    on in front. I wrote a <br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br>letter to sister Hannah a few days ago which I
                    suppose she has received by this time. I received one letter from Amanda, which
                    I answered when we were at Williamsport, but I have not received any letter from
                    her since, and Anne has not wrote to me yet. I would
                    be very glad to receive a letter from her and I heard that Spencer Brand was
                    very sick. I am anxious to hear how he is by this time. We have a young fellow
                    in Co. H by the name of James <i>[illeg.]</i> and
                    I dondt doubt but what you know him and there is one in
                        Co. L named Flechenstein, he used to live at
                    the cowpath road, perhaps you know him, and Charles Johnson the Blacksmith, who
                    used to live in Line Lexington is in Co. M but
                    neither of them knew me any more. Charles Johnson lived at <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    square and was drafted, and as soon as he was drafted he enlisted in this
                    regiment. he has been here a little over a week. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I have not heard
                    from the 104th Penn. since we came into
                    Maryland; if you have heard from any of them, I would be glad to hear how they
                    are getting along and where they are. has Searg.
                    Mathis gone to his regiment yet? I got my Photograph taken at Frederick and
                    enclosed you will find one if you will please to except of it. I must now bring my letter to a close, hoping that it may
                    find you all in as good health as I enjoy at present. Give my best respects to
                    all enquiring friends. my compliments and love to all the family at home. I
                    remain </p>
