                </opener>

                <p>I spent the last week at the <unclear>farm</unclear>, &amp; did not return
                    until Monday evening. This will explain why I did not write to you sooner. </p>

                <p>I have always thought it was your pecuniary interest to have the whole land of
                        M<hi rend="super">r</hi> M<hi rend="super">c</hi>Cue sold, &amp; I
                    believe that it was the <unclear>course</unclear> but calculated to ensure
                    harmony &amp; kind feeling among all parties interested. Nothing but your
                    strong desire to return the <unclear>manni-</unclear>
                    <unclear>house</unclear> caused me to abandon my position. My opinions however
                    remain unchanged, &amp; were I in your position, I would prefer a sale of
                    the whole. I fear, if you return the home place, you will be harrassed during
                    life, &amp; have a struggle to get on &amp; educate your children. I
                    never thought the home a durable one for you, &amp; were I in your place I
                    would still let it be sold. If it went for a moderate price, you might buy it.
                    if not, let it go, &amp; look elsewhere. Property must fall, &amp; you
                    can do better with this money six months hence. You will find it a troublesome.
                    and in ordinary times, an unprofi <pb n="2"/> table thing to carry on such a
                    farm. It would be better to have a less costly home, &amp; the surplus money
                    in production stocks. You would then be certain of a revenue even in case of a
                    failure of crops. A small farm sufficient to furnish your own supplies, with the
                    balance of your money at interest, would be better in all respects.</p>

                <p>You had better come up on Monday, &amp; qualify as guardian for your
                    children. Come to my office &amp; I will have <orig reg="everything">every
                        thing</orig> arranged so that you will be detained but a few minutes. you
                    can then go to our home to dinner &amp; return, if necessary, in the
                    evening.</p>

                <p>When you come up, we can talk matters over, more in detail</p>

                <p>I think <abbr expan="Colonel">Col</abbr> Bell had better file a bill &amp;
                    let Judge Thompson settle the matters of the estate both real &amp; personal</p>
