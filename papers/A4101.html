<p class="p10">Oct 21<sup>

      </sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Hd. Qrs. V. D. New Market Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">We went down day before yesterday after the enemy, marching three Divisions under the gallant
     Gordon around by the end of the Massanutton Mt, marching all night while the others advanced in
     front, in the night also &amp; Rosser moved to the left -- just before daylight a
     simultaneous attack was made on both flanks of the enemy at Cedar Creek, where they were
     strongly entrenched &amp; we surprised them completely our men swept over the works
     &amp; the 8<u>
      <sup>th</sup>
     </u> &amp; 19<sup>th</sup> Corps &amp; cleared them out completely from
     their camps, captured 20 pieces of artillery, ambulances, wagons all the tents of the two
     Corps, in fact gained one of the most complete victories I ever witnessed -- the 6<sup>th</sup> Corps made a stand N. W. of Middletown but our artillery forced them to
     retire -- Rosser also drove them on the left We halted near Midelletown &amp; reformed our lines preparatory to another advance but so many of
     our troops had left the ranks to plunder the Yankee camps that it was a long time before it
     could be done -- in the mean time
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>by the aid of their numerous cavalry the enemy rallied their fugitives, except the
     1300 we had captured, &amp; formed a body of them, of no great size, that moved up
     &amp; attacked our left which was siezed with a sudden, unexpected &amp; unneccessary
     panic &amp; gave way &amp; the whole line did the same thing, but our artillery
     &amp; some infantry held them back &amp; we retired over Cedar Creek more like a mob
     than an army, still the enemy did not gain any great advantage or take many prisoners &amp;
     our trains and artillery were all over &amp; moving off &amp; it seemed that the
     substantial <u>result</u> would be ours, when a small body of Yankee Cavalry
     dashed upon our train by a <u>by</u> road &amp; by killing horses
     &amp; overturning wagons, amulances &amp; artillery threw all into confusion &amp;
     as it was night no one could tell what to do so the train &amp; artillery was captured --
     at least left &amp; the Yankees got it, not by force of arms but because our army had
     become disorganized -- we lost 30 pieces &amp; about 100 wagons &amp; ambulances, but
     brought off our prisoners &amp; much that we had captured -- the enemy's loss in killed was
     very hevy, they fairly lay in heaps -- they have lost not less than
     6000 in killed wounded &amp; prisoners -- our loss in men is small &amp; our army is
     again together &amp; organized &amp; ready for a fight -- I do not think the enemy will
     follow us -- the cavalry came slowly after us &amp; halted when we did we are now here in
     camp. A more splendidly conceived &amp; executed movement I never saw &amp; if our men
     had behaved the reverse could not have happened -- I got a letter from Nelson yesterday,
     Harriet has had Typhoid fever for 6 weeks &amp; was very low -- she is now getting better
     -- they have had much sickness but are getting better I have written to Allie &amp; Ed.
     Palmer -- asked him to aid the Stout <i>[illeg.]</i> who are in prison at Elmira -- Mr.
     Robinson wishes you to keep his clothes for him -- Excuse my hasty note -- I want it to go
     today -- Love &amp; blessings for you all -- write soon </p>
<p class="p10">Yours <u>as ever</u></p>
