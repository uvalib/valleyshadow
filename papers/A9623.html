     Arbor Hill Va <br>Jany 12th <br>
     Miss A.C. Armentrout, <br>Greenville, Virginia
     Arbor Hill, Va.
    </b><br></p>

<p class="p10">Jan. 12th 1861</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Miss Midie;</p>
<p class="p10">In congratulation of your epistle, &amp; the interrogatives therein, which was so very
     striking indeed; &amp; from such, is a natural impulse on my part to respond, in my feeble
     way to your missive on the 21<sup>st</sup>
     ult. Happy to hear of general health, &amp; the improving of
     Nic's mind, &amp; very sorry to hear of the casualty of Miss Sue, (on her way to visit)
      <i>[added: you]</i> which no doubt marred her enjoyment to some extent.</p>
<p class="p10">And so you made a break on the Creek at last: Mr. Jas. Hall.
     Wonder who will <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>follow suit, as you intimated there were several talked of.</p>
<p class="p10">Perhaps <u>you</u> for one, as pictures have been passing, &amp;
     pressure the pen has been running too, with phrases of deepest emotion of mutual affection ha
     ha. "Now what do you think?" Just get the Cologne bottle, &amp; perfume for the Old Target.
     As for my part, <u>my</u> watch is dumb, &amp; horse have I not.</p>
<p class="p10">Should liked to have taught at the Creek this winter, but could not forfeit my word,
     &amp; leave here. I am however very well satisfied, with neighborhood &amp; boarding
     residence.</p>
<p class="p10">You will have to take <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>wills for deeds; it was out of my power to go either to
     singing, or to your house.</p>
<p class="p10">I did not get home till Sunday prior to Christmas, &amp; on Monday night had my Cousins
     from Illinois with me, &amp; for that reason could not go to your house on that day; in
     fact had company nearly every day &amp; night during the Holyday. Was at a Taffy pulling; had a fine time eating hard Molasses with <u>unwashen hands</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Did you ever pull any, when you had to <u>spit</u> on your hands to keep
     it from adhering to them? "Oh where did &amp;c &amp;c What foolishings, what foolery.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>Miss Eliza sends her love to you, &amp; says she is making her wedding dress,
     out of red calico trimmed with white strings.</p>
<p class="p10">Hard times on this side, no doubt with you. disunion and war was the cry, &amp; now a
     reality. Sad thoughts, that the ties of the Republic, are busted.</p>
<p class="p10">Oh Washington where are thy warnings? O Jacksons, where are you? Where is Lucian, these
     times; &amp; how are you &amp; <i>[added: he]</i> thriving these
     days, as you were once very intimate.</p>
<p class="p10">Excuse all foolishness &amp; accept my kindest regards, &amp; well wishings, for your
     prosperity &amp; future happiness.</p>
<p class="p10">Truly Yours,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>From a Friend</i></p>
