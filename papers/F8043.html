<h4>Franklin County: F. S. Stumbaugh to Simon Cameron,
                    January 18, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Stumbaugh comments on a letter he sent to Lincoln concerning Pennsylvania's
                    economic interest in a cabinet appointment, and he discusses the secession
                    crisis.</p>

<p class="p10">Hon Simon Cameron<br>Dr Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I sent the paper to Mr Lincoln &amp; gave him a history of the proceedings in
                    the case. I hope Mr Lincoln, as I wrote confidentially will not put McClure in
                    possession of the letter. I think he will have a pretty fair Expression of the
                    opinion held almost universally in this community of the integrity &amp;
                    general character of McClure, from the various letters written from this place.
                    The people here are Exceedingly anxious that their protection be granted soon by
                    the American Congress to our languishing mercantile, manufacturing &amp;
                    mechanical interest, could not something be<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>done with the
                        <i>[unclear: Moril]</i> Tariff bill in the Senate of the U.S</p>
<p class="p10">Everything in the shape of Trade is languishing for want of protection.</p>
<p class="p10">We are all a unit for the Maintenance of the land of the Country &amp; if
                    wanted--1000 men can be gathered together in this county in 3 days to march
                    anywhere to protect &amp; defend the Stars &amp; Stripes of our Country.</p>
<p class="p10">The Chambers Artillery think of going to the inaugeration providing it would not raise the ire of the South, we
                    are not very much in favor of compromise under threat, but would gladly support
                    any measure looking to the purchase &amp; colonization of the negroes of
                    Delaware Maryland, Missouri and Louisiana &amp; Texas, we want no more Slave
                    States, except by the<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>expressed wish of the people who reside in the
                    territory at the time they ask to be admitted as a State. Pardon my freedom in
                    thus addressing you from whom I would gladly receive instruction in Politician
                    Economy.</p>
<p class="p10">With the hope you will receive &amp; accept a position in Mr Ls-- Cabinet, whom you will be the better able to
                    carry out those great measures for which your whole life has been spent</p>
