<p class="p10">Dec. 13<sup>th</sup> (Saturday) 1862 5 A.M.</p>
<p class="p10">Camp 4 m. S.W. of Fredericksburg</p>
<p class="p10">My Dr Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">We are on the morning of an impending battle. I doubt not, as the two armies are fronting
     each other &amp; not more than 3/4 of a mile apart, the enemy on this shore of the
     Rappahannock &amp; on the bluffs on the other side while we occupy the the first terrace,
     this side of the river, which is wooded and varying from 20 to 150 ft. above the river bottom,
     which is about a mile wide, our line of battle is about six miles long, our troops in fine
     spirits and confident of success -- our Generals, seemingly, trustful &amp; confidant also
     - - There was no fighting but skirmishing yesterday &amp; artillery, but a tremendous
     conflict must come today, I feel quite certain. What my fate may be I know not, I can only
     trust in a merciful God, whose favor has never forsaken me -- and hope for his protection --.
     May he grant us victory, and may it be the means of <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> of bringing peace to our
     destructed land --. If it should be my lot to lay down my life for my country's cause I can
     only hope that God &amp; my country will befriend you and my children, my only legacy, I am
     sorry to say so, will be a father's blessing, and, I trust, an example they need not be ashamed
     of -- I will not send this until after the day has passed --</p>
<p class="p10"> I have many articles here that belong to me -- mess chest &amp; utensils - - maps
     &amp;c -- which Nelson will have to come for if I should fall --</p>
<p class="p10"> God grant I may do my duty to my country and to him -- And may he bless you &amp; ours
     for his Son's sake </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate husband</p>
