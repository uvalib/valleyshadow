<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">I respectfully <i>[added: forward]</i> copy of Record of
                    Board of Agents sitting at Staunton June
                    28/66 and copy of a letter addressed to James E. Carson receipt of which
                    he acknowledged by calling at this office and promising to settle which he has
                    not done and I learn does not intend to do.</p>
<p class="p10">Joseph Harrison (c) who is poor states he has no
                    means to sue in County Court amt. being in excess of
                    a Magistrates Court jurisdiction that he fears even these he should not have a
                    fair verdict and further he understands Carson will plead benefit of
                        <i>[unclear: Stay]</i> Law and as judgement by Board of Agents was rendered
                    in his favor while the said Board was empowered by the military to hear and
                    adjudge on such cases, he <i>[unclear: asks]</i> an order from the Maj. Genl.
                    <i>[unclear: Com<sup>anding</sup>]</i> to enforce the judgement in
                    his favor for $35 95/100 with Interest to June 1/66
                    $5 11/100 &amp; Int. on $35 95/100 from June 1/66 to date of Settlement. Carson is an
                    old slave dealer <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and was a bitter rebel. He is abundantly able to pay
                    at any time, and an order in his case would cause prompt settlement of several
                    claims made by Freedmen through this office which they have not the means to
                    prosecute in the courts.</p>
