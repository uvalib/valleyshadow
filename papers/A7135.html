<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 30<sup>th</sup> came duly in which you say that you will send a man for Mt Solon as soon as transportation comes</p>
<p class="p10">I have not heard from that point since the application made by Mr Jas W. Cochran (colored) the other day for a teacher</p>
<p class="p10">I will go down to Mt. Solon tomorrow if I can, and find out how school matters are--would go to day were it not for rain which has made it uncertain about my being to able to ford the river.</p>
<p class="p10">Will report immediately thereafter.--Jan 2  Dont believe I can get to Mt. Solon to day, but I want to see the place myself if I can before you send on<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> a teacher.  Have written there.  The name of the colored man who made application for a teacher is James W. Cochran. Mt. Solan.</p>
<p class="p10">I dont think it possible that any arrangement has been made for that place but still I havnt heard</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
