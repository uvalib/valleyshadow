<p class="p10">July 30, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Madison C.H.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister Kate,</p>
<p class="p10">It has been a long time since I received a letter from you, I suppose you have some on the
     way, but as we have been marching for the last month <u>constantly</u>, they
     have not been able to finde my camp. I received a letter from Addie
     yesterday also a <u>short</u> one from Cos. Linda. I understand you have
     been complayning a great deal lately. I hope you are well now,
     you must take good care of your health. We have had two dear Brothers taken frome us, God grant the rest may be <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/garb15b.jpg"><center><img src="images/garb15b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      left us. We expect to remain here a few days. This will be the first
     rest (of any course) we have had since we left <i>[unclear: Gin Station]</i> the 1<sup>st</sup> of June. Oure Horses are almost completely broken
     down, can scarcely drag the Guns, this morning is the first corn they have been fed for 20
      dayes, as we are near the Rail now we will be able to get
      <i>[unclear: good feed]</i> for them. Mr. <i>[unclear: Hallan]</i> I
     <i>[unclear: understand]</i> is inquiring about Jim. him &amp; Michael
     <i>[unclear: Duregher]</i> deserted the company in Yorke City and have not been heard of
     since. </p>
<p class="p10">Tell Ma I left a <i>[unclear: bundle]</i> of 25 yards of calico in New Market at the hous
     <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/garb15c.jpg"><center><img src="images/garb15c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     of Mr. D. L. Thomas. Asher left a <i>[unclear: bundle]</i> there
     too, we were not able to carry it and did not know that we would be near home. If you have an
     opportunity you can get the bundles from Mr. Thomas. </p>
<p class="p10">He is a Brother of Henry Thomas of Staunton. I am very badly off for Shirts. I have to borrow
     one untill I can have mine washed. I have but the one. </p>
<p class="p10">Our Corps is the only part of the army encamped here, do not know where the rest of the army
     is, it is said that we will move in the direction of Gordonsville in a few dayes. Ask Nellie why she does not write <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="images/garb15d.jpg"><center><img src="images/garb15d.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      to me occasionley, I suppose bothe of you are having holiday now, Does Nellie run off as much as ever,
     tell her she must be a good girl.</p>
<p class="p10">Cos John I understand is better write soon and tell me about him.</p>
<p class="p10">We are having as many black berries as we can eat - there is an abundance of them this year.</p>
<p class="p10">Love to all my friends, tell them I will expect to hear frequently from home now, as we are
     expecting the army to take a rest of a few dayes, and letters will be
     able to find the way to camp. Tell me all about home, every thing
     is interesting. <u>does</u> the Foundry look like old times, is the
     Henderson <i>[unclear: Cupola]</i>
     <i>[unclear: tender]</i>. Remember me to the Chaps and do write soon to your Bro.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Mike</i></p>
<p class="p10">Tell the young girl the soldier boyes don't like
      the way thes Marylanders have of carrying them off. There will be
      none left for us when we return.</p>
