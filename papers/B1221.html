<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John Scott to William R.
                    Morse, January 12, 1869<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Scott, the local educational agent in Staunton after the closing of the Bureau,
                    reports briefly on a few schools. He also notes that black leadership of their
                    own schools is not in their own interests.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Jan 12/69</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">The Blanks for Teachers Monthly Reports came duly. I was absent at the time but
                    they are now received.</p>
<p class="p10">The schools of which I have controll, I will endeavor
                    to see that are reported to you by the 30 <i>[unclear: es]</i> per request.</p>
<p class="p10">The school now kept by Jacklin Strange is not under my controll nor the one kept at Greenville by Miss Emily Rodney.</p>
<p class="p10">Nevertheless I will forward them the blanks and <i>[unclear: read]</i> to
                    Strange (who I think has charge of the Greenville school) your request to me.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Scott</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. An opinion among the colored people that they are
                        capable of taking the lead in their own educational affairs, roundabout here
                        is working badly against their interest.</p>
