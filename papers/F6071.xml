    <p>P. T. Zarhoviy attempts to answer M. L. Brewer's questions about his grandfather's will and
     estate. Zarhoviy suggests that M. L. Brewer direct several questions to his uncle George W.
     Brewer. In relating his knowledge of his grandfather's affairs, Zarhoviy mentions "Old Negro
     Poll," as an heir, probably a daughter since she is later referred to as "your Aunt
    Pollie."</p>

    <p>It would be more than useless to make an <orig reg="apology">opoligy</orig> for not answering
     your <orig reg="queries">quiries</orig>
     <hi rend="underline">much</hi> sooner. I will however say, I forgot it from time to time <abbr
      expan="until">till</abbr> it is too back</p>

    <p>I am not posted to answer your <orig reg="queries">quiries</orig>, I will however give you
     all I can recollect In the first place my <abbr expan="administration">adm</abbr> on your
     Father <orig reg="estate">estete</orig>
     <orig reg="compelled">come pelled</orig> me to get a <orig reg="copy">coppy</orig> of your
      <abbr expan="Grandfather's">G. Fathers</abbr> will, This I got only a short time before I
     requested to be released as <abbr expan="administrator">adm</abbr> and Andrew Kershner was
      <abbr expan="appointed">appointd</abbr> by the Court <abbr expan="administrator">adm</abbr>
     <unclear>De Bower</unclear> Now, and I gave up all papers &amp; credits in my hand to him.
     I recollect well that by your <abbr expan="Grandfather's">G.F.</abbr> will all his children
     were mentioned even Old Negro Poll, and as your Fathers part was a set off against his legacy*
     I was compelled to know the worth of the will your <orig reg="Uncle">Unkle</orig>
     <abbr expan="George">Geo</abbr> Brewer was executor in will and thus far only I became initated
     in the Settlement with <abbr expan="George">Geo.</abbr>
     <abbr expan="Brewer">B</abbr>. Andrew Kershner however found it necessary to sell your Fathers
     lands. This is a matter I could never understand, as it appeared to me all might have been paid
     without selling all the land <pb n="2"/>Your <orig reg="Uncles">Unkles</orig> and aunts <orig
      reg="were">ware</orig> all mentioned and cared for in your <abbr expan="Grandfather's"
     >G.F.s</abbr> will, as said before, but as to the <abbr expan="amount">amt</abbr> of each
     legacy, I am not able to say at this time Henry Brewer's Heirs are <abbr expan="George"
     >Geo.</abbr> Brewer, Henry Brewer, Emanuel <abbr expan="Brewer">B-</abbr> Elisabeth Brewer-(Mrs
      <unclear>Feidt</unclear>) Polly Brewer (Mrs Troxell) Sallie Brewer (Mrs Herschberger) and
     Negro Pollie This is all I can say about the will &amp; Matter your <orig reg="only"
     >onley</orig> way is to have a <orig reg="copy">coppy</orig> of your <abbr
      expan="Grandfather's">G.F.s</abbr> will, and <orig reg="copy">coppy</orig> of the settlements
     made with the orphans Court. Also a <orig reg="copy">coppy</orig> of settlements made by your
      <orig reg="Uncle">Unkle</orig>
     <abbr expan="George">Geo</abbr>, as <abbr expan="administrator">adm</abbr> of your Aunt Mary
     Traxell This will show you all you need on the subject and all that will be of any use to you
     in the premises. I suppose you have done So already. I would do it at <orig reg="once"
     >onc</orig> if not done. If my recollection serves me right John Traxell could not get at his
     wifes legacy, But is so long since that I forget, it perhaps was a lieu on some real <orig
      reg="estate">estete</orig> the interest of which fell annually to your Aunt Pollie. I know
     there <orig reg="were">ware</orig> some kinks in <orig reg="reference">referance</orig> to her
     legacy. Troxell was a shiftless man and <unclear/> a guard against squandering by your <abbr
      expan="Grandfather">G. Father</abbr>. I am sorry that I delayed this matter so long. Nothing
     however can go wrong by this as your course is before on record in Washington County <abbr
      expan="Maryland">Md</abbr> in the Prothonotory office We are all well. My respects to you
     &amp; family write soon.</p>
