<p class="p10">Dear Aunt</p>
<p class="p10">I take my pen in hand this evening to write you a few lines to let you know that I am well
     and hope when these few lines come to hand they may find you all enjoying the same blessing. I
     have nothing of importance to write. The enemy appears to be quiet although we may be at any
     time disturbed by the heavy sound of Artillery, and clash of small arms. In our late battle we
     lost one of our best members. Corporal Samuel Lucas. he was shot in the mouth and killed
     instantly; at the time he was struck he was laughing, had his mouth open the ball entered
     without cutting his lips and ranged upwards<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Smiley52b.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley52b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      We are now looking for his friends to come after his body which
     was buried as decently as circumstances would admit of. I take this method of thanking you and
     Aunt Anna for your kindness in sending me the Central Presbyterian, and the eatables you have
     sent from time to time. I have no way to repay you for your kindness except by reading the
     Papers, and observing the good advice contained in them which I try to do to the best of my
     ability. The papers are welcomed by a good many in the company they ask for them even before I
     can read them myself as soon as I read them I give them to others and it goes through the
     greater part of the company. But as I have not much more writing space left I will close by
     asking you to give my love to all enquiring friends and a large
     share to yourself &amp; Aunt Anne. </p>
<p class="p10"> Nothing more but remain as ever your affectionate nephew</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Thomas M. Smiley</i></p>
<p class="p10">N.B. (Please Write soon)</p>
