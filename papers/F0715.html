        <i>[deleted: March]</i>April, 9 <a href="#n1">[1]</a>
      </p>
<p class="p10"> Point Pleasant, Va
      </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Friend:</p>
<p class="p10">I received a letter <br> from you some time since, <br> which I will now proceed <br> to
     answer. I should have <br> answered it sooner, but as <br> we were constantly expecting <br>
     marching orders, I thought I <br> would delay writing until <br> I could tell you our destina- <br> tion. </p>
<p class="p10"> But as we are now <br> apparently as far from leaving <br> as we were when we first <br>
     came here, I will now write <br> to you and you can send <br> your answer to this place
     &amp; <br> I will be likely to receive it. </p>
<p class="p10">Your letters will always be <br> very welcome, as coming from 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/BitSho2b.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitSho2b.gif"></center></a><br><br> a locality where I have spent <br> a very short portion of my
     <br> life, and from a friend who <br> I learned to esteem. Should <br> there be any seeming
     lack of <br> punctuality in my answers <br> you will attribute it to the <br> fact that a
     military camp is <br> not the best place in the world <br> for writing and that the mails
     <br> in this part of the country are <br> very irregular. </p>
<p class="p10">Spring has finally made its <br> appearance here. Welcome, Spring <br> to all the sons of
     Mars. We have <br> been wading through mud knee <br> deep all winter, and it seems <br>
     quite a novelty to walk on <br>
     <u>terra firma</u> again. </p>
<p class="p10">J. C. Fremont has superceded <br>
     Gen. Rosecrans in this department <br>
     and made his headquarters at <br>
     Wheeling, and I hope some= <br>
      
      
      <p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/BitSho2c.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitSho2c.gif"></center></a><br><br></p> thing may be done this Spring. <br> There is a rumor
     that we <br> will go to Tennessee. For the <br> last two weeks we
     have been <br> drilled almost to death. Squad <br> drill from 6 to 7 A.M. Company <br> drill
     from 9 to 11 A.M. Batalion <br> Drill from 2 to 4 ½ P.M. Dress <br> Parade from 5 to
     5 ½ P.M. and <br>
     <i>[deleted: n]</i> non-commissioned officers <br> school from 7 to 8 in the evening. <br>
     If we don't soon become a well <br> drilled Regiment, we ought
     to. </p>
<p class="p10">I wrote a letter to Uncle Conrad
     <br> some time since and received <br> no answer. Will you remind <br> him of it. My
     respects to all <br> the friends, and compliments <br> to the ladies. Write soon and <br>
     let it be a long letter. </p>
<p class="p10">Your Friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>D.R.P. Shoemaker
      <br>
      Co. E. 11th Reg.
      O.V.U.S.A.</i></p>
<p class="p10"> P.S. The papers you were kind <br> enough to promise will be <br>
      thankfully received. We get <br> up a small sheet here sometimes <br> called the <u>Eleventh Ohio</u>. I <br> will send you a copy of the <br> next number.<br>
      D.R.P.S.</p>

     </a>Although Shoemaker does not include the year,<br> we have determined that the letter was
      written in 1862, based <br> on information about where the regiment was camped at the time
      (see <br> Joshua H. Horton and Solomon Teverbaugh, A History of the Eleventh <br> Regiment,
      Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Dayton, Ohio: W. J. Shuey, 1866, p.60).</p>
