                <p>Now let me give you the picture of a very busy family. A mother &amp; her
                    daughters Ma is making bread. Ada ironing Lola churning. Hattie &amp; Lula
                    entertaining their company on the green sward. I have just left the <orig
                        reg="spinning">spining</orig> wheel for the more pleasant duty of answering
                    your welcome letter of Tuesday. I was so glad to hear from you that you were
                    well. God is truly good &amp; merciful to us sinful creatures. I have not
                    finished my <orig reg="spinning">spining</orig> yet. will try hard to get
                    through by Saturday if I live. I was rejoiced to hear that you are coming down
                    Sunday I can scarcely wait until then it seems so long since you were<pb n="2"
                    />here. I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> a letter from Rennie to day she
                    &amp; David are coming up Sunday you will get to see them. she told me to
                    say to you that "she was still true to her cousin Davie" sends love to you. The
                    good people of Mt. Solon are busy now making peach &amp; apple butter. I am
                    invited to an "apple butter boiling" tomorrow night at Mrs. Cupp's. I am going
                    to send <hi rend="underline">ma</hi> in my place. I think she would enjoy
                    herself vastly well just as much as I should were I to go. I have made no visits
                    since my return home the report is floating now that I have come home to make
                    preparations for my marriage with you. That Rennie &amp; I are to be married
                    at the same time. Dame Rumor has it all very nicely arranged. Sam Ferror's
                    sisters want me to come<pb n="3"/>&amp; stay a few weeks with them. Sam will
                    come up for me when I conclude to go. I did not promise as I expected to return
                    to Staunton before I go any where else. I look at your photographs often they
                    are so much like you. I don't know how I could content my self without them
                    since I cannot see the dear original. I wish you had a good one of me when I go
                    back to Staunton you shall have one. When you come down Sunday I'm going to give
                    you some pies to eat of my own <hi rend="underline">making</hi> you said I could
                    not make pies Lula is a dear good child she kneels at my feet every night
                    &amp; says her childish prayer "Now I lay me down to sleep" then asks me if
                    the angels will watch while she sleeps after the "goodnight kiss" she is put in
                    her soft white bed at 8 O'clock but not to close the blue<pb n="4"/>eyes until I
                    tell her a "<unclear>Rat</unclear> Tale" as usual. We have not heard from pa
                    since he left look for a letter tomorrow. I wish I could see you this evening it
                    would give me more pleasure than any thing if I could hear your footsteps in the
                    hall. I must be contented as it is for that can't be to day or for two more
                    days. If I'm not on the porch Sunday to meet you just know that I am in the
                    kitchen. but I want to be on the porch &amp; will if I live be there The
                    ladies of Mt. Solon are going to have a grand "Picknick" the 25th of this month.
                    Ada is one of the <unclear>lady's</unclear> committee I have nothing to do with
                    it so far. Be sure &amp; come Sunday I am so anxious to see you. Ma send
                    love to you. Did you send me the Ledger last week? if so I did not get it. Take
                    care of yourself I send a kiss &amp; love to you come come Sunday will soon
                    be here I'm so glad May God bless &amp; protect you is the prayer of one who
                    loves you. Goodnight.</p>
