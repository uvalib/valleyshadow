<p class="p10">Sept 13, 1862</p>
<p class="p10">VMI,</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Papa </p>
<p class="p10">I have been intending to write to you for several days but thought I would wait a
                    day or two so that if I wanted anything from home I could write for them and
                    very well I did as I want you to send me the books with the following names:
                    Bolmar's Levizack's French Grammar, &amp; Penney &amp; Badois Practical
                    french grammar &amp; Dictionary, Modern and Ancient geography &amp;
                    atlas, Smiths &amp; Dukes Arithmetic as it will be a great help to me in
                        studdying Algebra. They have allways had books here untill this year and
                    I don't no why they have not gotten them this year. Tell
                    Ma to send me my gray Roundybout as we will not get our uniform for a month yet
                    and perhaps more.</p>
<p class="p10">I reckon you think I spend half my time writing but I think so much of home and
                    the dear ones there that I cannot help writing. I would give so much to see you
                    all to day. Tell Brother Jim and sister that they must
                    not give out their trip to Natural Bridge this fall as it would disappoint me
                    very much. </p>
<p class="p10">I am rooming now with Rough Griffin son of Dr. G of Salem and like him very much.
                    About one half of the boys here are very nice boys the other half are perfect
                        roudies. When you write let me know how you are
                    getting along on the farm and wheather uncle Archer
                    has heard from his horse and write me how Nanny looks. Pleas dont let any one hack her about. </p>
<p class="p10">We are not regularly started with our studies yet will get straight by next week.
                    I received Sisters letter last week the other day and was delighted to hear from
                    home &amp; to hear that Grandpapa &amp; Uncle M had improved so much.
                    Give my best love to uncle M. &amp; Aunt Liz when you see them and tell them
                    that I regretted not seeing them very much. What horse will Jimmy Armistead get.</p>
<p class="p10">Tell Sister I have been on guard twice once on police and once on fatigue. I
                        dont mind police guard much as I dont have to stand long at a time but fatigue guard is very hard
                    duty. You have to stand 2 hours at a time and then you are off 4 and <i>[unclear: 
                        on
                    ]</i> 2. You are put on guard one morning at 6 and come off the next at 6
                    but that exempts you from drill or any other Military duty and from your studies
                    also but I will not have to go on that kind of guard for a month yet. The other
                    kind of guard does not exempt you from any duty whatever.</p>
<p class="p10">Pleas send me the papers when you send the books as I
                    have only heard that there was a battle at Manassas and one in Kentucky and that
                    is all I know about it. I have made on Algebra this week 10 1/2 3 being the
                    highest mark and I missed one day the day I was on fatigue guard. I consider the
                    mark very good as I never studdied algebra before and
                    don't understand how to work by letters. I dont know
                    what I got on my other studdies as our marks were not
                    read out to us in French and geography but I hope and trust that they are good.
                    I would like to do well here as it is such a great thing for one to do well
                    here. </p>
<p class="p10">They say no one can get furlough here unless they have been here 6 months. 6
                    months sounds longer to me now than 12 years did before. It is a sad thought to
                    me to think of 6 months. Write me all the news when you write as I dont hear a word now. Tell uncle Archer to write to me
                    and let me know how much copperas he is making a day. Write me how everything is
                    going on the farm. Tell brother Jim I will write to him next but he must not
                        <i>[unclear: want]</i> to receive one before he writes. Is he gaining his
                    strength rapidly or not. Tel him that the Bridge will
                    pay any one for coming to see it. I didnt have time to look at it well I only stopped long enough to get
                    my breakfast.</p>
<p class="p10">I feel very sick at my stomach every morning getting up so soon and drilling an
                        our before breakfast. We get up at five and go down
                    to roll call having from 3 to 5 minutes to dress and roll up and strap our beds.
                    We go to tattoo at half past 9 and the roll is called again then we have half an
                        our to fix down our beds and undress. Tell Ma I
                        all ways take time in that half our to read my bible. Then the lights are tapped out and if there be
                    light burning after the drum qits
                    beeting the orderly of the room gets 5 or 10 demerits
                    for it &amp; one of the boys in the room are made orderly every week and is
                    responsible for any noise made in it and if any nois
                    should be made in the room during study hours the orderly is reported for it and
                    gets from 3 to 5 demerits for it or if any thing in the room should be out of
                    order or out of place the orderly is reported for it. The inspectors of rooms
                    visits 3 to 6 times a day.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my love to all at Cousin H<i>[unclear: 
                        Hues
                    ]</i> &gt; and at aunt Sarahs. You all must write often. Give my best love to
                    all at home.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain as ever your attached son, </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Kent. </i></p>
