<h4>Franklin County: E. to Edward McPherson, April 1,
                    1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>E. reports Jane Boggs's death to Edward McPherson and mentions good news about
                    Kate, Edward's sister. E. urges McPherson to become a practicing Christian, so
                    he can better serve his country. She also announces that Mr. Page is broke and
                    that Cousin C. is not better.</p>

<p class="p10">April 1<sup>st</sup>, 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Frederick</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Edward</p>
<p class="p10">After receiving your last letter, <u>I felt
                        fine writing very soon in return</u>, but that very day
                    brought some sad news from Baltimore &amp; ever since, my letters have been
                    directed there; Jane declined very rapidly in the last two months yet she was
                    not confined up stairs to her room or her bed until
                    two days before her death. She was down in the parlour last morning weak
                    &amp; the following (last Thursday) died, in great peace rejoicing in the
                    preciousness of the Lord Jesus, whom she loved. Being the household pet
                    &amp; much loved by all her relatives for her gentle confiding disposition
                    it is a sore affliction &amp; to her sister, it is like taking part of
                    herself, for they were very closely united to each other &amp; not only
                    sisters, but friends in all their intercourse. I longed to be with them, but it
                    was impossible for many reasons -- but they were not alone -- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> they
                    have many devoted friends in the city &amp; Jane's most intimate friend
                        Margt Breckenridge from Princeton
                    (granddaughter of old Dr. Miller) went on some weeks ago to make them visit,
                    &amp; as Jane declined so rapidly, she remained until all was over,
                    &amp; will be with them for two or three weeks yet. She has been a great
                    comfort to them all, in every way, as she is a very attractive girl &amp; of
                    great excellence of character. I cannot express, my Dear Edwd my delight &amp; gratitude, when I read the pleasing
                    tidings of Kate contained in your last. I cannot say I was much surprised, for I
                    had been hoping &amp; praying for it, encouraged too by the spirit &amp;
                    tone of her letter to me, soon after your dear Mother's death. However, my
                    impression two years ago was, that there was a preparation work going on, her
                    views &amp; feelings on the subject of religion were so much changed for the
                    better. Of Elizabeth I have not heard, though I wrote some time ago -- Lizzie
                    Howe expects her to make her a visit soon, of course, what impression sorrow has
                    made on her, I know not. I can only trust &amp; pray. As for yourself Dear
                        Ed. let me say, that before you enter upon the
                    public service of your country, I long to see you enlisted in the service of
                    Him, by "whom Kings reign &amp; princes rule". This is the best <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>preparation for such a trying, responsible work. A letter from Lizzie just
                    after yours, told us of your visit to them, &amp; how much gratified they
                    were. I am very sorry you had so much trouble to find them. Mr. Tyler is
                    preparing to go to the District very soon. Your cousin C- does not improve,
                    though she is about the house. All are in much trouble at the Dr's. Polly is
                    very ill &amp; what will surprise &amp; grieve you most, Mr. Page wrote
                    yesterday to the Dr. to say that he was entirely broken up, without a cent,
                    &amp; no place to take Nannie. Just exactly what the Dr. predicted, when he
                    made his objections to the marriage. They have been here nearly all the time,
                    have just left, &amp; of course will have to return. Do you not pity the Dr.
                    most truly. Mr. P- is totally inefficient, one of the <u>women-men</u>, would rather sit up stairs with
                    the ladies, in a rocking chair. Yet a gentleman, well educated &amp;
                    correct. What is to become of them? We hope to see you very soon now. Will you
                    not come this way to Hagerstown? I should think it would be most pleasant-- I
                    must stop-- All send love &amp; hope to see you as soon as you can leave
                    home. Love to Miss Polly &amp; all friends. Thanks for your good,
                    satisfactory letters-</p>
