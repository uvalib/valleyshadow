<p class="p10">May 17th, 1861 </p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg </p>
<p class="p10">My good old Friend:-- </p>
<p class="p10">I have been somewhat dis <br> appointed in not seeing you up
     here to <br> see the men playing soldier, and now since <br>
     
      Gov. Curtin is expected here tomorrow, (Saturday) <br> I
     will feel sure that you are coming, and look <br> for you, my but they do look pretty, Just
     <br> come and see. Three Regiments were in yesterday <br> afternoon and make a long line of
     people, who <br> with their glittering bayonets under the rays of the <br> shining sun,
     accompanied by their Bands, or marshal
     <br> music, and the heavy and steady tramp of three <br> thousand men, make all who stand and
     look <br> on, feel, that they are not soldiers, all this can <br> but give a very faint idea
     of the appearance of one hun <br> dred and fifty thousand human
     beings marched into the field <br> of battle by the warming and thrilling sound of <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/BitCre1b.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitCre1b.gif"></center></a><br><br> almost countless drums and Oh! what, or who can <br> describe the feeling
     of that immense congregation <br> of human souls when the sound of the booming <br> cannon
     first disturbs the quiet of that breast and <br> paints death and destruction all around. We
     may <br> try to form some idea of the scene presented by <br> a battlefield, both while in
     the actual contest <br> and after, but can never, in my opinion, realize <br> the horrors of
     such a sight until we ourselves behold <br> it, and such; humanity forbids us from wishing.
     <br> May it never be seen in our land, but may the <br>
     <u>Flag</u> continue to wave over the land of the free and <br> the home of
     the brave. </p>
<p class="p10">Aunt Lydia and Uncle Kyner spoke of
     coming to see the <br> soldiers and as you no doubt will not object to <br> having an errand
     there, you can tell them that <br> saturday will no doubt be a suitable day as <br> we expect
     all the soldiers in town while Curtin
     <br> is here. I have been expecting to read your letter <br> before this time, but suppose
     you are preparing to <br> keep me reading one day when it comes, which I will <br> gladly do.
     Mine to all inquiring friends. </p>
<p class="p10">Yours &amp;c </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Little Ellic</i></p>
<p class="p10">Excuse this side as I thought I had it full. <br> You can guess what is
      not written, now <br> Good-bye. </p>
