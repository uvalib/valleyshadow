                <p>As soon as possible, after the <hi rend="underline">great occasion</hi>, I have
                    seated myself to give you some account of what has passed. You know Mittie Tyler
                    was here about two weeks before the wedding, so that, she and Lizzie Law, became
                    like old friends, indeed they seemed to take to each other directly, <orig
                        reg="though">tho'</orig> they are so different. Mittie is so unselfish
                    &amp; always like a bird -- she falls asleep with a smile on her
                    countenance. On Friday last, the three <orig reg="bridesmaids">brides
                    maids</orig> from Georgetown came &amp; you may suppose six girls made a
                    merry house. The day before they came Lizzie Tyler's spirits began to give way.
                        <pb n="2"/>She did not seem to realize her leaving home until she had most
                    of her things packed. then she gave way to her feelings. After the girls came
                    however, she rallied again, &amp; with Jane &amp; Bettie added to them,
                    there was no chance for low spirits. We gave up the two rooms on the second
                    floor to them, three in each room, &amp; I wish you could have been here to
                    enjoy their merry laughs--On Monday might, the groom &amp; groomsmen, seven
                    in number arrived &amp; after they had made their toilet at the Hotel, they
                    all came up here. But before they came themselves, they sent a basket with the
                    bridal presents from the groomsmen, all silver. These with those from their
                    friends were 33 in number &amp; nearly all silver. I will name them in
                    another place. The girls were all dressed to receive them. Lizzie Law all
                    anxiety to see her "Cousin Ned." And she was greatly pleased with him. They went
                    through the performance once or twice <pb n="3"/> for fear of mistakes. The
                    first <orig reg="bridesmaid">brides maid</orig> was to be the tallest--that was
                    Jane <unclear>Burgh</unclear> next Miss Harry, then Lizzie Law, then Miss Berry,
                    then Miss Marberry &amp; last Bettie. They sent the beaux all away before
                    ten o'clock, that they might retire early. Next morning, the wedding day, we had
                    to stir ourselves.- Directly after breakfast the girls arranged the presents on
                    the piano &amp; fixed the Bride's cake in one Corner &amp; the Fruit
                    cake in another, both beautifully done. Then we all dispersed to our rooms to
                    arrange ourselves for the great occasion, while Mary Polly &amp; the
                    servants fixed the dinner table which was very nice, but everything was cold, as
                    all had to be done in a hurry to be ready for the cars.-- The girls <del
                        hand="h1"/> themselves greatly at Kitty who was dressed in a black silk <hi
                        rend="underline">with three flounces</hi> the height of her ambition. The
                    bride wore a brown merino travelling dress &amp; the <orig reg="bridesmaids"
                        >brides maids</orig>, nearly the same. All the <orig reg="connections"
                        >connexions</orig> of the families soon <pb n="4"/> invited with all
                    Lizzie's young friends, &amp; no married or older persons but Dr. &amp;
                    Mrs. Dorsey, E. Potts &amp; C. Reynolds, &amp; the parents of the
                    attendants.- Nearly all in town, invited came &amp; the <orig reg="parlors"
                        >parlours</orig> were filled. Our new Minister Mr. Ross, performed the
                    ceremony, which all pronounced very simple &amp; beautiful. The whole bridal
                    party behaved admirably &amp; <orig reg="everybody">every body</orig> said
                    it was the most pleasant wedding they ever attended. <orig reg="Everyone">every
                        one</orig> was so bright &amp; joyous. Kitty <hi rend="underline"
                        >behaved</hi> very well too. They all dispersed soon after twelve, that the
                    party might have time to dine. 21 persons dined here besides our own household,
                    &amp; afterwards several of the <orig reg="colored">coloured</orig> friends.
                    Soon after, the hacks, five in number, were at the door &amp; they all went
                    off in high glee. Several ladies &amp; gentlemen from here went to the
                    junction with them. The groomsmen were the handsomest set of young men I ever
                    saw. Lizzie Law served with French Bowie a cousin of Mary Tyler's &amp; very
                    handsome.</p>

                <pb n="5"/>

                <p><orig reg="Tonight">To night</orig>, Wednesday, they have a grand reception at
                    Miss Williams &amp; I would love to take a peep at them. The Bride's dress
                    is a white striped brocade satin, &amp; the attendants white silk, &amp;
                    they are all rather pretty. All regretted so much Edward was not here &amp;
                    that the Dr. &amp; Kate did not come. I was not able to write to her last
                    week as I wished, but will, soon-- She would have enjoyed it so much. We were
                    truly sorry to hear you had been so unwell &amp; Uncle so feeble. Many
                    persons here are sick with colds. You may imagine how lonely we feel with an
                    almost empty house. Kitty is <orig reg="today">to day</orig> feeling the effects
                    of all the excitement &amp; is not well <orig reg="tonight">to night</orig>.
                    I will name over the presents but not all the donors as I have not time. A most
                    beautiful <pb n="6"/> cake basket from Mrs. Williams, an elegant set of Castors
                    from Jane Bungh &amp; splendid silver salt cellars lined with gold from
                    Bettie, there were three pairs of salt cellars lined with gold &amp; spoons
                    to suit our dozen of silver knives with pearl handles, &amp; half a dozen
                    all silver. A very large &amp; heavy soup ladle &amp; a dozen of
                    teaspoons. <orig reg="Two">two</orig> pairs of butter knives &amp; one
                    single one. Four fluted sugar spoons line with gold, two pair of exquisite fruit
                    spoons about the size of table spoons, one pair all silver &amp; richly
                    figured, the other lined with gold &amp; carved. A large &amp; handsome
                    silver fish knife. A very heavy silver affair for salad &amp; two silver
                    napkin rings, a beautiful silver pie trowel to lift the pie when cut. a gold
                    bracelet from Lizzie Law &amp; a black lace head dress from her Mother E
                    Mchaffey a handsome worked pocket handkerchief <pb n="7"/> the shawl I knit her
                    &amp; a pair of fluted salt spoons from John. I ought to have mentioned
                    first, the elegant gold watch &amp; chain from Mr. Williams &amp; a
                    beautiful <orig reg="Chinese">chinese</orig> fan from one of the bridesmaids,
                    &amp; a pickle knife &amp; fork, silver-- &amp; a Bible from her
                    Aunt Mary covered with green velvet &amp; she is to get a double set of
                    forks from <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Coale her father's friend, but this
                    is a secret yet -- she does not know it. I believe I have named all-- The <abbr
                        expan="General">Gen.</abbr> intended to give her a watch; but as he saw she
                    had one &amp; no forks, he changed his plan.</p>

                <p>The bride &amp; groom with Lizzie Law, Jane &amp; Bettie expect to go to
                        <abbr expan="Prince">P.</abbr> George's before the weather becomes very
                    cold. I hope they will, I want Mrs Tyler to know Lizzie so much. All expect such
                    pleasure in showing the <hi rend="underline">lions</hi> of Washington to her, as
                    she has never been there before. <pb n="8"/> You can see that I have written in
                    a hurry just what came first in my mind as I was writing -- so I hope you will
                    excuse all defects for I am sure it must have many. My effort has been to give
                    you a minute account of <orig reg="everything">every thing</orig> &amp; I
                    hope this will find you well enough to enjoy it. I wish I could see you to tell
                    all, it could be more easily done. We are too sorry <abbr expan="Edward"
                    >Ed.</abbr> could not come, feeling so sure he would have enjoyed it mightily.
                    Let us hear from you soon. Some of the <hi rend="underline">guests</hi> were so
                    greedy, that there was scarcely a bit of cake left, though one weighed 16 <abbr
                        expan="pounds">lbs.</abbr> &amp; the other heavier. We had not a piece
                    to give to the servants &amp; Kitty &amp; myself did not get a taste
                    even. The cold dinner consisted of Turkey, roast beef, ham, tongues &amp;
                    pickled oysters, olio, slaw &amp; cold tomatoes, bread &amp; butter
                    &amp; all kind of pickles, also celery. They all seemed to enjoy it
                    mightily.-- But I must stop.-- All unite in much love to you <orig reg="uncle"
                        >Uncle</orig> &amp; <abbr expan="Edward">Ed</abbr>-- Mine to all
                    friends.</p>
