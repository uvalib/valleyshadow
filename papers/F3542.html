<p class="p10">November 22nd, 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg </p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor herewith to transmit my immediate and unconditional resignation
                    as Major of 126th Regiment Penna Volunteers for the following reasons,</p>
<p class="p10">I have been suffering with chronic diarrhea since the 20th of August last on the
                    28th of same month being in camp near Clouds Mills Virginia I went to Washington
                    D.C. to obtain leave of absence, failing to procure leave I returned to my
                    Regiment September 3rd. September 5th I was dismissed from service by General
                    order No. 125 for being absent without leave, I remained with the regiment
                    (marching from Washington via Frederick to Sharpsburg M.D.) until the 26th
                    September when having become so much reduced from the effects of my disease and
                    not having been reinstated in my command I returned to my home at Chambersburg,
                    Pa. On the 13th of October the order for my dismissal was revoked by General
                    Order No. 157, I received official notice thereof October 22nd but was then
                    confined to my room and not able to return to my Regiment. I reported through my
                    attending Physician to Dr. Rogers, Medical Director of Hospitals at Chambersburg
                    Pa. And after examination received certificate of inability for 30 days.</p>
<p class="p10">I am still unfit for duty and believe that I will not again be able to rejoin my
                    Regiment without endangering my life. </p>
<p class="p10">I therefore respectfully ask to be discharged from service.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.C. Austin <br> Major 126th Regt. P.V.</i></p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg Nov 22nd 1862 <br> I do hereby certify that
                        I have attended Maj. J.C. Austin 126th Regt. Pa. <i>[illeg.]</i> since his
                        return home on the 26th September last, that he is now and has been unfit
                        for duty during all of said time. I further declare my belief that he will
                        not again be able to resume his duties without great danger of life. <i>[deleted: ]</i> Richards M.D.</p>
