    <p>I seat myself this morning to write you a few lines for the purpose of informing you that I
     am well and that camp life has agreed with me very well since my long absence there is but very
     little sickness in our company now A S Craig is sick with the fever he is very bad it was
     thought that he would not live but he has gotten better now Jim Payne is sick also but nothing
     more than weakness. we are camped in a very <orig reg="pretty">prety</orig> place now good
     water and plenty to eat the water is about a half mile away. I do not know how long we may stay
     as there is some stir in camp this morning some report that the enemy are advancing but I think
     that there is nothing of it We may possibly have to move nearer to the enemy toward Fairfax
      <orig reg="Courthouse">Court house</orig> but not for a few days yet. Beaureguard has in his
     army about 120,000 men or at least there is rations drawn for that many it will take a great
     deal to feed them at the rate we are fed<pb n="2" entity="Smiley49b" pid="uva-lib:503235"/>
      Our company is gaining in numbers rapidly now 4 recruits having
     come before i got here by name Buchanan Golady Wright and James Beard a cousin of Jacky Beard

     Junction he says there is a package there for me <orig reg="Vegetables">Vegatables</orig> is
     chiefly what he brought. roasting ears are selling here at 30<hi rend="super">

     by this time. We have some great times making bread yesterday was my cook day I got through
