                    <p>It is difficult for me to do adequate justice to a theme so extensive, or to
                         advance any thing new upon it, since (it is that) all the great poets from
                              <orig reg="Shakespeare">Shakespear</orig> down have combined their
                         masterly inte<add hand="h1" place="inline">l</add>lects in extolling its

                         points - a very few, and be careful that our muses do<del hand="h1"
                         >se</del> not likewise incite us to take up our harps to sing of its
                         enhancing spells. For a man never feels more sublime and poet-like than
                         when intoxicated by the voluptuous strains of music; and we who do not wish
                         to deal in <del hand="h1">rhymetrical</del><add hand="h1" place="inline"
                              >rythmical</add> composition had better be on our guard when under its

                         come spontaneously forth.</p>

                         other hand it animates those more exalted passions of the heart, creates
                         glorious sensations, and inspires us</p>

                    <p>"_____ to noble God like deeds."<lb/> Music lulls the fretting babe to sleep
                         - wakens youthful aspirations - destroys the plethora of the sorrowing
                         heart - reanimates the christian's zeal - creates mental inspiration -

                         almost <orig reg="everything">every thing</orig> I admire, to me there is
                         music in a pretty woman's eye, in her sweet voice, and in her smile,
                         especially if she is one that I Love. <lb/> "Ther's music on the sighing of

                         Old Orpheus, or a shade rather in wandering from Phitoes regions had
                         accidentally shed a musical spell over these classic hills which our young
                         "music asters" have caught, or then some vagrant disciple of spells in
                         wondering over the earth had here seated the mortally contagious mania
