<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife and expresses his unhappiness at being separated from
                    his family. He discusses his pending resignation, and revives the idea of the
                    family moving to Staunton. He complains that he does not receive enough letters
                    from home.</p>

<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I am well &amp; doing as well as can well expect. I offered my resignation
                    again &amp; am waiting anxiously to hear the result which I hope will be the
                    final acceptance &amp; relieving me from duty, then I hope we can make some
                    better arrangement about living. I am sorely tired of this way of living I have
                        endavoured to bear it patiently without
                        <i>[unclear: m--mor]</i> but I hope we soon can make change. you either
                    come here or I Come home. I am so anxious &amp; concerned about you
                    &amp; the children I have <i>[added: had]</i> but one
                    short note from you since I left home July last which seems singular. I have
                    written you a Bushel of letters I think. I still hear in general terms that you
                    are all well but this is not like getting letters detailing all our private
                    &amp; domestic matters do write me dont write me
                    anything about service &amp; I cant see any
                    objection to it. Capt B- gets letter from home
                    about once in 1 or 2 weeks they come safely</p>
<p class="p10">Can<sup>

                    I would be so glad to see you &amp; bring Freddy. The little girls might be
                    left with <i>[unclear: sister]</i> Mary &amp; Miss Jane<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">It would not do to come when there is any movement of the troops as could not
                    pass the lines &amp; would be unpleasant. If you do come when you get to
                    Confederate lines make yourself know to the Military <i>[deleted: &amp;]</i>
                    <i>[added: or]</i> civil authorities &amp; you will be
                        allright &amp; be helped on your road</p>
<p class="p10">Do try &amp; write me I sent by several for a lace stocking but have not yet
                    got one would like to have one or two for a change. I have plenty chances to
                    send down, so many moving out C S but see but few chances up this way I will
                    write you so soon as I know or hear from my resignation and then we will know
                    better what to do</p>
<p class="p10">Keep the children at school but don<sup>
