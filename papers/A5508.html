<p class="p10">Dear John</p>
<p class="p10">I write this evening, to inform you that Wilson has run off, and may possibly be
                    about Staunton or somewhere in Augusta. There has been depradations committed
                    here from time to time, and the overseer found out to
                    day that several fine fat shoats had just been taken and wanted to know
                    something about the disposition of them, and at dinner time told all the
                    servants to go to the stable and he would have an examination; all went but
                    Wilson, and we did not know what had become of him until we found he had broken
                    open the cabin where his clothes were and taken them off. You know he is such a
                    sly negro that he may have more in his head than we know of. You can have an eye
                    to it, as he may attempt to go farther than this neighborhood</p>
<p class="p10">You know he was once taken up in Augusta and has so many acquaintances that he
                    may be harbored without its being known that he <i>[deleted: has]</i> run
                    away, or perhapse may aim for a free state. It is
                    late and I must send this off to night. All are well
                    and send love to you all. Write often.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Mother</p>
