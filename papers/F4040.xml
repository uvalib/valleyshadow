                    <salute>Dear Pa,</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>I wrote to Nannie the day after the battle of Winchester, but it is very
                    uncertain whether you even received the letter or not and I know you are all
                    very anxious to hear from me. After leaving Winchester out division went to
                    Sharpsburg &amp; remained there about 3 days on the old battlefield, From
                    there we marched on through Hagerstown which is a pretty little town in Maryland
                    &amp; contains some good Southern men. The day we left Hagerstown we crossed
                    the Pennsylvania line &amp; since then we have been marching constantly
                    &amp; through the finest country I even laid my eyes on, inhabited by the
                    hardest looking set of people -- <hi rend="underline">abolition Dutch</hi>. We
                    have passed through such a number of little towns that I cant recollect the
                    names of half of them but the principle ones were Chambersburg &amp;
                    Shippensburg. The former is a place of about 10,000 inhabitants, all <hi
                        rend="underline">Dutch</hi> &amp; the meanest looking white people I
                    ever saw. They were scared nearly to death at the bare idea of having the rebel
                    army among them &amp; evidently expected to be burnt alive. I had a
                    discussion with an old Dutchman on the right of secession &amp; War matters
                    generally, the day I was in Chambersburg. I also had a warm debate with a
                    regular abolition woman. I wouldn't say that everything I wished to the woman
                    but if I didn't abuse that old Dutchman, then I am one myself. <abbr
                        expan="General">Genl</abbr> Lee has issued positive orders against
                    individual plundering &amp; burning, but tells the <abbr expan="Quarter"
                    >Qr</abbr> Masters to pitch right into everything they see that is needful for
                    the Army. At Chambersburg the <abbr expan="Quarter">Qr</abbr> Masters emptied
                    every store in the place and our men are living luxuriously. We bought
                    everything we wanted at our own price in the town, &amp; the country is full
                    of everything good to eat. We get as much Butter, Lard &amp; Molasses as we
                    want, &amp; vegetables to. Yesterday evening we arrived at our present Camp,
                    which is three miles from Carlisle. I could have gotten a pass to go in there
                    this morning but it was Sunday &amp; I wanted to remain in Camp today
                    &amp; write some letters. The greatest consternation prevails all through
                    Yankee-dom &amp; they are busy sending on the "Milish" to meet us at
                    Harrisburg. We will leave here, I <hi rend="underline">think</hi>, tomorrow,
                    &amp; Harrisburg is only 18 miles distant. It will be rare fun fighting the
                    "Milish". Old Hooker is perfectly at a loss what to do. He cant bring his army
                    up here &amp; he doesn't know what to do with it where he is. I dont know
                    what <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Lee's plans are, of course, but it is
                    generally hoped &amp; believed that after taking Harrisburg, he will sweep
                    down the Susquehanna on Baltimore &amp; Washington, having destroyed their
                    great line of communication North. Our army is in fine spirits &amp; a
                    straggler is something that you never see now. This corps, I believe, can whip
                    all the Militia in the United States. We have splendid Horses for our Artillery,
                    an abundance of forage for them &amp; the men draw rations of everything. I
                    just wish you could see all the crops here. Pa, I never saw such wheat &amp;
                    corn in my life. Every man has a little bit of a <hi rend="underline"
                    >dwelling</hi> house &amp; a magnificent barn, probably about 80 or 90 feet
                    long. We can hardly ever get the Richmond papers now. If we are successful in
                    this move up here &amp; also in the Southwest I think there will be hopes of
                    an early peace.</p>

                <p>I have not heard a word from Home since I left Fredericksburg &amp; you may
                    imagine how anxious I am to hear from you. I wrote to Uncle George at
                    Sharpsburg. Send you letters to Uncle George &amp; ask him to get Mr. Wall
                    at the Adjutant <abbr expan="General's">Genl's</abbr> office to send them by
                    courier. Cousin Wattie has promised to forward any letters which I wish to send
                    back. I shall take this over to him this evening. I have not seen him within the
                    last few days. Did Nannie receive the letter containing his picture? There is
                    nothing worth writing &amp; I must now close. Write immediately &amp;
                    give me all the news. Give my best love to Mama, Sister, Bec &amp; Dinkie
                    &amp; kiss Jack for me. Give my love to Uncle Watt &amp; to Aunt Mary
                    &amp; Wattie when you see them. Dont be uneasy because you dont hear from
                    me. I will write as often as possible. Goodbye.</p>
