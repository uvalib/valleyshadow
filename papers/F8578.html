<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Thaddeus
                    Stevens, January 16, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Alexander McClure provides Thaddeus Stevens with details as to Lincoln's
                    appointments, saying that Cameron's appointment as Secretary of War seems
                    secure, despite much protest from Curtin and McClure.</p>

<p class="p10">Jany 16th</p>
<p class="p10">Harrisburg,</p>
<p class="p10">DSir --</p>
<p class="p10">The Cameron men are somewhat <u>revived</u>
                    to-day, and in their own confidential circles (to which
                    I have full access) they speak of his ultimate selection for Secy of War as probable. They have nothing
                    tangible; but that they are hopeful, there can be no doubt. Add to this the fact
                    that a well informed friend writes me from Phila that renewed efforts are being made to keep Cameron in. Is he
                    playing a feint on you? Write me.</p>
<p class="p10">Curtin has done his full amt. to keep him out-- has
                    sent a crushing protest two weeks ago, which I think Lincoln cannot disregard.
                    He is not naturally for you; but assured Mann &amp; myself last night that
                    he <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> would join cordially in asking it of the Congressional
                    delegation, with Camerons cooperation, would move
                    with reasonable unanimity. He does not of course wish to move unless he can give
                    success to the effort. <u>He is right</u>, &amp; we are
                    all about him now. He had been led to believe that you were <u>personally</u> unfriendly to him at the time of the nomination was made;
                    but the assurances from him by Mann Slifer &amp; myself as to your active
                    cooperation with the State organization last summer when Cameron was seeking to
                    destroy it, dissipated his objections. He will move in exactly the right way
                    whenever he feels assured that the Con
                    delegation have moved with Camerons
                    <i>[unclear: approbation]</i>. He of course understands that with Cameron at
                    war with the effort, it <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> would likely fail: for if Cameron were to
                    give the order for an attack, every friend he has would write Lincoln protesting
                    on every possible ground.</p>
<p class="p10">I wish Hale would write either Curtin or myself stating that the delegation had
                    moved and suggesting that the administration can settle the matter. Can you have
                    that done. In the face of daily rumors that Cameron is still hoping &amp;
                    laboring, Curtin will hesitate about acting, lest Cameron should betray him into
                    an effort &amp; then defeat it. You see how it is.</p>
<p class="p10">Our men in the legislature are hanging back hoping to get the Cameron men to lead
                    off, so as to get it unanimously. At noon today <i>[unclear: Hustain]</i> had
                    no reply <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> from Washington. Everything is set right here; only let
                    Washington start the thing properly. I have had a correspondence with Greeley
                    &amp; Sam Allen, assuring them that the administration would second the
                    movement in your favor.</p>
<p class="p10">You can show this to any trusted friend who may need its statements to act
                    intelligently</p>

<p class="p10">PS I sent a letter to Lincoln by Caleb <i>[illeg.]</i>
                        Taylor of Bristol, who is out there, in which I explained
                        fully the condition of things, &amp; stated that as matters now are your
                        appointment can be made with general acceptability<br>McC
