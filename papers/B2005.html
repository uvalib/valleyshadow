<p class="p10">May 6th 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Va.,</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to enclose report of agent for Augusta &amp; Highland Cos. and to report concerning the remainder of this
                        Dist., as follows, at Harrisonburg, Rockingham
                        Co. church owned by Freedmen, Rent Free,
                    Capacity 100, can be used as long as required -- Woodstock, Shenandoah Co., Room in private dwelling, owned by a Freedman,
                    Rent free, Capacity 75, can be had for one year from May 1, 67.</p>
<p class="p10">Front Royal, Va. Warren Co. Church owned by Freedpeople, Rent free, capacity 40, can be had as
                    long as desired but is too small for Winter school.</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Fredk. Co. - 4 Rooms, rented by
                    Bureau, owned by A.S. Griffith, $30 per mo. is paid
                    for Building, 3 rooms of which are used for Bureau offices <i>[added: (capacity 400)]</i> can probably be had another year -- at
                    White Hall, Fred<sup>k</sup>
                    Co. Schoolhouse, lately repaired by the Freedpeople, owned by Society of
                    Friends, can be had, rent free, as long as required. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>It will
                    accomodate about 50 scholars.</p>
<p class="p10">Schools are now being held in the places referred to except at Whitehall and
                    Front Royal. The School at Front Royal was held, the past winter in a building
                    hired by Bureau, which has been given up, and leased to other parties. At
                    Whitehall, no teacher has been sent, tho' the
                    Freedpeople are very anxious one should be, and as the people in the
                    neighborhood are quite generally loyal, a teacher would find it easy to obtain
                    board on reasonable terms.</p>
