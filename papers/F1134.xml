                <p>Rosenbery discusses how to remove "gray backs" from his clothing and also

                </opener>

                <p>This morning I seat myself to inform you that your letter of the 15th came to
                    hand the 21st. I was glad to hear from you. I am well at present. Hoping that
                    you are all enjoying the same blessings.</p>
                <p>I do not <orig reg="recollect">recolet</orig> how much money you paid Miller. I
                    mind about the order that Forbes gave Miller but the amount I can't tell.</p>
                <p>This morning we send all our extra clothing to the rear. It <orig reg="may be"
                        >maybe</orig> before this reaches you we may have an engagement on the 14th
                    of this month.</p>
                <p>I expressed to you 20 dollars to Chambersburg. When you get it let me know.</p>
                <p>I sent 2 shirts home. Tell Rachel to boil them well for fear there might be some
                        <orig reg="gray">grey</orig> backs in them. Put them in a small tub. Put
                    some salt in the tub. Then put some boiling water on the shirts. Tell her to
                    keep them by themselves. Those <orig reg="gray">grey</orig> backs are not the
                    body lice but still they know how to bite. I washed the shirts some time ago. I
                    did not notice any of the gentlemen about them. But they can easy be seen when
                    they come to a full growth.</p>
                <p>There is still talk of no getting out of the Service when we have been in the
                    service 9 months, but still if we live we will see some hand battles before that
                    time.</p>
                <p>When Rachel writes again, she may send me some threat in her letter.</p>
                <p>I am nearly out of paper and envelopes there I shall mention that if you do not
                    get any letters for some time. Don't be uneasy for the report that the mail will
                    be <orig reg="stopped">stoped</orig> for some time.</p>
                <p>I will still try and write as often as I can. I would like to be more prompt in
                    answering letters but it is impossible. People at home think the soldiers has
                    nothing to do. But it is a sad mistake we must drill so long then get ready for
                    dress parade-guns bright, boots black, white gloves and brasses bright.</p>
                <p>These things we must keep clean-company drill in the forenoon, <orig
                        reg="batallions">batalions</orig> drill in the afternoon, dress parade in
                    the evening and then we have other <orig reg="duties">dutys</orig> to perform.
                    Such as policing our streets, do our own cooking-washing.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>Write soon. No more at present. But I remain your son,</salute>
