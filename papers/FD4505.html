<h4>Franklin County: Diary of Lippitt, Charles Edward (1863)<br>
</h4>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Charles Lippitt writes in his diary about the town and people of Chambersburg.  He describes how supplies were collected, the attitudes of the people, and mentions the rumor of a murder.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b></b></p>
<p class="p10">Orders more sensible today, to march at 6 1/2 o'clk. Passed through Greencastle in Franklin Co. Pa. where the people all looked very serious, most of the houses closed, but the inhabitants were visible. Fine country well cultivated. An old farmer said he could not blame our army for taking horses &amp;c for he had heard the Yankees boast of what they had taken from the Southern people.</p>
<p class="p10">A fine day for marching, but only made about 15 miles passed through Marion a village 4 miles from Greencastle &amp; through Chambersburg, a thriving town of perhaps 7 or 8,000 inhabitants, camping 3 miles beyond the latter place. Stores closed but streets and windows filled in with men &amp; women, the latter very common looking, not to compare with our Southern females. Q. M. &amp; Commissary supplies pressed in C. The men caught some fowles on the road, but were made to offer to pay for them. I am glad to see the men are allowed to walk through wheat fields &amp;c, instead of confining them to the muddy roads. Some of the women were very impudent. A few of our men exchanged hats with citizens in a very quiet manner. 'Tis said one murder was committed by a southern soldier, but as the parties were drunk I did not here what was done with the men. 'Tis also said that some of our men have been bush-whacked, this should not be allowed. Met several droves of horses going South.</p>
<p class="p10">I did not mention that a deserter was shot in Garnett's Brig on the 25th upon halting from the night. The offence was committed some time ago.</p>
