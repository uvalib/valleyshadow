<p class="p10">June 15th 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Fair Grounds.<br>Winchester</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Dear</u>
                        <u>Annie</u>,</p>
<p class="p10">I am now seated on a bench in our Barracks (for the pres. at least) writing on a box of ammunition, surrounded by at least 2
                    hundred soldiers, all talking &amp; laughing so much that I hardly know
                    whether I can write or not. But I will endeavor to do the best I can under the
                    circumstances as I have just finished reading yours &amp; Jimmis letter which believe me was a source of much
                    pleasure &amp; I shall proceed immediately to answer it for fear that an
                    opportunity will not present itself soon again. The 5th Regiment (of which we
                    constitute a part) arrived here last night about dark <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>after travelling about 22 miles from Charlestown. The day
                    before we marched from Shepardstown a distance of 12 miles starting from their at about five oclock in the evening &amp;
                    arrived at our camp at 12 in the night. lay out in the woods on the ground like
                    "Hogs" without anything to eat. This is the way soldiering goes.</p>
<p class="p10">about one half of our men were so much fatigued. &amp; their feet so sore
                    that they could scarcely walk. my feet have blisters on now, as big as
                        <i>[unclear: ten]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>. You have no idea how much we have to endure &amp; yet I
                    fear its nothing to what it will be. But if I have my health I care not what
                    comes I can stand it as long as the <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>most of them. I have no idea when
                    we will leave this place. The Bridge together with all the publick buildings at the Ferry have been burnt by our troops
                    &amp; the place is now vacated entirely. Also the bridge at shepardstown was
                    burnt the evening we left by Capt Doyle such a
                    destruction of Property. not less than <i>[illeg.]</i> of <i>[unclear: it]</i>
                    destroyed &amp; what <i>[unclear: will]</i> it be by the time the wars are
                    ended? I had a little excursion over into Maryland the night before we left
                    Shepardstown, some 20 of our men went out on a scout to see if we could find any
                    of the Yankey's I tell you we ran a considerable risk
                    nevertheless we went. We <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>were at a place where a sentinal had been
                    posted the night before but did not see anything of him. Then was a company of
                    35 camp<i>[unclear: ers]</i> about 3 miles from the bridge &amp; if the
                        Col.
                    had'v let us we would <i>[unclear: tried]</i>
                    them any how one <i>[unclear: round]</i>. But we had orders not <i>[added: to]</i> go farther than a mile &amp; half - consequently
                    we got no fight. I must stop for the present, it is so warm &amp; I am so
                    crowded that I cant write more. if we dont leave directly I will write you again &amp; give all the
                    news I can. As for the note enclosed - I hope <i>[added: you]</i> will not think any thing more about it. I'll say nothing more myself.
                    &amp; believe me to be as ever <u>yours</u>. My love to
                    all,</p>
<p class="p10">yours in haste</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Sam Frank</i></p>
<p class="p10">no more <i>[illeg.]</i>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i></p>
