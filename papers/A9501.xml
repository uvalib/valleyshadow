                <p>"Procrastination is the thief of time" and for fear it should prove to be such in
                    reference to answering your welcome epistle, I will answer it immediately. It
                    came by due course of mail, and it arrived, like that of its predecessors from
                    the same source, met with a hearty reception. It is a great pleasure to know
                    that although <orig reg="separated">seperated</orig> for several hundred miles,
                    yet that there is a way; in which to communicate thought from friend to friend
                    through the medium of pen &amp; paper. There is nothing can so vividly
                    revive past associations, and can call to mind joys and sorrows seemingly
                    forgotten, as a letter from a friend, unless it be the presence of that friend
                    himself or herself. On its reception we go back in contemplation to other days,
                    and other scenes, connected with the individual from whom it comes, and we seem
                    to live over the past. Memory revels amid by-gone experiences bringing forth
                    pleasing as well as sad reminiscences <pb n="2"/>and if there is a ray of hope
                    promising to a return of past joys the soul is filled with expectations and
                    longs for their speedy arrival. Last Friday was observed here as a day of
                    Fasting Humiliation &amp; Prayer. I preached a sermon on the times at my
                    church in the country to quite a large congregation. Next Friday has been
                    appointed by the President for the same purpose. It will be observed here as it
                    should be. Surely if ever a people had need to Praise God, and to pray to him,
                    it is the people of the South. We are rather in a sad condition at present in
                    the Southern Confederacy yet I hope our dark day will soon pass by and that our
                    recent defeats will soon be overruled by the Disposer of all events for our
                    good. The North are making a desperate effort for our subjugation. "The battle
                    is not always to the strong nor the race to the swift." If the Lord sustains us
                    we will in the end triumph. Almost all the soldiers from <pb n="3"/>Newberry
                    have revolunteered &amp; I suppose it will be the same thing throughout the
                    South. Lincoln will find it a hard matter to subjugate a people as numerous as
                    we are, &amp; scattered over such an extent of country. It will be
                    impossible I think if we remain united. I should like very much to have been in
                    Augusta during the Holidays and have been a certain place not a hundred miles
                    from Churchville (You may guess where.) You seem to think I was putting on airs
                    about becoming an old bachelor. I was not altogether doing so but perhaps my
                    case is not a hopeless one and as bad as I represented it to be. Your letter
                    contains one ray of hope. You Say "I know one lady who things a great deal of
                    you perhaps enough to go with you to South Carolina (as much as she is attached
                    to Virginia) but I can not tell you her name but leave it to your imagination as
                    it is fertile." This is some consolation yet I do not think it definite enough
                    to give firm hope. I do not like that "perhaps" "perhaps enough to go with you
                    &amp;c." As to the lady I have set my imagination to <pb n="4"/>work and I
                    think, I believe, I hope, I feel confident (yet I may be mistaken "perhaps")
                    that I have her name in my mind. Who I have in mind your imagination which also
                    "is fertile" may conjecture. I would like to know who she is <hi
                        rend="underline">for certain</hi> and also to know if she would not be
                    willing to leave out 'perhaps' and adopt some language similar to that of Ruth
                    as given in the Bible (see Ruth 1:16,17). Perhaps <hi rend="underline">you</hi>
                    can give one some light upon the subject. I would take some way to find out all
                    about it if I did not fear I might meet with the same sad reverse that I met
                    with in reference to the same subject from a lady <hi rend="underline">whom you
                        know well</hi>. It is by no means pleasant to be disappointed in a matter of
                    this kind &amp; as I have met with one reverse as <hi rend="underline">you
                        know</hi> I shall never attempt it again unless I receive some encouragement
                    to know that I shall not be repulsed a second time. I shall patiently yet
                    anxiously await your reply. We have nothing new in our town. Our number of
                    students is small not more than sixty. This war interrupts every kind of
                    business. We have had very pleasant weather for two or three days. Before that
                    it was cloudy and raining for almost six weeks. There has been no snow here this
                    winter. Some of the <orig reg="plum">plumb</orig> &amp; peach trees have
                    been in bloom for a week past. I fear they will be killed. So Mr. John R. is
                    quite popular in the army. I suppose you are glad to hear it. And Miss Sally is
                    alone. <pb n="2-3"/>It ought not so to be. You say she looks well. She always
                    looked well and by well you mean I suppose pretty, handsome, goodlooking or
                    something of that kind. If so I agree with you. I live so far away that I cannot
                    go to see her I fear she will become discouraged. Please try and keep her in
                    good cheer. But I must close. Write soon sooner soonest. It is now 11 oclock
                    &amp; time to retire. So I will bid you good night. </p>
