<p class="p10">I reached this place on <br>

they are unhurt in the

much difficulty in <br>
getting a pass and means of conveyance <br>
to the army and having procured the <br>
former should have gone to

 but for the heavy <br>
and constant rain that have been <br>
falling.  I shall go tomorrow
if poss <br>
ible.  It is not possible to get
a sub <br>
stitute in for Charles
<a href="#n2">[2]</a>
until something <br>
decisive has taken place betweeen the <br>
contending armies,
Jackson is
<i>[unclear: move <br>

con <br>
stancy of action
precludes the possib <br>
ility of getting in a substitute.  The <br>
news from the army is of the most <br>
thrilling and complicated character; <br>

the enemy is still unbroken and <br>
formidable, and disputing every <br>
inch of our advance with the <br>
energy of despair.  Our loss in killed <br>

  It is re <br>
ported that Jackson was
very seve <br>

finally succeeded but at great <br>
loss.  Our army commands the fla <br>

the admirable order of the latter <br>
leaves it much to be feared that <br>
the crisis is yet to come.  There has <br>

<p class="p11"><b>Notes</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> Apparently the family patriarch James Brooks
asked his neighbor Schyler Trible to
travel to Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy. Trible's
mission was to
find out about the welfare of Charles Brooks and "John," who appears
to be Charles' cousin John D. Brooks (see William Brooks' letter
of July 8, 1861). Trible arrived in Richmond on Monday, June 30,
the fifth day of the Seven Days Battle, a series
of battles around Richmond between Union General McClellan's
army and Confederate troops under the command of Lee and
Jackson
Because the battles were going on around Richmond when
Trible was writing,
he was understandably concerned about the welfare of John and Charles
Brooks, but unable to discover much about them in the confusion
(McPherson,
70-73).

</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a> The First Conscription Act allowed a conscripted
(drafted) man to hire a substitute to serve his term. This
provision produced much division and tension between the poor and the wealthy.
Often, a substitute would desert a day after appearing in camp, then
agree to substitute for someone else (Current, vol. 1, 396-99).
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> During the Seven Days Battle, the Confederates lost
20,141 men, while the Federal army lost 15,489 (McPherson, 72).  The
Fourth Virginia suffered losses of 8 killed and 28 wounded (Robertson,
<i>4th Virginia Infantry</i>, 16).

</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> As a result of the Seven Days campaign, the Confederates
prevented McClellan from capturing Richmond, but McClellan succeeded in
moving his base of operations from the York river to the James (Wallace, 35).
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n5">[5]</a> According to the 1860 Census of Augusta County,
Schyler Trible, who was thirty-one in 1860,
lived with the farmer Samuel Steele on land close
to the Brooks family farm.
