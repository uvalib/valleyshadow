<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your much wellcomed letter last week &amp; was glad to hear from you. My
                    health is very good at present &amp; hope theese
                    fiew lines may find you enjoying the same blessing. We
                    have had annother very hard battle on the ninth of
                    this month. I suppose you have hurd the perticulars before this. Brother John was slightly
                    wounded in the early part of the engagement. Charles was hurt in the hand with
                    his ramrod while loading his gun thay
                    ware both sent to the hospital at Sharlottesvill our <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> loss was
                    estimated at six hundred killed &amp; wounded. The enimies at three thousand. Our Brigade recieved a grate deal of praise for its bravry on the battle field. It sertainly did act nobly your Brother was not very well and was
                    excused by the Sergeon &amp; stayed back with the
                        waggons, he did not have the good luck of being in
                    the fight he has got right well again &amp; I hope his health may continue
                    to be good for we all miss him when he is sick or absent. We captured four or
                    five hundred prisoners &amp; two pieces of canon.</p>
<p class="p10">I was glad to hear Mr Burkholder health was improveing &amp; hope he may soon recouver his former strenghth you referd me to a piece <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> of poetry I well
                    remember but it has been a long time since I wrote it, &amp; if you recieved any lately it was not from me nor have I the
                    least idea who gave it to you. I am sorry I did not get to see you &amp;
                    Lizzie the Sunday I left it was late when I got to Greenville &amp; I went
                    down to Mr. Burk &amp; then to Mr. Newton's and by that time <i>[deleted: ]</i> was out. Orders just come for us to cook two days rations I suppose we will
                        hafto march to morrow. General Lee was at
                    gordonsville to day. Yesterday was thanksgive
                    day in our Army for the Merciful kindness God showed towards us in the battle of
                        Ceder Creek. I hope the God of battles may <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> still crown us with sucksess in future
                    engagements. I would like very much to be up in Augusta now &amp; go<i>[deleted: s]</i> a whirtleberrying. I know I could have a grate deal of pleasure. I suppose Sam Fitch has been down a half
                    dozen times by this time. Me and Sam are not as intimate as we was once he
                    treated me very kindly when I was at home he has a smooth tongue &amp; seems
                    to be a real ladies man. Dear Kate I have nothing to write that will interrest you. I cannot write a good letter so you
                    must not exspect one from me my friend J.V. sends a
                    note in my letter. My respects to all the family.</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon to your warmest friend &amp; well wisher</p>
