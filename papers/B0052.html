     </u> which he seems to have claimed of me. Said Alfred Stribling contracted to work for me one
     year commencing on last November 27th for $90.00 &amp; house firewood some ground for corn
     &amp; vegetables, his board, all furnished free. After working 12 days he quit without any
     provocation &amp; went into another man's house. From a former settlement he owed me $2.00
     which he <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>gives me no credit for. he quit at a time when I needed him worst. (working
     at corn) &amp; caused me a great deal of trouble to get a hand in his place, hands being
     scarce at that time. I have no disposition to take advantage of this man am willing that the
     case be tried before a magistrate I am acting as agent for my mother</p>
