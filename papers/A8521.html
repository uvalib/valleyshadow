<h4>Augusta County: Jedediah Hotchkiss to John H. McCue,
                    February 8, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jedediah Hotchkiss regrets that he cannot visit John H. McCue, because Hotchkiss
                    is in the midst of deciding to purchase the Addison Cochran farm, where he plans
                    to open a women's seminary with his brother. He also asks if McCue has any news
                    of an unsettled suit in which he is involved.</p>

<p class="p10">Feb. 8<u>
                                <sup>th</sup>
                        </u> 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Stribling Springs, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear M<sup>c</sup>Cue:</p>
<p class="p10">Your favor of the 28<u>
                        <sup>th</sup>
                    </u> ult. came duly to hand -- accept my thanks for this last expression of
                    your friendship.</p>
<p class="p10">I regret my inability to accept the offer and come to your new home, for I doubt
                    not the school would be successful, and I should delight to be in your immediate
                    vicinity: but I am now under obligations to unite with my brother in the
                    purchase of the Addison Cochran farm at Churchville, with a view of opening a
                    female Seminary there. We are under obligations to accept if certain
                    arrangements can be made. If they cannot be made I would entertain a proposition
                    to go to Lovingston. I suppose the people would be willing to pay 50 or 60
                    dollars a Sess. for tuition. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I am doing
                    very well here, this year, but am not perfectly satisfied. This is a delightful
                    place to live &amp; very agreeable to a one that is somewhat of a recluse.</p>
<p class="p10">I am pleased to hear that you are working your way into business. <u>Never Despair</u> is the word.</p>
<p class="p10">What about the interrogations that Harman &amp; Bell were to serve on me? I
                    have not heard from them yet. If you come over to Staunton, stir them up -- let
                    us finish up the suit if possible.</p>
<p class="p10">If there is any prospect of my coming to L. I
                    will let you know--</p>
<p class="p10">My wife joins me in kind regards to you &amp; yours.</p>
<p class="p10">Your friend</p>
