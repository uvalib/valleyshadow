                <p>I received your letter by your Papa, and was very much pleased to hear from you,
                    as we missed you very much.</p>

                <p>Well the "<unclear>Potoss</unclear> mine," has proved a grand thing, and Mr.
                    Sibert says the best opening for <unclear>Barytes</unclear>, he has ever seen.
                    He dined with us to day, and desires me to say that he will not return, until he
                    can realise a pocket full, and that the finding of this new bed of mineral, will
                    detain him three weeks at least over his <orig reg="allotted">alloted</orig>
                    time He is in <hi rend="underline">jubilant</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">spirits</hi>, and has invited Nan and myself to visit the
                    mine this week: he has five or six miners, and is throwing out<pb n="2"/>the
                    mineral beautifully. Nan will answer your letter very soon, she begs to be <orig
                        reg="remembered">remember'd</orig> to you. Sadie, Min and Ellie send a kiss.
                    Rex &amp; Miller have removed their <hi rend="underline">entire</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">stock</hi> of dry goods &amp;c, in the store house on
                    this place, over the creek. Will is as much devoted to his store as ever, and is
                    as <hi rend="underline">lively</hi> as ever.</p>

                <p>There have been several weddings around us since you left, Nan attended quite a
                    large wedding party at Fancy Hill, and expects to attend one at Botetout next
                    week. We have been confined pretty closely to the house, the roads have been too
                    heavy to make riding <orig reg="pleasant">plesant</orig>, and as to walking--you
                    know how much we do of that.</p>

                <p>Our Sewing Machine has proved a treasure, and we<pb n="3"/>have been kept pretty
                    busy with it, and have accomplished a great deal with it. I have been writing
                    several letters, and I believe ought to write as many more this evening, so as I
                    have nothing very interesting to tell you, will make my letter very short. Nan
                    will write you after the wedding of next week is over. Much love in which Nan
                    joins from </p>

                        travelling Mr. <unclear>Hites</unclear> limb was taken off at the knee. The
                        amputation was done in Washington City. Mrs Cupp says he does not seem to
                        suffer any pain<pb n="4"/>Dear Sister, I found Ma &amp; the children all
                        well. I was almost <unclear>frozen</unclear> when I got home. Old Mt Solon
                        looks horrible. I wish I had <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> in Bridgewater.
                        I would have <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> But I knew what work I had to
                        do at <hi rend="underline">home</hi>. This letter was here when I returned.
                        Have you sent for your clothes that I left at Mrs Whites? You must not get

                        too much. If he was in much danger they could not have moved him home. He
