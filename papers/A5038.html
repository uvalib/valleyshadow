<h4>Augusta County: Martha L. Roadcap to John B.
                    McGuffin, July 6, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In her letter to her son, John McGuffin, Martha Roadcap writes that she is
                    worried about his safety after reports of a battle near Shepherdstown. She also
                    mentions that the local crops look promising this year.</p>

<p class="p10">My Dear Son</p>
<p class="p10">I again seat myself to write to you. Not that I have any particular news to write
                    about but to relieve the anxiety that presses upon my mind, for night &amp;
                    Day my thoughts are with you both, and unless I can hear from you very often I
                    get in a desponding mood which I can only relieve myself of by writing. I am now
                    anxious at present for the reason that we have just heard the report of another
                    battle at Shepherdstown where you are, and that your Co. was engaged in it, hence my writing before I again heard from you.
                    If the report is true let me hear from you as soon as possible. There is no news
                    of interest in this neighborhood, all are engaged with the war and seem to think
                    of nothing else. Most of the farmers are engaged in harvesting, which is the
                    best we have had here for several years. Fruits &amp; everything else in
                    abundance. Corn is also looking finely.</p>
<p class="p10">Sallie is mending slowly - she was down to see me on yesterday and sends her love
                    to you with her sincere prayers for your safe return. Write soon all at home
                    send love to you hoping to hear from you soon &amp; often.</p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate Mother</p>
