                <p>As I have now a leisure hour after recess, I will employ it in writing to you. I
                    received your letter yesterday &amp; was I <del hand="h1">h</del> glad to
                    hear that Grandpa was better. The winter here, unlike the same season at
                    Washington, has not been very dull at least not to me. We have had good
                    sleighing and skating almost all the time and there have been a good many
                    parties here among the boys &amp; girls, to most of which I have gone. Next
                    week, the Catholics have a fair, which is to begin on Monday and continue during
                    the week. The proceeds are to be used for the purpose of finishing &amp;
                    furnishing the Catholic Church of this place, that is, if they (the proceeds) do
                    not go towards filling the pockets of the Committee, in whom I have little
                    confidence. I expect that it will be patronized extensively by the community in
                    general, &amp; it will go a good ways towards making next <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">week</add> pass pleasantly. The weather (that
                    never-to-be-worn-out-topic) is cold here and has been <pb n="2"/> so for about a
                    week, with the exception of one or two melting days. The snow, which fell last
                    Friday &amp; Thursday, sticks to us most perversely and has all the
                    appearances of continuing for two or three more weeks, unless the weather
                    changes for the warmer. This morning an Irishman attempted to commit suicide by
                    hanging himself &amp; no doubt would have done so, if the rope had not
                    broke. He is not yet out of danger. He would have been a good riddance to the
                    town, if his project had only succeeded. Two or three weeks ago, there was a
                    conjurer here, with the most celebrated dwarf, which the world has ever seen.
                    His name is <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr> Charley <unclear>Violet</unclear>
                    &amp; he <add hand="h1" place="inline">is</add> only twenty-nine inches
                    high, weighs twenty-three pounds &amp; is eighteen years old. He was born in
                    Fort Wayne, Indiana &amp; under the guardianship of his father is travelling
                    with <abbr expan="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Millar. He goes throught the sabre and
                    musket exercises with great dexterity. So is said he is one inch smaller than
                    Tom Thumb, &amp; certainly he is better proportioned than any man, I have
                        <hi rend="underline">ever</hi> seen. I have not very long to write yet but
                    "I will improve the minutes not hours I have." Our Latin Class has quit Circero
                    &amp; entered Virgil &amp; in not quite two weeks we have read<del
                        hand="h1">s</del> as far as the <orig reg="four-hundred">fourhundred</orig>
                    &amp; twentieth line. But I am above <orig reg="fifty-five">fifty &amp;
                        five</orig> lines ahead of the class as I translated in the leisure moments.
                        <pb n="3"/> of time <add hand="h1" place="inline">in</add> which I had
                    nothing better to do. I am beginning to like his style, which I did not like at
                    first. We are now reading in the (to me) most interesting part of the first
                    Book, at the passage, in which Virgil represents <orig reg="Aeneas">Aneas</orig>
                    as being conducted, with his companion through the city by Venus, who had
                    previously made them invisible. It is rumored that we are to have but six months
                    school &amp; six months vacation as the funds in the Treasury have
                        "<unclear>gone</unclear> out". There is the bell for the <orig
                        reg="dismissal">dissmissal</orig> of school so I have only about five or ten
                    minutes more to write. Our family are all well, with every prospect of
                    continuing so. How are all my friends in Gettysburg? Please write soon again
                    &amp; a little plainer. By doing so, you will oblige both myself &amp;
                    Jane, whose assistance I often require to help me <del hand="h1">with</del> in
                    "translating" your letters.</p>
