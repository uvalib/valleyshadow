<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John W. Jordan to Orlando
                    Brown, May 31, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jordan's monthly report is largely positive and optimistic about the state of
                    affairs in Augusta County. He does, however, observe that while white farmers
                    seem to possess "kind" feelings towards freedmen, townspeople possess an
                    "intense hostility" toward the exercise of civil and political rights on the
                    part of blacks.</p>

                    Jany 29<sup>th</sup> 1866 relating to
                    the general condition of Freedmens affairs &amp;c I
                    have the honor to submit the following on the condition of same in the Counties
                    of Augusta &amp; Highland Va at this date.</p>
<p class="p10">The present state of things especially in Augusta Co.
                    indicates a healthy condition of Freedmen's affairs generally in fact I find
                    them industriously and satisfactorily employed and encountering but <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>few drawbacks to their material advancement &amp; prosperity. Their
                    interest in Churches Schools &amp;c betray a settled
                    determination to make all possible progress in intelligence and comparatively
                    but few of them are indisposed to earn their bread by dishonorable employment.</p>
<p class="p10">Intemperance among this class does not seem to me to be so prevalent as it was
                    one month ago.</p>
<p class="p10">Fair, reasonable wages are paid them for their labor, and as long as the
                    employers acts fairly and justly toward them but little trouble is encountered
                    in their business operations and but little reason is given the employer to
                    complain of.</p>
<p class="p10">A fair proportion of the settlements made between the farmers <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>and
                    laborers are made in this office and I plainly discern evidences daily of an
                    improving slate of feeling between the races.</p>
<p class="p10">But little time is idled away and very little interest is taken in political
                    affairs by the Freedmen here attributable probably to the fact that they are so
                    sadly in the minority.</p>
<p class="p10">I have discovered that among the Agricultural people especially the greatest
                    possible kind feeling is cherished toward the Freedmen but among the townspeople
                    there is a vast deal of hatred cherished in fact cultivated against the race <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>and were it not for the presence of a Government officer here I am
                    convinced the colored people would meet with serious &amp; frequent
                    persecution. The most intense hostility is manifested toward the exercise of
                    either civil or political rights by the Freedmen and from what reaches my ears
                    daily one would imagine the people here were further away from
                        <i>[unclear: reconstruction]</i> than in any portion of the South.</p>
