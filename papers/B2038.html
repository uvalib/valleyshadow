<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John Scott to R. M.
                    Manly, March 13, 1869<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Scott alludes to the ongoing problems in Staunton with finding space for school
                    rooms, noting that he and his school were "driven out" of the church they were
                    using by the minister himself. Scott asks about the Peabody Fund and if they
                    would be able to get money to build a school house on land already owned by the
                    black community.</p>

<p class="p10">Mar 13, 1869</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I have already stated the trouble that I have had in regard to the colored people
                    about a school house. I never before was turned out-doors by any-body until the
                    school with their teacher was driven out of the church by the colored minister.</p>
<p class="p10">And the school will never be very successful until there is a school house here.
                    We want a building large enough to accomodate 800 scholars. Now how can we
                    obtain it. The colored people ar already in debt - having just purchased a
                    cemetery for $1200 and the baptist denomination are now <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>trying to
                    build a church.</p>
<p class="p10">I have made application to the Gov't for aid and
                    find the appropriation exhausted.</p>
<p class="p10">The colored people have land here, now, can any money for the building of <u>school</u>
                    <u>houses</u> be obtained from the Peabody fund on any
                    condition, and if so, on what condition.</p>
<p class="p10">Have you any circulars or printed information.</p>
<p class="p10">There is I suppose an Agt. in this city, but I am
                    entirely unacquainted with the business methods of applying for this fund or
                    with the specific object of it further than the newspaper acct of such a fund having been left for the benefit of schools in
                    the country.</p>
<p class="p10">If it can be properly used for such a purpose I would like to obtain something
                    for a school building.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Scott</i></p>
