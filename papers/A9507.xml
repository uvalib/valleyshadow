                <p>I have been thinking of <orig reg="writing">riting</orig> to you for some time
                    ever since the yanks were up to see us. I have a great Deal to tell you but
                        <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> know whether I will get through this time or
                    not. In the first place we are all well. The yanks <orig reg="burned"
                    >burnt</orig> both of our barns with about twenty five <orig reg="tons"
                    >tun</orig> of hay in them &amp; all of our wheat <orig reg="except"
                    >excep</orig> about twenty five bushels that we had carried out. We saved <orig
                        reg="almost">allmost</orig> all of our farming utensils. The yanks took all
                    of our cows but <orig reg="two">too</orig> came back.</p>

                <p>I <orig reg="refugeed">refujeed</orig> over the mountain with four horses
                    &amp; our colts &amp; some old horses we left at home &amp; they
                    tried to drive the colts off but they ran off &amp; came back. They looked
                    through the house but <orig reg="didn't">dident</orig> take any thing except
                    some sugar &amp; one pair of pants from papa.</p>

                <p><orig reg="There">Their</orig> will be suffering times in the valley this winter
                    as the yanks have burnt all of the barns from <orig reg="here">hear</orig> down
                    &amp; all of the mills except <pb n="2"/>one <orig reg="occasionally"
                        >occasionly</orig>, all of the barns in this neighborhood are burnt up
                    except two or three &amp; the worst of all <orig reg="everybody">every
                    body</orig> paid the yanks all of their gold &amp; silver. One thing we
                    never paid them one <orig reg="cent">sent</orig>, &amp; if they never come
                    again we will do pretty well. Some people are ruined <orig reg="entirely">in
                        tirely</orig>. They liked to ruined <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> Pence
                    they took <orig reg="off">of</orig> both of his black men that he had bought
                    &amp; five head of horses &amp; all of his cattle &amp; sheep
                    &amp; <orig reg="burned">burnt</orig> his barn he <orig reg="didn't"
                    >dident</orig> have a barrel of flour on hand. I tell you he is almost crazy
                    &amp; the worst of all he has to go in the army now he has to go to Staunton
                    to morrow to Start to Richmond the next day &amp; John Grove has to go also
                    &amp; all of the details. I tell you they are <unclear>scraping</unclear>
                    things now &amp; I think they ought <unclear>for times</unclear> looks
                    pretty squally but we will come out all right in the end. Some people think the
                    Confederacy is <orig reg="gone">gon</orig> up all ready as the saying is.</p>

                <p>There has a great many family <unclear>members</unclear> off to the yanks from
                    Rockingham &amp; some <pb n="3"/>men that had fine farms. People from <orig
                        reg="here">hear</orig> down are very much discouraged every thing destroyed.
                    The yanks <orig reg="didn't">dident</orig>
                    <orig reg="get">got</orig> to John Grove. So all of the barns in that
                    neighborhood are safe. They were at Uncle Jacobs but <orig reg="didn't"
                    >dident</orig> burn anything in that neighborhood. The yanks stripped some
                    people of all of their stock.</p>

                <p>I must tell you a little joke on <orig reg="Pappy">Papy</orig>. Uncle John went
                    to <orig reg="haul">hall</orig> some wood &amp; <orig reg="pappy"
                    >papy</orig> went over toward Mr. <orig reg="Reubush's">Reubushes</orig> to
                    stand picket so he could notify him if the yanks were a coming. So Mr. Reubush
                    joined Pappy &amp; they went out to the Keegle town road &amp; was a
                    looking for the yanks &amp; all at once a old yank <orig reg="rode"
                    >road</orig> up in their rear &amp; asked them what they were a doing there
                    &amp; demanded their money &amp; as good luck would have it <orig
                        reg="Pappy">Papy</orig>
                    <orig reg="hadn't">hadent</orig> but little &amp; he told him to go home
                    &amp; stay <orig reg="there">thier</orig>, but Mr. R. had about five
                    thousand dollars in <abbr expan="Confederate [currency]">confed</abbr> &amp;
                        <orig reg="some">soime</orig> little <orig reg="specie">speace</orig>
                    &amp; they robbed him &amp; as they told pap to go he left Mr R
                    &amp; cut out &amp; after he had <orig reg="gone">gon</orig> the old
                    yank struck Mr R <orig reg="three">thre</orig> times with his saber &amp; so
                    he put out <pb n="4"/>home to with an empty pocket, a wonder the yank <orig
                        reg="didn't">dident</orig> take both of their horses &amp; so that ended
                    their picketing &amp; I think it ought as they both might of been killed.
                    Nothing new except everybody so down in the mouth in Rockingham the yanks burnt
                    a good many houses the people in the lower valley will have to leave &amp;
                    go someplace this winter. One good thing almost <orig reg="everybody">every
                    body</orig> was done seeding &amp; the wheat is up &amp; looks very
                    fine. We <orig reg="hadn't">hadent</orig> sowed as much as we had counted on
                    sowing but we will have to quit so <orig reg="there">ther</orig>
                    <orig reg="isn't">aint</orig> any to spare to mow. We had sowed some 40 bushels.</p>

                <p>The people in the neighborhood are <orig reg="generally">jenerlly</orig> well. I
                    tell you about that battle that we had in the valley when the yanks whipped our
                    men we were whipped very bad. I never saw such a demoralized set of men in my
                    life a heap of our men deserted some never will do us any more good but our army
                    has <orig reg="been">bin</orig> recruiting &amp; our army is in better
                    spirits than they were two weeks ago &amp; I think we will clean the yanks
                    out of the valley soon. I don't think they will be up this winter any more at
                    least I hope so. It was a bad arrangement to let the Yanks destroy the valley. I
                        <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> see how our army is to live in <abbr
                        expan="Virginia">Va</abbr> this winter the valley has <orig reg="been"
                    >bin</orig> our main support &amp; that is nearly all destroyed. James D.
                    Schreckhise is safe yet at last accounts but the old company that I <orig
                        reg="used">ust</orig> to belong to was all killed or captured except one
                    private &amp; that is <abbr expan="William">Wm</abbr> Sheets. <abbr
                        expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Joseph Frey was wounded &amp; <orig
                        reg="died">ded</orig> he was <unclear>dead</unclear> three weeks yesterday.
                    That is his third Son for to be killed in this war. George
                    <unclear>Baker</unclear> has got back from Fort Delaware paroled as he was
                    wounded. A. B. is still <orig reg="there">their</orig>. Nothing more new to
