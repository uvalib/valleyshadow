<p class="p10">May 5 1860</p>
<p class="p10">Wests. L. Asylum, Va,</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of 25 ult. has been recd. It affords the
                    first authentic information, which has reached me, as to the death of Mr Peter
                    Carr-- I had conceived for his character, a high appreciation &amp; truly
                    sympathize, with his family, in the loss they have sustained</p>
<p class="p10">You inform me, that you have been appointed curator for Mr Jas. H. Lewis, a patient in this institution I ask to be informed on
                    certain points.</p>
<p class="p10">I send herewith a statement, from which you will perceive that on 30 Sept 1859 there was a balance due the asylum of
                    $332.72 cts (If this balance be promptly paid interest will not be charged)--You
                    will also learn from this Statement, that the <u>annual</u>
                    charge for board, fuel, lights, washing, clothing &amp; medical attendance
                    for Mr Lewis, is $250.<u>00</u> under the Law of Virginia,
                    the <u>Principal</u>, as well as <u>income</u>, from his estate, is bound for his Expenses here.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Carr usually made his remittances thro me,
                    because probably I am the Supdt. of the institution- In regard to Mr Lewis, any
                    check, forwarded to "Geo. Baylor, Treas", will be promptly acknowledged by him
                    &amp; his recpt be a legal voucher- If<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>however for any reason, you prefer, making remittance, thro me, I will cheerfully give the matter my attention &amp;
                    return you treasurers recpt-</p>
<p class="p10">Please let me know, in what, the pecuniary interests of Mr Lewis, at present
                    consists--what its actual value, &amp; what the annual proceeds--</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Lewis physical health, continues good--He is however not merely destitute of
                    sight &amp; hearing--but his mind, in a most enfeebled condition--Mrs Carr
                    has often learned my views as to his condition &amp; prospects, thro my letters to her husband--I have nothing
                    additional to report to her-- Be so good, as to assure her, of my sincere
                    sympathy &amp; kind regards</p>
<p class="p10">In much haste, &amp; very respectfully yrs</p>
<p class="p10"><i>F. T. S</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Jno. W. Davis Esq
                    </p>
