<p class="p10">May 4<sup>th</sup> 1868</p>

<p class="p10">
                        Capt.
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to call your attention to certain demonstrations made by an
                    organization here known as the "Ku Klux Klan" and which have caused a vast deal
                    of dangerous excitement, especially among the colored population and which if
                    not promptly suppressed will culminate in serious and deplorable disturbances of
                    the public peace.</p>
<p class="p10">This Klan made their appearance in the Streets of Staunton about 1 o'clock Sunday
                    morning last, mounted and the Klan being enmasked in white sheets or something
                    of the kind, and being armed caused no little consternation among the colored
                    people and much serious annoyance to the respectable whites. Their operations
                    were attended with the discharge of pistols and <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>also by cheers or
                    yelling, which of course occurring as it did almost in the center of the town
                    aroused almost the entire population.</p>
<p class="p10">On yesterday I addressed a formal communication to the Mayor upon the subject who
                    has informed me that every effort is being made by the Civil Authorities to
                    ferret out the guilty parties in the matter, who I am assured will be brought to
                    punishment and the operations of the Klan suppressed at once.</p>
<p class="p10">The colored people are very much excited upon the subject and but little is
                    needed to bring about a serious state of things here. I would also remark that I
                    have reported the facts to the Military Comr
                    for this Division also.</p>
