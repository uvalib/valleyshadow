<h4>Augusta County: Thomas J. Jackson to Francis
                    McFarland, February 11, 1862<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson's letter explains the reasons for his resignation to McFarland, stating
                    that he is opposed to a particular military strategy. McFarland often read
                    letters from Jackson to his congregation at Bethel Presbyterian Church.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    To Rev. Francis McFarland, D.D.
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Feby. 11th, 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Doctor,</p>
<p class="p10">Your very kind and christian letter respecting my proposed withdrawal from Field
                    Service, has been received, and be assured it met with a cordial reception. My
                    desire to serve our cause is undiminished; but I am in active service not
                    because it is more congenial to my taste, but from a sense of duty. The moment
                    that my services are not required in the field I desire to return to the
                    Institute. After God had restored to us the County of Morgan east of the Big
                    Capon River, and the most valuable fortress of Hampshire County, and was still
                    driving the enemy from this Military District, the Secretary of War, without
                    consulting me upon the subject, sent an order to me stating that he has
                    information, that Genl. Loring's command is in
                    danger of being cut off, and directs me to order him back to Winchester
                    immediately, thus unnecessarily abandoning to the enemy what had been restored
                    to us. If such a policy as that was to be pursued by the Secretary at his desk
                    far removed from the theatre of war, ruin must result
                    to our cause, and I feel called upon to utter my strongest protest against such
                    a ruinous policy, and this I designed doing by offering to resign, rather than
                    be the wilful instrument of carrying out a ruinous
                    policy.</p>
<p class="p10">So far as the Secretary may have shown indignity to me personally, that is not a
                    matter to be considered in times like the present, especially I am satisfied
                    that my course was a good one for our cause, the effect that it may injuriously
                    have in the estimation of men respecting me is of but little moment.</p>
<p class="p10">I say it humbly but with the hope that you will live to see that my course has
                    been what it should have been. I am ever ready to remain in the field when I can
                    have a prospect of being useful there. Pray that I may be useful.</p>
<p class="p10">Sincerely your friend,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>T.J. Jackson</i></p>
