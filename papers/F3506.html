<p class="p11"><b>
                    Adjutant Genl.
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">January 19, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">McConnelsburg, Fulton Co. Pa.</p>
<p class="p10">Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">I am at home, wounded, on "Leave of Absence" for thirty days. My time expired
                    yesterday--My "Leave" being dated Dec. 19th 1862. Here I am, in a quandary. My
                    wound is not yet healed up, is still a running sore, and being in the head, on
                    the left temple, it is in an exposed and <u>critical</u>
                    place, so my surgeon assures me &amp; consequently protests against me
                    venturing to return to my regt (126th regt. Pa.)
                    or even venturing out on two or three days travel--and yet the surgeon cannot
                    comply with the literal terms required by Dec. 5 of the <u>extracts</u> from the Regulations, accompanying my "Leave of Absence," by
                    which he is required to swear that the patient is not <u>"able"</u> to travel. This I cannot <u>ask</u> him to
                    do because I <u>can</u> travel (though not <u>fit</u>) else I would not be here &amp; yet the
                    surgeon deems it both imprudent &amp; dangerous to make the venture, the
                    wound being in the head. On <u>pleasant days</u> I can
                    &amp; <u>do</u> go out and feel the better for a little
                    exercise.</p>
<p class="p10">I have no desire to remain away from my comrades in arms one day longer than is
                    necessary. I want to serve my country and the measure of my services is not yet
                    full and will not be until this rebelion is crushed
                    out if I live so long.</p>
<p class="p10">If an extenson is granted, I assure you I will not use one day more of the time
                    given than is necessary to heal my wounds.</p>
<p class="p10"> My address stands at the head of this note.</p>
<p class="p10">My "Leave of Absence" is dated Dec. 19th 1862-- disability report the previous
                    day.</p>
<p class="p10">herewith I send surgeons certificate. I will await your reply.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully your Obt. Servt.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>James Pott, 2nd Lieut.<br> Co. "B" 126th Pa.</i></p>
<p class="p10">D. Suffield was my attending physician until he went to
                        Washington. His certificate is filed in your office.<br>
                        Yrs. J.P.</p>
