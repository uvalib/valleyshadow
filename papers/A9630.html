<h4>Augusta: William F. Brand to Kate Armentrout, May 4,
                    1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William tells Kate about friends and family he has seen in camp at Harpers Ferry,
                    and that he and his friends have enlisted "for as long as Virginia has need for
                    us." He estimates that the war will last three or four years.</p>

<p class="p10">May 4th '61</p>
<p class="p10">Harpers Ferry</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">In confusion not as you exspect for time is so very
                        presscious that I have to hurry about evry thing. Yesterday we ware all
                    on Maryland hights &amp; had nothing to eat
                    &amp; raining an no shelter put when we came home those that we left had dinner ready for us.
                    Brother arrived safely yesterday with Thomas Supple put
                    James Supple never will get hear for he <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> took
                    sick at Winchester &amp; I exspect he will go
                    home, very likely it is good policy in him for I know that he would be scorned
                    almost to death. I would not be in his plase for a
                    fortune or any thing that seems dearer. We all enlisted our servises to day as long as Virginia had need for us. I dont think that we will be released before Three or Four
                    years &amp; if that may be the case we all never can come home. John is
                    well, I think he wrote to you all. I am not surtain.
                    Abraham sends you his love to you.</p>
<p class="p10">I will hafter bring this uninteresting letter to a
                    close, my health is very good &amp; hope that these fiew lines come to hand you may be enjoying the same blessing. I ask an
                    Interest in your prayers give my love to all the family.</p>
<p class="p10">yours in love burity &amp; fidelity</p>
<p class="p10"><i>William F. Brand</i></p>
<p class="p10">PS Please excuse all bad writing speling &amp; composition. Yours &amp;c W.F.B.<br><p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p>God bless you when the sunset tints Warm the high battlements of
                        heaven As day a fond warm kiss imprints Upon the gentle brow of even Yours
                        &amp;c WFB<br>Mr George W Fitch requested me to send you his love
                        &amp; at the same time not noing who I was
                        writing to &amp; sayes he will write before
                        long. Good by.</p>
