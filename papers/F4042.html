<p class="p10">March 11th 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Newberne</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">I have only received one letter from since I came here and that was the one from
                    Father of 20th. But I presume that you have certainly written since, and as the
                    mail boat from the North is due here to-day I can only
                    hope that with its arrival good news from home it will bring The weather here
                    has been exceedingly changeable The rain will fall in torrents all night, and in
                    the morning the "God of day" will rise in all the splendor of the July morning
                    with such intense heat that one would think that underclothes must be laid aside
                        untill the stormy winds of November again sets in
                        <i>[deleted: But]</i><i>[added: And]</i> before night
                    comes rain again set in But owing to the sandy soil the water soaks away in a
                    very short time</p>
<p class="p10">Frank and myself are both at present employed in the Office and I can not yet
                    tell whether we will be on the RRoad or remain
                    where we are</p>
<p class="p10">The Colonel has allowed me one half months pay (31.59) to pay for my expenses
                    from Chattanooga to this place</p>
<p class="p10">Since Gen
                    <i>[unclear: Schofield]</i> has moved towards the interior of this state a
                    great many refugees have come into Newberne of both sex the clothes show how
                    scanty their wardrobes <i>[deleted: my]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: are]</i> must be Men with hats without and crown or rim only the
                    sides of a hat and the hole of a hat women wear hat also with ribbons faded,
                    Bonnets of the antiquated kiss-me-quick design</p>
<p class="p10">I Hope these few lines will find you all well, give my love to Father, Mother
                        <i>[unclear: Rollins]</i> and <i>[unclear: Lidi]</i></p>
