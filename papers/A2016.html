<p class="p10">Mossy Creek Academy, Augusta County Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father,</p>
<p class="p10">Having some leisure moments I thought I would write you a short letter. The boys have all
      arived here at last except one. I came all the way on Saturday. I
     stopped in Harrisonburg and tried to get my self a pair of boots but did not succeede. I was at all the shops in town and could not find a pair of
     boots to fit me. I came on to Bridgewater and met with no better success. I had my measure
     taken their for a pair <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> stick down <i>[unclear: Kip]</i>
     boots, and I expect to get them tomorrow morning by the mail. he charges me five dollars and a
      halfe. I asked the price of the same boots in Harrisonburg and they
     said they could not make them for less than 7 dollars. Beaver and the boys from down the valley
     came Wednesday. I found but very few here when I got here and had a lonesome time. But every thing is started on right now. I payed Mr. White my book bill
     this evening and took his receipt. It was quite a military day in Harrisonburg Saturday, there
     were two companeys
     parrading the Horse company and the Rifle Company they made quite a
     show, and I thought went through the manouvers very well. The
     horse company was receiving their <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> arms. Beaver tells me that the arms for the New
     Market Cavalry is on the way. They are to be sabres and two of Colts Navy revolvers. I think it
     is time that they should arm the volunteer companies of the State. As in all probability they
     will be called out in the spring. Secession is on the increase here, I have heard men say in
     the last few days that they were strong secessionist, who before Christmas were quiet
     submissionist. I think the time has come when submission can no longer be withstood, and we
     should claim our rights, if not in the Union we must - out of it. The North will hear to no
     compromise, and the South will not submit to an unconstitutional party. Write soon. My love to
     all.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Son,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>C.C. Branner</i></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p>P.S. Friday Morning. My Boots came this morning the do very well. I tell you they are stomppers, soles about half an inch
      thick. <u>C.C.B.</u></p>
