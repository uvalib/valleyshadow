<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to John
                    A. McDonnell, July 3, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson writes on behalf of Benjamin Frazier, who is looking for his four older
                    children because he is unable to support his four youngest children without
                    assistance. Hector Sears, the Agent in Fredericksburg, reports that Frazier's
                    eldest son is the only one in a position to help him.</p>

                    Fredericksburg and Emily Williams who lives with Edward Stephens near
