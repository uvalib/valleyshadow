                </opener>

                <p>I embrace the first opportunity of sending you the printed minutes of our Synod,
                    approved by the <abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Assembly">Ass.</abbr>. The meeting was small but pleasant. You have
                    doubtless seen the published proceedings.</p>

                <p>You are aware that we have had a visit from our Yankee Brethren. Our community
                    has suffered greatly. Many were robbed of almost every mouthful of food and
                    every <orig reg="piece">peice</orig> of apparel. My house &amp; its contents
                    escaped, but they robbed me of 36 bushels of corn, a ton of Hay and my favorite
                    riding horse. Besides this they destroyed my grass, <unclear>consumed</unclear>
                    a great deal of my ice, ruined my carriage harness, cut the curtains from my
                    carriage &amp; endeavored to steal the carriage. One of their Generals made
                    his head quarters in my yard. This was some protection to me. On the whole they
                    appeared to me like a great mob of <unclear>licensed</unclear> robbers and house
                    burners. They did immense damage to the college. They utterly destroyed or <orig
                        reg="carried">carryed</orig> off the college library &amp; did the same
                        <pb n="2"/> to about half of the two society Libraries &amp; destroyed
                    or gave to the negroes all the furniture of the two society Halls. They broke
                    every <orig reg="piece">peice</orig> of the philosophical apparatus &amp;
                    would have burned the buildings if it had not been for <abbr expan="Captain"
                        >Capt.</abbr> Moore. They burned the Institute, Mess Hall, two professors
                    houses, sparing Smiths on account of the illness of his daughter <del hand="h1"
                        >&amp; all</del></p>

                <p>From the way in which I am told many of their officers spoke of our "<hi
                        rend="underline">cruel treatment to Dr. Junkin</hi>," I have no doubt that
                    his <unclear>representation</unclear> didn't lead to much of their cruelty here.
                    It is curious, that his daughter, Mrs Col. Preston was the only lady here who
                    was treated with personal rudeness <del hand="h1">here</del>. Of course the
                    party who did it, did not know that she was his daughter. One of their officers
                    stated that both he &amp; Dr. Junkin were with Averill on his raid last
                    fall.</p>

                <p>I am thankful to learn that they did not reach your house. May a kind providence
                    shield us from their presence &amp; deliver us from their power. I trust
                    your health is comfortable. My wife joins me in kindest remembrances to you, Mrs
                        M<hi rend="super">c</hi>Farland &amp; Mary.</p>
