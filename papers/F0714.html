<p class="p10">Jan. 18, 1862 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp Dennison, Ohio. </p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Old friend-- It is <br> very seldom that I have to apolo= <br>
     gize for any failure in punctu= <br> ality in answering
     correspondents, <br> but have not been as punctual as <br> usual in answering your last,
     <br> (forwarded to me to Camp Chase
     <br> at Columbus) from the fact th
     <br> we have never known until now<br> how long we would remain in <br> Camp or where we
     would be <br> ordered to. </p>
<p class="p10">You will perceive by this time <br> that I am again in the service 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/BitSho1b.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitSho1b.gif"></center></a><br><br> of Uncle Sam. I have been <br> soldiering since the fifth of
      Nov.
     <br> I resigned my situation in <br>
     Darke Co. and quit the business <br> of
     teaching the young idea<br> how to shoot, in order <br> to learn how to shoot (secessionists)
     <br> myself. O Lord! what men <br> will do for glory, beans, bacon <br> and $17 per month! I
     am <br> writing this on the soldier's <br> writing desk, i.e. a board 18 <br> inches square
     placed upon my <br> knees. </p>
<p class="p10">We are provided with very <br> good quarters here--regular <br> barracks--and plenty of
     beans, ba=<br> con, hominy, and other luxuries. <br> but alas! how
     fleeting is all <br> earthly happiness! We are or=<br> dered to
     leave next week for 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/BitSho1c.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitSho1c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     Virginia, and ere this reaches you <br> we will be in "Dixie's
     Land." </p>
<p class="p10">The only thing about the busi=<br> ness I don't like is that it
      de= <br> prives us of the pleasure of that <br> time honored
     institution--"sparking <br> Sunday night." I haven't been <br> within 6 feet of a piece of
      cali= <br> co for two months. Ugh! Think <br> of that old fellow,
     and the next <br> time you go to see your--what's <br> her name?--just give her a smack <br>
     on those rosy lips of hers for me. <br> Well, sir, the tattoo is beating and I <br> must
     attend roll call. </p>
<p class="p10"> As taps will beat in 20 minutes <br> and all lights must be extinguished <br> I must now
     close. My respects to <br> the friends and compliments to <br> the ladies--especially your
     Angelia <br> Seraphina. Hope you will
