<p class="p10">I recieved your letter of the 29th It found me in the saddle &amp; after
                    reading its contents my feelings were deeply affected. Its clarion nots rang louder than the shock of the midnight assault,
                    Indeed it made my heart, as it ware
                    blead in simpathy for you,
                    I havent the least doubt but you hurd the rumer, you ought to have seen my
                    mortified &amp; anger lit continance I didnt think thare was one living
                    in G. so <i>[unclear: disspsibly pose]</i> as
                    to circulate a malicious lie. I deny emphatically of taking a drop, or asking or
                    desiring one. I have evry reason to believe that your
                        relitive was the starter of the lie what else
                    shall I term it &amp; for the simple reason I have been more fortunate than
                    his son in trying to be something in this world I will not deny your charge of
                    swearing occasionly &amp; God knows I am
                    sorry to make this confession, but I never shall try to decieve you in the
                    least. I have always used candor &amp; hope I never may very from its treshhold <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I was down to Staunton on

                    called on you but had not time. excuse my haste while in Aug. I am doing very well &amp; have no fears of the dangerous
                    red cup no I will never bring Fathers head in sorrow in the grave unless it be
                    in regard to my soul &amp; I sincearly
                    hop I may claim a right in the first reserrection ere long only by busy boddies who ought to learn our lords prayer. your letter
                    was like a white winged angel I admired it, it was tuching &amp; pathetic thare is nothing in
