<p class="p10">New Market, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dr Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I send William, he will tomorrow get to Mr. Hamilton's &amp; the next morning come home,
     then you have him do what you wish to have do . . . put away your vegetables &amp;c
     &amp;c -- let him find out from Mr. Heizer where to cut wood &amp; go &amp; cut for
     about 4 or 5 days -- I want him to get back by the 10<u>
      <u>
       <sup>th</sup>
      </u>
     </u> of Nov. unless I write to the contrary. I have him ride up a horse that he can put into
     pasture -- Mr. Geeding will let it run in his I suppose, or Dr. Wilson as it will not be more
     than a week -- have him get the axe that Mr. <i>[unclear: Euritt]</i> fixed &amp; grind it
     up he will reach home Wednesday morning, let him go to Mr. Hamilton's over next Sunday
     &amp; then start for here direct on the 9<u>
      <sup>th</sup>
     </u>. Did you charge Allie Hanger not to let the desks be cut? - Get the flour from all that I
     named on the list I gave you -- I am trying to pay all up at Christmas -- glad you got
     buckwheat -- I am very much pleased to know, by your letter, that you are succeeding so well in
     getting things together -- Make the most of William's time you can <u>now</u>, &amp; I hope, by &amp; by to come home myself with him &amp; get up a
     full supply of wood for winter but he can cut up a lot now &amp; perhaps when I come with
     him we can get the Cold man you spoke of to help &amp; <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>haul up wood, with my own horses if I can do no other way. Mr. R's shirt fits only a
     little too narrow in the back -- I send you a copy of Gen. Early's address to the army -- we
     are getting well organized &amp; are prepared to meet any force that may come up -- we have
     been reinforced by some Cavalry from the S. W. &amp; all things wear a cheerful aspect -- I
     do not think there is any idea of evacuating the Valley -- Of course an army could be subsisted
     as well near Staunton as any where else, as there is R. R.
     communication -- . Send my towel, hair brush, &amp; white blanket by Wm -- I hope my Saddle bags have gotten home -- send them back by Wm. Maj. Green's things, bed &amp; carpet bag were sent to Maj.
     Bell -- &amp; he was to send them out. I do not know what became of them -- I hope they are
     safe. I will provide a blanket for Mary &amp; think I can get shoes, what is her no: -- I
     shall yet have a chance to get the gloves for Miss Kate, I think -- Have my coat turned. I
     shall draw pay tomorrow &amp; will send you some money -- Write soon -- I will write again
     in a day or so. All quiet. Love &amp; blessings for you all -- </p>
