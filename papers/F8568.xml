                    night</orig> and hasten to reply to it. We heard of your election yesterday by
                    Telegraph and must congratulate you, as you have had such a hard fight it is the
                    more gratifying. I think you must feel relieved it is over and must need rest. I
                    will have to ask you to defer your visit to us, for which I am truly sorry as I
                    want to see you very much but -- I have made all my arrangements to go to <abbr
                        expan="Baltimore">Balt.</abbr> next week /on Wednesday I expect to start and
                    will be absent two weeks and perhaps a little longer, I wish you could come
                    there it would be so pleasant. I had a letter from Margaretta Stevenson giving
                    me a very pressing invitation to stay with them. I will divide my time there and
                    at Mrs <orig reg="Adams'">Adams's</orig>

                    The Rose Hill girls came home with me to tea and we went to a concert at the

                    very tired and feel like retiring. I am too sorry about your visit and will
                    certainly expect you when I return. the children are well and enjoyed the Fair
                        <orig reg="today">to day</orig> very much. Dr sends his congratulations,
                    your side does not go down well here. We do not hear Lincoln's name, though I
                    fear he will be the man. If you cannot come to <abbr expan="Baltimore"
                    >Balt--</abbr> write to us when I am there. I imagine you must have great
                    interest and excitement on Tuesday night and yesterday. I am much obliged to you
                    for the check and will enclose the <orig reg="receipt">reciept</orig>. I <orig
