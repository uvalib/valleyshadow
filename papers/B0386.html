<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John A. McDonnell to
                    Roswell Waldo, September 15, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McDonnell expresses surprise that Waldo is requesting money for a school house in
                    Waynesboro, because as McDonnell explains, $150 was already appropriated for
                    that purpose while Jackson was the agent for Augusta County, and no more aid can
                    be expended.</p>

<p class="p10">It was with some surprise that your application for aid in building a schoolhouse
                    &amp; church in Waynesboro was received.</p>
<p class="p10">Authority to expend $150 in repairing a schoolhouse for freedpeople was given by
                    communication from this office of May 20t 1867. And checks in payment of
                    accounts for material purchased were sent as follows viz.</p>

<p class="p10">Receipts for the above amounts from the Agent in charge at Staunton are on file
                    in this office. It is presumed that the colored people are endeavoring to obtain
                    further assistance from you, but it is possible that the money may <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>not have been expended as designed.</p>
<p class="p10">Application was made last January for a Teacher for the School at Waynesboro, and
                    it was supposed that the Schoolhouse was in use, or ready for occupation.</p>
<p class="p10">No further aid can be expected from the Bureau in building schoolhouses, the sum
                    appropriated for that purpose being exhausted.</p>
<p class="p10">Books and teachers are supplied only by private parties or charitable
                    associations.</p>
