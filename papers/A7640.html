<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, January 24, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife and describes the lonely life he and Freddy are
                    leading. He expresses his frustration at a life separated from his family, and
                    laments the four years they have been apart. He discusses running the hotel and
                    a store in Staunton. He also sends several I.O.U.'s his wife can collect for her
                    own use.</p>

<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">As I have another oppertunity to write you I
                    embrace it hoping it may reach you soon</p>
<p class="p10">Freddy &amp; I are both quite well &amp; live here quite snug rooming
                    together it is quite lonesome but we get along quite well F passes away his time
                    at night in learning his lessons I pass part of my by helping him. he learns
                    fast. I have got him a Michels geography which he is studying hard I also got
                    him a latin grammer which he is studying &amp; learns quite fast. He
                    frequently wishes to be at home but says he would not be satisfied there, but
                    wishes you were only here with us (<u>&amp; I say so
                    too</u>)</p>
<p class="p10">From present prospects I think very probable we will be home in the spring. I
                    long for that time to come I am soarly tired of this
                    life nearly 4 years separated loosing this much time in the prime of life (<u>too bad</u>) But it is no use to grieve after spilt milk
                    but provide for the future.</p>
<p class="p10">I am still in the Hotel yet, seems no hope for a change yet We change our plan of
                    keeping it tomorrow, furnish rooms &amp; prepare meals &amp; let persons
                    call for what they want &amp; pay for what they get. I think this mode will
                    pay much best. I am conducting the<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> store with M<sup>
