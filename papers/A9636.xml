                    the purpose of dropping you a <orig reg="few">fiew</orig> lines. I have been
                    looking for a letter from you for some time past. Indeed, I have not <orig

                    begin to think that I am <unclear>uttrably</unclear> forsaken no one can tell
                    the pleasure that it affords, a poor soldier on <orig reg="receiving"

                    <orig reg="they">thay</orig> took fifteen or twenty Prisoners. John Plunket went

                <p>I have <orig reg="no">now</orig> doubt that <orig reg="there">thare</orig> will

                    pieces. The red flag waves in full view of the white house <orig reg="every"
                        >evry</orig> day I reckon that it is very provoking to old Abe, when he
                    takes his spy glass &amp; looks over into Virginia and <orig reg="there"
                        >thare</orig> see what he <orig reg="calls">cauls</orig>

                <p>We just <orig reg="heard">hurd</orig> that we would have to move down the road
