                    same; the health of our company is inproving smartly for the last two or three
                    days and I hope before long we may all have good health and <add hand="h1"
                        place="inline">ever</add> after. Your friend Jimmie V. is enjoying good
                    health he is on duty to day. John sends his love to you he just <orig reg="now"

                    >hafto</orig> stop writing at this time Saturday.</p>

                <pb n="2"/>

                <p>This is the 15th day of July. I had to stop writing the other day for to go on
                    battalion drill and it was my time to go on guard duty for Twenty four hours and
                    this morning we <orig reg="were">ware</orig> drilling and again I have a <orig
                        reg="few">fiew</orig> moments of <orig reg="leisure">leasure</orig> time I
                    will write. I have not had the opportunity of seeing Mr JPL yet we are often
                    parted <orig reg="here">hear</orig> for some times two or three weeks. I do not
                    feel like writing this <orig reg="evening">eavning</orig> and <orig
                        reg="therefore">thare four</orig> you must excuse me if I may write a short
                    letter. I suppose you all have <orig reg="heard">hurd</orig> a <orig
                        reg="correct">crorect</orig> account of the skirmish of the 2nd of this
                    month <orig reg="there">thare</orig> was but little loss on our side. The report
                    is <orig reg="here">hear</orig> that we killed from Two fifty to three Hundred
                    of the Yankees.</p>

                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>That is the statement of one of Pattersons <orig reg="aides">aids</orig> if all
                        <orig reg="Johnston's">Johnsons</orig> force <orig reg="here">hear</orig>
                    fights like the 5th <orig reg="regiment">regament</orig> did on the memorable
                        <orig reg="second">seckond</orig> we will soon whip all the Yankees back
                    into Maryland that is all that would escape the wiry arm of the South. We just
                    now <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> orders to draw three <orig reg="days'"
                        >days</orig> rations and cook one <orig reg="day's">days</orig> it is said
                    that the <orig reg="enemy">enimy</orig> is marching against us it may be so but
                    it is <orig reg="certainly">sirtainly</orig> to <orig reg="their">thare</orig>
                    loss, for our force now nearly <orig reg="equals">eaquels</orig>
                    <orig reg="theirs">thares</orig> and we have the most <orig reg="artillery"
                        >artilery</orig>
                    <orig reg="on">ond</orig> our side we have some twenty stationed pieces and some
                    five or six flying <orig reg="Batteries">Batterries</orig> and all commanded by
                    as brave as the bravest all the Southern troops are as eager to fight seemingly
                    as they are to eat.</p>

                <pb n="4"/>

                <p>It seems to me that <orig reg="we'll">will</orig> soon whip our <orig
                        reg="enemies">enimies</orig> if our <orig reg="officers">offices</orig> Just
                    let us have a trial at them. I got acquainted with a gentleman by the name of
                    Brand he is from with a lieutenant in the <orig reg="Wytheville"
                    >Withville</orig> company he said he never saw any one of the name of Brand
                    before that was not relations he seemed to be very glad to see me and on parting
                    invited me up to see him he is a <orig reg="doctor">docktor</orig> lately from
                    Richmond &amp; I think he resembles Cousin Joseph Brand some what I think he
                    is about twenty eight years old from his looks. I shall call on him some of
                    these <orig reg="evenings">eavnings</orig> before long. Cousin Abe is writing
                    close to me we have a hard way to write <orig reg="here">hear</orig>. I have not
                    had time to have my likeness taken yet <orig reg="but">put</orig> if ever I get
                        <orig reg="where">whare</orig> I can <orig reg="possibly">posibly</orig>
                    have it taken I will do so. I hope it may not be long <orig reg="until"
                    >untill</orig> peace may be made between the Confederate States and the
                    corrupted north the <orig reg="drums">drumbs</orig> are loudly beating <orig
                        reg="now">know</orig> and some of our regiments have taken up the march
                    towards our <orig reg="enemies">enimies</orig>. They are <orig reg="within">with
                        in</orig> twelve miles of us and it may not be long <orig reg="until"
                    >untill</orig> death may step between us <orig reg="but">put</orig> if so I hope
                    not for ever.</p>

                <p>I'll put my trust in the God of battles for he is able and willing to save those
                    that put <orig reg="their">thare</orig> trust in him. I recieved a letter from
                    Miss <unclear>Matit</unclear> she told me in her letter that you <orig
                        reg="were">ware</orig> up <orig reg="there">thare</orig> to see her it is
                    useless for me to write any more at <orig reg="present">preasent</orig>. I will
