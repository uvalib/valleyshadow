<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">April 22<sup>nd</sup> 1864 </p>
<p class="p10">On Picket near Mountain Run, </p>
<p class="p10">Dear John, </p>
<p class="p10">I wrote while in Washington, but neglected posting my letter till I arrived at
                    camp. I overtook Col. Dale in Washington, and we
                    both went to Brandy Station together on Tuesday. Our camp is about four miles
                    from the station. The boys were rejoiced to see us, and the regiment begins to
                    assume the appearance of a complete organization. Recruits are arriving daily;
                    and I fear we will be compelled to move before we are quite ready. I remember
                    seeing the 116<sup>th</sup> at Chancellorsville. It was the regiment
                    that dropped their muskets there to save a battery, when nearly all its horses
                    had been killed. The boys dragged out the guns by ropes; and I remember how we
                    cheered them as they passed us. We have a jolly set of Irishmen in our brigade.
                        I<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> have a detachment of the 88<sup>th</sup> &amp;
                        69<sup>th</sup> N.Y. under my control on picket, and their
                    conversation is amusing. They are very friendly, and if any of them <u>draws</u> a canteen of milk, I must have my share of it.
                    Yesterday afternoon and last night Rebel pickets were seen a short distance in
                    front of our posts; but they have not attempted to molest us yet. We have had
                    most beautiful weather for the past few days; and so far as the condition of the
                    roads is concerned there is nothing to prevent an advance of the army at any
                    time. Bob is well and is getting along first rate. I haven't got my company
                    organized yet, I was only one day in camp before being ordered on picket; but I
                    will have things fixed as soon as we return. All my men have not yet joined the
                    regiment. I have distributed what postage stamps I had to others who needed
                    them, and want you to send me a supply. I promised Mary Jane to go out to Your
                    house before I left; but as my departure was sooner than I expected I couldn't
                    go...I looked for Bob as we passed Manassas junction but did not see him.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my love to all at home </p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate Brother </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Sam </i></p>
<p class="p10">Apr. 25<sup>th</sup> We returned from picket yesterday, and have been issuing ammunition
                        and making other preparations. All well so far. I wish you would get my
                        "Oriental Glee and Anthem Book" from Mr. Sherratt and send it by mail. Also
                        a copy of "Columbia's Guardian Angels." The latter you can get at Mellon's,
                        or if they haven't a supply yet Mr. Sherratt has a copy he doesn't use. Your
                        Affectionate brother, Sam </p>
