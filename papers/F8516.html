<h4>Franklin County: Jonnie G. Ross to Edward McPherson,
                    January 5, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In writing to Edward McPherson, Jonnie G. Ross requests help in recovering family
                    birth, death and marriage dates for a damaged family bible. Ross also expresses
                    his concern that politics distract from "spiritual things."</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Edward,</p>
<p class="p10">I expect you will be astonished to see my hand-writing once more, but as I am in a little trouble, I hope you can
                    help me out. I wanted to give Father a little surprise at Christmas, by having a
                    new binding put on his Father's family Bible as it had needed it for some years,
                    So accordingly sent it to Baltimore to have it done. They returned it very
                    neatly finished to all appearances but on opening it we found they had cut the
                    leaves to make them even and cut off nearly all the dates of the <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    deaths and births; of course I was very sorry and told Father that I would write
                    to you to see if there was not a family record at your house and if so I knew
                    you would copy it for me with pleasure.</p>
<p class="p10">We have all been suffering from wretched colds and Mother and Father are still
                    quite indisposed. I have not seen them at Dr. Tyler's for a week or two; but
                    they have had a very sick family for three months past.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not know whether to congratulate you upon your election or not. It seems to
                    me the deeper we become entangled in temporal things the more we are drawn away
                    from spiritual things, and particularly when a gentleman finds himself a
                    politician the world seems to <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>
                    beare a net a trials and temptations around him, from
                    which it seems almost impossible that he can escape; but I trust that where ever you be or in whatever situation you may be
                    placed a kind protecting Providence may follow you, whose guardianship you may
                    never forget to own.</p>
<p class="p10">Mother, Father and Fanny join me in love to your Mother, whose health I hope is
                    better and much to yourself. </p>
<p class="p10">
                        Yrs
                        Affect.
