<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">Received your letter by Billie Fulton yesterday morning and was glad to hear that you were
     well and enjoying yourself. We are all well at present, though ma was right sick yesterday with
     headache but is pretty well again Bil Fulton got home Wednesday night about two o'clock and I
     have no doubt would surprise them all considerably next morning to step down stairs to breakfast. I do not know when he intends to go out<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Smiley58b.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley58b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      the caves I suppose not, until <u>General
     Echard</u> goes back to work. Mr Echard has made the wonderful amount of seventy-five pounds
     of salt petre. Dont you think there is danger of his getting sick at
     that work &amp; Mrs Kerr had her shoulder put out of place the a few nights ago pa had to
     go after the doctor and help to put it right again. but they could scarcely get it in place
     again. Grovy would not go until morning for the doctor he wanted to dream about the pleasant
     ending of his havest that is about his bottle. Pa finished his
     harvest last Monday he had no help <i>[deleted: after]</i> but Jackey one day &amp; Mr
     York &amp; Billie one He could scarcely get done for people got to coming to mill and he
     had <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/Smiley58c.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley58c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     to grind some by the way some have brought some grain for him to
     grind that have not been patronizing his mill for some time. He had some one hundred &amp;
     thirty dozen of wheat and about seventy of rye. He has not had any of his grass cut yet. Things
     are going on in just about the same old humdrum sort of way nothing of interest transpiring in
     the neighborhood. Capt McHenry was still improving the last I
     heard and thought he would be able to come home the last of this week. I suppose Bess Kerr will
     feel considerably elated on account of his promotion. We have not received the letter you sent
     by mail yet had we not received one by hand we would have been wondering pretty considerably by
     this time<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="images/Smiley58d.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley58d.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      We have got a little black boy here of Mr Steele's he is some 9 or
     10 years of age We find him mischievious enough too. I don't know how some people stand them.
     As I have nothing interesting I must close I dont know where to direct
     to for this reason. Mrs Kerr has just sent a letter down and says her last was sent to staunton
     and is certain that it was not received. </p>
<p class="p10">Dont forget to write soon and often I remain as ever your affectionate sister</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Mary</i></p>
<p class="p10">I suppose that the boys have nearly all got In by this time I expect
      John Beard will feel sort of flat if they say any thing to him
      about staying so long after orders back </p>
