                    <salute>Dear John </salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Your favor containing postage stamps came to hand a few days ago. I found use for
                    the stamps and am very much obliged to you for them. Both money and stamps have
                    been very scarce with us and the former likely to be scarce for a few days yet.
                    I would not have known what to do at different times, had it not been for Sam
                    Harper. The first time I visited the 139<hi rend="super">th</hi> I had been paid
                    off a few days previous and Sam after enquiring how I was <unclear>
                        <orig reg="off">off</orig>
                    </unclear> for money gave me $10. Before marching to White Plains, I met him
                        again<pb n="2"/> and hearing that we had not yet been paid off he insisted
                    on me taking $10 more. Still, when in camp and the Commissary is in blast we can
                    manage to get enough to eat. I do think though that they are not treating our
                    Brigade right. The latest report is that the Paymaster will not be up for twenty
                    days yet at the expiration of which time, there will be none of our men but will
                    have <hi rend="underline">seven</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">months</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">pay</hi> due then, and a great many will have <hi
                        rend="underline">nine</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">months</hi> coming but the probability is we will only
                    receive <hi rend="underline">four</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">months</hi> pay; and then every thing in this country
                    purchased outside the Commissary costs at lowest mark about three<pb n="3"/>
                    what you would pay for it any place north of the Potomac. Well I suppose it will
                    be all right some day. I have not yet heard from the 123<hi rend="super">d</hi>
                    if I knew exactly where they were I would go over.</p>

                <p>It has been remarkably fine weather here until this morning when rain set in and
                    promises to continue. I received for <orig reg="today's">to days</orig> mail
                    Dispatch of the 7<hi rend="super">th</hi>. Also letters Sally &amp; Lizzie.
                    Will answer them soon. My love to all the folks.</p>
