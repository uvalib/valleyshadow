<h4>Augusta: John Z. H. Rawlings to Alexander Brown,
                    August 10, 1860<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>John Z. H. Rawlings describes a recent trip to Staunton in this letter to
                    Alexander Brown, a fellow student at the University of Virginia. During his
                    visit, Rawlings accidentally jumped out of a window at a party and injured his
                    leg. In addition to staying at the Cochran residence, Rawlings spent time at
                    Variety Springs with a hotel keeper he calls Mr. Burrell but who appears in the
                    Census as Charles Burress. Rawlings closes his letter by commanding his friend
                    to attend the Democratic Convention.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Sandy,</p>
<p class="p10">As I am confined to the house all the time, except before breakfast and after
                    sundown, by Drs Davis &amp; Randolph, I'll
                    occupy myself in writing to you.</p>
<p class="p10">I went over to Stanton soon after you left here, and
                    stayed with Mr Burrell a while, riding about in Augusta, we<i>[deleted: s]</i> stayed at Mr Jimmy Cochran's where George was <i>[added: 1 night]</i>, there was a crowd of Girls there playing on
                    the piano, right up by the door; I was by the window, and wanted to get out doors where the men w<i>[deleted: as]</i><i>[added: ere]</i>, without going by the girls, I thought we
                    were on the first floor, so I jumped out of the window, but when I got to the
                    ground I found out I had jumped two stories and <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> hurt my leg so I
                    could hardly walk. I went to another party, at Mr. Christians', where they
                    played Blind-Billy-Buff and blindfolded me most every time. I went to Variety
                    Springs where I saw <i>[deleted: M]</i> a lady looked like Miss Polly
                    Goodman's grandmother.</p>
<p class="p10">I stayed about three weeks in and about Staunton, when my health grew so bad that
                    I had to come home and put myself under the Doctors
                    charge.</p>
<p class="p10">I have to bathe my feet in some sort of acid every night; it is so strong that I
                    got a little on my finder the other day and it has ate all the skin off</p>
<p class="p10">I have to take medicine three times a day. Billy Abell has gone to Dubique, Iowa.
                    Frank Meade has gone to Clarke and there aint but four
                    boys in town Malcolm, Jimmy Davis, Jimmy Rawlings, and Otho Reyne.</p>
<p class="p10">Ten of the old boys and the two Slinks are going to Berkley.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> I wont go to school next year. I dont know yet what I'll do. Old Clay is well and sends
                    his love to all enquirinig friends. Write soon and
                    let me know whether you are <i>[deleted: g]</i> coming down here to school
                    next session. You had better come down to the Democratic Conventiaon, and stay
                    with,</p>
