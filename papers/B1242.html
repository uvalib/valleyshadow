<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Horace Neide to J. M.
                    Schofield, August 20, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Neide submits an inspection report of the 7th and 8th Districts. At this time,
                    Augusta County was a part of the 7th District, and such portions of Neide's
                    report are transcribed here. His remarks concern the ability of blacks to find
                    justice in the local courts, the registration of marriages, and the general
                    abilities of George Cook, the agent.</p>

<p class="p10">Aug. 20th 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Richmond</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit the following report, upon the General condition of
                    Bureau affairs in the 7th and 8th Dists Department
                    of Va. (as late constituted) made in conformity to
                    Special Orders no. 121 C.S. Bureau R.F. and A.L.
                    Headquarters Asst Comr
                    Dept of Va. dated
                    August 4th 1866.</p>
<p class="p10">. . .</p>
<p class="p10">. . .</p>
<p class="p10">Counties of <u>Augusta</u>, <u>Highland</u>
                    &amp; <u>Bath</u>.<br> These counties constitute a sub
                    district under charge of <u>Lieut.
                        G. T. Cook</u>
                    V.R.C. as Asst. Supt.. The freedmen are
                    generally engaged at labor but do not appear to be in a prosperous or contented
                    position.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Lt. Cook</u> makes grave
                    complaints against the local magistrates for their utter indifference and
                    inattention to the complaints of the freedmen, who come before them, especially
                    where such complaints are made against whites. Reports of outrages are frequent,
                    and almost invariably the freedmen are the sufferers, with but little if any
                    chance of redress. When the attention of the magistrates is <u>specially</u> called to a case, and it is at the same time intimated <br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br>to them by <u>Lieut. Cook</u> that any refusal or delay on their part to act
                    promptly in the matter, will necessitate a reference of the matter to the Asst. Commissioner, they will act, but generally
                    their action amounts to nothing more than to bind both parties over to keep the
                    peace, the innocent with the guilty, the aggressor with the victim. <u>Lieut. Cook</u> does
                    however, report <u>one instance</u> in which the magistrates
                    protected an outraged freed-girl and bound some white citizens over to answer to
                    the grand-jury for a gross assault upon her. Justice to freedmen is however
                    here, the exception and not the rule.</p>
<p class="p10">Circular No. 7 Bureau RF
                        &amp; AL
                    <i>[added: Washington]</i> DC. <i>[unclear: I]</i> inquired
                    of <u>Lt. Cook</u> as to what
                    inquiry the Freedmen were making in the matter of Lands in certain states
                    offered to them by the provisions of the Act of Congress approved June 21st 1866
                    and in regard to which information has been <i>[unclear: promulgated]</i> in
                    Circular No 7 Headquarters Commissioner Bureau R.F. and A.L. and in
                    reply he informed me that he had not received the circular and knew nothing of
                    its provisions.</p>
<p class="p10">Marriage register<br> The registry for the county of Augusta had been completed,
                    before the arrival of the blanks distributed for that purpose. I examined it and
                    found it complete with <br><br>[<i>page 12</i>]<br>the exception that it did not furnish the
                    names of the former owners of either husband or wife. The Asst Superintendent was convinced that it would be
                    impossible even to get the Freedmen together again, for the purpose of
                    completing the record and in consequence, I directed him to copy his present
                    registry numerically upon the blanks, <i>[unclear: trusting]</i> to time and
                    opportunity to make it gradually more complete. The calling of these people
                    together for the purpose of registry has had an excellent and noticeable effect
                    upon them, especially in imbuing them with a greater respect for the marriage
                    relation that they have heretofore had.</p>
<p class="p10">Support of Destitutes<br> The county authorities of Augusta county have made
                    proper arrangements for the support of the poor, and expect and intend to
                    provide for all "freedmen paupers" who are properly thrown upon them. In
                    Highland and Bath counties similar provision has been made.</p>
<p class="p10">So far as Bath County is concerned, it has been but lately added to this sub
                    district: and the officer in charge has as yet had no opportunity of examining
                    into the condition of the freedmen therein. The slave population of the county
                    in 1860, was but small, while in Higland County it was still less.</p>
<p class="p10">The official records of this office are in good condition, books are well kept,
                    so far as furnished, and all orders, letters &amp;c properly filed. <u>Lieut. Cook</u> appears to
                    be a competent officer and successful in the discharge of his duties.</p>
<p class="p10">. . .</p>
<p class="p10">. . .</p>
<p class="p10">In this as in the 7th I found such of the officers as I said men of more than
                    average ability and discretion.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>H. Niede<br>Lt. Col. V.R.C. and Bvt. Brig. Genl
