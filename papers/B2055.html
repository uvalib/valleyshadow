<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Amelia Mead to R. M.
                    Manly, November 11, 1869<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Mead, a teacher in Staunton, asks Manly for advice on where they should request
                    funds to build an additional room on their school building, and to equip it with
                    supplies. Mead reports an ever-growing number of students.</p>

<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">We received the school registers last evening. You are aware I suppose of the
                    condition of the Freedmen in Staunton. Also of the inconveniences of our
                    school-room. It is now so crowded that we feel obliged to have another room. So
                    I wished to acknowledge the receipt of the registers I thought at the same <i>[added: time]</i> I would ask you to whom we should look
                    for the money to pay for the room. We shall also be obliged to have some desks
                    for it. Can you inform us <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>where we can get them. We have now one
                    hundred and <i>[unclear: fifty]</i> day scholars and nearly that number of
                    night scholars with new members coming in every day. If you can give us a little
                    advice and information we shall be much obliged. I would <i>[added: like]</i> to know also where and at what price a set of maps
                    can be obtained.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Amelia Mead<br>Box 73<br>Staunton Va.</i></p>
