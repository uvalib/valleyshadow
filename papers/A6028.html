<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">As it has been almost three weeks since I wrote to you I will try and write a few lines to
     you this <i>[unclear: morning]</i> to let you know that I am well and getting along pretty
     well considering the hardships we have had to go through with since the commencement of the
     present year We left camp Stephenson on New year's day and since that we have been almost
     constantly on the march and when night came we had to lay down without our tents in the snow
     and rain We marched to Bath the County seat of morgan and was five days in getting there. The
     first snow we have seen this winter fell on us the third night while we were laying on the side
     of one of Morgans Numerous mountains<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Smiley1b.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley1b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
    And after that we marched on a solid sheet of ice the wagons  runing on theroad packed down the snow and
     it got so icy a person could hardly stand on his feet the horses falling down wagons sliding
     off the road and breaking to pieces there was several men slipped down and broke their legs and
     arms there was a great many horses killed and crippled not so many in our brigade but in those
     that came from Western Virginia they are weak and poor and can not stand much hardship we drove
     the enemy out of Bath took 24 prisoners killed and wounded 8 or ten took their comissary stores &amp;c we got about 6-or 8000 dollars worth of
     property our success would have been much greater had it not<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/Smiley1c.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley1c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     been for some militia we had along with us 2 regiments of them run
     from some 25 Yankees and their general in the first place disobeyed orders throwing the whole
     plan wrong he has <i>[deleted: been]</i> been placed under arrest by Gen Jackson. If the
     Militia had done right we would have captured the whole <i>[deleted: plac]</i> force baggage
     and every thing they had and made a complete disaster to the enemy We are camped at the cross
     roads where we can go to four different places we do not know where we are going to some thinks
     we are going to romney and some to Martinsburg-while others suppose we are going to Winchester
     we will probably take winter quarters when we get back if the weather is very rough<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="images/Smiley1d.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley1d.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     you say to let you know whether I want a pair of over socks I do
     not know that I want them as I have not wore the other ones any yet my boots are most too tight
     with them on Tell pa that he need not be uneasy about my enlisting for the war as I have not
     had any idea of it yet there is a bill up in Congress now for the purpose of keeping the twelve
     month volunteers in service during the whole war but I do not know whether it has passed or not
     our regiment are all wanting to go home when their term expires as they do not like their
     officers but I must close as my paper is out Write soon</p>
<p class="p10">nothing more at present but remain your brother</p>
