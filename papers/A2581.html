<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">July 27th., 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Allen. Near Gordonsville, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Brother:</p>
<p class="p10">I have been thinking of writing to you for some time, but I have been very busy, have not had
     any spare time and so have neglected this duty. Sara tells me that you came in and found us
     gone,- Much disgruntled as the Major would say, and I was much put out too, to have to strike
     out on such short notice, and without coming home; but our order came in the night and said
     that we must come on at once, and not knowing but some important movement might be on hand we
     put out as soon as possible; but the army is here to recruit, get fired up, clothed, paid,
     etc., etc., preparatory to some move. We are in a very fine country, only we can't get much to
     eat. There are too many of us here: we are now in a mess of four, dividing the expenses. I want
     you to get a barrel and fill it with potatoes and onions, no matter what they cost if you have
     to buy them, and put them in a barrel, with a jar of butter that Sara will fix up, and a loaf
     or two of bread, nothing more, and send it to Staunton and by express to me to Gordonsville,
     care of Major Kearsly, and send me a bill of the expenses and I will send it back. The things
     we must and will have. The enemy is not far off, and we thought they were going to come and
     fight yesterday, but they went back again, so we settled in the same old place 3 1/2 miles east
     of Gordonsville. The corn here looks finely.</p>
<p class="p10"> The rains are plentiful. My love to all. It is church time, and the General has gone so I
     must close. Write to me.</p>
<p class="p10"> Please attend to the eating very soon, for I am very hungry for something to eat. </p>
<p class="p10">Your aff.bro.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
