<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Moffett Brooks writes that enemy fears of
Stonewall Jackson's forces can explain why Staunton has not been invaded.

</p>
<p class="p10">Near New Market</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Aunt,</p>
<p class="p10">
We received a <br>
letter from home yesterday <br>
one from aunt Clem
<i>[added: and]</i> one <br>
from Bet<a href="#n2">[2]</a>,
so we had quite <br>
a reading, we had looked <br>
for them for several days <br>
before they came to hand.  <br>
The one from home was quite <br>
a family one the, kind I like <br>
only wish they would come a <br>
little oftener, was
 glad to hear <br>
you were all as well as usual. <br>
There is no news in camp <br>
of importance,  the enemy are <br>
still quiet &amp; I hope they will <br>
stay so until we get our <br>
army better organized, they <br>
are reported to have a large <br>
force between 20 &amp; 25 thousand <br>
but I think that is too

<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Bro2d144.jpg"><center><img src="images/Bro2d144.gif"></center></a><br><br>

large for if they had that <br>
number they would not <br>
have any difficulty in march <br>
ing right on to
Staunton, but <br>
I think they are afraid of <br>
Jackson,
  I wish he could <br>
get a sufficient force to drive <br>
them back for it will never do <br>
for them to get possession of <br>
this rich &amp; beautiful
valley there <br>
is sill a great deal of corn out <br>
in the fields yet which we <br>
ought to have for will ne<i>[added: e]</i>d it <br>
after while.  We are still at Parson <br>
Rude's 5 miles below
New Market <br>
on the fine Steinberger Farm. <br>
I tell you it is the finest <br>
farm I ever saw the land <br>
nearly as level as a floor. <br>
We have two houses to stay in <br>
&amp; plenty to eat so you see <br>
we are getting along finely.<a href="#n3">[3]</a>

<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/Bro2d145.jpg"><center><img src="images/Bro2d145.gif"></center></a><br><br>

I do not know what our force <br>
is not more than 6 or 8 thou <br>
sand.  I am afraid we will have <br>
to fall back farther.  Our compa <br>
ny was filled up yesterday with <br>
the Rockbridge Malitia 52 in <br>
number they are very nice men
  <br>
Charly McClung<a href="#n4">[4]</a>
 is among the <br>
number a very pleasant man<br>
we scraped up kin but I do <br>
not know how much,  I expect <br>
he is all you know any thing <br>
about,  we had an election <br>
of officers this morning <br>
which resulted in the election <br>
of 
Hue White
Captain
Strickler <br>
First Lieut,
 Sam Lile
2nd <br>
&amp; James Culton
3d one of the <br>
malitia<a href="#n5">[5]</a>
 I think they will <br>
make very good officers <br>
but I am in hopes by June <br>
we will have our Captain <br>

<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="images/Bro2d146.jpg"><center><img src="images/Bro2d146.gif"></center></a><br><br>

back by that time<a href="#n6">[6]</a> if all reports <br>
are true about the late fight <br>
in Mississippi but I am afraid <br>
there is some mistake about <br>
it I have no doubt we get a <br>
great many prisoners but I don't <br>
like the thought of falling back <br>
again and I regret the loss of <br>

Gen Johnson for I think he <br>
was an excellent
officer,  we get <br>
no papers and cannot get the <br>
particulars but I am in hopes <br>
we have defeated them badly <br>
though our loss is very heavy <br>
now is the time for the South to <br>
act if we delay, now we are <br>
gone but I will never give <br>
up as long as there is a ray of <br>
hope,  I don't believe there is <br>
any chance for them to whip us.
<br>
We are both very well.  I like <br>
the service very well though it is <br>
right hard but I think every one that <br>
can go ought to.  Give my respect to <br>
aunt Elvira
 and to every
body write soon <br>
for it takes letters so long to come. love
to <br>
you and all the rest. </p>

<p class="p11"><b>Notes</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> Although Moffett did not include the year
in writing the date, we have
determined that he authored this letter in
1862, since he enlisted on March 27. 1862 and died on June 29, 1862.
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a> Aunt Clem, or Clemenza Stuart, lived next to the Brooks and
was married to Benjamin Stuart, the brother of Moffett's mother Eleanor
Stuart Brooks.  In the 1860 Census of Augusta County, she is listed
as being thirty years old.  "Bet" most likely refers to Betsy Brooks, who
appears in the 1860 Census of Augusta County as a twenty-nine
year-old living with Silas and Apatia Brooks.
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> Moffett wrote this letter three weeks after
the Confederates' March 23 defeat at Kernstown.
The battle significantly weakened the Stonewall Brigade,
since of its 1,418 soldiers,
343 were either killed, wounded, or missing.
After the battle, Jackson commanded
his troops to retreat to Rude's Hill, which is near
New Market (Robertson, <i>The Stonewall
Brigade</i>, 70-78, 82).  Moffett's confusion about the strength
of the Federal forces was common.  As James Robertson reports,
"The men in the ranks were aware that Federals in great strength
were pouring through the Valley, but knew little else of the military
situation" (<i>The Stonewall Brigade</i>, 84).  Unbeknownst
to Moffett and his comrades, in Harrisonburg, Virginia, Union General Banks
and his force of 19,000 soldiers were waiting to
attack Jackson.

</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> C. B. "Charly" McClung became a member of the 4th Virginia
Infantry, Company I
on April
12, 1862 and was discharged on April 17, 1862 (Robertson, <i>4th
Virginia Infantry</i>, 62).
</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n5">[5]</a>In April of 1862, the Confederate army was
reorganized as a result of the Conscription Act, which extended the
enlistments of those already in the army indefinitely and made
provisions for drafting men not yet in the service.  The Act also
allowed soliders to elect their own field officers.  As Moffett reports,
Company I of the 4th Virginia elected Hugh White as its captain, Givens
Brown Strickler as lieutenant (here Moffett's information conflicts with
Robertson's, who writes in <i>4th Virginia Infantry</i> that Strickler
was chosen as a <u>second</u> lieutenant in April of 1862), Samuel
Harrison Lyle as second lieutenant, James B. Culton, who had just
enlisted, as third lieutenant (Robertson, <i>4th Virginia Infantry</i>
80, 75, 62, 47).<b>Hugh Augustus White</b> (1840-1862), whose brother James
was Company I's first captain, enlisted in the 4th Virginia Infantry
while a student at Washington College. Prior to being elected captain,
White was appointed a sergeant on September 13, 1861.  Surprised that he
was elected captain, Hugh White accepted the position with a great sense
of responsibility.  As he wrote to his brother Henry, "Promotion in
itself brings neither peace nor happiness, and unless it increases one's
usefulness it is a curse.  An opportunity is now afforded for exercising
a wider influence for good, and if enabled to improve this aright I
shall then be happier than before" (quoted by Bean, 111).  White was
killed on August 30, 1862 at Second Manassas (Robertson, <i>4th Virginia
Infantry</i>, 80).Like White, <b>Givens B. Strickler</b> (1840-1913) enlisted
in Company I of the 4th Virginia while a student at Washington College.
He was promoted to corporal on June 30, 1861, to first sergeant on
September 13, 1861, and to Captain on August 30, 1862.  He was captured
on July 3, 1863 at Gettysburg, and was imprisoned at Johnson's Island
Prison until he wa exchanged on March 14, 1865 (Robertson, <i>4th
Virginia Infantry</i>, 75).<b>Samuel Lyle</b>
(1840-1898) was a student at Washington College when he enlisted in June
of 1861.  He was appointed sergeant on September 13, 1861; promoted to
First Lieutenant on August 30, 1862; slightly wounded on November 27,
1863; captured May 12, 1864 at Spotsyvania; and paroled at Fort Deleware
Prison on June 15, 1865.  He is buried at Timber Ridge Presbyterian
Church in Rockbridge County (Robertson, <i>4th Virginia Infantry</i>,
62).The only officer elected who was not formerly a student at
Washington College, <b>James B. Culton</b> was elected
third lieutenant when he enlisted on April 12, 1862. He was promoted to Second
Lieutenant on August 20, 1862 and and resigned from service on March 16,
1863 (Robertson 47).</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n6">[6]</a> Captain Henry Morrison of Company I was captured at
the battle of Kernstown on March 23, 1862.  He was not exchanged until
August 5, 1862. </p>
