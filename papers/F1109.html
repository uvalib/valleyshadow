<p class="p10">October 28, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Baltimore</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father:</p>
<p class="p10">This morning I seat myself with pen in hand to inform you that I am well-Happing that these few lines may find you all enjoying
                    the same blessing of health that I enjoy at present.</p>
<p class="p10">I left Carlisle yesterday evening. We landed here this morning. This afternoon at
                        3:00o'clock we leave for Washington and I
                    expect we go on to Warrenton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">We will joine
                    Capt Patterson's Company-148 Regt.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, Father, I feel satisfied that I am doing the will of God. I feel glad that
                    I could so willingly yield to the will of God. I know that God is able to
                    deliver me safe and if I should fall in the field of Battle. I am glad to know
                    that God will save me forever in Heaven. I know that he that promised is
                    faithful and cannot lie.</p>
<p class="p10">I take God at His Word. That if our conscious condemns us not not. Neither will
                    he as he is greater than our conscious.</p>
<p class="p10">For instance you will aske me how I know this. I answer
                    that I feel my acceptance with God. Yes, Father, I can say-Glory to God for the
                    hope of Eternal Life.</p>
<p class="p10">I fear no gun or cannon. My faith is strong in the Lord. If I fall I will fall in
                    the arms of the Lord. If I should never see you on earth, Father and the family
                    all, Try and meet me in Heaven where there will be no pain-where our eyes shall
                    run down no more with tears, where the wicked cease from trowbling and the weary are forever at rest.</p>
<p class="p10">Oh, the glorious thought of eternity and enjoying heaven as a home while eternity
                    remains.</p>
<p class="p10">Now, Father, will you all-the family-promise to meet me in Heaven. Give my
                    respects to all enquiring friends and take good
                    care of Rachel and the two little babes and you shall be rewarded for it.</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote you a letter last week. I hope that you received it and I Must close as I
                    have not much time.</p>
<p class="p10">I will write soon again. I have no importance to write at present. You may direct
                    your letter.<br> Franklin Rosenbery<br> 148 Regt<br> 2nd Army Corps<br> I shall close for the present. After I get
                    to my company, I will give you a whole history.</p>
<p class="p10">So fare well for this time<br> Yours Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>F. Rosenbery</i></p>
