<p class="p10">Dear Cousin Annie</p>
<p class="p10"> Your kind letter dated Aug 5<sup>th</sup>
                    was received the 16<sup>th</sup> and believe one was read with great
                    interest. Would have answered immediately, but was expecting to leave every day,
                    consequently I thought to defer writing untill I
                    arrived at my destination. We were landed here on the 7<sup>th</sup>
                    <i>[unclear: inst]</i> having been on board the "Steamer
                    C<i>[unclear: rescent]</i>" 19 days, had a pretty hard time I tell you. Our
                    position at present is between Fort's Gregg &amp; <i>[unclear: Wagner]</i>
                    which could be made very uncomfortable to us, but so far has not. Hope the time
                    is not far distant when in the providence of God I may see you all again.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Please remember affectionately to all my friends and relatives, and
                    believe me as ever your devoted Cousin</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>S.F. Carson</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S.<br> I am well at present, but was quite sick on
                        board the boat for a short time, the rest of the 600 are generally
                    well</p>
