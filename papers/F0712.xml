 <p>I have poor facilities for   
 <orig reg="writing">wri<lb/>

 You will therefore<lb/>   
 excuse this roughly gotten up thing.  I was ever so<lb/>  
 glad to hear from you and read your interesting <orig reg="letter">let-<lb/>  
 ter</orig>, moreover that you were   
 successful in getting<lb/>   
 the same old school to teach again. I  
 hope your <orig reg="reputation">reputa<lb/>

 to keep me posted in school affairs,   
 for although I am now<lb/>   
 a military man, I still take great interest in <orig reg="educational">  
 education-<lb/>  
 al</orig> subjects. I suppose you've heard of our battle. Our  
 brigade<lb/>  
 however was not engaged, still we performed some exploits<lb/>   
 of which I must tell you.

 fighting was<lb/>   
 over the rebels as usual poured in upon Banks in   
 <orig reg="overpowering">overpow<lb/>

 (<name type="person">McDowell's</name>) corps was<lb/>  
 not ordered up in time I cannot tell. The rebels were<lb/>   
 retreating however when <name type="person">  
 <orig reg="Banks's">Banks</orig></name> men were  
 ordered to halt<lb/>   
 because he had not men enough to follow up what  
 <orig reg="otherwise">other<lb/>  
 wise</orig> would have proved a glorious victory. The papers<lb/>   
 will give you the particulars better than I can state them here.<lb/>  
 When we neared the battlefield late in the evening we<lb/>   
 met lots of our own wounded returning to   
 <name type="place">Culpepper</name>, where,<lb/>  
 our Chaplain told us the citizens treated them very kindly,<lb/>   
 the women assisting in dressing their wounds. We had<lb/>   
 been listening to the roar of artillery and could see the smoke<lb/>   
 of the battle all P.M. of Saturday, from our camp 1 mile south<lb/>   
 of <del hand="h1">the battle</del><add hand="h1" place="supralinear"><name type="place">

 and when we saw the wounded, we felt like<lb/>   
 taking revenge. When we came within a mile and a half<lb/>

 of the battle ground, our brigade was halted; our regiment<lb/>   
 received its mail here, and we fell to reading  
 letters by <orig reg="candlelight">can<lb/>  
 dlelight</orig>; this drew the fire of a rebel battery, and  
 some half<lb/>   
 dozen solid shot fell right in among us, wounding four<lb/>   
 men of our regiment. One ball fell about three yards from where<lb/>   
 I stood, we stood this like heroes for a short time, then we<lb/>   
 were ordered back a short distance, but advanced again   
 <orig reg="until"><lb/>  
 til</orig> we came within 300 yards of  
 the same battery which was<lb/>   
 firing upon us, and  which with several others,  
 had opened<lb/>   
 out again with the purpose of ascertaining our position  
 as<lb/>  
 well as of the rest of the large number of   
 <name type="person">McDowell's</name> corps<lb/>  
 which had silently advance under cover of the dark, but they<lb/>   
 fired far above our  
 heads, and we lay listening to the loud<lb/>   
 and crashing roar of the dogs  
 of war in perfect safety. <orig reg="Presently">present-<lb/>

 back although in good order.  Next morning we found two<lb/>   
 dismounted guns, 9 dead horses, and two   
 <abbr expan="Lieutenants">Lieuts.</abbr> killed, one<lb/>  
 having his head shot off.  If we had not did this, they<lb/>   
 would have continued to kill us, while their infantry would<lb/>   
 have advanced, and perhaps have proved too strong<lb/>   
 for us then, as our main force only came in the next day.<lb/>
