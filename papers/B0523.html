<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Sept 29t 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit for your revision the following case with my action
                    upon it.</p>
<p class="p10">James Hamilton, colored, says he was a free man living in Hancock Md before the war -- was free-born -- He was
                    captured by the rebels while driving a team in the service of the Government
                    somewhere between Winfield and Cumberland, and taken to Harrisonburg, Rockingham
                        Co, Va, where he was put in Jail and
                    kept there four (4) months. In May 1864 he was sold to Mr. Wm. J. Shumate and by him taken to Staunton Va where he was kept in Jail (1) one month. When Genl. Hunter came along and Shumate took him out of
                    Jail Handcuffed and kept him so (4) four days and nights. He lived with and
                    worked for Shumate during one year leaving his service about the last of May
                    1865.</p>
<p class="p10">I sent for Mr. Shumate who appeared and substantiated the main points of
                    Hamilton's statements.</p>
<p class="p10">Shumate said he bought Hamilton of Mr. Trick, Jailer, in Harrisonburgh for 505, or 510 dollars. He was sold as he understood
                    by order of <i>[unclear: Court]</i>. Did not see the order knew that he
                    Hamilton claimed to be free, and that some one in Md had answered to Jailer's
                    letter to that effect. Knew also that he was a prisoner of war.</p>
<p class="p10">Afterwards brought to me the bill of sale, of which the following is a true
                    copy.<br> "Rec'd of William Shumate - five
                    hundred Dollars it being in full for the purchase of a Negro man named James
                    Hamilton aged about 30 years. The write and title of
                    which man I sell for the term of twenty years, at which he is free unless some
                    one claiming proves a write to him as property. Witness
                    my hand and seal this the 4th May 1864."<br>Sigd
                    Peter Trick (seal)</p>
<p class="p10">Upon the facts as they thus appear and in the view of the fact that this Shumate
                    was a trader in doubtful "property" of that kind, and considering that Hamilton
                    would probably have been released as were the other prisoners in Harrisonburg
                    Jail by the troops under Genl Hunter had not
                    Shumate gone there and speculated in him, I decided that Shumate should pay
                    Hamilton thirty (30) dollars per month (Hamiltons wages for one (1) year. He
                    demured and thought Irick, if anybody, should pay and wished me to see Irick,
                    which I did, but he is a poor, infirm old man who can recollect nothing except
                    that he sold Hamilton to Shumate for Jail Fees by order of
                    <i>[unclear: Court]</i> - the records of which have been destroyed.</p>
<p class="p10">He claims to have been a "Union Man" but was old and could only do as he was bid.
                    I also submit without comment a letter from Shumate's attorney Mr. John B.
                    Baldwin, and repsectfully ask Instructions,</p>
