<p class="p10">November 15th 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Campt Near Winchester V<sup>a</sup></p>
<p class="p10"><u>Dearest</u> Kate,</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your letter a fiew
                    days since. and it was with pleasure to me to open it &amp; peruse over its
                    contents. It was with sorrow that I read of the death of Miss Kate Hall
                    &amp; Miss Sarah M<sup>c</sup>Cadden but our loss is thare eternal gain. Miss Kate was my most intimate friend
                    while I lived in Greenville. I saw a piece in the Newspaper Composed about Miss
                    Kate I Judged that Mr. Monroe was its auther, it was a
                    very good piece. Your Brother John has been sick for three or four days
                    &amp; has gon to the hospital in Winchester. I hope
                    he may soon recover his former health. I think he is taking the fever. Your
                    Cousin Abe has been complaining for some time past, but looks harty at present. Brother John has returned from the hospital, he
                    was sent to Richmond, I was very glad to see him as I could'nt hear from him he had the Typhoid fever &amp; looks
                    quite thin yet he has not reported for duty yet. I got a pass to go to
                    Winchester the other day evry thing is very <i>[deleted: ]</i> The town <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> is not crowded like it was in the spring.</p>
<p class="p10">I will try &amp; give you a short account of our march to the Valley. Our
                    Company was on piket that morning had very little or
                    nothing to eat; we recieved orders about ten oclock A.M. to pack up &amp; march to camp a
                    distance of two miles when we got thare
                    evry thing was packed up &amp; ready to march. We
                    had to carry our plankets &amp; overcoats. The
                        regaments was formed at half past twelve
                    &amp; took up the line of march at one oclock. We
                    got to Manassas about five o'clock &amp; rested thare a while, then marched to the Junction &amp; loaded our bagage on the cars. We did'nt
                    get started before nine we ware packed in the cars like
                    cattle we had no seats but the bagage, and those on
                    top of the cars ware
                    exsposed to the cold &amp; Sam one of Capt Roberts men fell of the
                    cars &amp; was brused so that he died next
                    morning it was said that he was drunk &amp; walked of
                    the top of the cars, we got to Strawsburg about
                    daylight unloaded our bagage cooked of our breakfasts
                    &amp; started for Winchester it rained hard all day. I do believe that one
                        forth of the regament
                    ware drunk we had gotten in about three quarters of a
                    mile of Winchester when we recieved orders to turn
                    round &amp; go a mile &amp; camp <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; officers
                    refused to obey <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> the order, the Colonel swore he would be obeyed
                    &amp; drew his soard &amp; ordered his Brother
                    to foward his Comp, but
                    he would not move so the Colonel ordered him under arrest &amp; told Simbs to take the Command of the Comp &amp; the Lieut. refused to
                    obey the order. Capt Harman then went out and
                    talked to the Col. he had understood that we had to
                    go back to Newtown a distance of five miles. As soon as he learned better he
                    ordered his comp to moove
                    of, &amp; the regament
                    followed. I was smartly excited at the time of the fracus the Col struck one of Harmens men,
                    with his soard a grate many of
                    the men ware getting out catriges others fixing thare bayonets. I exspected nothing but a big row as the Col. is not loved by any of his men. I know you are
                    tired of this uninterresting letter. My health
                    has been very good till late. I have had the head ache with chills &amp;
                    fevers. I hope though it may soon ware
                    of. I hope theese
                    fiew lines may find you enjoying health &amp;
                    happiness. Excuse me for not writing sooner &amp; I will try and do better
                    next time. You said you wanted to know if I kneeded
                    any socks I have three or four good pair but would recieve a pair from your hand with the gratest pleasure. I wrote to your Paw about
                        <i>[unclear: a pair]</i> of pants.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to all enquireing friends. Nothing
                    more at present.</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon to your true &amp; omble
                        friend,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W.F.B.</i></p>
