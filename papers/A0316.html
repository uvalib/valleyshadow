<p class="p10">Dec. 7th 1862 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Mount Pleasant<br> Spotsylvania County, V<sup>a</sup>
                        </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister </p>
<p class="p10">Your kind favor of Nov. the 20th came safely to hand a few days ago and as I have
                    a few leisure moments this cold morning will try and write you few lines, not
                    that I have any news of interest to <i>[unclear: write]</i> but mainly to let
                    you all know that I am still <i>[unclear: alive]</i> and well. We have but
                    little duty to do now <i>[unclear: except]</i> picket duty and have not had any
                    fighting <i>[unclear: to do]</i> the last three or four weeks but move
                        <i>[unclear: camp]</i> every day or two. Still moving back toward Richmond
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> of our Regiment is out on picket now, been gone a day, will
                    be back this evening. Our picket <i>[illeg.]</i> is twenty-three miles from
                    where we are at camp, but we only gave to go on picket every <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    day and stay on three days at a time.</p>
<p class="p10">I was detailed to go on picket when a part of our regiment <i>[illeg.]</i> out
                    the other day but got James Vance to go in <i>[illeg.]</i> place by letting him
                    ride my mair was glad to <i>[illeg.]</i> it off for it
                    has been very cold ever since They <i>[illeg.]</i> and the snow is about six
                    inches deep. Still <i>[illeg.]</i> what we are having a could old time of it - sleeping out without tents, but we build big log
                    fires, <i>[illeg.]</i> make up shantys out of pine brush so you see <i>[deleted: ]</i> make out very well when it does not rain.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[illeg.]</i> heard from Sam a few days ago. he was very well <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    would have gone down to see him but they were <i>[illeg.]</i> and I did not
                    know where to find them <i>[illeg.]</i> Scott saw him he says that Sam was
                    cooking <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br><i>[illeg.]</i> nice, wouldent take
                    twenty dollars a piece for them. My pants I have swapt
                    them off for a longer pair. I hated to part with them
                    but they were so small that I could not ware them.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: Sister]</i> I thought that I would write this letter with
                        <i>[unclear: pen and ink]</i> but my pen is so bad that I will have to
                    finish it with my pencil I am almost ashamed to send this it is so badly written
                    and you can see that I have nothing to write that would interest you in the
                    least or would not fill up my letter with such foolishness--things that would
                    not intend <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> but I hope you will excuse <i>[illeg.]</i> this <i>[deleted: ]</i> and I will try and do better next and for goodness sake, dont let any persons see this <i>[unclear: badly]</i> written and
                    disconnected letter.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: Still]</i> I will tell you how we are fixed about cooking there are
                    eight of us in <u>my</u>
                    <u>mess</u> (Asbury, Clark, <i>[illeg.]</i>, Buchanan,
                    Bambs, Scott, and myself) and we only have <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    on oven to cook in--we first <i>[illeg.]</i> our
                        beef--<i>[illeg.]</i> make up our bread and butter it and if we have any
                    thing else to eat (which we have sometimes, by <i>[unclear: buying]</i> when we
                    can find any thing for sale) <i>[unclear: cook]</i>
                    what ever it may be all in the one <i>[illeg.]</i> is quit a novelty to see us cooking it<i>[unclear: alway]</i>--<i>[deleted: ]</i> on me to make the brew, for they say that <i>[illeg.]</i> but
                    any of them 
                        <u>makeing</u>
                    
                    <u>good</u>
                    <u>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    </u>. Give my love to cousin Johns folks and tell Mr. Hull to
                    <i>[unclear: write]</i> to me. I suppose Cousin Lizzie has quit writing to me
                    as I wrote to her nearly two months ago and she has not answered my letter <i>[deleted: ]</i> also give my respects to Mr. <i>[illeg.]</i> and family and my
                    love to Miss <i>[illeg.]</i>. Tell Mollie that I wrote to her from Culpepper
