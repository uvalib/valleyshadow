    <p>Your letter by yesterday's express came to hand, &amp; I have ordered &amp;
     designated 13 four horse wagons &amp; teams &amp; two (two) horse teams &amp;
     wagons to be turned over to do the transportation from Monterey to Greenbrier River. Would it
     not be well to take only 10 of these teams for the present until a good stock of grain
     &amp; hay can be gotten out, or whenever you can spare the train let the whole train come
     in for a load of grain &amp; hay.</p>
    <p>You may depend upon it General that the Quarter Masters Department in the North West never
     can be managed with system &amp; regularity until first rate business &amp; experienced
     men are commissioned &amp; placed at the important points on the line, &amp; when
     commissioning they give security. Money can be drawn by them &amp; many supplies purchased.
     Whereas when men are only occupying the place of assistants they are powerless &amp; they
     probably never see their principal once in two months. Unless this Department is thoroughly
     organized on the different lines the Army must suffer greatly in the coming winter. You can
     judge of it by what your division has already suffered. I know you have enough to do without
     attending to these details.</p>
    <p>I expect to join my regiment in 8 or 10 days &amp; hope to get the Department in working
     order in your line before I left. I hope you will write a letter to the Secretary of War on the
     subject. I have placed Capt. Funkhouser on the road in charge of the Pony Express line
     &amp; Capt Mason in charge of the repairs to the road, and a good business man is needed in
     the Quarter Masters Dept at Monterey whose duty should be to purchase all the supplies of
     forage &amp;c &amp; also see to the proper management of the wagons, horses &amp;c,
     and also to have repair shops, blacksmith &amp; wood shops at that point. I have written
      <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> my views &amp; I recd. a letter from General Lee yesterday which I
     enclosed to the Secretary of War stating the great difficulty about transportation on that
     line. I have urged this most important matter upon the War Department &amp; if you concur
     with me hope you will urge it also. Would it not be well to have a commissioned Quarter Master
     at Greenbrier River also.</p>
