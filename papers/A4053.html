<p class="p10">My Dear Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I got to Staunton by half past five and had time to get all my errands attended to before the
     cars started then got along very well to Orange C.H, &amp;
     there Mr. Shaw invited me to spend the night at his house, so after paying my respects to Gen.
     Lee &amp; chatting a while with Maj. Harman I went up &amp; had a good night's rest on
     a <u>feather</u> bed &amp; I tell you my Dear I stood in need of it, for
     my early start, hard seat &amp; a little cold &amp; the all days ride in the cars had wearied me much &amp; I was decidedly <u>nervous</u>, but the night's rest refreshed me. William got there in good
     time. This morning I got up early, breakfasted with Harman &amp; then rode down with Maj.
      H. to Hd. Qrs. fifteen miles --
     quite a pleasant ride, the air bracing. I found them at Morton's House, "The Hall" a very nice
     place &amp; all in the house, though the tents are up in the yard "for charn" Mr. Robinson had a room in the house -- big fire &amp;c, so I am quite
     comfortably fixed &amp; though somewhat jaded, hope to stand it very well. Everything is
     quiet &amp; there is no prospect of fight at present, though one is expected here before
     long --<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I hope you were not made sick by your many labors of the day before my
     leaving. Please send me back my letters -- you can put them all in one of yours. Tell Mrs. Wise
     I saw the Rev. Mr. Slaughter who had seen some people lately from Culpeper &amp; they said
     Meade had his quarters at Mr. Wollocks &amp; had a large drove of cattle in that vicinity
     -- The ladies that came out lived near Mitchell's Station &amp; were compelled to come away
     for want of food, they had to ask Gen. Warren (Fed.) for something to eat before they could
     come to our lines -- it was said the Yankees had killed a Mr. Nelson at Culpeper C.H. -- but in general they had behaved very well -- I found all
     very well &amp; enjoying their comfortable quarters. My snack was delightful -- Maj. Allen
     &amp; brouther ate with me -- Gen. Rodes got on the cars at Charlottesville -- he said he
     had got a <u>fine boy</u> &amp; his wife was doing well. Aint he a lucky man? I forgot to tell Allie that I did not get a chance to
     see Capt. S. privately - - sorry I did not -- but she must be of
     good cheer &amp; hope for a change -- time mends all things even rheumatic joints.</p>
<p class="p10"> I shall write to you again in a few days &amp; send some money -- I wish to go to the
      C.H. tomorrow.</p>
<p class="p10"> Kisses &amp; love for all the children including allie &amp; the rest if there
     &amp; a full <i>[illeg.]</i> for you my Love -- Write to me soon -- very soon: By the way
     I left a roll of paper on the pile of big books, which I want sent to Lt. Koemer, Staunton care
     of Maj. Bell -- send it soon to Maj. B -- Good bye &amp; God
     bless you </p>
<p class="p10">Your aff husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
<p class="p10">Get Harvey Bear to bring your 90 pounds of salt from Hanger -- I told
      him of it but he may forget &amp; you give him a recpt
     --</p>
