<salute>Dear Sir</salute> 
</opener> 

<p>Last eve.  I was presented a letter from one of the teachers (Miss Dewey) asking a release from teaching the last month of the term</p>
	<p>I had hardly time to consider the matter, it being late, but signed my approval, as it would seem from the letter it was necessary.  But I do it reluctantly.  She is attached to the school, and I believe that it is not on account of any circumstance at all connected with the school that she askes you to release her from the month of June</p>
	<p>Our <hi rend="underline">hands are already full</hi> and I do not know what we shall<pb n="2"/> do <hi rend="underline">or how we shall get along without her</hi>.  The night school may grow smaller, as the evenings become short, but I do not think that the day school will for if some go to the country to work others will be likely to come who were to young or to poor to come in winter  But if she must go (perhaps we can divide her school between us and get along some way for, a month)</p>
	<p><hi rend="underline">We are not without our troubles in a good many ways</hi>, but our school is doing very well, and I think better than ever</p>

<p>P. S. Apr 20.  I am more of the opinion that we can not receive Miss D's school, and if she leaves, it must stop unless we can engage<pb n="3"/> some colored teacher to fill her place which is very doubtful
