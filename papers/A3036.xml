                <p>An update about camp life from Pastor to his lady friend Annie. He mentions that
                    several men he knows recently died. Note that he mentions evacuating their last
                    camp because there were too many "Confederates," in quotes. This might mean
                    people trying to sell goods, camp followers, spies, or several other groups.</p>

                </opener>

                <p> I will hasten this morning to answer your kind letter, which was received
                    through <abbr expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Stricke. Was glad to hear from you
                    once more, &amp; to learn that you were still in the enjoyment of good
                    health, a blessing which is of all others the most desirable. I have nothing to
                    write this morning that will prove at all interesting to you We have changed our
                    camp since I last wrote you which is about all that is worthy of note. We were
                    compelled to do so on account of the "Confederates" which became so numerous
                    that we had to evacuate our camp in order to get rid of them.</p>
                <p>All is quiet in camp this morning, no news from the enemy for several days, hope
                    they may let us rest this winter, and probably by spring something may be done
                        to<pb n="2"/> bring about an adjustment of things in general</p>
                <p>Jimmie Buck has gotten back to us again he looks like he hadn't fared much better
                    than we have been doing. Since we left him <unclear>able</unclear> was left with
                    our baggage at Jeffersonton in Culpepper County, where he remained <orig
                        reg="until">untill</orig> we came to this place. Two more of our noble
                    companion in arms have fallen <orig reg="victims">victoms</orig> to the fell
                    destroyer, since I last wrote you. Namely John M. Gabbest who was wounded at
                    "Cedar Creek"- and Franklin Black who was left in the rear when we crossed the
                        <orig reg="Potomac">Potomack</orig> the first time not being able to keep
                    up, his father <orig reg="read">reed</orig> a letter from a yankee <abbr
                        expan="Doctor">D<hi rend="super">r.</hi></abbr> stating the fact. I pressume
                    he was taken prisoner. I will bring this short note to a close as the mail is
                    about to leave. My health is pretty good with the exception of a bad cold. The
                    weather is quite cool has been raining a little &amp; looks like we may have
                    more</p>
