<p class="p10">Sept 16th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Orange C.H.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">Once more I have the privilege of dropping you a fiew
                    lines. My health is very good &amp; I hope theese
                    fiew lines may find you enjoying the same blessing. For
                    the last two or three days we have been exspecting
                    a fight. The enamy advanced on our cavelry last Sunday at Culpeper C.H. &amp; drove them back after
                    a sleght engagement to the Rapidan River. We recieved orders Sunday night at one OClock to cook one
                    days rations &amp; be ready to march at day light early Monday morning we
                        ware marched down below <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>O.C.H. for to
                    await further orders. The enamy crossed the Rapidan at
                    Raccoon ford. Gen Early with his devision drove them
                    back I suppose it was nothing more than a Yankee raid trying to reconoiter our strengthe &amp; position. Thare is many
                        rumers afloat I know we are not settled yet I
                    would not be serprised if we dont go to Fredericksburg evry thing seems to
                    indicate a change of base. The grater portion of
                    Longstreets corps; if not all; has left us for some point not known to me now
                    Capt G. arrived yesterday evning with eight men; a
                    heavy reinforcment for our com. We have the largest company in the Regt some
                    fifty odd reported for duty. The boys all seem cher<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br></p>full; &amp; willing to meet the enamies of our country on any field to dispute our rights with them
                    I hope we may go back to our old camp &amp; remain thare
                    untill the weather gets colder &amp; I fear to if
                    we go on a long march that I could not stand it on account of my toe We had
                    preaching evry night while we ware in camp The Rev. Mr Taylor of Staunton preached to us Monday
                    evening I believe thare
                    ware more than five thousand soldiers gathered under the
                    sound of his voice eagerly listening to the words of light &amp; life that
                        seamed to flow from his lips at the same time we
                    could hear the booming of the distant canon while he
                    preached I prayed that the <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>holy spirit might fall on us, as it did on
                    the children of iseral on the day of pentecost
                    &amp; that thousands might thare make thare peace with God. Dear Kate when you recieve this no doubt you will say cold; so cold; but I
                    would not have you think thus for thare is not a beat
                    of my pulce but beats true to thee. O how often I think
                    of the past when you ware by my side; my arms encircling
                        you waist &amp; you sweet lips gently prest to mine than I was happy;
                    yes happy; as the gay warbler whilst they are singing thare notes of praise to thare maker I must
                    soon close your Br is well I had a notion to close him up in his box &amp;
                    send him home awhile to his fond &amp; loving sisters my love to all good by
                    my best &amp; dearest Kate</p>
