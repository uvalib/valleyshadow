<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">October 6<sup>th</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp Buford </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister </p>
<p class="p10">I have neglected to write to you for some time but I will take the present
                    opportunity to pen you a few lines hoping that they may find you all in good
                    health. </p>
<p class="p10">We are still at our old camp below Washington and there is no more indication of
                    our leaving here at present then there has been all along. We got <i>[deleted: ]</i> tents again last week, the same kind as we had the first winter we layed at
                    Washington. we are fixing them up for Winter quarters but I dondt know how long we will have the good of them. Last week nearly
                    all our men who were taken prisoners during last summer were exchanged and
                    joined us again so that most of our <i>[illeg.]</i> are pretty well filled up
                    again, we had only lost two men taken prisoners<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>of our <i>[deleted: ]</i> last spring and they both returned. </p>
<p class="p10">I was in Washington last week and seen Sergt. Davison of
                    our Co. he had just returned from home the day before where he had been for a
                    month on a Furlough from the Hospital he told me he had seen Father twice as he
                    was going and coming from town; he is now gone home again but I have not heard
                    for how long. He was wounded on the 1<sup>rst</sup> of August in the
                    fight near Culpepper. </p>
<p class="p10">There is no Furlough given yet in our Brigade, but I expect there will be if we
                    stay here much longer and nothing turns up. Do you ever hear anything of Levi or
                    John Markley? I have not heard anything from them since we came from the front. </p>
<p class="p10">I received a letter some time ago from a young man "William Curtis" who used to
                    belong to our Co. but is<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>now in the Chesnut Hill Hospital. he told me,
                    he got up in Hilltown occassionally; did he ever call at our house? </p>
<p class="p10">I was sick for a while with chills and fever since we came here but I have got
                    quite well again. The weather has been very pleasant for some time, but the
                    nights are beginning to get cold. </p>
<p class="p10">Please write soon and let me know all the news from the neighbourhood. I must now
                    bring my letter to a close. <i>[illeg.]</i> my love to all at home and my
                    compliments to all inquiring friends. </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate Brother </p>
