                <p>I write you for the purpose of asking the favor, if not inconvenient to you, to
                    procure me a form book published by the commission of Patents, giving forms for
                    affiliation for land warrants pensions &amp;C and for the purpose of
                    enquiring of you, what in your opinion are the prospects of an adjustment of
                    present crisis which now overhangs our beloved Country, if necessary, Old
                    Franklin Can furnish 1000. men at 10 days notice to go <orig reg="anywhere">any
                        where</orig> to defend the Union the Constitution &amp; the laws, we are
                    not very much in favor of compromises, especially any compromise which would
                    sacrifice our principles " Our people were all (except a few under the influence
                    of <abbr expan="Alexander">A</abbr> K McClure) delighted to learn that the life
                    long friend of the interests of Pennsylvania had been selected by Mr Lincoln as
                    one of his cabinet, and I trust there is no mistake about it, though the Press
                    of Philadelphia by <orig reg="today">to day</orig>, informs us that--<pb n="2"

                    Springfield, &amp; that Mr Cameron is not to go into Mr Lincoln's Cabinet,
                    is it possible that so pure a man as Mr Lincoln, is to, be influenced by such a
                    man as McClure who is trying to defeat Pennsylvania. I hope not, and I feel very
                    much like sending Mr Lincoln a copy of the Valley Spirit of this March,
                    containing those claims against McClure, on which McClure had the Editors,
                    indicted for libel, &amp; then after he had secured his election to the
                    State Senate, comes into Court and takes a not <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, &amp; as
                    yet has refused to pay the costs. Excuse me for this long letter but Justice
                    demands that the real friend of Pennsylvania &amp; the Union ought to be
                    injured in any way by such men as McClure</p>
