<p class="p10">Saturday Evening Apr
                                16<sup>th</sup> 1859</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear John</p>
<p class="p10">As I have not heard from you for some time I concluded that the best plan was to
                    stir you up. We are all well, and hop you are the same.
                    I have no news of special importance to write. We are all in anxious Suspence Waiting to hear news from the various
                    counties, but as yet we have heard in a manner nothing. Old Augusta as usual
                    done her duty but not what she might and ought to have done. We gave Baldwin
                    1900 majority, but ought to have given him three thousand. the people did not
                    turn out, but done better in this County than in any that I have heard from.
                        B<sup>s</sup> majority in
                    Rockingham while <i>[illeg.]</i> near 1000 and 700 in Rockbridge<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Robinson will cary Shenandoah by a very
                    small majority, say 150. We have heard from five of the largest precincts in the
                    county and R has a majority over B of 72 and I think 150 will be a large estimate.
                    Albemarle will give R 950, there was not more than
                    one third or fourth of the vote polled in the district-in Frederick there was
                    but about 650 votes and Bal received 172 Robinson
                    43 and Parker the rest-we think from the present indications Baldwin is elected
                    by a small vote; Culpeper has gone for Baldwin by a small majority 40 or 50-and
                    I hope Nelson has done the same. Well I am truly glad to hear that you are
                    coming over to see us at the June term of the Circuit Court. We all<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>will be truly glad to give you an old shake of the hand. You must excuse me
                    for braking my promise to come over to see you, for
                    I assure you it is not for any want of paying you a visit but from the fact that
                    I have been bound hand and foot and have not had the time and it will be the
                    case untill after July, for John will take up the whole
                    of next month in his trip north, and the the month of June we will have the
                        cir ct. and then in July we will have a
                    special term of the Federal Court to try the Jarvis <i>[unclear: Yactview]</i>
                    suit so that it will be out of my power to<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>pay you my intended visit,
                    till fall. I have seen D<sup>r</sup>
                    <i>[unclear: Mervillatt]</i> in regard to the letter you spoke of-and he told
                    me he had not translated it, but would do it, in a short time. I hope you are
                    doing good work for Goggin &amp; Co. I made my first speach at Mt. Sidney on
                    last Saturday-We will give 1000 or more majority. I have more news to write but
                    as it is late I will close-Give my love to all</p>
<p class="p10">in haste your friend</p>
