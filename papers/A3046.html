<h4>Augusta County: Various authors to Annie Harris,
                         [date unknown]<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>This note, written on a pay sheet for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
                         Company, contained two separate parts, both to Ms. Harris. The first was
                         written by a Dr. "S. A. T.," the second by Tony Pastor.<br> The first
                         letter describes camp life in some detail, including exhaustive marches,
                         hot weather, and mental exhaustion caused by false alarms of battle. The
                         second letter mentions sickness in the camp and includes Pastor's usual
                         complaints that Annie does not write often enough.</p>

<p class="p10">Sunday 23 186</p>
<p class="p10">Five miles beyond Martinsburg</p>
<p class="p10">Our Dear &amp; highly respected Annie</p>
<p class="p10">This paper as you will pershiver has been pressed
                         by friend Toney from the Baltimore &amp; Ohio company. but nevertheless
                         we hope you will excuse the paradoxity in which I am about to get. Here
                              <i>[illeg.]</i> we <i>[unclear: 
                              ly
                         ]</i> down at the root of an oak to give you an idea of our camp life.
                         We expected to have a long march to day as it is
                         the day on which we generally do our large marching. We are within a few
                         miles of the enemies camp. On yesterday we
                         received information that they were crossing into V<sup>
                                   <u>a</u>
                              </sup> and we were immediately if not sooner ordered out to meet
                         them We got up the road about two miles when we called a halt to wait
                         further news. About ten at night we were informed that they had gone back
                         so we returned to camp. They however were met <i>[deleted: with]</i> by
                         our cavalry who killed three or four of them. We do not know there number but we have various reports from two
                         to thirty thousand<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">There are only three or four thousand of us, with four pieces of artillery It
                         is thought that they are great cowards but, I think they are endeavoring to
                         get us into a snap It is certainly very trying on the constitution to be
                              <i>[deleted: always]</i> on the verge of battle and then be
                         disappointed. Our men seem very thoughtless &amp; indifferent on the
                         subject &amp; I expect I am a little worse than any of them. For I have
                         fully made up my mind to die here if necessary &amp; I really feel
                         eager to get into action. I would much rather be at your fathers table enjoying the delicacies which your
                         own hand has prepared; but since it must be so, I am perfectly satisfied.
                         We have just listened to a sermon from Capt
                         Pendleton which differed in one immaterial respect from the one you have
                         doubtless heard, in that we had no <i>[unclear: fase]</i> faces to look
                         upon. This I believe is the first Sabbath we have spent in rest, &amp;
                         we may yet be ordered out before night.<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">The weather is dry and favorable for our mode of living only it is rather
                         warm. We frequently pass soldiers on the march who have fallen in the road
                         from heat and fatigue. It is certainly delightful to the weary soldiers
                         after a hard march to lie down in the woods or clover field as it may be,
                         and gaze at the moon &amp; stars. Lest Toney should think I am
                         monopolizing space, (&amp; I have no doubt I am if I know anything
                         about dryed apples) I will close. I can never forget, &amp; shall ever
                         appreciate your kindness to me; &amp; if it should be my misfortune
                         never to return I hope you at least will not allow my memory to perish with
                         my body. <i>[unclear: How]</i> arrived in camp last evening, he was
                         complaining a little but <i>[unclear: he's]</i> better this morning. He
                         say he dont know whether he will remain or not
                         Some of my love to all friends and the rest which you will find much the
                         greater portion unless the bag leaks, <i>[deleted: and]</i> you will
                         reserve for yourself<br> Your sincere friend<br> S. A. T.xxxxxxx</p>
<p class="p10">Exit D<sup>r.</sup> Enter Toney:<br>
                         John is now enjoying a sick repast, served up in soldier style, consisting
                         of dry bread &amp; ____ beef which doubtless he enjoys as much if not
                         more than the delicacies he spoke of in the introduction of this epistle.
                         It is not worth my while to attempt to give you a d<i>[deleted: i]</i>escription of our camp. John has already given you a full discription, &amp; in much better style
                         than I could even if I were to try. This day appears more like sunday than
                         any that I have passed over since<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> I left home. Mr John Lightner
                         arrived here on yesterday with <i>[unclear: How]</i> &amp; several
                         other boys from town.</p>
<p class="p10">I have written some three letters to you since I left the Ferry &amp; as
                         yet have not received one from you. As for the note that accompanied yours
                         &amp; Miss Jennie I would say as I have done that I hope you will drop
                         the question in discussion. &amp; believe me to be as ever your <u>devoted</u> friend. I thought from the winding up of
                         it that you meant differently, but I am <i>[unclear: strongly]</i> glad
                              <i>[unclear: to]</i>
                         <i>[illeg.]</i> that such was not the case. <i>[illeg.]</i> You still
                         have a heart that vibrates to the <i>[unclear: chords]</i> of love I must
                         bring this letter to a close - for we cant get
                         time to write any more at present <br></p>
<p class="p10">yours truly in haste</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Tony P____</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Sam Thompson is laying by my side sound asleep
                              - says he is going to cease all corrispondence after to day, when you write direct to Winchester. Our boys are
                                   tollerably well some have mumps
                              &amp; some have the measles. Our Capt
                              is down with the mumps now in Winchester but is better my respects to
                              all but for John's &amp; my sake dont show this <i>[illeg.]</i>
                              Tony</p>
