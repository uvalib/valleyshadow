                    <salute>My dear wife: </salute>
                </opener>

                <p>I have not heard from you for sometime - but it is owing to the want of a mail -
                    we have left the Valley and are now between Standardsville &amp;
                    Harrisonburg, about halfway between the two places. The enemy are now in the
                    valley at Harrisonburg - their advance guard - but I do not think they will move
                    very rapidly upon Staunton, for fear of being flanked by us - and we hope soon
                    to be able to do so - that our force will allow us again to give them battle and
                    by the blessing of Providence drive them from our homes. </p>

                <p>Of course the people seen in great trepidation in Staunton and the accounts of
                    the panic, on Friday and Saturday last, were exceedingly ludicrous &amp;
                    amusing -- women &amp; children &amp; negroes &amp; especially the
                    men &amp; more especially the office-holding men - Quartermasters &amp;
                    Commisioners were seen running to &amp; fro through rain &amp; mud
                    begging &amp; hiring passage to some other point of safety - It is said that
                    the Virgin<hi rend="super">a</hi> Hotel was so completely deserted as to require
                    it to be closed up - and all this panic when the enemy was at least 30 miles
                    from them. I feel very anxious about Father &amp; Mother &amp; <del
                        hand="h1"/> I advised father to leave mother &amp; may at home - but I
                    heard they were all going to leave. I am almost sorry to advised at all -
                    Trusting in a kind Providence to look over &amp; take care of them I hope
                    that it will be His<pb n="2"/> pleasure to restore us all to our homes with
                    liberty &amp; peace &amp; happiness smiling upon us &amp; hearts
                    full of gratitude for His mercy &amp; goodness - It is a hard matter to give
                    up home to the ruthless <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of an enemy seeking our destruction and
                    the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> wisdom of God can alone see why it is done. Let us submit
                    &amp; pray for his blessing to restore us to him soon again &amp; in His
                    own good time. I forgot to tell you before that I have been promoted to the
                    Colonelcy of the 5th Regt by its unanimous vote - But for the gratification of
                    being thus restored to a position of which I was deprived so unjustly 12 months
                        <orig reg="ago">go</orig> I do not know that I should not decline the honor
                    conferred &amp; shrink from the great responsibility it imposes - It is no
                    pleasant thought to have the care of the lives of 800 to 1000 men - I will use
                    every effort to look after them - to be a father &amp; leader - and I
                    beseech you and all to pray to Heaven to give me the ability and assistance
                    necessary for so hard a task &amp; so responsible a position - I will have a
                    fine regiment - one that loves me &amp; will do everything I can to make it
                    a pride &amp; noble defence of the country - I do not like to say how you
                    shall send your letters - for I do not know - send them however to Maj Gen
                    Jackson army - Dear Lottie when shall I see her - I trust she is still improving
                    - I will soon be allowed to see her father - the enemy are fast drawing their
                    coils about Richmond &amp; within them I fear you may come - If so remain at
                    home &amp; act as many of our noble women have done &amp; you need fear
                    no harm for God will<pb n="3"/> protect you - Oh when will this avenging sword
                    be drawn &amp; wielded in the cause of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> - It cannot be
                    that our cause is not just - It cannot be that we have so sinned as to be worthy
                    of destruction - No it cannot be - He may be scourged <unclear>&amp; we
                        deserve it - we may be <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> to the last extremity,</unclear> but
                    if we rely upon God &amp; do our duty the result will be our success. </p>


                <p>The result at Yorktown I trust will be in our favor - a great success there would
                    be glorious for our cause - It would almost put a stop to the War - I feel much
                    confidence in the result as we have noble Generals &amp; brave troops to
                    rely upon.</p>

                <p>I am not so well as usual - though not sick - my liver is torpid and I fear it
                    may result in dispepsia or jaundice - I will go into the field tomorrow and will
                    be considerably more exposed than I have been - but will take care of myself. I
                    am in a considerable strait about my mess and have written to McBell to buy me a
                    full set of everything and bring a good cook. He promises to be with me
                    &amp; he will be very useful - He is now at home making arrangements to send
                    off his cattle &amp; everything - &amp; will be back in a few days -
                    write me a long letter - love to all - Kiss Lottie Remember me to Jacques - </p>
