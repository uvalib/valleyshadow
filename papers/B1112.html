<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, August 22, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How writes that the officers he expected are being mustered out of his District,
                    and will therefore need more. He notes that "it will be impossible to establish
                    the relations of the Freedmen to their former masters without the aid of the
                    military."</p>

<p class="p10">Aug 22 1865.</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I have this morning requested of Brevet Major Genl
                    Torbert an assignment of four (4) officers for duty in the counties comprising
                    his District, "the Shenandoah" and have been informed that he has received
                    orders to muster out the regiments now on duty in his command, and thus cannot
                    furnish the officers required, and I have telegraphed you to that effect in
                    order that so many more might be added to the number for which I understood you
                    were to apply.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not know whether any troops are to replace those mustered out, but beg leave
                    earnestly to <i>[unclear: represent]</i> the absolute necessity for a
                    detachment of troops in each of the counties of this District as it will be
                    impossible to establish the relations of the Freedmen to their former masteres
                    without the aid of the Military.</p>
<p class="p10">I shall go tomorrow to Harpers Ferry to learn what may be done for the counties
                    of Jefferson and Buckley, which are in the command of Genl Emory. I will make a full report on my return to Staunton, to which
                    place please send all communications by letter.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Colonel <br>Very Respectfully</p>
