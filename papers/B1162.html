<p class="p10">Jany 10th 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Virginia</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to call your attention to the following statement of grievance
                    which has and still continues to occasion me considerable loss and
                    inconvenience. I have been a resident of Staunton V<sup>a</sup> for the last fourteen years by my industry I
                    succeeded in purchasing a lot here in 1861 before I could build on it the Rebel
                    officials took possession of it in 1862 for a camping ground and in 1864 erected
                    thereon a Barracks for their soldiers, which they occupied until the collapse of
                    the rebellion. During all that time I received no compensation for its use.
                    After the surrender of Lee I took possession of it and ploughed the lot up and
                    planted it. I also put there 2,200 twenty two hundred feet of lumber for
                    building purposes in May when the U.S. forces occupied this place they took
                    possession of the building for barracks because <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>because it
                    had belonged to the Confederate Government. The result was that every expense
                    and labor in the fencing and lot were lost. Capt T.
                    J. Farnsworth A.Q.M. also took
                    possession of the lumber I had put there promising to pay me for it, but never
                    did. Since July the 58 Pen Vols
                    have used it. The Q.M. of the Regt informed me that he had no authority either to
                    recompense me for its use or give me possession of the lot, since they left I
                    learn that the building has been turned over to the Freedmen's Bureau and as the
                    building remains on the lot, I am still deprived of its use. I enclose herewith
                    a deposition taken before Capt. Tho<sup>s</sup> Johnson Provost Marshall showing that I put the lumber referred to
                    on the lot and also enclose a letter from Col Clay
                    to the Q.M. of the 58 Pen Vols
                    <i>[added: in relation]</i> to said lot.</p>
<p class="p10">I am and always have been a Union Man and have been so considered
                    <i>[unclear: such]</i> in my neighborhood. I have never been in the Rebel
                    service nor any of my family.</p>
<p class="p10">Hoping this will meet your favorable consideration.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Col<br>Very Respectfully<br>Your
                            obedt Servt</p>
