<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John W. Jordan to Orlando
                    Brown, July 31, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jordan remarks that he observes different opinions regarding the legal rights of
                    blacks among different classes of people, but notes that "intelligence,
                    integrity or moral courage" do not appear to be qualifications necessary to sit
                    on a jury or preside as a Magistrate in Augusta County.</p>

                    "Order" restoring to the "Civil Courts" jurisdiction over colored persons
                    &amp;c I have the honor to submit the following "Report" concerning same as
                    it pertains to Highland &amp; Augusta Counties.</p>
<p class="p10">I have no cases to report wherein any serious or marked injustice has been done a
                    colored person by any authority vested with the power to institute or regulate
                    proceedings <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>in the Courts - No cases in which colored persons
                    appeared as parties excepting a few criminal cases have been tried by the Courts
                    during this month.</p>
<p class="p10">Among the reflecting substantial people I think it is manifest that there is as a
                    general thing a disposition to give the freedmen fair and impartial hearings but
                    among the lower classes there is a clearly defined and firmly established
                    determination to obstruct his advancement in every possible way and especially
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> this evident in the manner in which his ignorance of the
                    rules of evidence and blunders are ridiculed.</p>
<p class="p10">Whenever I find an <u>intelligent</u> Jury or Magistrate on
                    the Bench, I find a disposition manifested to give the colored man all that he
                    is entitled to but it is a deplorable fact that in this <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>county
                    intelligence, integrity, moral courage &amp;c are not considered necessary
                    qualifications, either in the Magistrates or Jurors.</p>
<p class="p10">There is a marked decrease in the number of criminal offenses committed during
                    the month as compared with the months of April, May &amp; June.</p>
<p class="p10">There are but few Magistrates whom I trust with the trial or adjudication of
                    cases, believing that my old system of bringing the parties together in my
                    office and settling the difficulty there to be productive of more good to all
                    concerned as well as securing to the parties their just and equitable rights.</p>
