<p class="p10">My Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I again attempt to drop you few lines which I hope will reach you safe &amp;
                        <i>[added: find you]</i> in the full enjoyment of health
                    &amp; <i>[unclear: friends]</i>. I wrote to you about the 21 or
                    <i>[unclear: 22]</i> of May in answer to yours of the 1st which I recieved on the fourth I reckon you think I was long
                    time answering your letter but it was impossible for me to do so sooner. I have
                    waited a long time for you to answer, my love, but up to this time have heard
                    nothing from you so I write again to inform <i>[added: you]</i> where am &amp; to let you know my condition. On the 1st day of
                    this month I was very badly wounded in the mouth &amp; neck. So much so that
                    I could not talk any for many days I am geting so I
                    can talk a little now but make a very poor <i>[unclear: fist]</i> of it at best
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>since I have been wounded I am more anxious to hear from
                        <i>[unclear: friends]</i> though I reckon it is more for the fact that I
                    have not heard from you for so long if you have written to me before you receive
                    this of course your letter will go to my company but my brothers will receive it
                    then forward on to me I am improving very much my Doc thinks my case not dayersome. I cant eat any
                    thing I live on muck and mush mixed very thin so that I sip it with spoon. I am
                    quite strong thank God I have a fine constitution I can stand most anything well
                    My own friend you must write to me as soon as you recieve this I close so anxious to hear from you you must excuse a short
                    letter this time as my wound pains me. I have the <i>[illeg.]</i> pen in
                    Richmond <i>[illeg.]</i> dear Kate write soon to your unworthy but fond friend</p>
