<h4>Franklin County: George M. Brinkerhoff to Edward

<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>George W. Brinkderhoff, a resident of Springfield, Illinois, writes soon after
                    Lincoln's election, fondly describing the President-elect, congratulating Edward

<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your letter and book on Saturday night,
                    for which accept my thanks. I have not seen Lincoln yet but will in all
                    probability see him on Monday, and give him your message. He is well and hearty
                    and his success does not change him any, he is the same old Abe he used to be
                    last spring. When he would play ball with us, in our ball-alley. It may appear
                    strange for a president to play ball. Yet a good many, good games have I played
                    with old Abe. He is <u>rather tall</u> and generally made an
                    awkward figure at play. He will have other kind of play, next spring. Well done
                    good and faithful old Keystone! Lincoln says he can account for his vote in
                        Penn<u>
                            <sup>a.</sup>
                        </u>. only on one supposition, and that is that the <u>Quakers voted</u>. I will be pleased to hear from you
                    frequently during the winter, by <u>letter and document</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">Your friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>George M. Brinkerhoff</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. We have a grand jollification here to-morrow night. Vice-President Hamlin is expected
                        and will be present on the occasion. We will have a glorious time here at
                        home of old Abe. General Illumination. Pyrotechnic display. Torchlight
                        procession, and a few congratulatory speeches at the wigwam after which that
                        venerable and honored institution will be closed. I wishe you could be here. Come out and see Lincoln. I promise you a
                        nice time.<br><u>GMB</u></p>
