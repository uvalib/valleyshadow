<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Abner Harrison to Thomas
                    P. Jackson, July 19, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Although now residing in Tennessee, Harrison writes to Jackson to find out
                    whether or not Jackson has the power to pursue a case in which Harrison was not
                    able to collect payment for some land he sold near Middlebrook before the war,
                    because he refused to accept Confederate money. His letter details the
                    circumstances of the matter, and asks for help, or at the very least, advice,
                    from Jackson.</p>
