<p class="p10">Dear John </p>
<p class="p10">I suppose the Telegraph has given you notice of a skirmish in which our Brigade
                    was engaged. Well its all over now, and the <u>got</u> off
                    remarkably well. Captains <i>[unclear: Galway]</i> &amp; Dick are both
                    wounded in the legs -- not dangerously. Two of our men, one in Co E, &amp; 1 in Co
                    H. were killed and about sixteen or eighteen wounded. The 9<sup>th</sup> was in advance and came near being surrounded, but the boys fought like
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>. The Rebels loss is estimated at between one &amp; two
                    hundred together with a number of prisoners, quite an amount <br><br>[<i>page </i>]<br> of forage
                    &amp; equipments. One of Co. C. after getting
                    his canteen, clothes, &amp; thigh -- the latter but little -- <i>[unclear: 
                        fired
                    ]</i>, with a bullet, nabbed the fellow and made him fork over all his
                    equipments and $80, Southern money. He gave me the enclosed which I send on to
                    you, and see that you don't get on <u>too big a spree with
                    it</u>. It will be apt to hold good -- for nothing as long as the war last at
                    least -- </p>

<p class="p10">My love to family &amp; respects to enquiring
                    friends. A Merry Christmas to you all</p>
