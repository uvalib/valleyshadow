     Editor, Pennsylvania Daily Telegraph
    </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">June 16, 1862</p>
<p class="p10">CAMP AT WEAVERSVILLE, FAURQUIER COUNTY,
       VA.</p>
<p class="p10">MR. EDITOR: </p>
<p class="p10">I have concluded to trespass upon your valuable columns, to inform our friends what the 107th
     is doing down on the "Sacred Soil." On the 28th of May, at the time of General Banks' retreat,
     it was our division (Gen. McDowell's) that left Manasas Junction and marched to Front Royal and
     cut off the rebel Jackson. It was a distance of fifty-six miles, and rained every day during
     the march, and when night-fall arrived we bivouached under trees and bushes. At Peidmont we halted and received two days' rations in our haversacks and
     on we went through the mountains, and on Sabbath morning, June 1st, our brigade (Gen. Duryea's) composed of the 107th Penn'a. regiment, New York 105th, 104th and 97th, made a charge through Front Royal,
     double quick through mud ankle deep amidst the booming of cannon. On making a charge of over
     five miles up the south branch of the Shenandoah we found that Gen. Shields' artillery had a
     very heavy skirmish with the retreating portion of Jackson's army. The 107th is on the right of
     our brigade, and the men acquitted themselves with great credit to themselves and the great
     State that they represent.</p>
<p class="p10">As several members of my company (C) have parents and relatives residing in Harrisburg and
     Dauphin county, I deem it proper to give you this short epistle for publication for their
     benefit.</p>
<p class="p10">Our brigade lays again in Eastern Virginia, near Cattlet's station on the Orange and
     Alexandria railroad. The boys are all well and enjoying good spirits, but considering the long
     and forced marches, the men were not so much jaded as you would imagine, and ready at moment's
     notice to repeat the labor if needs be. No one need tell me that anything but love of country
     and a strong desire to get at the enemy, could stimulate an army to make such a match and be in
     order for an engagement in one hour afterwards.</p>
<p class="p10">But, Mr. Editor, this is not all the boys have been doing while fighting the battles of our
     country. They have not forgotten their dear relatives they have left behind.</p>
<p class="p10">About ten days ago paymaster Major D.F. Watson, made his appearance and paid off the
     regiment. I took the pains to ascertain the amount each man of my company sent home, and
     summing it up, I found the amount reached the handsome sum of three thousand and thirty
     dollars. This is independent of the eight members who were sick and in the hospital. -- This is
     indeed very gratifying as well as creditable to the families having husbands and sons in the
     company fighting for the Union. My prayer is, God will protect them and all of us in this noble
     cause, and restore peace to to the county, and that we may return to our loved homes and enjoy
     the benefits of a free and happy people.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Respectfully, </p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.A.C., Lieut., Co. E, 107th Reg., P.V. </i></p>
