<p class="p10">My own Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">You have no idea how glad I was when your dear letter was handed me. I thought I
                    was entirely banished from your memory but your kind letter gave me understand
                    that there is still <i>[deleted: place]</i> a place in your noble heart that
                    sometimes promts you to think of me. Well in the
                    first place I will tell you how it is looking in <i>[unclear: camp]</i> this
                    day it looks and feels very much like snow it has been raining for several days
                    hope it will cleare off soon for I get so tired in
                    doors all the time I am so glad spring is so nigh most ever person are <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br><i>[illeg.]</i> but one deep <i>[deleted: ]</i> has been scarce, I took one good sleigh ride You wanted to know what kind of
                    xmas I spent. I had a very happy time went to an xmas tree it was a very grand
                    one but there wasent a present for me wasnt that too bad, but one consolation it was out of
                    the neighborhood &amp; wasent
                    disapointed You bet I would like to see your
                    little boy but would rather see my darling Friend I so often think of him I can
                    hardly wait untill you send me there
                    Photoes I will have some taken next Fall if I live
                    &amp; will send you one I guess I will get a letter from you about that time
                    is Rose B staying with you now? wish I could step in and have a long chat I
                    could tell you so much more than I can write but as we are deprived of that</p>
