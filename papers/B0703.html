<p class="p11"><b>
     Bureau R.F. and A.L. 4th Div. 9 S.D.
    </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Nov. 11. 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">In the case of Cornelia Moore (colored) v.s.
     <i>[unclear: W]</i> Booz heard at this office on the 9th inst, in
     which said Caroline Claims of the said Booz the sum of $7<u>
      <sup>50</sup>
     </u> in payment for services rendered by her, as servant in boarding house of said Booz, for
     five weeks at rate of $6.00 per month which amount became due on or about the 12<sup>th</sup> of October <i>[unclear: ultimo]</i> - date of her
     <i>[unclear: discharge]</i>, which said Booz refused to pay <i>[unclear: Cornelia]</i> for
     reasons hereinafter stated - The <i>[unclear: Evidince]</i> &amp; testimony produced
     elicits the following decision from this Office viz:</p>
<p class="p10">Cornelia, having remained &amp; boarded at the house of Mr Booz several days after her
     discharge without his consent and thereby place herself under obligations to him to an amount
     Equivalent to her board while there which he is justly Entitled to. But inasmuch as the said
     Booz refused to settle <i>[deleted: to settle]</i> with her when discharged, at which time
     she demanded her money &amp; assured him that she would leave his premises so soon as she
     received amount due her, and</p>
<p class="p10">he having no excuse for its retention than to secure himself for amount of her board in the
     event she should remain at his house to abide his time for a settlement with her &amp;c -
     he acted without authority or protection of the law and became, in a measure, responsible to
     her for his unjustifiable delinquency.</p>
<p class="p10">The Evidence further shows, that Mr Burdette, boarder in house of Mr Booz, did by promises of
     Employment in his family at some future time, influence Cornelia to remain and did thereby
     secure the benefit of her services in his (Burdette's) family without compensation or without
     becoming obligatory for her board. He, therefore, in the opinion of this office, also became
     responsible in a measure to Cornelia for her remaining &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p10">Whereas it is above shown that Each party mentioned in this connection, was equally in the
     wrong. - Mr Booz will pay to Cornelia the sum of $2.50 - Mr. Burdette will also pay her <i>[added: the]</i> same amount, which leaves an equal amount ($2.50) yet due
     on the original claim ($7.50) to be borne by Cornelia</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Roswell Waldo<br>A.S.A. Comr</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. - Amts due Cornelia from Mr Booz
      &amp; Burdette will be forwarded to her thru this office
       To - Mr. Booz<br>
       " Burdett<br>Cornelia Moore<br>Wm Burdett pd $2.50 Nov.
       <i>[illeg.]</i><br>
       " Booz pd $2.50 <i>[illeg.]</i><br>Pd
       the same to Cornelia $5 Nov.
       <i>[illeg.]</i>
