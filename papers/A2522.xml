    <p>We were yesterday marched back from Mt. Jackson where we had been marched the day before at 5
     P.M. 9 miles -- We are now at the same place we were before where the roads passes between two
     streams of water on a narrow ridge -- It is thought Jackson will make a stand. <orig
      reg="Ashby">Asby</orig> is fighting them every day -- one of their cavalry was just taken
      <unclear>in</unclear> as a prisoner -- he is a <orig reg="Marylander">Marlander</orig> -- says
     he is tired of the war -- thought it would only be against So. Carolina &amp; for a short
     time. Our men get very weary &amp; I suppose these moves are to make them used to marching
     -- The 5<hi rend="super">th</hi> Va <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> -- (Augusta) is in a
     sore condition having been marching every day &amp; fighting too. Gen. Jackson <abbr
      expan="received">recd.</abbr> a letter today from Mrs. Lee saying that the Mayor &amp;
     ladies of Winchester buried our dead. The loss on our side in the fight of Sunday was about 470
     in killed, wounded &amp; prisoners. Our prisoners marched through Winchester waving their
     hats &amp; shouting hurras for <abbr expan="Jefferson">Jeff.</abbr> Davis -- the ladies
     cheering them too. It was reported that Ashley had killed 500 of them before Saturday night.</p>
    <p> I see a good many of the Augusta people here, they have come down to look after friends in
     the 5<hi rend="super">th</hi> as the first accounts that reached Staunton were very much
     exaggerated Henry Robertson (the Dr's <abbr expan="brother">bro.</abbr>) is among the missing
     -- Lt. Dale of <unclear>Dayle's</unclear> Co. <pb n="2"/> was killed. One fellow was saved by a
     ball hitting his pocket knife &amp; <unclear>shivering</unclear> it into some 10 pieces --
      <abbr expan="James">Jas.</abbr> Galt had to throw away his gun &amp; everything &amp;
     tore through the fields -- The enemy's cavalry cannot jump fences or stone walls as ours does,
     therefore many of our men escape even when cut off the West Augusta Guards lost one of their
     pieces because a horse was shot &amp; they could not extricate it -- I am in great doubt
     about our dear little Nelly &amp; spend much of the sleepless nights in thinking of her
     &amp; your sorrowing situation --</p>
    <p> I have just been detailed by Gen. Jackson to make a map of this country &amp; must go to
     work at once -- I am unable to get a furlough now but hope I may soon &amp; that God in
     Mercy has spared my beloved child &amp; thus consoled you in your affliction --</p>
    <p> May God mercifully bless you</p>
