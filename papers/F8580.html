<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Thaddeus
                    Stevens, January 24, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McClure writes that Cameron's bid for a Cabinet position seems to be defeated,
                    but McClure believes that Cameron should leave the Republican Party to save it
                    from disgrace.</p>

<p class="p10">DSir --</p>
<p class="p10">There is no doubt but that the Cameron men here have little hope for his success.
                    They regard him as beaten -- or at least left with but the shadow of a chance</p>
<p class="p10">I did not make a legislative movement beyond having a few trusted friends to
                    write separate letters. A clear majority of both branches have signed for
                    Cameron, and many hesitate about acting in any way.</p>
<p class="p10">His forms of intimidation are most remarkable, those who would be ready to go
                    down in sackcloth if he should be appointed, fear that he might strike them in
                    some way if they go for any other person. I have written Maxwell Marshall <i>[deleted: ]</i> &amp; they will act promptly.</p>
<p class="p10">It is Manifest that all his friends here are <i>[unclear: unfriendly]</i> to
                    you. They are open in their denunciation of both Wilmot &amp; yourself. Poor
                    Wilmot. They made him debase himself just enough to make him powerless &amp;
                    then put the knife to him.</p>
<p class="p10">Here is but a single <i>[unclear: hope]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: for]</i> you success -- that is in the event of Cameron being
                    thrown clear overboard by the administration. His late speech looks a little
                    that way, &amp; I trust in God that the old villain means to do our party,
                    the service of his life by leaving it. If he goes out of the Cabinet <u>on terms,</u> both you &amp; Dayton will be overlooked
                    in that case he wants Chase so as to weaken the administration &amp;
                    strengthen himself as the representative of the Tariff interest.</p>
<p class="p10">Lincoln cannot now appoint him without demoralizing himself. I so wrote him to-day
                    <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>If the Breckinridge platform must be presented in Lincolns cabinet, Bigler should be the cabinet
                    officer Lincoln should take the man -- not the ape. Our Republicans here feel
                    greatly outraged; and we shall soon make a record that will make both Bigler
                    &amp; him tremble for their humiliating subserviancy.</p>
<p class="p10">I go home to-day &amp; must be at court all of next
                    week-- certainly until Friday. If anything special is to be done, telegraph me
                    &amp; I will leave.</p>
