<h4>Franklin County: D. O. Gehr to Simon Cameron,
                    January 5, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Gehr wants to write Lincoln about Alexander K. McClure. Gehr considers McClure a
                    lying scoundrel and offers to back Cameron for an appointment to Lincoln's
                    cabinet.</p>

<p class="p10">Hon Simon Cameron<br>Washington
                        City<br>DC</p>
<p class="p10">M<u>r</u>
                    A K McClure in his return from Springfield whilst
                    tarrying for a short time at Pittsburg telegraphed the Philadelphia &amp;
                        N, York papers his return, and the effect produced
                    on M<u>r</u> Lincoln by his visit, From the nature of the
                    Dispatch McClure is evidently making an effort to impose on the President Elect.</p>
<p class="p10">Pennsylvania is desirous of being represented in Mr Lincoln's Cabinet, and there
                    is no other person thought or spoken off for that position
                    than yourself in Pennsylvania the great body of the Republican as well a portion
                    of the Democratic party expect M<u>r</u> Lincoln to have
                    Pennsylvania represented in his<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>by you in whom they have the most
                    implicit confidence upon all the leading Questions which the state of P<u>a</u> are interested, and
                    all national Questions to which the Republican Party are identified M<u>r</u> McClure is aware of all these facts but from his
                    personal hostility to you and probably to be <u>bought off his
                        favorite</u> project, my impression is the only hope left to accomplish his
                    purpose, is to create an impression on the mind of Mr. Lincoln that there is a
                    great diversity of opinion as regards the person and also a formidable
                    opposition in our party against you, therefore P<u>a</u>
                    better be passed by and the position assigned to some one from Jersey, Now sir
                    if M<u>r</u> Lincoln was as well acquainted with this man
                    McClure as I am he would avoid his council as that of the most loathsome
                    &amp; infectious disease, he is <i>[unclear: plausible]</i>
                    untruthfull &amp; corrupt and it will not
                    require any great length of time to find out these qualities and to a stranger
                        <i>[illeg.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>very dangerous man, and from the character of
                        M<u>r</u> Lincoln as represented and which I firmly
                    believe to be correct I do not think he would take council from <i>[deleted: from]</i> any such a man as McClure or those connected with him after a
                    more intimate acquaintance.</p>
<p class="p10">I have no personal acquaintance with M<u>r</u> Lincoln but as
                    one of his Electors in the College from the 17<u>th</u>
                    District I desire to address a letter to Mr Lincoln stating the position you
                    occupy as regards the Republican Party and the interest which the State has in
                    your having the position designated by P<u>a</u> in his Cabinet and also to inform him
                    partially who McClure is, his character &amp;c if agreeable to you.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your most<br>obedient servt</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
