<h4>Augusta County: F. S. Tukey to Unknown, July 26, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Tukey provides an initial assessment of the AMA's operation in Staunton, stating, "It will as you are aware be a new field of operations and Subject to many privations not common to old districts, among other things.  I think the temper of the people is verry bad, but those things have got to be overcome."  He estimates that the population of Staunton is "about 5000 what the colored alone is."

<p class="p10">It will as you are aware be a new field of opperations and Subject to many privations not common to old districts, among other things.  I think the temper of the people is verry bad, but those things have got to be overcome  So I will not waste words about them now as I am in a Hurry, if Mr. Whipple<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> will commission Miss <i>[unclear: Mcleune]</i> and her Sister Mrs Annie E. Dunn and any others they may see fit I will house them upon the same terms here as I proposed in Portsmouth, provided I can have an immediate answer which circumstances make it absolutely necessary that I should have.  So that I can govern myself accordingly, So you will do me a favor to answer this at once the address of these Ladies is <i>[unclear: Milltown]</i> Me hopeing to hear from you at once I am with</p>
