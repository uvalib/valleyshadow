                        campaigne if I remain here, at Brigade Head
                    Quarters, == So you must not be unconcerned about me not coming home, == <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> There is six of us Blacksmiths here together,
                    and we, always have comfertable quarters, = And
                    always get rations of the very best and Double the rations of, all others
                    because we do more Duty. = We are boarding with a family here in town and are
