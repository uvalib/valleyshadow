<p class="p10">March 3<sup>d</sup> 1861 </p>
<p class="p10">Richmond </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mother </p>
<p class="p10">Without any thing from you to answer I have seated
                    myself to write to you. As you see by the papers the peace conference has made a
                    report. A report which I fear the convention will adopt. If it does <u>woe</u> to Virginia this proud old mother of states. For
                    close upon the heals of such a cowardly submission will
                    follow in "the course of common law" (which the republicans and such men as
                    Botts and that ilk say does not recognise slavery)
                    a general exodous of the owners of slaves with their
                    slaves, and with the money for their lands in their pockets. Then will come
                    dishonor disgrace and repudiation. Then will this fair land be polluted with the
                    presence of hoards of yankees and other such like vermin. Then will Stuart,
                    Summers, Rives, S. McD.More, and Botts lift their heads and glory in the
                    consciousness of having acquired high offices among their colaborers the abolitionists by selling and
                    disgracing their native state.</p>
<p class="p10">Tere is but one way to avert such dire calamities to the
                    old commonwealth and that is by revolution. Some will say that the remedy is
                    worse than the disease -- but sooner would I see this fair land dreanched in the blood of contending brothers than to
                    see such a fate as the submissionist are preparing<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> for her
                    accomplished. If it must be so I am a rebel and ameanable to the law of reason. But trusting in "God and keeping my
                    powder dry" I intend to make the best fight I can. And I think there are enough
                    of my way of thinking to inaugurate a revolution which will be triumphant. There
                    is no news here every thing appears to be at a stand still. I saw Dr. Shelton
                    down here a day or two ago he says that Mr. A. McChesney had been sick but was
                    then well.</p>
<p class="p10">Has Frank got his tobacco yet.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to all kind friends. Cousin Mary will write soon she can give
                    you the news or rather such little so is stiring.
                    Hoping all are well I remain your affectionate son. </p>
