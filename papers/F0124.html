<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Mon 16th</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Falmouth</p>
<p class="p10">Brother Cyrus</p>
<p class="p10">I take the present opportunity to let you know that I have received your most welcome letter
     dated March 8th on the 14th but had no opportunity to write until at present - when I will let
     you know that I am still enjoying the same state of good health which I am proud of and I am in
     hopes these few lines may find you and all the rest of our family and friends and acquaintances
     enjoying similar blessings</p>
<p class="p10">Further I let you know that you mentioned in your letter about Brother John I sent him a
     letter already I sent one a few days after the time I sent one to you I cant see the reason <i>[illeg.]</i> Engle got a letter 2 days before I got mine and
     they were dated and mailed the same day. Cyrus you said this Sunday morning you would write to
     me Sunday I dont know what that is we dont
     have any such a day or at least there is no difference in the days You also said that you and
     John <i>[unclear: Gossie]</i> were at <i>[unclear: Lehafferstown]</i> and got on a spree. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I wish I could have enjoyed that time not for the sake of the spree but the fun and
     then the girls I would like to <i>[illeg.]</i> one once Cyrus Engle and myself request you to
     have a few girls engaged for us until we get home so that we have no trouble to hunt some only
     to jump right in up to the knees. Brother Daniel was on a visit to me once to and I am very
     sorry for Jonathan that he is unwell I am going to write to him today I think you felt like a
      (<i>[illeg.]</i>) the time you fell in the creek. I think you made tracks for home then news
     is very scarse we have good times and nothing to do we only work
     about three days in a week that is doing orderly duty the rest of the time lay in camp and
     sometimes go on Patrole and take prisoners from one place to the
     other. they are again working at the pay rolls and we expect to be paid soon which is the
     report - but these reports come so often and the pay day never makes its appearance. I am out
     of postage stamps and can not get any here you will please and send me some by your next letter
     and you will oblige me very much give my best respects to Father Mother and Brother</p>
<p class="p10">so much of your Brother</p>
