    <p>I wrote to sister yesterday and write this morning because <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr>
     M. wishes to enclose a letter in mine. I have had no trouble in having my clothes washed so
     far. I want you to send me the receipts for making buns those sweet <orig reg="rolls"
     >roles</orig> you <orig reg="used">use</orig> to make as we have no use for our sugar, and how
     to cook potatoes cut up under meat and to fry them. I like camp life so far very much. All the
     cavalry forces we have are concentrated near hear except Robertson who we are looking for every
     day. I hear that Gen. Beauregard is to take charge of Jackson Corps. God has certainly taken a
     great man from us. No one hear thinks that his place can be filled. </p>

    <p>Maggie is looking nearly as well now as when I left. I never knew a horse to become as much
     attached to any one in my life. I have been offered $800 for her several times. Tell uncle
     Archer if Pa is not at home to know what Mr. Billy Barwell will take for his brown horse and if
     he will take $500 for him to let me know as Capt Steptoe wants a horse and cannot get one at
     any price. There is no news. Never forget to mention him in your letters and tell him to try
     and get well. Tell Sister &amp; cousin K I don't want such short letters. Love to all.</p>

    <closer>
     <salute>I am your attached son,</salute> This version of the letter has been transcribed from a
     previously transcribed (by an unidentified transcriber), printed version that has been
     published by VMI. <signed>Kent</signed>
