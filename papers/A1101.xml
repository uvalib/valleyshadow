                <p>Staunton, the place of my present sojourn, is a beautiful town, of some four or
                    five thousand inhabitants, situated in a little valley, completely hemmed in by
                    immediately surrounding hills. It is a little north of east from Richmond, and
                    west of south from Winchester--nearly equidistant from either point. The
                    supplies for our army in Virginia are now mainly transported to this point by
                    railroad, and thence to the army by wagons. There are a number of hospitals
                    here, which are rapidly overflowing with an excess of sick and wounded soldiers
                    who daily arrive from the army. There were originally two newspapers here, both
                    of which have been suspended until recently. The "Spectator" has been resumed,
                    but does not present the appearance of probable success. There is at present but
                    one hotel in the place, and that is crowded to overflowing; it is called the
                    "Virginia Hotel."--The former "American" Hotel, situated immediately on the
                    Railroad; has been appropriated by the Government for hospital purposes.</p>
                <p>The time which I am necessarily enforced to remain here, drags very heavily on my
                    hands--especially as my health is not good. Like most of towns in Virginia,
                    little is to be seen but moving masses of soldiers, ambulances, transport
                    wagons, floating officers of all grades, men and women in search of <orig
                        reg="sick">sich</orig> or wounded relatives, etc.</p>
                <p>We get no news of importance from the army. Conjecture and speculation are rife,
                    but nothing definite in reference to the plans of our Generals is permitted to
                    reach the public. The Richmond papers profess to see farther through a mill
                    stone than their neighbors, but I doubt if they know sufficient to speak by the
                    card. One thing is certain, the interval of rest which is being afforded our
                    army, cannot but be conducive to good results. Clothing and food are being
                    furnished the soldiers, the ranks are filling up, health is improving, and in a
                    few days the troops will be fully prepared, as they are anxious, to welcome the
                    enemy to another contest of arms.</p>
                <p>It is stated that no less than ten Georgia Colonels were acting Brigadier
                    Generals at the battle of Sharpsburg! Thus it will be seen that Georgia troops
                    and Georgia officers have no inconsiderable proportion of the risks and burthens
                    of this war to encounter. But what becomes of the Generals, whose places it is
                    thus necessary to fill, in the thick of flight?--That is a question, I
                    apprehend, which President Davis and the War Department would do well to
                    consider. While the poor, worn down privates are being goaded on to the army
                    almost at point of bayonet, is there not some way to reach and compel laggard
                    officers to the discharge of their duty? If "stragglers" are to be dealt with
                    summarily, let there be no distinction made between officers and men; it is as
                    much incumbent upon the one class to be at their post as the other.</p>
                <p>Col. Douglas' brother left here this morning <hi rend="underline">en route</hi>
                    for Shepherdstown, to procure and have carried home, if possible, the dead
                    hero's body. It is interred at the last mentioned place, and I apprehend there
                    will be no difficulty in getting it, even if the enemy should be in possession
                    of the town--which I am not sure is the fact. Col. Mercer of the 21st Georgia,
                    passed up with <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lieut.</abbr> Douglas; <abbr
                        expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Stiles left here yesterday also, to join his
                    command.</p>
                <p>I am informed by <abbr expan="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Marcer, that <abbr
                        expan="Captain">Capt.</abbr> Nisbet, of his regiment, who was reported
                    killed at Sharpsburg, was not injured, being at the time of that battle, in
                    Richmond on business.</p>
