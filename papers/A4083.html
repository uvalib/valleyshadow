      </u> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Bottetourt Springs</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sara:</p>
<p class="p10">Capt Sterrett is here &amp; says he is going on &amp; will have a chance to send you
     a letter -- so I avail myself of the opportunity, tho' very tired
     &amp; wanting rest -- I have not yet heard <u>directly</u> from you, but
     generally from the neighborhood &amp; suppose you got along like the rest of the community
     &amp; may thank God that it is no worse -- I cannot come to lament the loss of my excellent
     friend &amp; neighbor Harvey Bear, one of the most unobtrusively good men I have ever known
     -- I do most sincerly condole with his afflicted family -- I saw
     poor James &amp; he could only speak of it with the tears welling to his eyes. I wrote to
     you from Charlottesville -- we went the next day to Lynchburg on the cars, taking our horses
     along -- we found the enemy three miles from there &amp; had a little skirmish with them in
     which young Tinsley of Staunton was killed, our loss very small, in numbers &amp; we drove
     back the advance of the enemy with considerable loss to them -- our whole corps got up Saturday
     &amp; we prepared to attack the enemy on all sides Sunday morning, but during the night the
     Vandals ran away -- we followed them as far as Liberty in Bedford Co. Sunday, 25 miles over a
     rocky &amp; dusty road<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>picking up some stragglers &amp; killed a few in a
     skirmish -- we kept up the pursuit Monday -- all day -- hot &amp; dusty, an occasional
     fight with the enemys rear, to Buford's Gap in the Blue Ridge -- the
     enemy plundering &amp; burning as they went stripping every house of all its provisions,
     driving off the stock of all kinds &amp; in many cases tearing up the clothes &amp;
     plundering the trunks &amp;c of the citizens -- we could not get a chance to fight them --
     they moved so rapidly -- we sent our cavary round to Salem, by Buchanan, to cut off the enemys retreat through the Mts. &amp; yesterday our weary &amp;
     hungry men pressed on after them &amp; Ransom with the cavalry got to the Gap which they
     were passing through &amp; fell on them &amp; captured &amp; brought off 4 pieces
     of artillery &amp; 5 caissons 140 artillery horses &amp; some 200 cav. Horses a lot of wagons &amp; some 150 prisoners &amp; made them burn up
     some 20 wagons 6 pieces of artillery which we afterwards got -- our cavalry hung on their
     flanks &amp; rear all day &amp; did them considerable damage, but our infantry could
     not get up until they had all gotten through the Gap -- for many of our men had had no bread
     for 3 days -- we had marched so fast &amp;<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>far that the commissary wagons could
     not get up -- The cavalry has gone on after the enemy &amp; we are all in camp today in the
     vicinity of Botetourt Springs resting &amp; getting up on our rations &amp; washing My
     shirt is if anything a shade darker than the ground -- have not had any clean clothes in 10
     days, but William is washing now -- &amp; I hope to be clean once more -- our wagons are up
     with us this morning for the first time since we left Charlottesville -- we have been getting
     along the best we could &amp; the people have been very kind to us although they have
     suffered so terribly from the Yankees -- we spent last night at the Bot. Sps. (Hollins Institute) there is no school here now, a
     fever in the Spring took off 6 young ladies &amp; they closed the school -- one of the Miss
     Chapmans from <i>[unclear: Lanz]</i> is here &amp; quite anxious to go home --</p>
<p class="p10"> As I wrote to you from C. I expect to see you all soon -- without rendering any <u>military</u> reason &amp; you need not tell any one <u>either</u>! Though I know we shall both be glad to see <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>each other -- I cannot
     write more now -- so good bye &amp; the Lord bless you all </p>
<p class="p10">Your Aff husband</p>
