<h4>Franklin County: Diary of Lippitt, Charles Edward (1863)<br>
</h4>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Charles Edward Lippitt records in his diary a description of a rainy march in Pennsylvania and the attitudes of the people the army encounters.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b></b></p>
<p class="p10">Ordered to march at 4 but as it rained all night &amp; was still inclement did not get off till between 5 &amp; 6. Marched about 3 miles and made a wearisome halt in the rain for Hill to pass through Hagerstown. We followed him, passing through Middleburg, Pa. &amp; camping 1 mile from Greencastle. The march was a most tedious one, rainy all day and the roads very muddy. The country is a fine one, well cultivated and the crop looking well, better than with us. There seems to have been plenty of rain here.</p>
<p class="p10">There was some waving of handkerchiefs in Martinsburg &amp; Williams Port, but even more in Hagerstown. Here the men are sullen and the women obsequious, bowing even at a distance as if to conciliate. All seem afraid we will injure them knowing how well they deserve it, but Lee has issued orders forbidding any one taking or injuring private property execepting the C. S's and Q. M's &amp;c</p>
<p class="p10">Genls Lee, Longstreet &amp; Pendleton passed us today.</p>
<p class="p10">Our march today was about 15 mile. The Dutch farmers say Take de horses take de cattle take eberyting put don't purn de parn don't purn de house &amp; don't hurt de wife &amp; leetle one.</p>
