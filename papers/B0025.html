                    to my house in Highland and have gotten into a right Serious difficulty which I
                    will State. Some of the facts. My Brother and Myself were attacted on the road by Some Rebels who threw Rocks at us and
                    pursued us to the house and Commenced an attact upon
                    us there. They buroke
                    upen windows threw rocks into the house. They kept up
                    the attact for some time hurraying for Rebels and
                    Cursing yankees. My Brother was badly injured from being struck in the face with
                    a Stone. One other man and Myself were Slightly injured the
                    <i>[unclear: dips]</i>: an other union mans house was Stoned the Same night we
                    got a warrant and had one man by the name of Ratcliff arested he said the Reason why we were treated So was because we
                    were claimed Radicals he gave bale for his appearance at
                    Court but I have no Idah that he will be punished and
                    him and others I understand have been making Threats against union men. I wish
                    to know of you if we Cant get some protection by the Military. I think after
                    having Soldiered for the Union I diserve protection
                    in it. I wish you to write to me imediately and
                    let me Know what to do. I Think that I am well able to prove that David hicks was engaged in this thing the man that you saved
                    from punishment last summer he is now Threatening union men.</p>
<p class="p10">I am able to prove to you that <i>[deleted: the]</i> he is nor never has been
                    a loyal man and Charges against him is Correct and he never was employed by the
                    government and I advise you to let the civil law have it
                    affect upon him. I am able to Substantiate what I have Said in this letter by
                    Reliable men. Please write imidiately and let me
                    know what to do </p>
