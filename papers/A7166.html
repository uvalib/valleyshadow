<p class="p10">May 25<sup>th</sup>/69</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Believing that I was carrying out your wishes and acting in accordance with the best interest of our work I have closed the school this day--and have myself left Staunton after more carefully considering the question; as to the expediency of remaining to put up a school house.</p>
<p class="p10">You advised me to remain <u>if I could raise money for that object</u>--and labor to that end for a month.--but after consulting the most interested among the colored people.  I called a meeting last night and the result was a decision that we <u>should not succeed in raising money at this time</u></p>
<p class="p10">I waited still for advice from you but as I received nothing further, and as sickness and other causes had reduced the school--therefore I thought it your wish to close</p>
<p class="p10">The reason why we can not raise money at this time I gave in another letter  I will inform you fully on my return to New York</p>
<p class="p10">The meeting was very encouraging in favor of building</p>
<p class="p10">I am going to Hampton, Norfolk Beaufort and Wilmington</p>
<p class="p10">A letter would reach me at Wilmington <i>[illeg.]</i> early part of next week--or a Telegram at Norfolk--tomorrow (Wednesday)</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>J Scott</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I send the Maps by Express.  It costs only 95 cents.</p>
