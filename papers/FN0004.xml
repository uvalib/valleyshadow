                </opener>
                <p>This has been indeed a gala day in Camp Couch -- a lovely morning, after a
                    succession of rainy days and nights since Friday evening -- a cool delightful
                    autumn afternoon, that brought many visitors to camp from our native city -- a
                    splendid "dress parade," and no less than two sword presentations by our worthy,
                    patriotic and gifted Chaplain -- rendered this one of the most important days
                    that an all-wise Providence has permitted us to enjoy since our departure from
                    Camp Curtin.</p>

                <p>Among the Harrisburgers in camp to-day who came here to visit their friends, I
                    noticed Messrs. Chambers Dubbs, Wm. Bostick, Jr., G.W. Basbore, Mr. May, Mr.
                    Nunemaker, (father of our <hi rend="italic">typo</hi>-sergeant Samuel,
                    Quartermaster-Seargent of Company I(<hi rend="italic">saac</hi>,) as they dub
                    our lively crowd,) besides a number of Harrisburg ladies.</p>

                <p>This afternoon, before conclusion of "dress parade," the regiment was drawn up in
                    proper position to witness the interesting ceremony of a sword presentation.
                    Major John T. Morgan, a gentlemanly and corteous officer of this regiment, was
                    the recipient of a magnificent sword, belt and sash, from his numerous friends
                    and admirers, of West Fairview, Cumberland county.</p>

                <p>The sword was placed in charge of Rev. Mr. Rakestraw, our obliging and worthy
                    Chaplain, and presented to MAJOR MORGAN by his Reverence, in the following
                    words:</p>

                <p>"MAJOR MORGAN -- I am happy to be the medium through which your personal friends
                    of West Fairview have been pleased to present to you this token of their esteem
                    and love for you as a man and a soldier, coming as it does from your personal
                    friends, who are represented here by you townsman, Mr. May. It should give to
                    you the assurance that those whom you love and have left behind, will be
                    protected and cared for in your absence. It was remarked to me on receiving this
                    sword and sash, "That thy had bought you this sword for <hi rend="italic"
                        >service</hi>!" We believe that their confidence in you will not be
                    misplaced, and to <hi rend="italic">their</hi> prayers and good wishes I ask
                        <hi rend="italic">our own</hi>.</p>

                <p>May God bless the hand that wields this sword, not only in preservation of your
                    own life, but in the preservation of this the <hi rend="italic">greatest
                        country which God ever gave to any people</hi>. Take it, and may God bless
                    the donors!"</p>

                <p>Major Morgan replied: REVEREND SIR -- "I am not accustomed to public speaking;
                    yet I cannot refain from expressing my sincere thanks to my friends of West
                    Fairview, for this token of their esteem and good will. I pledge them my word
                    and sacred honor, that I will wield it with a firm hand and strong arm, should
                    occasion require it."</p>

                <p>Three cheers and a "tiger" were then given by the whole regiment, for Major John
                    T. Morgan; after which the most interesting dress parades we have had since our
                    acquaintance with Camp Couch was dismissed.</p>

                <p>After supper, another pleasant affair came off in the shape of a sword
                    presentation. The members of company K, Captain Landis, presented to Second
                    Lieutenant J.H. Snow, of that fine looking company, a beautiful sword and
                    fixtures, through our obliging Chaplain, Rev. Rakestraw. Captain L. drew his
                    company up in line, when Chaplain R. said:</p>

                <p>"LIEUT. SNOW: -- In times of peace the presentation of a sword simply meant
                    something to hang up as a memorial of holiday soldiers; but in times like this
                    it means something more -- it means <hi rend="italic">war</hi>! Coming as it
                    did, from the men of company K, it is a memorial of great respect; and should
                    your gallant captain fall on the battle-field, it would become your duty to take
                    his place; and, should occasion require it, we feel confident that you will not
                    disgrace this offering at their hands."</p>

                <p>Second Lieutenant John H. Snow replied: "That he hoped he might never disgrace
                    the sword his comrades in arms presented to him -- that he should ever be
                    willing and ready to raise it in defence of his country and his country's noble
                    flag. He thanked them for their kind offering, and said he was unable to command
                    language to express his heartfelt gratitude."</p>

                <p>Three cheers were then proposed, and rang out upon the evening air, from a
                    hundred patriotic hearts!</p>

                <p>During the afternoon, a beautiful flag staff was raised in front of Colonel Awl's
                    quarters, and by to-morrow, I presume the</p>

                <p>"--Star spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er this land of the free and the
                    home of the brave!"</p>

                <p>when, doubtless, we shall have another pleasant little episode of military life
                    in Camp Couch to record. </p>

                <p>It was remarked by strangers and others visiting here yesterday, that the
                    regiment was under splendid discipline; and there cerainly is great credit due
                    the officers of the regiment for their untiring efforts to instruct the men
                    under their charge; for be it understood, that a large proportion of the
                    soldiers never had the least knowledge of even the rudiments of military
                    tactics.</p>

                <p>The health of the regiment is, thank Providence, remarkably good. Only a few more
                    additional cases of sickness of a slight nature, have been reported -- and
                    others, since I last wrote you, have again reported for duty. -- Thanks to the
                    prompt treatment and skill of Dr. Wagonseller and his assistants. </p>

                <p>I took a trip, a few days ago, to Chambersburg; and while there making a variety
                    of purchases for my fellow-soldiers of company I(<hi rend="italic">saac</hi>,)
                    I was enabled to learn from prominent business men much of the doings of
                    M'Causland's "Virginia Robbers" (as the Chambersburgers term them) during their
                    twenty-four hours operations in July last. </p>

                <p>Three hundred and sixty odd dwelling houses, stores and public buildings were
                    destroyed by the "chivalry," (nay, fiends of hell is a better term!) and their
                    blackened walls stand there, like so many skeletons, demanding the vengeance of
                    a just and righteous God upon the heads of the drunken, piratical, infidel horde
                    that wrought this uncalled for, unchristian and diabolical piece of mischief. </p>

                <p>A respectable and intelligent shoe dealer informed me: "I had a large store - -
                    employed fifteen to twenty journeymen, made a good living and accumulated a snug
                    little amount. In three hours after the rebels came here I had not even a
                    table-knife and fork to call my own." Now he occupied a little basement store,
                    with a few boxes of shoes, bought on time, to commence life anew. This is <hi
                        rend="italic">one</hi> instance only. Hundreds of others shared the same
                    fate. The loss, Mr. Hutton informed me, will reach <hi rend="italic">four
                        millions</hi> of dollars! In many instances the property of the citizens was
                    destroyed after the "chivalry" had extorted all the ready money that the
                    citizens, so basely outraged afterwards, could command.</p>

                <p>There are also many instances of heroism recorded. Mr. Wm. Burgess, formerly
                    Captain of an ambulance corps, had a fight with a "reb" near Chambersburg
                    somewhere, and placed him <hi rend="italic">hors du combat</hi>. On examination
                    Mr. B. found some $2,000 in U.S. money, and quite a large amount of rebel trash
                        (<hi rend="italic">grey-backs</hi> included!) on his defunct carcass!</p>

                <p>The statement about Dr. Miller burning two Johnnies, in the office of his drug
                    store, is correct. He floored them in some way, then locked them in, when they
                    met the fate they so richly deserved!</p>

                <p>Among the ruins of one particular house, we noticed a cooking stove that had
                    dropped down in the cellar, with all the cooking apparatus yet setting upon it,
                    as if in preparation for breakfast, coffee pots, pans, kettles, &amp;c.,
                    still in proper place.</p>

                <p>The citizens say that if they had made any respectable show of defence, or had
                    had any authority to do so, they could have protected the place, and they
                    attribute their sad misfortune, alone, to <hi rend="italic">red tape- ism</hi>.</p>

                <p>I have much more to communicate, but must "halt" for a future letter. </p>
