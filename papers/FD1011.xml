              <p>From November 3 through 11, the entries in the diary appear to be written by another person. The handwriting is different, as are some of the spelling idiosyncrasies. The handwriting changes the day after Anna Mellinger wrote she was planning on taking a trip and the entries resume in her handwriting after she returns. It is possible she asked someone else in her household to keep a record while she was away.</p>

<head>Biography

</head>
<p>Anna Mellinger was the young wife of a Franklin County farmer.  She kept a diary throughout 1864 when Chambersburg was invaded and burned by Confederate troops.  In it she very briefly describes the invasion and aftermath of the raid.  Most of her diary, however, is concerned with the weather and the everyday activities in and around a Pennsylvanian farm.  She refers often to family members, friends, and church activities.  In November 1864 it appears that someone else wrote in her diary during Mellinger's absence from the farm.</p>
