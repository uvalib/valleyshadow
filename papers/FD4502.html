<h4>Franklin County: Diary of James E. Green, (1863)<br>
</h4>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>James Green writes in his diary about the march into Pennsylvania toward Chambersburg.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b></b></p>
<p class="p10">24th  We left this Camp &amp; Marched off through Greencastle &amp; on to Chambersburg the yanks left day before yesterday.  We expected to have a fight with them here but they left before we got there.  We marched through Town the People looked on us very grum.  They had nothing to say to us only when we spoke to them.  But they appeared very liberel in feeding us, I think it was not out of good will but purely out of feare. For they think we will treat as our Enemys do us in Eastern N.C. &amp; other places, burn them out &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p10">We come on some 3 miles out of Town &amp; Camped.  Gen Daniels Brigade was scatered out on Picket to night.  We thought the Enemy would make a stand here they did not, So we dont know where they intend to fight us.  Neither do I know - how fare we will go if we dont get a fight for we are now some 20 Miles in Pa. &amp; no fight of mutch importance yet, only at Winchester &amp; our Division was not in it.  It was Johnsons Division that Routed them from there.  Run them out of there Breastworks &amp; captured 6000 men with there arms &amp; 64 peaces of Artilery, &amp; all there Commisary stores &amp;c.  Johnsons Division belongs to the Emels Corps, the same to which this (ie) Roads Division belongs  Our men gets there Rations of a Eav. sometimes in the night, so they are up or some of them all night, after marching all day. </p>
