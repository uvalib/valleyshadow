<h4>Augusta County: C. T. Wills to John H. McCue,
                    November 20, 1852<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>C. T. Wills' letter to McCue makes reference to several insurance policies,
                    including a refusal to issue policies involving Irishmen in Staunton. Wills also
                    provides McCue with the names of other companies whose bylaws serve as the basis
                    for the bylaws of the Lynchburg Hose and Fire Company.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b>
                    Mr John H McCue
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Novr 20<sup>th</sup> 1852</p>
<p class="p10">Office of the Lynchburg Hose and Fire<br> Insurance
                            Company</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your favour of the 10<sup>th</sup> Inst. is
                    in hand and its contents noted. Our Directors are gratified at the stand which
                    you have taken as to the risks of the Messrs Shumate, and for the present will
                    decline their propositions. This is not the general course of this Company,
                    under similar circumstances. Where two neighbours
                    (citizens) have difficulties, our Company ordinarily feel no fear in taking a
                    risk for either, but where the difficulty is with a citizen and one of the class
                    of Irishmen such as you have about Staunton on the Rail Road, they always refuse
                    the Risk when the fact of the existence of such a difficulty is made known, for
                    in temper and disposition, that class of Irishmen are regarded as neither fish,
                    flesh or fowl, and the fear always is that in order to vent their spleen or
                    gratify their animosity they would, as is believed, injure the whole world to
                    effect an enemy, in feeling or in property.</p>
<p class="p10">In regards to Mr Woodwards Policy, if the Insurance which he has effected in
                    other companies, does not cover the <u>same property</u>,
                    upon which he has effected Insurance in this, then it is not necessary to
                    endorse the fact upon our Policy, but if it does, then it is must be endorsed,
                    and the amount Insured and the name of company insuring should be furnished to
                    this office to be entered on our Policy Book.</p>
<p class="p10">The Bye Laws of our Company have never been printed,
                    they are all in manuscript, but are shortly to be revised prepatory to printing,
                    and it would take two weeks to copy them. Not being able to furnish you with a
                    Copy, I give on the next pages the names of the Companies from whose Bye Laws ours were Compiled, from the Officers of which
                    companies you can no doubt <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>obtain all the information desired --<br>
                    "Richmond Fire Association" Mr. John H. Bosher Secretary<br> "Mechanical Fire
                    Company of Baltimore"<br> "Associated Firemans Insurance Company" of
                    Baltimore<br> "Baltimore United Fire Department of Baltimore. who the Officers
                    of the three last named Companies are I do not know.</p>
<p class="p10">If you will write to Mr Bosher he will no doubt furnish you with a Copy of the
                        Bye Laws of his Company and give you all the
                    information you may desire.</p>
