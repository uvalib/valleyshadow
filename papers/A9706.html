                    Hon Alex H H. Stuart
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">3<sup>d</sup>. Sep<sup>t</sup>. 1869</p>
<p class="p10">Salt Sulphur Springs M. Co West Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">The letter was r<sup>cd</sup> yesterday,
                    my court here will meet on the 15<sup>th</sup> inst - at which Wm.
                    Spangler has promised me to make a payment on the Stuart land - Times here have
                    been so hard that I told him, if he could <i>[deleted: pay]</i> make a good
                    payment I would not require the whole at this time - I have none of the fund in
                    my hands or I would lend you the cheque you desire - I
                    have r<sup>cd</sup> nothing for several
                    years <i>[added: before]</i>
                    <i>[deleted: I]</i> and <i>[added: nothing]</i> since the
                    termination of the war except Eleven dollars in some matter with Spangler, for
                    which he is entitled to credit on his bonds.</p>
<p class="p10">I will have the bonds &amp; receipts ex<sup>d</sup> as soon as possible and send you a statement
                        <i>[unclear: of]</i> the balance due, and a cheque
                    for <i>[unclear: all]</i> I can get from Spangler at <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>at my next
                        Ct.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr Henry M. Matthews, told Mrs Harrison that Genl Echols said he would dismiss
                    his suit in Charleston vs Erskines Estate, if his (Echols') debts are paid. Will
                    you do me the favor to ascertain and let me know as soon as possible whether
                    this information is correct and to what particular claims it was intended by
                    General Echols to be applied.</p>
<p class="p10">We are endeavouring to sell the property as fast as possible, with a view to
                    paying off all the debts and, if a payment to General Echols embracing no claim
                    which is objectionable, would result in a dismal of
                    the suit I will use every effort to make it before the next term if Judge
                    Jackson could on 22<sup>d</sup>
                    Nov<sup>r</sup>. next.</p>
<p class="p10">Very truly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>N. Harrison</i></p>
<p class="p10">Your injunction presented by the pleadings &amp;
                        proofs in Echols vs. Erskines Adm, which
                            <i>[deleted: it cod in]</i> would involve some time &amp; expense
                        to settle by law - I would much rather, if practicable make
                        an arrangement, which would result in a dismissal of the
                        suit, &amp; afford us an opportunity of suing the
                        entire estate -</p>
