<h4>Augusta County: John D. Imboden to Annie Lockett,
                    November 6, 1870<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Imboden explains another delay in his returning to visit a young woman in
                    Virginia. He blames railroad-related business affairs for the delay.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Sunday night Nov. 6, 1870</p>
<p class="p10">Richmond</p>
<p class="p10">My dear, dear Miss Annie.</p>
<p class="p10">You don't know how much I am grieved at your long silence. I reached here last
                    week confident I should find a letter from you but none has come to hand. Before
                    this reaches you I may, &amp; hope I shall <u>see</u>
                    you. Col. Flournoy left here yesterday and tomorrow
                    I follow him to Danville. On Saturday I am compelled to return to N. York for a few days on business vital to the
                        V.&amp;G.W.R.R. which it would take too
                    long to explain on paper. If it be <u>possible</u> for me to
                    get away from Danville on Wednesday night, I will come down to Keysville and
                    Thursday go to Lombardy <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Grove, spend the night and Friday get back in
                    time for the down train, so as to go on to N.Y.
                    Saturday. But so earnest is my desire to <u>see</u> you, and
                    in person assure you of my unalterable affection, that I mean to do so if it is
                    in the compass of human effort. Our R.R. affairs
                    are in a crisis so vital to the success of the grand scheme that I have
                    subordinated everything to that. If we can accomplish certain objects we have in
                    view in the next two weeks it will be plain sailing for us afterwards. All this
                    I can explain when we meet, &amp; you will then understand what a struggle I
                    have had between my obligations to the <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>public and my personal
                    happiness. One day with you would be a compensation for weeks &amp; months
                    of work and trouble. Should <i>[added: you]</i> ever be my
                    wife our happiness is largely involved in the success of this great R.R. enterprise, for I have a fortune dependent on
                    it. And the very love I bear you has been an additional stimulus to my efforts.
                    Since I parted from you not <u>one</u> day has been at my
                    command. It has been with me like Hood's song of the shirt "Work! Work!!
                    Work!!!" Such a life, unblessed by the love of such a woman as you would be
                    intolerable - but with that reward I am willing to bear it, till <i>[deleted: such]</i> such success crowns the effort as will compensate all the labor.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>Believing we shall meet before this reaches you I will not anticipate
                    on paper what I shall then have to say. I have written to "Sister Lou" tonight
                    &amp; sent her my photograph. I enclose you one, if fate should decree that
                    I may not deliver it in person this week. I did so hope you would be at the
                    Fair. It would have crowned my happiness completely.</p>
<p class="p10">My darling, if you will let me call you so, be patient with me, for I can not
                    help the delay that has kept me from you so long.</p>
<p class="p10">Goodbye - God bless you.</p>
<p class="p10">Sincerely &amp; devotedly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J.D. Imboden</i></p>
