<p class="p10">I am now writing on a bucket turned wrong side up. I sent a letter up to by Mr.
                        <i>[unclear: Garber]</i> did you get it.</p>
<p class="p10">We caught two of the enemy last week. One of them a lieutenant Colonel and
                    another officer we are encamped within eight miles of the enimy and expect a fight evry moment the
                    other day when our troops were coming here they passed through Martinsburg by
                    orders of the general they burned at least one hundred thousand dollars worth of
                    cars for fear the enimy would get possession of them. I
                    wish you would pack my gun up and send it down to Waynesboro and direct Mr. King
                    to give it to Capt Patrick when he starts back to
                    the army send my powder and flask with it you need not send the shot pouch.
                    about twenty of our company<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> are armed with
                    <i>[unclear: carbines]</i> and we cannot get any more and I would like to have
                    my gun you must direct your letters to Winchester if you wish to see what part
                    of Va we are in look on the map of Va at the north-east part in Berkly County and you will see directly across the
                    river a small town named Williamsport we are eight miles this side of there
                    Federal troops are quartered there the number we know not.</p>
<p class="p10">When was the last time you heard from Johnie and how was he</p>
<p class="p10">I am well and hope to finde
                    <i>[added: you the same.]</i> Give my respect to all. </p>
<p class="p10"> </p>
<p class="p10"><i>B.F. Cochran </i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I wish you would send me a dispatch once in a while
                        to read. </p>
