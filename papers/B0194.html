<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: J. Cumming to Thomas P.
                    Jackson, January 8, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Cumming's letter to Jackson pertains to the case of Ann Wallace, a woman who is
                    being sought by her parents in Baltimore. Cumming notes that he did what he
                    could to help her parents find her, but calls them "shiftless."</p>

<p class="p10">Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your favor dated 21 inst. has been received and I say in reply that I do not know
                    where her parents live now. This time last year they were in this city and they
                    called on me and at that time Dr James Miller being in the city I gave his
                    address and I directed them to obtain all necessary information from <i>[deleted: them]</i> him Dr. J Miller in reference to the girl about home
                    you write, I have on several occasions put them on the track of finding his girl
                    but they seem to be such shiftless people that they did nothing. It only remains
                    now to advertise in the "Balti Sun."</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully</p>
