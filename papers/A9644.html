<p class="p10">July 25th 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Campt Near Liberty Mills</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I seat my self once more for the purpose of pening you
                    a fiew lines. I arrived safely in camp on the 21 and have
                    been improveing in health ever since. We have a
                    very nice camp and the water is very good. Our Comp
                    numbers sixty odd at presant; more than we have had
                        presant for some time past. I hope providence may
                    smile on our armies and bless us with health. I found Brother John looking badley again. I was fearful he was taking the fever but
                    think he is somewhat better today. Charles has returned to the camp at last he
                    was <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> to see grand ma. he says he had a grate
                    deal of pleasure. I tried to shame him for treat<i>[added: ing]</i> us all so badley by not writing. he
                    wrote home to day for the first time for the last six months I believe; We have
                    to drill twise a day. Mr. Robt Taylor recieved his discharge to day
                    being over thirty five years of age. he has been a good soldier and I am glad to
                    see him get of
                    honerably.</p>
<p class="p10">Our Regt. has a Chaplain at last he is a Baptist
                        thare was prayer meeting last night &amp; night
                    before. I hope &amp; pray that his teachings may be a benefit to the Regt. &amp; that many may give them selves over
                    unto the true &amp; living God. Our Chaplains name is Wa<i>[deleted: r]</i>ters he is a very good preach<i>[added: er]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">Well Kate I had a wanderfull time Sadurday night of the <i>[unclear: 19]</i> hunting
                    for deserters we all enjoyed our selves finely serrounding the houses &amp; charging <i>[added: the]</i> dogs. We arrested Frank Taylor &amp; brought
                    him as far as Peter Hights; and left him in the charge of Isaac Vines &amp;
                    George Hight untill I could go home &amp; return.
                    About sun up he asked permission to go down to Mr Faubers, a half miles distant.
                    Hight granted his request &amp; Vines went with him. He had not been thare long before he told Ike he wanted to go in annother room to see Mr Fauber who was sick Ike thought
                    all was right &amp; let him go alone &amp; then he made his escape. Ike
                    after looking around for him returned aloan. I had been
                    waiting nearly an hour. We all laughfed at Ike and
                    told him he was a bad sentinel.</p>
<p class="p10">Well Kate I came away &amp; forgot my presants
                    but I hope and pray the day may not be very far distant when I may return
                    &amp; recieve from thee a richer &amp; nobler
                    blessing thy hand &amp; heart. Oh dear Kate with out thee evry thing would be dark &amp; dreary. I would rise up in the
                    morning &amp; lie down at <i>[added: night]</i> with out
                    having any one to whisper the breathings of a pure and umble heart. I must bring my letter to a close. Write soon. My prayer is
                    that you may be blest with all the mercies of our
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> God.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain your true and affectionate admirer</p>
