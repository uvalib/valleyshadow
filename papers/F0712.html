<p class="p10">Aug. 10<sup>th</sup>   
 1862.</p>
<p class="p10">Culpepper</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Old Friend Harry  
 </p>
<p class="p10">I have poor facilities for   
 wri<br>  
 ting, but must do the best I can.  
 You will therefore<br>   
 excuse this roughly gotten up thing.  I was ever so<br>  
 glad to hear from you and read your interesting let-<br>  
 ter, moreover that you were   
 successful in getting<br>   
 the same old school to teach again. I  
 hope your reputa<br>  
 tion in this profession is now established. I want you<br>   
 to keep me posted in school affairs,   
 for although I am now<br>   
 a military man, I still take great interest in   
 education-<br>  
 al subjects. I suppose you've heard of our battle. Our  
 brigade<br>  
 however was not engaged, still we performed some exploits<br>   
 of which I must tell you.  
 Banks   
 whole corps <i>[unclear: ]</i> fought<br>   
 them all Saturday afternoon, and were  
 relieved by McDow  
   
       
   
  
 <p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/BitKin2b.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitKin2b.gif"></center></a><br><br></p>  
 
   
 ells corps in the evening after the infantry  
 fighting was<br>   
 over the rebels as usual poured in upon Banks in   
 overpow<br>  
 ering numbers, and why our   
 (McDowell's) corps was<br>  
 not ordered up in time I cannot tell. The rebels were<br>   
 retreating however when   
 Banks men were  
 ordered to halt<br>   
 because he had not men enough to follow up what  
 other<br>  
 wise would have proved a glorious victory. The papers<br>   
 will give you the particulars better than I can state them here.<br>  
 When we neared the battlefield late in the evening we<br>   
 met lots of our own wounded returning to   
 Culpepper, where,<br>  
 our Chaplain told us the citizens treated them very kindly,<br>   
 the women assisting in dressing their wounds. We had<br>   
 been listening to the roar of artillery and could see the smoke<br>   
 of the battle all P.M. of Saturday, from our camp 1 mile south<br>   
 of <i>[deleted: the battle]</i><i>[added:   
 Culpepper]</i>,  
 and when we saw the wounded, we felt like<br>   
 taking revenge. When we came within a mile and a half<br>   
   
       
   
 
 <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/BitKin2c.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitKin2c.gif"></center></a><br><br>  

   
 of the battle ground, our brigade was halted; our regiment<br>   
 received its mail here, and we fell to reading  
 letters by can<br>  
 dlelight; this drew the fire of a rebel battery, and  
 some half<br>   
 dozen solid shot fell right in among us, wounding four<br>   
 men of our regiment. One ball fell about three yards from where<br>   
 I stood, we stood this like heroes for a short time, then we<br>   
 were ordered back a short distance, but advanced again   
 <br>  
 til we came within 300 yards of  
 the same battery which was<br>   
 firing upon us, and  which with several others,  
 had opened<br>   
 out again with the purpose of ascertaining our position  
 as<br>  
 well as of the rest of the large number of   
 McDowell's corps<br>  
 which had silently advance under cover of the dark, but they<br>   
 fired far above our  
 heads, and we lay listening to the loud<br>   
 and crashing roar of the dogs  
 of war in perfect safety. present-<br>  
 ly the battery belonging to our  
 (Duryee's) brigade let loose upon<br>   
 the one which fired into the 107<sup>th</sup> and  
 silenced it. This de-<br>

 <i>[added: railed]</i> their whole programme, and we could hear them falling<br>  
 back although in good order.  Next morning we found two<br>   
 dismounted guns, 9 dead horses, and two   
 Lieuts. killed, one<br>  
 having his head shot off.  If we had not did this, they<br>   
 would have continued to kill us, while their infantry would<br>   
 have advanced, and perhaps have proved too strong<br>   
 for us then, as our main force only came in the next day.<br>   
 We have been watching the enemy ever since, yesterday<br>   
 they commenced retreating on account of   
 Burnside  
 getting<br>  
 in their rear, The reason  
 we have not advanced upon them<br>   
 since our whole army is here is because  
 they occupied a strong<br>   
 position on a high knoll.  Abe got a letter  
 from Pap   
 which<br>   
 says 9 men from Corrstown,   
 including   
 Bro. Harry have  
 enlisted<br>   
 in Reeds Co.   
 Chambersburg.  Bully for them.  Its  
 uncommonly<br>  
 warm here now.  Soldiers live on secesh roasting  
 <i>[unclear: cans]</i>.  Cant<br>   
 get my picture taken now, No artist here.
