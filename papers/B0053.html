<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Sarah A. Craig to Thomas
                    P. Jackson, June 1, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In a letter written by her son, Sarah Craig disputes the claims of a former
                    slaver of hers, Ellen Taylor. Among other things, she states that she is not
                    responsible for any thing that happened before the emancipation.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    Tho<sup>s</sup> P. Jackson,<br>Agent
                        Freedman's Bureau<br>Staunton, Va.
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">June 1<sup>st</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Near Middlebrook</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">yesterday Archibald Smith came for the things that Ellen Taylor had left in my
                    care until she sent for them; these I let him have &amp; such other things
                    as I could spare.</p>
<p class="p10">I too was greatly astonished, when I saw the letter from you, concerning the
                    wages of said Ellen as I thought we were square. As to the crop of <u>Corn</u> &amp; <u>Potatoes</u>
                    raised by Toby Taylor (Ellens Husband) I will say that I had to study awhile
                    before I knew what it meant; then I recollected that told Toby that he might
                    have a piece of corn (about an Acre) if he would attend to it; but unfortunately
                    for him he took sick and died before the corn was gathered.</p>
<p class="p10">I also told him he might have a piece of ground for <u>Potatoes</u>; he planted them, <i>[deleted: and died before they came]</i>
                    but they were never gathered in, they rotted in the ground. This you see was
                    before the negroes were free (in 1864) so I think I am clear of that.</p>
<p class="p10">As to <u>Ellen's</u>
                    <u>wages</u>, I told her when she first was set free that I
                    would give her her victuals &amp; clothes if she would stay with me. She
                    stayed until about 2 months ago, when she left; and now I think it would be
                    great injustice for me to have to repay her.</p>
<p class="p10">I sent you a note by A. Smith stating that I would be in town in a few days
                    &amp; see you but other arrangements makes me write this to you instead. I
                    hope this will make all things right.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Res</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Sarah A. Craig</i></p>
