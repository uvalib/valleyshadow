</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>As the new agent in Staunton, Jordan reports that he knows of no injustices
                    committed against freedmen in the courts and states that he will not let cases
                    go before local Magistrates in whom he does not have confidence.</p>

                    Va dated Richmond Va
                    March 12<sup>th</sup> 1866 concerning the result of the operation of
                    the "Order" restoring to the "Civil Courts" jurisdiction over colored persons in
                    criminal cases. I have the honor to report as follows, viz.</p>
<p class="p10">I have no cases to report in which any authority vested with the power of
                    regulating the institution of criminal proceedings has refused justice to a
                    colored person by improperly neglecting a complaint or <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>by declining
                    to receive an oath or sworn information tendered by a colored person &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p10">At the last term of the Augusta Co Court there was
                    but one case before the Court in which a colored person appeared as a party to
                    the action which case was continued by reason of the absence of material
                    witnesses.</p>
<p class="p10">It is my intention as soon I become acquainted with the Magistrates in my new
                    field of operation to permit no cases to go before those officers in whom I have
                    no confidence and to continue as far as is possible the adjudication of
                    difficulties in which freedmen are interested in my office.</p>
