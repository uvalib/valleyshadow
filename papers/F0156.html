<p class="p11"><b>
     George M. Miller
    </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Jan'y 10<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester, Va</p>
<p class="p10">George M. Miller </p>
<p class="p10">Friend George I suppose you will be surprised when you find this letter is from your old
     friend Sam Pile, well its a fact. I am still alive and well, I suppose
     you wonder how in the devil I come to be all the way here in Virginia. I can tell you that best
     another time.</p>
<p class="p10">I hear that you are still at your old business, making legars,
     setting rabbit looops and fishing, take my advice and stick too it, for
     it is a darned sight better than soldering, that is in the wrong
     cause.</p>
<p class="p10">Well George I've been knocking about this Southern Confederacy considerably since I wrote to
     you last.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and a devil of a time I've had I dont know where
     I will strike to next, the next time you hear from me I will tell you something it would not
     pay to tell it at the present time. George I hear that Al Weiser is dead, poor Natty we have
     had many a gay time together The 87 Rgt P.V. is now at this place. I was somewhat surprised
     when I found it out, I was mighty glad to see many of my old friends, and to hear from old York
     for it has been a long while since I heard from there last</p>
<p class="p10">I want you to write me a long, long, letter, as soon as you get this and tell me what you
     have been doing for the last two years. direct your letter to Miss Maggie Burnett Winchester
     Va. now I know<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> you will wonder what that means, it means I will be more likely to
     get it if addressed to a lady, dont fail to write. Whisky is a scarce
     article in this part of the world, only eight dollars a quart for stuff that would burn the
     hair off a dog, when you write pour some on the paper then mabe I will
     get a smell. If you see any of my folks tell them you heard from me. If you can send me some
     York papers, to the same address. </p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to all enquiring friends, be a good democrat
     and hate abolitionists and you will stand a good chance in the next world.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Sam Pile </i></p>
