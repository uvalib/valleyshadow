                <p>I <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> your &amp; Mary's letter day before
                    yesterday &amp; was glad to hear from you all. I hope Bells mouth will get
                    well soon. The next letter you write tell if two little books come in the mail
                    for Josey and Lucy. I put them in the post office down in Harrisburg. Our
                    Regiment is about <orig reg="organized">organised</orig>. I saw the Colonel
                    yesterday he had just arrived. Our Surgeon was here a few days ago &amp;
                    went off before I could see him. Our Captain was trying to get me a position but
                    as the doctor is away at this time I am not sure of it. I have tried all I could
                    &amp; hope to get it yet. I have been in the hospital for a few days
                    attending one of our men who has the fever. Our regiment is the 16th <abbr
                        expan="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr> Cavalry &amp; I think I will get a
                    position yet as I intend watching close for it. You need not be uneasy about me
                    as I will try the best that I can. The night after I <orig reg="received"
                        >recieved</orig> your letter I dreamed I was at home. I could get a furlough
                    but want to wait awhile yet. The drafted men are coming in here very fast. Will
                    soon fill this camp. I expect you misunderstood me about the battle. We went
                    onto the cars but never got out of Harrisburg as they were getting dispatches
                    all day and at last heard that the rebels left Chambersburg so we went back to
                    our old camp &amp; are here yet. One of my messmates Thomas J. Marshall is
                    going home today to stay 3 weeks if you could send me a pair sock to Caldwells
                    Tavern on the Pike he will bring them to me. Mary &amp; you will consider
                    this answer to both your letters. Tell Josey when I go home I will get him a
                    drum. I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> get it now. I have nothing more to write
                    at present but hope that you will still remember me in your prayers &amp;
                    may God bless you all in my prayers.</p>
