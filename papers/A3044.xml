                <p> For fear that you may come to the conclusion that I did not receive your last
                    letter or that I don't intend to answer it, I will embrace the present
                    opportunity of replying. We left our old camp 5 miles below Winchester on friday
                    the 21<hi rend="super">st</hi>, crossing the <unclear>Massanutten</unclear>
                    Mountain at New Market. We then marched up the river towards Swift Run Gap to
                    the ford near the "Columbia Bridge" (which was burnt by <abbr expan="Colonel"
                        >Col</abbr> Ashby to prevent <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Shields from
                    cutting off our forces in their retreat from Winchester to Port Republic) where
                    we crossed &amp; proceeded to the Blue Ridge, crossing into Madison County
                    about 12 miles from the Court House and on the road leading directly to
                    Gordonsville. We are now about 16 miles from that place on the road leading from
                    Madison C.H. to Orange C.H. and about 1 mile from the former place.<pb n="2"/>
                    We have <orig reg="traveled">travelled</orig> over 100 miles being on the march
                    6 days. I must say that I have never passed over such a country before &amp;
                    hope I never shall again. Some times we would travel for two miles &amp; not
                    be over one hundred yards from where we started, I mean in a straight line. We
                    were one whole day crossing the mountain, &amp; then didn't get over. lay
                    one night in the mountain amongst the rocks &amp; brush with no covering.
                    Save what could be made of oil cloths &amp; blankets it being <orig

                    of that? Well I have no news, so I will have to confine myself to <hi

                    have to stop &amp; eat a while &amp; then finish. Well I have eatten my

                    </unclear>. I will now give you some idea of the prices we have to pay for our
                    little nicknacks. Apples the size of <unclear>milled</unclear> walnuts sell at a
                    1$ per day. Half moon <unclear>pris</unclear> with two cherries in 75 cents a

                    whole army is on this side of the Ridge, making preparations to meet Burnside in
                    his advance upon Richmond, which I suppose from all accounts will not be long.
                    My impression is that we will go to Richmond before long some of the troops it
                    is said are going off on the cars now. well I must bring this to close, as I am
                    too cold to write any more.</p>
