<p class="p10">May 15, 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Harpers Ferry</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Ma</p>
<p class="p10">I got here today and found all well &amp; very glad to see me and got my office. Capt
     Patrick seemed glad to see me he said he intended writing to Pa but had been very busy. I was
     about leaving for Shepherdstown when we got orders to get ready to leave at once but after we
     were told to march at 8 oclock tomorrow morning. I expect we will go to Shepherdstown. Everyone
     is talking about the way they were treated at Shepherdstown &amp; are anxious to go there
     again they were so well treated. I will have no difficulty in getting along. I went down to see
     Eddie Waddell. He was glad to see me &amp; said he wished he was in our company. Saw also
     Lipscomb. Both are looking well. Camp life seems to agree with them. I left Clinton at
     Stroudsburgh &amp; gave him money to pay his way home. I wish he could have come to the
     Ferry. There is about 11000 men here now. You can see tents &amp; soldiers all over the
     place. We are in camp in a large brick house in the upper part of Bolivar. It is only a few
     hundred yards to Capt Baylors company. There is a regiment of 1100 men just left here for
     Shepherdstown or Martinsburg. I will write you from where I am to go. I think to Shepheredstown
     I will go &amp; see the folks. Tell Pa I will write to him next &amp; will write to you
     all the first chance I have. The Capt myself &amp; the officers all sleep in the same room.
     I will sleep with Irvine. I am very well pleased with camp life. Give my love to all. Excuse
     this short &amp; badly written letter as I am very busy fixing things. I am very glad you
     put so many little articles in my trunk. Write soon. I got Charley letter with no trouble and a
     piece of the Dispatch. I will read it and take good care of myself. You need have no fears of
     me keeping bad company or anything of that kind.</p>
<p class="p10">From your affectionate son</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W B Gallaher</i></p>
<p class="p10">Kiss the little folks for me. My horse stood the travel very well. I had
      her put on the cart at Winchester &amp; brought down. It did not cost me much. Give my
      respect to all. Write soon.<br> Your son<br>William <br> Tell Pa to keep a sharp look out
      in the farm yard &amp; at the stable. I have never seen anything wrong but if they are so
      inclined they have a very good chance. The reason Guy wrote to me to come he could not enlist
      as a substitute unless he would enlist for 12 months &amp; he said he did not want me to
      lose my place. He is going home Monday &amp; will be back in a week &amp; join our
      company or get an appointment as he is trying very hard to get the adjutants place in the
      Regiment. I will get Capt Patrick to sign the certificate for my horse &amp; send to you
      next week.<br>
      <br>Your son<br>William <br> Love to all. Tell Mr. Evans to make me a pair shoes like the
      ones he made me &amp; send down with Ed Waddells. They are too narrow at the toes. I can
      get along with the boots.</p>
