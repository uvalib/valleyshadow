<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, April 11, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch responds to his wife's worries regarding confiscation of their
                    property by Federal soldiers. He assures his wife he has enough money to sustain
                    the family, and to not worry too much if some property is lost. He also
                    complains about his loneliness and his suffering from rheumatism. He urges his
                    wife to come to Staunton if things become too difficult at home.</p>

<p class="p10">April 11/64</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">Through the extreme kindness of a friend I propose to try &amp; get you a few
                    lines. I have been quite disabled from Rheumatism for some three (3) weeks most
                    of the time confined to my room &amp; a good portion to my bed &amp; now
                    whilst I write I am in the greatest misery, but hope so soon as the weather
                    clears up &amp; settles I will be relieved Louise, Hen, &amp; Jenny are
                    all well, fat &amp; saucy We are still running the machine &amp; doing
                    quite well My papers not yet come on look for them daily</p>
<p class="p10">I heard through a friend a few days ago from you in which I am enformed that you are in a peck of trouble about the
                    confiscation of our property Well first no property will be permanently
                    confiscated until after the war (<u>certain</u>) and a claim
                    to it now is all a farce &amp; of short duration. So far as ours is
                    concerned if they will take it now let it go. I have plenty here to keep us well
                    during our lives if properly managed. dont let this
                    matter weary you one particle but just take it as it comes &amp; if
                    unpleasant for you there or if you are in any way in need come out here at once
                    or at any time you can &amp; may desire <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I have a good place here
                    for you and only wish you were here now, to help to cheer up my dull gloomy
                    hours that I spend in my lonely room only relieved occasionaly by the dropping
                    in of some friend The doctor being my most constant visiter. George Schoppert rubbed my back by the fire last night until it
                    is now in blisters. his family is well. M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> J. Thomas family are now boarding with us which adds something more to our
                    society Col Hoge &amp; a host of other lower
                    Valley friends surround our tables &amp; makes it seem <i>[added: more]</i> like old times</p>
<p class="p10">The last word I got from you was dull &amp; gloomy and in a desponding tone
                    which I regreted much to see as previously you spoke so hopefull &amp;
                    cheerful &amp; all things seemed bright. But I hope you will soon dispel
                    these dark gloomy cloud<sup>s</sup> &amp; look forward to
                    brighter days. I spend portions of my time in reviewing your pictures thus
                    calling to mind lovely recollections of the past similar to which I hope soon to
                    be returned</p>
<p class="p10">Capt Brown is here &amp; well the men generally
                    from our section are well. I will try &amp; write you more fully when I get
                    better I want you all here whenever you can come out</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J Q A Nadenbousch</i></p>

                        that you may in future regret take things cool</p>
