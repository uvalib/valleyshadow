<p class="p10">My Dear David,</p>
<p class="p10">I have your dear &amp; welcome letter of the 29 I was so glad to hear of your
                    safe arrival home. I thank you my love for your cheering words in regard to my
                    becoming satisfied in my new home. I shall be so for the sake of my dear papa he
                    loves to see his family happy as much as any one in
                    the world &amp; I shall let him see that I am not an ungrateful child
                    &amp; that I will love him when, &amp; where
                    ever he goes. My dear kind papa Oh! <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>how earnestly I do wish I
                    could keep every Earthly trouble &amp; anxiety from his pathway through life
                    &amp; at last insure him a home in Heavan, but I
                    cannot May God bless him is my heartfelt prayer. I wish you could step in at
                    this time you would think we are going away by the appearance of every thing in &amp; out of the house. I think
                    we shall all be very happy in our new home this winter if we live &amp; can
                    keep pa with us all the time, &amp; I think we shall have the mail arranged
                    all as we wish. I could not be contented two long weeks without hearing from
                    you. one of the greatest pleasures I have is getting your dear letters &amp;
                    answer <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>-ing them. &amp; I do hope that pleasure will not be kept
                    from me at Buffalo. I hope for the best in this as in all other affairs of life.
                    I know you will still love me but then I like best during the two weeks that you
                    are away from me to read the dear, &amp; sincere expressions of your
                    affection in your letters. I do love to read them. They tell me how dear I am to
                    you my love. Your letters are dear &amp; welcome to my heart. I read them
                    over many times.</p>

                        day with us. Miss Regina told me to tell you that she was very sorry
                    she did not get to see you last Sabbath. I have concluded not to spend the
                    winter down the Valley but to go with my dear pa to our Buffalo home. I shall be
                    far <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>happier there doing my duty &amp; then I can see you often my
                    love if I went to Page I could not see you &amp; I would rather be with you
                        then all on Earth. I would rather be where I could
                    see you then all other places in the world. I am happy
                    then very happy. I feel as if I have just what is dearest to my heart with me
                    &amp; I ask for nothing more only that I might always have you with me. I
                    cannot yet tell if I shall go to Buffalo by Staunton. If I do you shall know I
                    would love so much to go with you to Staunton I will tell you if I live in time

                    go &amp; here where you &amp; I have spent so many sweet &amp; happy
                    hours together the very happiest hours of my life I have spent here with you my
