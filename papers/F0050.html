<p class="p10">Dear John, </p>
<p class="p10">I can't just exactly say when I last wrote to you but I know there has been no
                    chance to write or mail a letter for over a week. And it has been an eventful
                    week. A mail arrived to-day and as there will be a chance to return a letter by
                    the Post boy, I will write a few lines and send them if we don't have to "fall
                    in" before I get through. We had another big battle, at South Mountain, on
                    Sunday last and an equally terrible one at this place yesterday on both of which
                    occasions the Union Arms were victorious. In the Providence of God, I have
                    passed through both unhurt. I have not time to give you particulars. The
                    Reserves received great praise for their conduct on both occasions. Well, they
                        <u>did</u> fight long and nobly. The fact that <u>McClellan</u> is in Command inspires the whole army. Our
                    loss in the 9<sup>th</sup> on Sunday was 10 killed, 34 wounded.
                    Yesterday, 16 killed 67 wounded. We had this morning 107 men for duty in the
                        Regt. We took 2 Rebel flags yesterday. Sergt R. Hohaffey who was commanding Co C <br><br>[<i>page </i>]<br> was killed -- shot through the heart -- He
                    had a brother killed at Gains Mills. They were both noble, and brave fellows. He
                    has another brother in the Company he is well. There is a brother in the Iron
                    City Bank, Pittsburg Pa. I sent him a line
                    yesterday. It may reach him or may not please call and inform him of the fact.
                        Capt Dick was in Command of the Regt., Col Anderson the
                    Brigade, yesterday. To give you an idea of the fight at South Mt. imagine an army in position on the top of <i>[unclear: 
                        Court
                    ]</i> Hill and along the face behind stove piles. The Reserves charging up
                    the hill dislodging the enemy from behind every stone and driving them down off
                    the top. It was done and done quickly. But I must stop. This is a strong Union
                    Country. Don't know what may turn up. Must close. There will be an Official list
                    of killed and wounded sent to Dispatch. I gave one to Mike Halloran. My love to
                    all. </p>
