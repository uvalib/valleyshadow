</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Carson tells Annie about his trip from home back to the Army after a furlough. He
                    mentions that at the moment many of the men have furloughs to get married and

<p class="p10">Jany 24th 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Randolph</p>
<p class="p10">My Own Dear Annie</p>
<p class="p10"> I have just returned from preaching &amp; having ate a hearty dinner, will
                    now devote a few moments in writing to you. I arrived at camp last evening about
                    dusk (nearly exhausted, having walked from Orange C.H. a distance of 7 miles over the worst road you ever saw in your
                    life) - found all the boys well &amp; doing well. I will now give you a
                    brief history of my trip.</p>
<p class="p10">I left home on Monday evening went by the way of Midway Dr. B's being along, from
                    thence to Uncle Billie's where we stayed all night. Tuesday morning <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I
                        <i>[unclear: put]</i> off for town &amp; had every thing in readiness to leave the next morning. Stayed all night
                    with Mr Marquis, had quite a nice time with refugee lady from Alexandria.
                    Wednesday morning I was at the cars by times, but could not get my baggage on,
                    consequently I had to lay over untill Thurday. I put in
                    the time as best I could during the day stayed all night again with Marquis.
                    Thursday morning I got up to the <i>[unclear: depot]</i> just in time to be too
                    late, so there I was, my hopes gone on &amp; me left, I then ascertained
                    there would be a freight down. So after breakfast I jumped aboard the freight
                    train and put off. I had not gone far however untill I
                    missed my sword. I had put it <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>away after the first <i>[added: train]</i> had left supposing I would not get off that day,
                    &amp; then came off &amp; left it. I telegraphed from Waynesboro to
                    Henry Rop who brought it down the next day. Thursday evening we arrived at
                    Gordonsville. I found my boxes in the Depot. Friday evening we left for Orange
                        C.H. I found several of the boys there but
                    no conveyances, so I had to lay over untill Saturday. I
                    must say that I never spent such a night as the one I spent in Orange,
                    considering that I was at the Hotell, at least they had
                    a sign out. But I shall not attempt a description now - several of the boys in
                    the Regiment have gotten furloughs &amp; gone home to <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>marry - so
                    I presume there will be no difficulty about getting a special furlough if the
                    Army remains quiet. This can be ascertained hereafter, so I will say nothing
                    more at present.</p>
<p class="p10">Buck &amp; Frank send their love to you - excuse haste bad writing <i>[deleted: ]</i> &amp; believe me to be as ever <u>yours</u></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Frank</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S.<br>
                        Direct as heretofore</p>
