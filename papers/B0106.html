<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to John
                    A. McDonnell, December 26, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson reports the case of Betsey Brown, who was originally sold out of Augusta
                    County, and who has since returned with her three children. Jackson asks for
                    information about her father, who lives near Winchester, so that he may support
                    her. McDonnell reports that while Gabriel is able to support his daughter, he is
                    unable to pay for her transportation to Winchester.</p>
