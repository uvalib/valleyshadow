<p class="p10">My dearest husband,</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote to you yesterday, but have thought of several things that we would like
                    to have, &amp; will therefore hold a short converse with you this morning. I
                    hope this bright morning, finds my precious husband &amp; dear little son
                    quite as bright &amp; happy, particularly as the time is fast approaching
                    when we must meet, a kind Providence permitting. Do take good care of
                    yourselves, &amp; come as soon as it is possible. In my hurry to finish my
                    letter yesterday I forgot to remind you of the whale bone split for my corset,
                    which you must certainly get, if you can. Also, Donny's fishing hood, from
                    behind the clock or on the mantle piece some where, &amp; I want you without
                    fail to bring Mama as many duck eggs as you can, she is so anxious to have the
                    Poland duck. Don't forget my cape at Mrs Staffords, &amp; Read // my first
                    letter over, &amp; see that every thing is attended to. Mama joins in best
                    love to you, my precious, &amp; dear little soney. Write what day to expect
                    you.</p>
<p class="p10">Your own fond wife,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Liz McCue</i></p>
