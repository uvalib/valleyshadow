                <p>Nadenbousch writes his wife and states he is doing well in Staunton, which is now
                    occupied by Federal troops. He reports that many of the officers have been
                    staying at the Hotel, and there is little disruption in daily life. He expresses
                    impatience with life separated from his family by war, and hopes to wrap up his
                    business in Staunton and move home. He also discusses financial and family

                    mail. I am here at home and quite well except some of the Rheumatism still
                    remaining in my bones. The Federal forces are here in force most of the officers
                    are stopping at my house I have had <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">

                    quite gentlemanly here &amp; treated me exceedingly kind. nothing has been

                    be quite limited, and I will close it up as soon as possible and will close up
