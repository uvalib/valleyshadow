<p>A steady rain.  A week today since the <orig reg="fighting">fight<lb/>

Battles inevitably bring rain.  We <lb/> 
got a Whig<ref n="3" target="n3">[3]</ref>  
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">of Fri.</add>  
<abbr expan="yesterday">yes.</abbr> &amp; devoured  
it eagerly, but got little  
<lb/> 
about the battle as they are not permitted

<lb/> 
yet.  Heard that some Louisianians advanced to  
<lb/> 
the charge  
with the name of <name>Butler</name> as their war

desperately.  <name>Butler</name>

the whole.  <name>Butler</name> is the best man for  
<lb/> 
our cause within the limits of  
the S. C. He has  
<lb/> 
given a union to the Southern heart, and a nerve<lb/> 
 to  
the Southern cause as one that none among ourselves  
<lb/> 
could possibly  
have done.  They thought they</p>

<p>What are the people in Yankeedom thinking

of today?  Perhaps  
however they have not got the truth yet

it without <orig reg="remembering">re

has fallen upon the North because of  
their declension

from him.  Its effects, <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">it is true,</add>

us, &amp; more

We too have

<p>A long hiatus.  Couldn't help it. So many

 the

also killed

at this battle.  His brother <name>John</name> was wounded before

<name>L Kerr</name> another neighbor

<lb/> 
of typhoid fever.  Before this on the

died of

When has a year departed so crowded  
<lb/> 
with events, &amp; <hi rend="underline">such</hi> events as  
the last.  How many  
<lb/> 
battles have we fought, &amp; how has God blessed our <lb/>

<lb/> 
not given us as a  
prey to their teeth.  As a nation,  
<lb/> 
we have in a measure acknowledged  
God, &amp; he has  
<lb/> 
appeared for us most wonderfully, on one occasion  
<lb/> 
giving  
us two great victories in one day; one at <name type="placename"><orig>Rich<lb/>

simple, <orig reg="consistent">con<lb/> 
sistent</orig> Christian, as appears, a member of the <orig reg="Episcopal"> 
Epis<lb/>

<lb/> 
prayer on three occasions, when  
our cause seemed <lb/> 
 dark, our prospect rather, &amp; in every case, the <orig reg="answer">an<lb/> 
swer</orig>  
was manifest.  After the two victories in  
<lb/> 
one day, a day of  
thanksgiving was appointed <lb/> 
&amp; generally &amp; joyfully observed.  It was  
stated in  
 
  
<pb n="11" entity="EmeDiar11" pid="uva-lib:503336"/> 
  
the <abbr expan="Central">C.</abbr> Presbyterian, that services were held in the

business generally suspended, &amp; the city had  
<lb/> 
the air of a quiet  
Sabbath.  Three out of four daily  
<lb/>

<p>We have cause for gratitude more than<lb/> we can express, that we have

brought no desolation.   
<lb/> 
What awful disappointment will be experienced 
<lb/> by  
our friends the abolitionists.  Never was  
<lb/> 
a more quiet and orderly  
Christmas &amp; New Years.   
<lb/> 
Even <name>Sister <abbr expan="Catharine">C.</abbr></name>  
who is so <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> timid,  
<hi rend="underline">forgot</hi><lb/> 
 to be afraid!  I do not forget it, but a little  
<orig reg="circumstance">cir<lb/>cumstance</orig>  
may show how much I was terrified.   
<lb/> 
<name><abbr expan="Brother Luther">Bro. L.</abbr></name> having been

<name>Cousin S</name> 
<lb/> 
 went <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">to S.</add>  
for him, &amp; did not get home  
till late.  I  
<lb/> 
sat up for them, and having occasion to visit my  
<lb/> 
chambers, went repeatedly in the dark, &amp; near <orig reg="midnight">mid<lb/>night</orig>.  
 Indeed, never  
since have I been in this state  
<lb/> 
have I felt any reluctance to visiting  
any part of  
<lb/> 
the house in the dark either here or in Highland.</p>  
<p>This whole agitation about slavery <abbr expan="which">wh.</abbr> 
<lb/> has prevailed at the S.  
these years, is the most  
 
  
<pb n="13" entity="EmeDiar13" pid="uva-lib:503338"/> 
  
monstrous humbug ever got up since the flood.   
<lb/> 
I am <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">if  
possible</add> a thousand times better satisfied of the  
<orig reg="propriety">pro 
<lb/> 
riety</orig> of  
slavery than I was before the war.   
<lb/> 
I believe this violent abolition  
spirit grows out of <orig reg="attempting">attempt<lb/> 
ing</orig> to be wise above what is written, &amp; it  
shows  
<lb/> 
itself out where it is carried out, by leading those  
<lb/> 
possessed  
with it to throw away the bible.  It is  
<lb/> 
my full belief that the  
infatuation which has <orig reg="preciptated">pre 
<lb/> 
cipitated</orig> the North into this war, is a  
judgment  
<lb/> 
from God upon them for their deep declension from  
<lb/> 
him  
manifested <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">among other ways</add> 
 by their fanaticism and every other  
<lb/> 
ism.  
The fear of the Lord had <del hand="h1">so</del> nearly <unclear>ford where</unclear> 
 the  
<lb/> 
land, <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">as there is season

<lb/> 
upon them.  
It has spent much of its force upon  
<lb/> 
<hi rend="underline">us</hi> thus far, but if this is the  
end of the matter, I  
<lb/> 
have miscalculated this eclipse altogether.  
Both

<p>Owing to the inflation of our economy, produced in  
<lb/> 
 
part by the  
abundant issue of treasury notes, our  
<lb/> 
business affairs are involved in  
much perplexity.  Every  
<lb/> 
article is from two or three time its usual <lb/> 
value.  Corn is 3,25 a bushel, flour 20 or 25 dollars  
<lb/> 
a barrel, pork  
30, a hundred, butter from one to two  
<lb/> 
dollars a pd in R.  Those who  
have much to sell  
<lb/> 
make great profits, but those who have all to buy  
<lb/> 
and little to sell like ourselves, are in danger of faring  
<lb/> 
hardly.  
Providence has kindly provided for us <orig reg="however">how 
<lb/> 
ever</orig>.  We had some stores on  
hand of sugar, <orig reg="molasses">molas<lb/>

It is a hard case that my money is beyond my

desecrated.  How have they soaked

<lb/> 
plead our cause  
against an ungodly nation, as

not to them their deserts O Lord.  The Lord be gracious

to all  
there as well as here who have shown me <orig reg="kindness">

hangs over that  
land.  A just God will visit sooner  
<lb/> 
or later, &amp; there will be no escape

<name>James Holladay</name>, <name>Sister

in <name type="placename">Williamsburg</name> sick when that place

&amp; was taken by them.  He was taken to

<lb/> 
says he had no special reason to complain of his  
<orig reg="treatment">treat<lb/>

He was soon removed however to <name type="placename">

had nothing but a <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">narrow</add> board,

<p>We have glorious news from <name>Milroy's</name>

<add hand="h1" place="supralinear"><name type="placename">Winchester</name>  
&amp;</add> several thousand prisoners  
<lb/>

himself <orig reg="narrowly">nar

<lb/> 
Whig I  
must copy it.  It is told in a letter from a lady  
<lb/> 
in <name type="placename">Winchester</name>.  She  
says God only knows what we have  
<lb/> 
had to bear from the Federals, &amp; then  
proceeds to speak  
<lb/> 
among other things of an old negro who was kept  
<lb/> 
on  
nothing but water for three days because he  
<orig reg="refused">re<lb/>fused</orig> 
 to work &amp; said he  
was "secesh."  The fourth  
<lb/> 
day an officer went to him with the inquiry  
"Are  
<lb/> 
you secesh yet?"  His reply was "<hi rend="underline"> 
Bless de Lord,  
<lb/> 
Massa, I is  
secesh yet.</hi>" He was then set to  
<lb/> 
splitting wood with iron balls  
attached to his  
<lb/> 
hands &amp; feet.  This Lady's brother was at the  
<lb/> 
guard  
house &amp; saw him. The officer was cursing  
<lb/> him &amp; saying he ought to have iron balls on his  
 
  
<pb n="22" entity="EmeDiar22" pid="uva-lib:503347"/> 

  
neck &amp; arms.  The old fellow went on splitting  
<lb/> 
saying "Bless de  
Lord, massa, any where you can  
<lb/> 
put 'em.  You can kill de body but you  
can't

stand the starving process <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">myself</add>,  
but think I  
would  
<lb/> 
have to be right hungry before I would give in.

She adds that

saying, "Hallo Grant, is that what

<p>Long time has elapsed since the <orig reg="foregoing">fore 
<lb/> 
going</orig> was written, &amp; 
innumerable have been the events  
<lb/> 
which have transpired in the  
interval.  The most <orig reg="important">im 
<lb/> 
portant</orig> of these to me are two severe illnesses  
which  
<lb/> 
have occured since last  
<abbr expan="October">Oct</abbr>.  A few particulars of these  
<lb/> 
I will  
note down, as I write for the information of my  
<lb/> 
northern friends,  
should any of them have the <orig reg="curiosity">curios 
<lb/> 
ity</orig> to read this journal, &amp; leave  
herewith the request<lb/> 
 that it may be forwarded to them at some future  
time  
<lb/>if it 
should  not be in my power to do it myself.</p>  
<p>The attacks spoken of bore symptoms of typhoid  
<lb/> 
pneumonia at first,  
&amp; the fever in each attack continued  
<lb/> 
many days, especially the  
quickness of the pulse,  
<lb/> 
ranging from 120 to 125.  This was attended &amp; 
<orig reg="suceeded">suc<lb/>eeded</orig>  
by extreme prostration so that many of my  
<lb/> 
friends apprehended  
that I would never be able to arise.   
<lb/> 
By the blessing of God, however,  
upon the close attention  
 
  
<pb n="24" entity="EmeDiar24" pid="uva-lib:503349"/> 
 
of my physicians &amp; the most careful nursing, I was at  
<lb/> 
length  
restored, though confined to my my bed the second  
<lb/> 
time nearly three  
months.  I cannot at all do justice  
<lb/> 
to my feelings here without  
speaking particularly of  
<lb/> 
<name>Sister <abbr expan="Catharine">C.</abbr></name>'s  
kindness in watching over me with <lb/>  
the tenderest care by day &amp; by night through both these  
<lb/> 
illnesses.  
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">Much more might be added did not my limits forbid. 
</add>  I must be indulged  
in describing my little  
<lb/> 
bed, set under the windows by the side of  
hers, &amp; at  
<lb/> 
right angles with it, in here for the last eight or nine  
<lb/> 
months, I have slept by night &amp; lain often a great  
<lb/> 
part of the day.</p>  
<p>Some of the neighbors sat up with me a few  
<lb/> 
nights, but for the most  
part, <name>Eva</name> attended upon  
<lb/> 
me, sleeping in the same room &amp; bringing me  
<orig reg="nourishment">nour<lb/> 
 
ishment</orig> at bedtime &amp; at midnight &amp; soon in the  
<lb/> 
morning.  If she  
got worn out, <name>Sister C</name>. in spite  
<lb/> 
of all my persuasions, would do it  
herself.</p>  
<p>For weeks during the second illness, I took no  
 
  
<pb n="25" entity="EmeDiar25" pid="uva-lib:503350"/> 
  
solid food &amp; very little of anything.  The doctor however  
<lb/> 
said I  
must eat often, &amp; after I began to get an appetite  
<lb/> 
I did not fail to  
profit by his suggestion, for my <orig reg="stomach">stom 
<lb/> 
ach</orig> felt like a shrivelled scroll  
if I did not eat very  
<lb/> 
frequently.  No one would <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">have</add> 
 supposed I could  
lose  
<lb/> 
much flesh, but I did, &amp; when able to a rise from  
<lb/> 
my bed, looked  
like a walking skeleton.  By a kind  
<lb/> 
Providence, we had a small  
quantity of cocoa  
<lb/> 
on hand.  This suited me pretty well, which was <lb/> 
fortunate as I could not take tea &amp; coffee.  I was  
<lb/> 
kept constantly  
supplied with chicken soup, which  
<lb/> 
with porridge &amp; a little bread &amp; 
butter formed a <orig reg="sufficient">suf<lb/>ficient</orig> variety.   
But enough on this head.</p>

<p>One thing I omitted to mention, a severe cough  
<lb/> 
a thing very unusual  
for me.  It hung on for many  
<lb/> 
weeks, &amp; indeed is not entirely cured  
yet.  This cough  
<lb/> 
seemed a sort of epidemic.  Within the last year, it  
has <lb/> 
prevailed extensively, has been so violent &amp; long  
continued, 
 
 
  
<pb n="26" entity="EmeDiar26" pid="uva-lib:503351"/> 
 

  
 that many have insisted it was the whooping  
<lb/> 
cough, even  
those who have <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">had</add> that already.</p>  
<p>I was taken the second time, the last of <abbr expan="February">Feb</abbr>. 
<lb/>  Have recovered so as  
to be able to go about the house  
<lb/> 
but not so as to go to church or to  
visit abroad, &amp; feel  
<lb/> 
still very weak so that it often requires a  
painful  
<lb/> 
effort to get about.  During this time, <name>Sister  
<abbr expan="Catharine">C.</abbr></name> has  
<lb/> 
been  
sick two or three times.  Once she had <orig reg="inflammation">inflam 
<lb/> 
ation</orig> of the stomach &amp; 
was threatened with apoplexy  
<lb/> 
but was mercifully spared to us.  
<name>Eva</name> was  
sick &amp;  
<lb/> 
laid up for some time, &amp; she got over done.  One of  
<lb/> 
the  
neighbors lent us a little chap to wait on me.   
<lb/> 
<name>Josie</name> was sick a long  
time too, though not at the  
<lb/> 
same time with his mother.</p>  
<p>Our friends at the North have probably  
<lb/> 
been thinking <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">some</add>  
about us  
of late, hearing that the <orig reg="Yankees">Yan

<name type="placename">Staunton</name>, though  
<hi rend="underline">what</hi> they have  
<lb/> 
thought is beyond my power to divine, ignorant  
as we  
  
<pb n="27" entity="EmeDiar27" pid="uva-lib:503352"/> 

  
are of each others feelings.  <name>Sister  
<abbr expan="Catharine">C.</abbr></name> &amp; I very often  
<lb/> 
talk of  
them, wonder how they fare <add hand="h1" place="supralinear"> 
&amp; what they think of us,</add> whether they set  
us down  
<lb/> 
for incorrigible rebels against "the best government in  
<lb/> 
the  
world," always winding up however by arguing  
<lb/> 
that we do not &amp; cannot  
believe they favor this <orig reg="unjust">un 
<lb/> just</orig> &amp; abominable war, though such strange  
things  
<lb/> 
happen these days that nothing ought to astonish us.</p>  
<p>But I commenced with the intention of <orig reg="telling">tell 
<lb/> 
ing</orig> a story about some  
Yankee raiders.  We have  
<lb/> 
often had alarms about their coming but have <lb/>  
been preserved by a kind Providence until this season.   
<lb/> 
Not long  
since, they favored us with two visits  
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">(on June 9 &amp; 10th)</add> which  
<lb/> 
will  
not soon be forgotten in these parts.  The first day,  
<lb/> 
they came in  
from the West, across the mountain.  A  
<lb/> 
party of 40 or 50 perhaps, came  
riding up, dismounted  
<lb/> 
&amp; rushed in.  "Have you got any whiskey" said  
they,  
<lb/> 
"got any flour?  got any bacon?" <add hand="h1" place="supralinear"> 
with plenty of oaths</add> "Come on  
boys," says  
<lb/> 
one, "we'll find it all"  With that, they pushed rudely  
 
  
<pb n="28" entity="EmeDiar28" pid="uva-lib:503353"/> 
 
  
by <name>Sister <abbr expan="Catharine">C.</abbr> 
</name> who was terribly alarmed, &amp; had been  
<lb/> 
from the first  
news of their coming, &amp; spread <orig reg="themselves">them<lb/> 
selves</orig> nearly all over the house.  
Finding their way  
<lb/> 
to a fine barrel of flour which a neighbor had given  
<lb/> 
us, they proceeded to fill their sacks &amp; pillow cases,  
<lb/> 
scattering a  
large percent on the floor, till it was  
<lb/> 
nearly exhausted.  The last  
one told us, on our <orig reg="remonstrating"> 
remon<lb/>strating</orig>,  
to hide the rest.</p>  
<p>Some went upstairs, opened every trunk &amp;  
<lb/> 
drawer &amp; tossed things  
upside down or on the floor,  
<lb/> 
even my nice bonnets, pretending to be  
looking for<lb/>
arms.  They stole <name>Cousin Samuel</name>'s gold sleeve  
buttons  
<lb/> 
&amp; 
pin (a present to him) his best shirt, a good coat,  
<lb/> 
&amp; pair of shoes.  
The shoes, it being nearly impossible  
<lb/> 
to get shoes these days, he  
afterwards persuaded the<lb/>
fellow to <hi rend="underline">sell</hi> him back for an Ohio ten  
dollar note,  
<lb/> 
as good as gold to him.  He could with a much  
<lb/> 
better  
appetite doubtless have knocked him down,  
 
  
<pb n="29" entity="EmeDiar29" pid="uva-lib:503354"/> 
 
  
but there was no choice in the matter.</p>  
<p>We did not say anything to provoke them, but  
<lb/> 
did not disguise our  
sentiments.  They went peeping  
<lb/> 
under the beds, looking for rebels as  
they said.   
<lb/> 
<name>Baxter</name> told them there were no rebels here (meaning  
<lb/> 
rebel  
soldiers) <name>Cate</name> spoke &amp; said  
<hi rend="underline">We are all rebels.</hi><lb/>  
<name>Ellen</name> spoke &amp; 
said "Yes <name>Baxter</name>, I am a rebel."  The  
<orig reg="Yankee">Yan<lb/>kee</orig>  
looked <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">up</add> from her  
drawer, which he <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">was</add> searching just<lb/>
then, &amp; said "That's right."  
<name>Cate</name>  
then said, "I am a rebel  
<lb/> 
too &amp; I <hi rend="underline">glory</hi> in it."  When  
<name>Sister <abbr expan="Catharine">C.</abbr></name>  
remonstrated with  
<lb/> 
them about taking the shoes, asking them why they <lb/> 
injured innocent persons who had taken no part  
<lb/> 
in the war, one of them  
replied, "You need not tell me  
<lb/> 
that, I know all the people along here  
have sons in  
<lb/> 
the army."  She then pointed to B &amp; said "That is my <lb/> 
only son."  <name>Ellen</name> then said, "I have no brothers in the  
<lb/> 
army, I wish from my heart I had."  He then said,  
<lb/> 
"Now Sis, I don't wish you had  
brothers in the  
 
  
<pb n="30" entity="EmeDiar30" pid="uva-lib:503355"/> 
 
  
in the army.  I wouldn't like to kill one of your  
<lb/> 
brothers.  I got  
some corn here," (pointing to his  
<lb/> 
plunder) An officer rode up after the  
rest had gone  
<lb/> 
having the appearance of a gentleman, &amp; asked civilly  
<lb/> 
if  
he could get some flour.  <name>Sister  
<abbr expan="Catharine">C.</abbr></name>  
telling <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">him</add> how they  
<lb/> 
had stripped  
us of nearly every thing they could find,  
<lb/> 
said he could go &amp; see what  
they had left, &amp; help  
<lb/> 
himself.  He said no, he never had searched a<lb/>  
house &amp; never would, &amp; it was a shame they should 
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">do so.</add></p>  
<p>That night they camped <del hand="h1">away</del>  
a mile or two<lb/>  
 
 
 
from us, extending along the  
road two or three  
<lb/> 
 
miles, &amp; got a fine supper from the farms around  
them.   
<lb/> 
<name>Sister <abbr expan="Catharine">C.</abbr> 
</name> was afraid to undress, but lay down quite  
<lb/> 
exhausted  
two or three hours in the night.  <name>Ellen</name>  
<lb/> 
kept watch the first part of  
the night, &amp; <name>Cousin S.</name>  
<lb/> 
the last.  E soon called to him, "I hear  
footsteps."   
<lb/> 
He went out &amp; saw some coming up the road  
<lb/> 
with a torch.  
Thinking they might be coming  
 
  
<pb n="31" entity="EmeDiar31" pid="uva-lib:503356"/> 

  
to burn the house, he came to our door, saying we  
<lb/> 
had better have  
something ready to throw around  
<lb/> 
us if we should be called out for any  
reason <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">taking care not to alarm us</add>.   
But  
<lb/> 
our fears were groundless.  
They started off in the  
<lb/> 
night for Staunton where there were several  
<orig reg="thousand">thou<lb/> 
sand</orig> of them.   
Our visitors belonged to <name>Averill</name>'s

that was true, but they were  
<lb/> 
bad enough &amp; worse at some other places  
than with  
<lb/> 
us.  At one of our neighbors,  
 
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear"><name>Mr. H.</name></add> they took every thing 
<lb/>  
they had to eat, all the pillow cases &amp; sheets but  
<lb/> 
what were on the  
beds, &amp; the towels &amp; some of the ladies  
<lb/> 
stockings.  One of them made  
up a bundle of ladies  
<lb/> 
clothing to take, but his comrade shamed him out  
of it.  
<lb/> 
 They then poured out their molasses, scattered their  
<lb/> 
preserves  
&amp; sugar &amp; other things about the floor, &amp;  
<lb/> 
mixed them all together &amp; 
destroyed things generally  
 
  
<pb n="32" entity="EmeDiar32" pid="uva-lib:503357"/> 

  
The ladies there are very amiable &amp; genteel in their  
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">appearance</add>  
<lb/> 
which makes it the more strange.  Their visitors as well  
<lb/> 
as ours  
however had taken a drop too much.  This <orig reg="gentleman">gen 
<lb/> 
tleman</orig> had kept some  
things for sale of late, had  
<lb/> 
a quantity of tobacco &amp; some other things  
on hand, all  
<lb/> 
which they took to the amount of several thousand  
dollars.</p>  
<p>At another neighbors, they took all of their  
<lb/> 
meat (some 30 pieces  
of bacon) &amp; nearly everything  
<lb/> 
else they had to eat, all their horses  
(4) &amp; <orig reg="persuaded"> 
persuad<lb/>ed</orig> off their two negro men.  One of these  
was <orig reg="afterwards">af- 
<lb/> 
terwards</orig>  
seen by one of our men crying to come  
<lb/> 
back, but was watched so closely  
that he could not  
<lb/> 
escape.  No wonder he cried.  He has been twice  
<lb/> 
on  
the brink of the grave with pneumonia, &amp; was  
<lb/> 
nursed by his mistress as  
tenderly as if he had  
<lb/> 
been a brother, &amp; she was always kind to him,  
his <orig reg="master">mas 
<lb/> 
ter</orig> also.  He will not find such treatment anywhere  
<add hand="h1" place="supralinear">else  
</add> 
  
<pb n="33" entity="EmeDiar33" pid="uva-lib:503358"/> 
 
  
The Yankees (I give them this appellation <orig reg="because">be 
<lb/> 
cause</orig> every body else  
does) took off all the negro men  
<lb/> 
&amp; boys they could, as well as all the  
horses, told the  
<lb/> 
women they would take <hi rend="underline">them</hi> next time they  
came.   
<lb/> 
Many sent their horses to the woods.  Some of these  
<lb/> 
were found  
&amp; captured.  People here do their farming  
<lb/> 
with horses instead of oxen,  
&amp; it is an immense loss  
<lb/> 
to have them &amp; the servants swept off to  
such an extent,  
<lb/> 
just as harvest is about to begin too.  Many sent  
<lb/> 
off  
their servants in one direction &amp; another, some of whom  
<lb/> 
were overtaken  
&amp; captured &amp; others escaped.</p>  
<p>The lady before mentioned has told me since  
<lb/> 
that no tongue can tell  
her feelings the day the Yankees  
<lb/> 
were there.  In the first place, they  
fired on her little  
<lb/> 
son &amp; another boy several times, as they sat on  
the  
<lb/> 
fence watching their approach, &amp; afterwards pretended  
<lb/> 
that they  
took them for confederate soldiers from their  
<lb/> 
being dressed in gray.  
Then her husband &amp; oldest son  
 
  
<pb n="34" entity="EmeDiar34" pid="uva-lib:503359"/> 
 
  
were hid in the bushes in the garden, &amp; she was in  
<lb/> 
momentary fear  
of their being discovered &amp; fired upon.   
<lb/> 
The men &amp; boys always kept  
out of the way, as they  
<lb/> 
were sometimes taken off, &amp; did not know what  
<orig reg="treatment">treat 
<lb/> 
ment</orig> they might receive, &amp; thus the women were left  
<lb/> 
to shift for  
themselves as best they could.  Another  
<lb/> 
of our neighbors was fired  
upon several times until  
<lb/> 
he either dropped or lay down, it was not  
known  
<lb/> 
which.  They said it was because he ran, but he  
<lb/> 
was passing  
between their pickets &amp; ours, who were  
<lb/> 
firing at each other, &amp; was  
obliged to run.  We heard  
<lb/> 
of the circumstance, &amp; were very uneasy, but  
he <orig reg="providentially">prov 
<lb/>identially</orig> escaped injury.  They always fire upon  
<lb/> 
those who run  
from them.</p>

<p>Those who left their houses fared worse than  
<lb/> 
others, at least their  
houses did.  The wife of a worthy  
<lb/> 
miller living near us, became so  
much alarmed that  
 
  
<pb n="35" entity="EmeDiar35" pid="uva-lib:503360"/> 
 
  
went with her little children to a neighbors'.  They  
<lb/> 
stripped her  
house completely, destroying <orig reg="everything">every<lb/>thing</orig>,  
left nothing but a straw bed  
&amp; one sheet.  It  
<lb/> 
was a hard case, for it was with difficulty that Mr.  
H.  
<lb/> 
with his large family, could get along before.  Another  
<lb/> 
lady who  
was alone, was so much frightened by a  
<lb/> 
drunken soldier who came in,  
that she left the house.<lb/>
The Yankees destroyed every thing there  
too.</p>  
<p>We were better off than most in having <name>Cousin  
<lb/> 
S</name> with us.  We feared  
they would take him, but they  
<lb/> 
only inquired if he was a soldier, &amp; 
when told that  
<lb/> 
he was a teacher, did not molest him.  He had a  
<lb/> 
large  
school (upwards of 40) &amp; had refused many more  
<lb/> 
applications.  It was nearly  
out at that time, &amp; was  
<lb/> 
closed abruptly because parents liked to stay at home  
<lb/> 
&amp; keep their children with them.  He was the  
<lb/> 
chief man in hiding our  
things.  I know not <orig reg="what">wha<add hand="h1" n="editor" place="inline">t</add></orig> 
 
  
<pb n="36" entity="EmeDiar36" pid="uva-lib:503361"/> 
  
  
we should have done without him.  Some hid their  
<lb/> 
things &amp; had them  
discovered but we were more <orig reg="fortunate">for<lb/> 
tunate</orig>.  (Some were betrayed by their  
servants) Some  
<lb/> 
hid nothing, thinking they would not be disturbed but  
<lb/> 
found themselves woefully mistaken.  Others thought  
<lb/> 
they might be  
worse dealt <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">with</add> if they hid anything.</p>  
<p>A lady near <name type="placename">Staunton</name> a little time since  
<lb/> 
had two Yankee officers  
come to take tea with her.   
<lb/> 
She was strong "secesh," but she got them  
a good <orig reg="supper">sup<lb/> 
per</orig>.  It was served up in very plain dishes.  They  
<orig reg="perceived">per<lb/>ceived</orig>  
that she was wealthy, &amp; inquired if she had not  
<lb/> 
hid her plate &amp;c.  She  
told them she had.  They  
<lb/> 
asked <hi rend="underline">where</hi>.  She told them in the ash heap.  
They  
<lb/> 
said "That is not a good place.  It is the first place <lb/>  
searched."  They then very kindly &amp; politely showed  
<lb/> 
her a good place  
(in their opinion) She followed their  
<lb/> 
advice &amp; saved her things.  In  
another instance, some  
<lb/> 
Yankee officers politely showed a lady where to  
hide her  
 
  
<pb n="37" entity="EmeDiar37" pid="uva-lib:503362"/> 

  
her <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> silver &amp;c.  The soldiers came &amp;  
searched in vain.   
<lb/> 
Just as they  
were going away, a little black chap  
<lb/> 
who had followed them around says  
to them in a  
<lb/> 
tone of triumph, "Ah you did not find Missis things  
<lb/> 
hid  
inside the ____"  They went &amp; found &amp; took them.</p>  
<p>Very early on the morning of June 7th, 
<lb/> 
 knowing that the Yankees  
were coming (the night  
<lb/> 
had been mostly spent in preparing for them)  
<name><abbr expan="Brother Luther">Br.

to <name type="placename">Eastern <abbr expan="Virginia">Va</abbr></name>.  He wanted to be

<lb/> 
We had been in a great quandry as to what <lb/>  
course was best for him to pursue.  If he went  
<lb/> 
abroad, he might fall  
into the hands of the Yankees.   
<lb/> 
If he <orig reg="stayed">staid</orig> at home, they would  
probably take him,  
<lb/> 
having such a spite against preachers &amp; especially<lb/>

<p>It was finally concluded to ship the whole  
<lb/> 
cargo, &amp; let them go &amp; 
seek their fortune.  <name>Eva</name> had been  
<lb/> 
right sick, threatened with  
pneumonia, but when the  
<lb/> 
time came, she was very anxious to go &amp; 
thought  
<lb/> 
she was able.  So she wrapped up well, took a strong  
<lb/> 
dose of  
coffee, &amp; set off.  We heard nothing from them  
<lb/> 
for <del hand="h1">illeg.</del> <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">a</add> 
 week.  Then word  
came that they had been  
<lb/> 
seen riding behind a train of wagons which  
they  
<lb/> 
could not pass, &amp; that those wagons were afterwards  
<lb/> 
captured. So  
that there was little doubt they were  
<lb/> 
taken too.  <name>Sister <abbr expan="Catharine">C.</abbr></name> was in  
such a state from anxiety,  
<lb/> 
loss of sleep &amp; fatigue, for she &amp; the  
children had had  
<lb/> 
all <name>Eva</name>'s work to do, that this news brought on  
<del hand="h1">spa</del> 
<lb/> 
spasms such as she used to have.  A note was now  
<lb/> 
brought in from a  
friend, saying that <name>Mr. E.</name> was seen  
<lb/> 
at such a time in <abbr expan="Eastern Virginia">E. Va.</abbr> 
 beyond  
the reach of the  
<lb/> 
Yankees, &amp; was therefore safe.  There might be some  
<lb/> 
mistake about this, but we tried to believe it &amp; rest upon it.  
 
  
<pb n="40" entity="EmeDiar40" pid="uva-lib:503365"/> 
 
  
<del hand="h1">illeg.</del> In a few days, we got a letter from  
<name>brother <abbr expan="Luther">L. 
</abbr></name> saying  
<lb/> 
that he hoped  
to get home soon, &amp; so he did.</p>  
<p>It seems he wandered around for several  
<lb/>

<name type="placename"><abbr expan="Eastern Virginia">E. Va</abbr></name>,  
to <name type="placename">Amherst County</name>  
<lb/>

 but  
<lb/> 
here he was not safe.  In a day or two, news came  
<lb/> 
that the  
Yankees were coming, &amp; were just upon them,  
<lb/> 
He mounted his horse &amp; 
made for the woods, his  
<lb/> 
host also, taking their servants with them.  
They  
<lb/> 
barely escaped, for in five minutes from the first alarm, 
<lb/> 
 the  
Yankees were in the house.  The fugitives  
<lb/> 
<del hand="h1"> illeg.</del> slept in the woods three

<p>I have been anticipating. On the 10th of  
<lb/> 
June we received another  
visit from our invaders, at  
<lb/> 
least, several thousand of them passed our  
house  
<lb/> 
on their way from  
<name type="placename">Staunton</name> to  
<name type="placename">Lexington</name>.  <name>Sister C.</name>  
<lb/> 
requested  
one of them who was gentlemanly in his  
<orig reg="appearance">ap<lb/>pearance,</orig> to guard us, &amp; he  
did so.  They were four  
<lb/> 
hours in passing.  None of them came in but  
the  
<lb/> 
guard.  Some went in the spring house however, &amp;  
<lb/> 
helped themselves  
to milk, &amp; one went off with a large  
<lb/> 
panfull in each hand.  
<name>Ellen</name>  
called after him to  
<lb/> 
"Bring back those pans," but he only laughed &amp; 
went on.  
<lb/> 
 Another who had been taking a cool draught from  
<lb/> 
a pan, came  
out with his chin covered &amp; some on  
 
the  
<lb/> 
end of his nose, like a cat  
from the cream pot.  E.  
<lb/> 
accosted him with "<hi rend="underline">Ar'nt you ashamed</hi>?"  
putting on  
<lb/> 
as much emphasis as she well could, &amp; adding,  
<lb/> 
"Who do you  
think is going to drink that milk, 
<lb/> 
 after you have put your nose in  
it!"  The fellow made no reply  
<lb/> 
but walked off.</p>  
 
  
<pb n="42" entity="EmeDiar42" pid="uva-lib:503367"/> 
  
  
<p>I did not see much of them, <name>Sister C.</name> prefering  
<lb/> 
to have me stay  
home in our room.  I was just getting  
<lb/> 
able to walk about.  They did  
not find the way down  
<lb/> 
there at all.  The room was built over after we  
came  
<lb/> 
here, &amp; they might have thought that the door  
<orig reg="leading">lead 
<lb/> 
ing</orig> into it, led  
out of doors.  I did not feel afraid of  
<lb/> 
them in the least, but did not  
have opportunity to  
<lb/> 
say much to them.</p>  
<p>Volumes might be written, &amp; doubtless  
<lb/> 
will be, according them  
heroic achievements, but  
<lb/> 
I must cut my story short.  They burnt a bridge 
<lb/> 
a very large distillary &amp; some other buildings in 
<lb/> 
S. <name><abbr expan="Governor">Gov.</abbr>  
Letcher</name>'s house, the military institute in  
<lb/> 
Lexington, &amp; some of the mills about the country.   
<lb/> 
My brother had a  
barrel of flour, four bushel of  
<lb/> 
wheat &amp; eight of corn at a mill a few  
miles <orig reg="distant">dis 
<lb/> 
tant</orig> from us, all which they took, a great loss  
<lb/> 
in these  
times for a poor preacher.  It was the  
 
  
<pb n="43" entity="EmeDiar43" pid="uva-lib:503368"/> 

  
whole of wheat he received this year from the people  
<lb/> 
at Walker's  
Creek, where he supplies one fourth of his <add hand="h1" place="supralinear">time</add>. 
<lb/> 
  I forgot to say that  
they took from us, a very large  
<lb/> 
ham of bacon, two large rolls of  
butter &amp; whatever  
<lb/> 
else they could lay their hands on, at the first

<p>One thing which happened at a neighbor's  
<lb/> 
is too good to omit.  A

<lb/>

&amp; finally  
<lb/> 
lighted upon a jar of <hi rend="underline">tar</hi>.   
 
He asked what it was.   
<lb/> 
A

<lb/> 
told him it was  
<hi rend="underline">blackberry jelly</hi>.  He took it, &amp;  
<lb/> 
made off.  She called after  
him to know if he would  
<lb/> 
have some cream with it.  With that he put his 
<lb/>  
fingers in it, &amp; began to suck them, then threw 
<lb/> 
 down the jar &amp; went  
off cursing with all his might.   
<lb/> 
His captain coming up just then,  
asked the girl  
<lb/> 
what that fellow was cursing so for.  When told,  
<lb/> 
he  
said he thought the Yankees were sharper than that.

<p>It is doubtful whether this irruption

should be called a raid, when  
so many were <orig reg="consumed">con

<lb/> 
15,000  
or more.  Some passed here, &amp; some took

to inquire what <orig reg="became">be

back to reap it for us, but the good

 that many of  
them suffered greatly, &amp; some even

<lb/> 
Their violent

 came down upon their own

<lb/> 
which we captured.  As we had the work to do, it 
<lb/> 
  
was but fair that we should have the wherewith to

But to return to our inquiry.  From  
 
<name type="placename">Lexington</name>  
<lb/> 
they went to take  
<name type="placename">Lynchburg</name>.  Our men followed them,  
<lb/>

them, till we got

reinforcements <del hand="h1">at</del> near L.  Then they retreated before 
<lb/>  
us, &amp; went on to  
<name type="placename">Parkersburg</name> &amp;  
<name type="placename">Wheeling</name>.</p>  
<p>There is a report very current now, that <name><abbr expan="General">Gen.</abbr>

there are so many rumors, that  
<lb/> 
I never believe anything till confirmed

his cause was the best for us that could have

If human

been a most wonderful work

of grace in our army.  How could a broader

<lb/>

persuasion that multitudes

<p><name>Mrs. Gilbert</name> one of our neighbors died a few

 "O there's

to the army at the first sound of the

were brought home &amp; buried in one grave.  We

<lb/> 
Men are drawn off so closely that it is  
difficult to

<p> Nancy Emerson lived with her brother Luther Emerson and 
his family in Augusta County, Virginia.  According 
to the 1860 census of Augusta County (available 
at the Valley of the Shadow site, 
http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/vshadow2/govdoc/census.html),  
both Luther and Nancy 
were born in Massachusetts, Nancy in 1807, Luther in 1811. 
Sometime after 1832, Luther served as the minister for 
Shemeriah Presbyterian Church in Augusta County, Virginia  
(J. Lewis Peyton, <hi rend="italic">History of Augusta County, Virginia</hi>, 83).  
Luther Emerson's family was fairly prosperous, claiming 
$800 in real estate and $12,265 in personal estate.  
Luther Emerson and his wife Catharine, who was a native Virginian, had three 
children: Ellen, Catharine, and Joseph, all of whom were born in Virginia.  </p>
