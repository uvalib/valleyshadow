     more than we want or can use for some time to come you stated that theare is grate talk of pease in
     augusta I think it will all end in talk for this time from all that I can learn I see no sine of pease unless the South gives up the war
     that they will not do as long as they can ceep an army it is no use for
     us to build our hopes <i>[illeg.]</i>
     peasat this time so far as I can see <i>[illeg.]</i><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">aulthough I wish for it as mutch as eney body still I see no hopes for it both parties seem determin  to conqer the other, the onely consolation I have is that it will onely do
     what it is intended to do so wee will have to submit to it. and the more
      wee
     cand submit to it the easearer it will go with
     us though some times it seems to go hard still it is our duty to
     bear it as well as wee can, trusting to a higher pour than eney earthly for our help</p>
<p class="p10">Well Giney I must stop for this time Wilson is not don
     righting yet him and Sarah do lots of righting to each other</p>
