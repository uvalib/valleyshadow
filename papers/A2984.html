<h4>Augusta: William F. Brand to Amanda C. Armentrout,
                    April 10, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William writes to Kate of camp religious life, his belief that he won't have a
                    furlough unless he becomes sick or the Yankees get him, and his continued love
                    for her.</p>

<p class="p10">April 10th</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Randolph</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved yours of the 21st on the sixth; I failed
                    in recieving your letter in time to write to you
                    before you would leave home, Thought it best to wait a day or two then direct to
                    Lexington; Thare never was a letter recieved with more pleasure, or perused with more
                    interest; When Abe returned to camp we ware on picket
                    &amp; didnt get to camp untill the 4th; I believe my letter was enclosed in one of packes he gave it to me on the 6th I hope you will not be
                    low spirited when this reaches you for I do not feel as if I could interest you
                    this eavening. I spent part of the four noon of this blessed day at our little chaple; Thare was a large
                    congregation all seemed <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to pa strict attention
                    to the word of life; oh how I do wish all our soldiers would become pious men I
                    am sure then our armies would be invincible I sometimes think your brother is
                    trying to be a better boy. I pray I may be right for I hope to see him a true
                    christian I nead not ask you to make him a special
                    object in your secreet communings for I am sure you
                    do; Thare is no news in camp worth your attention.
                        Evrything is quiet as far as I know The wether has been very inclemment for the last two weeks; first snow then rain my darling Kate
                    you said your face could not ware a joyous smile, untill you could behold my face, Cheer up my ever faithfull one I hope the time will soon hasten round
                    when we may meet, But I pray the not to put off smiling
                        untill I come, but rather try &amp; be cheerfull &amp; hapy
                    darling I am sorry that my last letter brought with it sorrow to thy <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>noble heart; God knows I would not purposly give
                        the trouble. Would that I ware so situated that I could say to the idle of
                    my heart lean upon my <i>[deleted: heart]</i> arm an I
                    will support the through life with a willingness that
                    would now no end. That dream of yours oh that it was a
                    reality I'me my hapine<i>[added: ss]</i> would be compleat, Often in my nightly slumber you are by my side &amp; I
                    wake finding my arms around my friend Trot -- oh! Dear Kate I fear you have some
                    clue that will be injurious to your kind sisters hapiness in the future I would be sorry if anything should accur to cause her to be sorry for her change in life. I
                    have heard rumers but I hope thay are al false My wish is that she may be hapy
                    throughout her days, You need not look for me this summer without sickness or
                    the Yanks give me a furlough. The detail I was at home on counted as a furlough
                    I would be sadisfied if I was sure you ware
                    hapy, Abe told me you desired me to direct your letter
                    in the care of your friend Rachel I think we had better continue <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>to
                    direct as we have in the past for if your parents shuld ever find out you were corissponding with me in a secreet way thare anger would be increased against both of us while
                    they do not positivly object we had best write
                    openly dear Kate what can I do to alleviate your troubles, I love you yes
                    passionately &amp; if you think you have ever treated me rong I forgive thee, &amp; will if you will permit love and
                    cherish 
                        <i>[added: the]</i>
                     more than I ever did, I believe my own coldness brought on our troubles
                    about but I believe they will <i>[added: be]</i> a blesing to us both I am sure it has drawn thee nearer
                    to me, I can only say speed on sweet day when I may meet thee. I must soon close
                    My health is very good &amp; I hope this may find you enjoying the same with
                        ceerfull spirits. Give my love to you sister
                    &amp; write soon It is getting so dark that I can hardly see how to write I
                    have not hurd from Bro. Charles only by your letter
                    Sister is well She desires to know your name I will give it to her in my next
                    letter, Now may the blessing of a great &amp; good God be with you</p>
<p class="p10">from your true friend</p>
