                <p>Your welcome, &amp; very dear letter of the 14th came duly to its rightful
                    owner. How to me its truthful lines gave the glad assurance of your continued
                    love you could have seen had you been near when I read it over &amp; over
                    again. It is so sweet to have you call me dear. I repeat the treasured words so
                    often in my mind since your dear hand traced them to me. I had looked &amp;
                    waited so long for you to call me Dear Mollie &amp; at last my wishes have
                    been fulfilled I feel more sure that I am indeed as dear to you as you are to me
                    &amp; My heartfelt prayer is that you may never regret giving me the sweet
                    &amp; affectionate little <hi rend="underline">Dear</hi>. I love to read the
                    short words so expressive, written by you &amp; coined from your true,
                    &amp; noble heart I know how dear, how <orig reg="inexpressibly"
                        >inexpressably</orig> dear you are to me always &amp; to feel that I am
                    as much loved by you makes me<pb n="2"/>so happy. I wish Oh so anxiously that
                    you were here this Evening I want to see your dear face more <orig reg="than"
                        >then</orig> I can tell I miss the happy &amp; loved Evenings of the
                    past three weeks when I could have you near me, &amp; now I think you must
                    come in at twilight &amp; sit with me &amp; as I can't see you I feel so
                    lonely &amp; that I can't live without seeing you Every day. I know you miss
                    me when the lamps are lit, "&amp; <orig reg="evening's">evenings</orig> home
                    pleasures are nigh." You have a heart made to love, enjoy, &amp; appreciate
                    fire side, &amp; home pleasures this I have known for some time &amp;
                    when I am in Staunton I am happiest &amp; so are you when we are with each
                    other round dear Ella's fireside. Yes I am so happy then &amp; happy when
                    you are here with me <orig reg="anywhere">any where</orig> with you I am
                    contented &amp; happy so happy that I love to sit silent &amp; think of
                    my blessing without talking much I love to muse when with you &amp; you
                    think if I don't talk that I am sad &amp; gloomy but I am not. with me much
                    talking does not prove the heart to be in its happiest mood. I am often
                        silent<pb n="3"/>when with you &amp; I know that I am very happy. I am
                    fearful you think I would not make a "cheerful, &amp; happy fireside" You
                    must not think this of me. I am sure with help from Above of making home happy
                    for I do love to see others happy &amp; unless those I best cherish are so I
                    cannot be so myself. Please don't think I would make a gloomy &amp;
                    cheerless fireside. to me the shake of your dear curly head &amp; the rapid
                    motion of your foot are very <hi rend="underline">Ex</hi>p<hi rend="underline"
                        >ressive</hi> I saw these when you spoke of Sue Forney &amp; I wondered
                    then if you thought I would be such a gloomy wife, a dark cloud to hide the
                    light, the beauty, &amp; happiness of home &amp; not a "fireside angel"
                    making home a sweet &amp; much loved shelter for the dayworn husband. what
                    were your thoughts then? did you think I was like Sue? perhaps I have been
                    unjust to you &amp; this I do not want to be for I love you too dearly to be
                    unjust forgive me then. one of my greatest wishes is to please you &amp; to
                    render myself a worthy object for you to love &amp; trust. I <abbr
