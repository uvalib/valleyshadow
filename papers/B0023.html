<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to John
                    A. McDonnell, November 9, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson asks McDonnell for advice on how to handle three assault cases against
                    freed blacks, noting high levels of negative feeling towards them. He also
                    mentions James Bumgardner's (Commonwealth Attorney) refusal to prosecute one of
                    the cases.</p>

<p class="p10">November 9th 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to report three cases of assault upon colored persons, and to
                    ask instructions, as from what transpired this morning, I cannot but infer that
                    the prosecuting officer will not willingly perform his duty as a public officer.</p>
<p class="p10">On the 1<sup>st</sup> Inst Hartwell Baker (col'd) was assaulted by Patrick O'Nole who snapped a pistol at him
                    several times, but as it did not explode he beat him with the butt of the
                    pistol.</p>
<p class="p10">Taken before a magistrate O'Nole was fined $17"" <i>[unclear: Son]</i> Hartwell
                    coming to me I sent him and his witnesses to Mr Bumgarner the Com
                    Atty no action yet taken.</p>
<p class="p10">On the 1<sup>st</sup> Inst Hugh Jackson (col'd) complained that on Oct
                    31st James L spencer assulted him with a knife. I referred him also to Mr.
                    Bumgarner- and no action yet taken.</p>
<p class="p10">Nov 8. Abraham Wallace (col'd) complained that on
                    October 31<sup>st</sup> James L Spencer assaulted him with a knife. I
                    referred him also <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to Mr. Bumgarner and
                    no action yet taken</p>
<p class="p10">Nov 8. Abraham Wallace (col<sup>d</sup>) complained on that day Henry Ford
                    discharged a loaded pistol three times and snapped a cap the fourth time at his
                    wife Eveline Wallace. This morning I addressed enclosed letter to Mr Bumgarner making a mistake in his intials which are
                    James <i>[unclear: L]</i>. He opened the letter, said to Wallace I had no right
                    to write anything to him and without giving Wallace any advice or satisfaction
                    returned my letter by him. Sentiment is so strong against Freedpeople here (not
                    withstanding their quiet deportment) since the election, that I fear unless such
                    outrages are promptly checked there will be trouble between the two classes.</p>
<p class="p10">I respectfully ask instructions as to what steps I am authorized to take in such
                    cases.</p>
<p class="p10">Very respectfully<br>Yr obt
                        serv</p>
