<h4>Franklin County: P. T. Zarhoviy to M. L. Brewer, April 18, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>P. T. Zarhoviy attempts to answer M. L. Brewer's questions about his grandfather's will and
     estate. Zarhoviy suggests that M. L. Brewer direct several questions to his uncle George W.
     Brewer. In relating his knowledge of his grandfather's affairs, Zarhoviy mentions "Old Negro
     Poll," as an heir, probably a daughter since she is later referred to as "your Aunt
    Pollie."</p>

<p class="p10">April 18<sup>th</sup> 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Bedford Monroe County, Mich</p>
<p class="p10">M. L. Brewer Esq<br> Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">It would be more than useless to make an opoligy for not answering
     your quiries
     <u>much</u> sooner. I will however say, I forgot it from time to time till it is too back</p>
<p class="p10">I am not posted to answer your quiries, I will however give you
     all I can recollect In the first place my adm on your
     Father estete
     come pelled me to get a coppy of your
      G. Fathers will, This I got only a short time before I
     requested to be released as adm and Andrew Kershner was
      appointd by the Court adm
     <i>[unclear: De Bower]</i> Now, and I gave up all papers &amp; credits in my hand to him.
     I recollect well that by your G.F. will all his children
     were mentioned even Old Negro Poll, and as your Fathers part was a set off against his legacy*
     I was compelled to know the worth of the will your Unkle
     Geo Brewer was executor in will and thus far only I became initated
     in the Settlement with Geo.
     B. Andrew Kershner however found it necessary to sell your Fathers
     lands. This is a matter I could never understand, as it appeared to me all might have been paid
     without selling all the land <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Your Unkles and aunts ware all mentioned and cared for in your G.F.s will, as said before, but as to the amt of each
     legacy, I am not able to say at this time Henry Brewer's Heirs are Geo. Brewer, Henry Brewer, Emanuel B- Elisabeth Brewer-(Mrs
      <i>[unclear: Feidt]</i>) Polly Brewer (Mrs Troxell) Sallie Brewer (Mrs Herschberger) and
     Negro Pollie This is all I can say about the will &amp; Matter your onley way is to have a coppy of your G.F.s will, and coppy of the settlements
     made with the orphans Court. Also a coppy of settlements made by your
      Unkle
     Geo, as adm of your Aunt Mary
     Traxell This will show you all you need on the subject and all that will be of any use to you
     in the premises. I suppose you have done So already. I would do it at onc if not done. If my recollection serves me right John Traxell could not get at his
     wifes legacy, But is so long since that I forget, it perhaps was a lieu on some real estete the interest of which fell annually to your Aunt Pollie. I know
     there ware some kinks in referance to her
     legacy. Troxell was a shiftless man and <i>[unclear: ]</i> a guard against squandering by your G. Father. I am sorry that I delayed this matter so long. Nothing
     however can go wrong by this as your course is before on record in Washington County Md in the Prothonotory office We are all well. My respects to you
     &amp; family write soon.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours &amp;c</p>
<p class="p10"><i>P T Zarhoviy</i></p>
<p class="p10">P. S. Peter is anxiously waiting to hear from you on the Mill Situation
      for him, if any can be found near you <p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br></p>*Your Father got his farm of his Father and was indebted to his estate, which had to be answered to your Unkle
      Geo
      B. executor in to will of your G.
      Father Brewer </p>
