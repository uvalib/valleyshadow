<p class="p10">Friend Thomas,</p>
<p class="p10">I received you letter and was glad to hear<i>[deleted: e]</i> you
     were doing very well. I hope the others are well also. Since I last wrote to you, we have had
     some trouble. It appears to me like the world is full of trouble and we have to shear a great portion of it. But I know there are others who have to bear
     more than we do. Last Friday night we were all fast asleep when a loud noise at the door awoke
     us. We got up as quick as we could and opened the door when in came four robbers. Oh! how it
     made our hearts beat when they threatened to kill Sam and burn the house if we did not give up
     all our money. Maggie Sam's wife had the purss. She gave it to them. I
     never in all my life heard such oaths. We gave them all we had. Darthula &amp; Mary are
     teaching. <i>[unclear: Mat is going to May.]</i> Do you get any
     thing from home excepe letters. How are the others boy doing
     for money or clothes? Tell them to let me know theire Situation.</p>
<p class="p10">My love to you <u>all</u>.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Emily Hull</i></p>
<p class="p10">How much do they allow you to write at one time? We do <u>not</u> hear from Va. Tell me the news from
      home </p>
