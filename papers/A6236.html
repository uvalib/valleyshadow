<p class="p10">I was truly glad to here from You. You Must pardon Me for
                    delaying so long. I would of answered Sooner but My time is so Much taken up
                    that I put it of from time to time untill four weeks has Elapsed Since your Much Esteemed
                        <i>[unclear: letter]</i> come to hand. You Speak Well for Staunton She is
                    far ahead of our town in Schools I dont think there is
                    a first class school in Our town at this time</p>
<p class="p10">but I suppose Some Gentlemen With literary taste will establish One-- You also
                    pay quite a compliment to the people of Winchester in Speaking of their Business
                    qualifications I think My Self business is conducted differant in Winchester from what it is in Staunton but whethe it is conducted to a greater advantage I cant tell-- as the people Seems to prosper in business up
                    there as well as Winchester. I am sorry to inform you that Mother has been very
                    sick I really thought she would not recover but she <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>is getting
                    better. I hope she will recover her health again.</p>
<p class="p10">Tif arrived from Moorefield on yesterday she is well but is talking of going back
                    again in a couple of weeks All the family are well you Must write soon again.
                    Love to all</p>
