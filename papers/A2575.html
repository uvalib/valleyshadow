<p class="p10">August 1, 1860</p>
<p class="p10">Gibson</p>
<p class="p10">Mrs. S. A. C. Hotchkiss <br>Dear Madam</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of Apr 10 came duly to hand but I have not found time to ascertain the amount due from
     James until - within a few days First, have now got the <i>[unclear: indgt.]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> for $2228,84 as per statement enclosed</p>
<p class="p10"> I also enclose a statement of your amount the two statements, I presume do not require any
     further explanations</p>
<p class="p10"> I expect to complete an arrangement this week for the pay<sup>t</sup> of amount due from James by Mr Jacob Taylor, one half June 1861,
     balance June 1862, this is better than I have expected until quite recently</p>
<p class="p10"> Mr Taylor bought of Geo Comfort the Mill, and land on the east
     side of the lake, and stream, and James, &amp; his son Nelson bought back from Geo all on the other <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> side. With kind regards to Mr Hotchki I remain </p>
<p class="p10">Very truly yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>U. Burrows</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. As the title to the land was in the executors probably it will not
      be necessary to have anything from you besides the rec<sup>t</sup>
       that I took at the time of the payment of the money -- <br>On looking to the receipt
      I conclude to send a duplicate for you and Mr Hotchkiss to sign, and return to me, seting forth the fact that I was understood that I was the purchaser of
      the land -- <br>U.B.</p>
