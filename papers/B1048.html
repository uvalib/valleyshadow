<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Orlando Brown, September 30, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson attributes the inability of blacks to receive fair judgements from local
                    magistrates to a result of their ignorance of the legal system, and notes that
                    he makes an effort to represent freedmen when they cannot obtain counsel.</p>

<p class="p10">Sept. 30 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Cir.
                    Ord.
                    No. 6, Series 1866 I have the honor to report that
                    during the month of September several trials of Freedmen have been had before
                    the county court. In all of these full justice was accorded by court and jury.
                    In minor cases before Magistrates in their districts, Freedmen, being without
                    counsel, cannot fully obtain impartial justice, but this is more the result of
                    their own ignorance, than wrong action on the part of the justice, basing his
                    decision upon the facts, as presented. To remedy this as much as lies in my
                    power, I shall continue to notify magistrates that if Freedmen request, the
                    examination be postponed until I can be sent for to appear for them.</p>
