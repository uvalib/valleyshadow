<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, April 22, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife and describes his plans for his return home. He
                    discusses efforts to settle people on the family land and hopes that Louise,
                    once his slave, will stay on at the house. He states that many people have lost
                    heavily on now-worthless Confederate money. He also has lost, but not as badly
                    as some. He reports that Staunton is quiet and dull. The army is gone, but the
                    railroad to Richmond is still destroyed, making communication beyond the city
                    difficult.</p>

<p class="p10">April 22/65</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Hester</p>
<p class="p10">I start Jack &amp; family &amp; Louise for home today. I have fit Jack
                    out with team &amp;c &amp; want him to locate on some of our land
                    &amp; farm it to make a living for himself &amp; something for us. If
                    could be done it would suit best to put him on your land of home place, as he
                    could haul wood to you But under the present condition of affairs it might be
                    best not to have him so close to town To put him on the North farm he would have
                    most room but so close to the pike that he might be interupted The Lowry farm would suit best I think at this time as J-
                    &amp; M<sup>r</sup> G. could see after him if the house along the
                    road is vacated. I have written to J &amp; M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> G on the subject &amp; asked them to assist him &amp;c they may
                    see you on the subject if so view all the advantages &amp; disadvantages
                    &amp; Make the best arrangement you can for him &amp; it will suit me
                    now He I think will stay there &amp; if so I will do a good part by him he
                    will want a cow &amp; a few hogs to raise. I want him to put out some corn
                    if it is late<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I want Louise to go home &amp; stay with you
                    &amp; I think you will get along better She has expressed a desire to go
                    &amp; I think she will remain with you &amp; she seems determined to do
                    it. You will have to fix her up a little in clothing, and take positive controll over her. F &amp; J are quite well F still
                    goes to school &amp; learns fast we are fixing up for our tramp home. I have
                    expected to get off next week but may not get off so soon, but will at least go
                    the week following, When as Aunt Matty says we will have a new wedding. You have
                    no idea how much I want to see you</p>

                    will rent out the Hotel today. the Man is to be here for that purpose</p>
<p class="p10">I have stopped the store &amp; divided the good<sup>s</sup>
                    &amp; will either sell at wholesale or put in someones hand<sup>s</sup> to sell for me. I have a number of small matters to settle up here
                    which I must put in some good shape before leaving &amp; it takes sometime
                    to do it May get through sooner than now expected if so will not delay in coming
                    home</p>
<p class="p10">We have had a heavy crash here in money matters Confed<u>
                            <sup>t</sup>
                        </u> money has gone up entirely I have lost smartly by it but not so
                    much as some here have. I am still not so bad off<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> here have nothing
                    new to write that will interest you it is quite dull here now being no
                    communication open from here to Richmond the rail
                    road having been distroyed &amp; not yet
                    repaired</p>
<p class="p10">Provisions &amp; everything here now seem plenty Our currency here now is
                    specie &amp; greenbacks No Army with us here now We now live quite a quiet
                    retied life</p>

                    be raised for him. He still has another rat terrier here raising</p>

                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> G. before coming home if you hear from me to that effect come out at once.
                    As I will be anxious to go through at once. Make all the necessary enquire
                    &amp; be prepared to give me all the information desired</p>
