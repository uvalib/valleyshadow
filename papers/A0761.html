<p class="p10">Dear Sister </p>
<p class="p10">I received Mamas letter two or three days ago and received yours and cousin Kate's yesterday.
     I have had quite a nice time since I have been in camp. I have made the acquaintance of a good
     many nice officers. Capt Steptoe is one of the nicest gentleman I ever saw and is so kind to me. I understand that Floods &amp; Pickets divisions are camped
     near here &amp; Jones, Imboden, Hampton, Jenkins and W.H. Lee are and in fact all our
     cavalry forces are here. We expect to leave here for some unknown point in a day or two. I
     shall try and fill your memorandum if possible. I dont intend to write
     long letters to you when you have nothing to do and write short ones. Judge is here and sends
     his love. I will write to Ma in a day or two. Never forget to mention bro Jim in your letters. I will write to him soon. Love to all. I am your Bro, Kent.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cousin <br> I received your two very short notes and regret to write as I have nothing
     in the world to write. I have not seen your Bro yet. I shall give
     him your memorandum in full and shall tell him not to apply for a furlough untill he hears from you. Forbear he may not get another in time espetially if you are in as big a hurry as cousin Nannie R. I shall
     try to get the veil and dress. What cotton will you have it. The paper is unruled on the other
     side and I cant write on my knee. Judge sends love and speaks of you
     very often. I am your attached cousin, Kent. </p>
<p class="p10">I shall expect to hear from you all often but you musent look
     for letters from me more than every 2 weeks.</p>
