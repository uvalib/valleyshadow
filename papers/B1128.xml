                <p>In order to show the exact condition of Bureau Affairs in this District, I have
                    the honor to submit a special report on the subject of its organization.</p>

                <p>Sub-District "A"</p>

                <p>In <hi rend="underline">Alleghany</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi> there is a <unclear>Sergeant</unclear> as Agent
                    who reports "everything working smoothly" - "there are but few out of
                    employment, or unable" "to support themselves - the citizens are well disposed
                    "and willing to give the freedmen a fair chance."</p>

                <p>In <hi rend="underline">Bath</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi> a Sergeant is acting agent and reports
                    "everything working well, but some are inclined to defraud the freedmen. There
                    is quite a large percentage that will have to be looked after and helped as the
                    cold weather approaches."</p>

                <p>Of <hi rend="underline">Botetourt</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi>
                    <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Asst Supt</abbr> Tubbs says "It is
                    difficult to make any <unclear>correct</unclear> report of this county as I have
                    no one in it to attend to the affairs, and cannot get any one." <pb n="2"/>"I
                    have not heard from the detail you wrote to <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr>
                    Curtis for therefore my hands are tied."</p>

                <p>Having previously asked <abbr expan="General">Genl</abbr> Curtis to send men to
                    Fincastle with an officer under instructions to furnish a detail at the request
                    of <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Tubbs, and duly notified him to that
                    effect, I have now instructed <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt</abbr> Tubbs to at
                    once <hi rend="underline">apply</hi> for the detail and report result.</p>

                <p>I respectfully suggest the transfer of this county to the Seventh District, as it
                    may be easily controlled from Lynchburg.</p>

                <p>Of <hi rend="underline">Rockbridge</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi> the <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent"
                        >Assist Supt</abbr>, <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Tubbs says "There
                    are a few <unclear>people</unclear> here that are well-disposed, and willing to
                    assist the freedmen in making an honorable living; but the majority of them are
                    selfish, stubborn, mean, and try to take every advantage of the freedmen that
                    they can. Occasionally one is bold enough to say plainly, that as soon as the
                    yankees leave they will shoot them like dogs. The Union sentiment is so small
                    that it would require something more thorough than a
                    <unclear>Pennsylvania</unclear> search warrant to find it &amp;c.</p>

                <pb n="3"/>

                <p>Sub-<abbr expan="District">Dist</abbr> "B"</p>

                <p>Of <hi rend="underline">Augusta</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi>, Mr Tukey <abbr
                        expan="Assistant Superintendent">Assist Supt</abbr> says "the condition of
                    affairs of the Bureau is not as good as I would wish, and yet perhaps as good as
                    could be expected when one considers the prejudice of the citizens against the
                    freedmen, and the lack of facilities for executing the regulations of the
                    Bureau, meaning want of Cavalry to send for parties at a distance. I find,
                    almost invariably, that the disposition to abase the freedmen comes from the
                    lower and more ignorant class of people, those who were non-slave holders before
                    the War. <unclear>G--</unclear>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> have already developed the fact that the intelligence of the
                    freedmen is much higher than that of their fellows in Eastern Virginia where
                    schools were opened in 1861, and I attribute this to a higher intelligence of
                    the Whites and a more lenient policy towards their slaves."</p>

                <p>In <hi rend="underline">Highland</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi> Mr Tukey says there are probably not more than
                    one hundred freedmen and that he is promised a detail with which he will attempt
                    the census. Only one case of destitution reported to him and that was provided
                    for by the civil authorities.</p>

                <pb n="4"/>

                <p>Sub-<abbr expan="District">Dist</abbr> "C"</p>

                <p>In <hi rend="underline">Rockingham</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi> I have been unable to accomplish much of
                    anything. It is in this Military District of the Shenandoah, but the distance of
                    the County seat (67 miles) and the lack of transportation and obstacles to the
                    sustanance of troops there which cannot now be overcome, and an officer or agent
                    of this Bureau on duty there without troops would be of about as much use now as
                    if sent on the same mission a year or more ago. If there was any Cavalry in this
                    command, an attempt would be made to obtain the census, but as it is there is
                    little possibility of its being taken.</p>

                <p>In <hi rend="underline">Page</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi> there are no troops and no agent and if one
                    should be sent unattended I doubt he would have time to make a report. It is
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> a mountainous region and off the mail route. But the <del
                        hand="h1"/> of the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> stations at Woodstock the census was nearly completed, and a
                    wholesale <unclear>influence</unclear>
                    <unclear>extent</unclear>, so that the freedmen are not liable to be molested or
                    interfered with, and a large portion of the county is within
                    <unclear>march</unclear> of Woodstock.</p>

                <pb n="5"/>

                <p>In <hi rend="underline">Shenandoah</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi>, at Woodstock I have a new officer, <abbr
                        expan="Lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Goble who relieved <abbr expan="Lieutenant"
                        >Lt.</abbr> D. A. Smith in charge of the Sub District and whose short
                    experience does not enable him to make a definite report.</p>

                <p>From <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt</abbr> Smith - a good officer, taken from me to
                    be made <abbr expan="Acting Assistant Adjutant General">A.A.A.G.</abbr> of this
                    Military District, I learn that the freedmen are doing very will. All at work
                    for good wages, and that there is generally, no disposition among the citizens
                    to treat them unfairly, as they view fairness. The Whites are an intensely
                    disloyal people, in real sentiment, and were the protection of this Bureau to be
                    withdrawn, the freedmen would be treat pretty much as they used to be. The
                    census of the County is nearly completed, and as there are troops at Woodstock,
                    it will doubtless be ready for copying as soon as I receive the
                    <unclear>pr----d</unclear> blanks. A board of agents is organized, but no report
                    of cases tried has yet been <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>.</p>

                <pb n="6"/>

                <p>Sub <abbr expan="District">Dist.</abbr> "D"</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">Frederick</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi>, Mr McKenzie reports as in a flourishing and
                    prosperous condition. "Most of the Whites are disposed to deal fairly and
                    honorably with the freedmen. The demand for labor exceeds the supply. All of the
                    freedmen being profitably employed except the aged, helpless persons and some
                    children to whom rations are issued in part, the authorities not being prepared
                    to provide for their paupers."</p>

                <p>In <hi rend="underline">Clarke</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi> there is a Sergeant as Agent, and Mr McKenzie
                    says "Although the people are not so well disposed towards the freedmen, yet
                    they seem willing to obey the laws and orders of the Government." - "probably
                    because they dare not disobey them. Labor is even more scarce in this county
                    than in Frederick, ten (10) and twelve (12) dollars per month is offered for the
                    year. The withdrawal of the Bureau from this county would, I think, subject the
                    freedmen to all manner of abuse and persecution from their former masters."</p>

                <pb n="7"/>

                <p>In <hi rend="underline">Warren</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi> there are neither troops nor agent, and for
                    similar reasons to those given in relation to Rockingham.</p>

                <p>The <abbr expan="Assistant Superintendent">Assist Supt</abbr> says "The sending
                    of an agent supported by a detachment of troops would be of great benefit to the
                    freedmen in that benighted region as I am afraid that in distant parts of this
                    county they are subject to <unclear>imposition</unclear> and actions of
                    injustice which are not brought to my notice owing to the great distance from
                    this, the nearest military Post."</p>

                <p>In <hi rend="underline">Berkeley</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi> there was a sergeant as agent, but he had
                    scarcely begun his work when he with his company were sent to the Kanawah Valley
                    in West <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr> The freedmen are well treated and at
                    work for fair wages. An agent will be stationed at Martinsburg, and the census
                    completed if possible. The board of agents will I think be established there
                    without difficulty.</p>

                <p>In <hi rend="underline">Jefferson</hi>
                    <hi rend="underline">County</hi>, <abbr expan="Lieutenant">Lt.</abbr> Smith says
                    that the freedmen are doing pretty well and are generally at work for usual
                    wages but that the whites are unwilling to concede any rights or privileges
                    other than those enjoyed (?) before the war, and if the troops should be removed
                    they would suffer petty persecutions and much ill treatment, particularly at
                    Harpers Ferry and at Charleston. From this place each named the soldiers were
                    withdrawn shortly after I had procured them to be stationed there, and just as I
                    had arranged for the establishment of a school, to which the whites were
                    bitterly opposed, and which I think could hardly be maintained without the
                    presence of a supporting force.</p>

                <p>I have had great difficulty in obtaining a proper officer for this Sub District,
                    but believe that now to have been overcome, and anticipate an
                    <unclear>effective</unclear> superintendence of Bureau affairs in Sub <abbr
                        expan="District">Dist.</abbr> E.</p>

                <p>All of which is respectfully submitted and I remain, Colonel</p>
