 is made out of   
 <br>  
 the vinegar and powder about a   
 <br>  
 half hour ago

 it was a substitute for something

<p class="p11"><b>Note</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Based on the contents of this letter,<br>  
 we have determined that it was probably written in February of 1863.    <br>
 Donely mentions that Levi Maish had just been promoted to colonel  <br>
 of the regiment;military records show that Maish was made Colonel   <br>
 of the 130th Regiment of the Pennsylvania Volunteers on February 3, 1863 <br> 
 (see Samuel Bates, History of the Pennsylvania Volunteers, Vol. IV, p. 207).</p>
