<p class="p10">Mt. Solon, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. D.H. Evans,</p>
<p class="p10">Your dear, &amp; twice welcome letter of Tuesday came safely. I was so
                    thankful to hear that you were well. If I had known last night that pa was going
                    to Staunton this morning I would have written to you by him. I thought of you so
                    often Sunday night during your lonely ride, &amp; did wish that I could have
                    been with you. I went off to myself just to think of you after you left. I love
                    to think of you always. How much I want to see you to
                    night. It will be such a long &amp; weary two weeks before you can
                    come again. I wish that important day was<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>already here so you could
                    come &amp; just to think I cannot see your dear face until 9 O'clock
                    &amp; then we must meet in the presence of others &amp; only shake hands
                    with no warmer greeting for two days I don't like to think of it. Ada &amp;
                    Hamie M'Fall are not going to wait on Rennie. she rec'd a letter from Cousin David to day. he
                    will bring a lady, &amp; gentleman with him you myself, &amp; those two
                    will be the only attendents. Pa objected to H.
                    M'Fall. I was sorry on Ada's account but it can't be helped now. I wrote to Ella
                    by pa this morning before D. Sibert's letter came &amp; told her Miss Link
                    was not coming so <u>brother</u>
                    <u>David</u> wrote in his letter of Monday but now he writes
                    that he has asked another lady<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>&amp; so we can do nothing but let
                    them come. I objected to this last arrangement but it did no good for he had
                    already asked the lady. I only hope we all shall have a happy time. Cousin David
                    wants us all to spend Wednesday night in Bridgewater as their Minister will
                    preach that night a special sermon for the Groom, &amp; his attendants so he
                    wants us all to go to church can you stay? I hope you can if you do not, I will
                    come home with you, for I would not care to stay there without you were with me.
                    The two Miss <i>[illeg.]</i> were married this morning. Several other lady
                    friends of mine are to be married in a few days. I hope they will all be very
                    happy &amp; so they can be if they <u>will</u>. I wish I
                    was with you now<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I would be happy too. Mr. Estell called in twice this
                    week but I was too busy to see him. you see he is still in Mt. Solon he has
                    heard that it is Rennie who is to be married, &amp; not Miss Mollie. I do
                    not care about seeing him any more Rennie sends thanks for the buttens
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> they were the kind she wanted. I enclose <i>[unclear: 25]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> It will be so long so long <i>[unclear: befor]</i> can come.
                    sometimes <i>[unclear: I]</i> feel like I can't wait. I love you so truly
                    &amp; so devotedly that I want to have you near me or I am not happy
                    &amp; contented my only &amp; greatest joy &amp; pleasur is to be with you who I love with all the
                    strength &amp; devotion of my heart &amp; entire nature. Yes I do indeed
                    love you &amp; only you. no man in all this world can ever take my heart
                    &amp; all of its deep &amp; fervent love from you. I have yours <i>[deleted: ]</i> they are truly yours my heart, &amp; its love shall never
                    belong to any but you while I have life, unless you yourself refuse to have them
                    &amp; even then I will still love you. Write to me soon I love to read your
                    dear true letters I read them over more then
                    <u>3 or 4 time</u>s I read them Every day till hear from you
                    again, or see you. I do want to see your darling face so much God bless you my
