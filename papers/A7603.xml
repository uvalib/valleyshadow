                    the children here with me would be satisfied. I am trying to buy Some place here
                    for a home &amp; if can will try &amp; get you out it is impossible to
                    rent a house here now all are full up. See in the mean time if you will be

                    hard to get I am sick &amp; tired being by myself and must have a change I
                    hope the Valley may be soon opened<pb n="2"/> &amp; there will be no
                    difficulty in getting out</p>

                    particularly Jane if you come out Jane or Mary or both must come out with you. I
                    will try &amp; get entirely out of the service so soon as I can My Physical
                    condition will not justify my remaining in service</p>

                <p>This is a place not liked by most of people but the people have been exceedingly
                    kind &amp; courteous to me about all of the 1<hi rend="super">st</hi>
