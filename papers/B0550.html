<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando

<p class="p10">Dec. 15th '65</p>
<p class="p10">Winchester</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to forward herewith my Estimate for Quartermaster Stores for the
                    Quarter ending March 31st 1865.</p>
<p class="p10">The fuel required will be absolutely essential to the existence of many Freedmen
                    and at this moment there is very great suffering which might and ought to be
                    relieved by the issue of fuel in small quantities, and which my previous
                    estimates if approved, would have enabled me to do so.</p>
<p class="p10">The wagons are really necessary and would have been asked for before, but for my
                    earnest desire to avoid unnecessary expense, and the hope that the local
                    Quartermasters would be able to supply all needs. Such is not the case, their
                    transportation being insufficient for their ordinary wants, leaving the business
                    of the Bureau to suffer through their helplessness. One wagon is needed at each
                    of the three principal points in this District, viz Winchester, Staunton, and
                    Lexington.</p>
<p class="p10">I have also respectfully to request action upon the requisitions previously
                    forwarded as the articles therein required are now very much needed.</p>
<p class="p10">I am, Colonel<br>Very Resply</p>
