                    Hon. Edwin Stanton
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Oct. 13th, 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">I beg leave respectfully to submit the following fact for your consideration</p>
<p class="p10">In the month of August 1862, the 126th regiment of the Pennsylvania volunteers
                    was organized at Harrisburg. My Son, Wm. Leedy, was a member of company "H" in
                    this regiment, at the time of enlistment he was not twenty-one years of age. He
                    volunteered in Franklin County, but was not mustered until he reached
                    Harrisburg; Franklin County, had given a bounty of $50 to volunteers. After my
                    son, Wm. Leedy, had been mustered in, the Captain of his company, Capt. Elda,
                    afterwards Colonel, refused to allow him his bounty for the reason that he was
                    in his minority and for fear that he would subsequently be taken out of the
                    service by his parents who were opposed to his enlisting, and he, the Capt., be
                    held responsible for the amount of the bounty by Franklin County. Thinking that
                    his disqualification on account of his minority would prevent him from receiving
                    his pay as well as his bounty he returned home from Harrisburg, where he
                    remained until the latter part of August last, when he was arrested and
                    forwarded to Fort McHenry as a Deserter.</p>
<p class="p10">His regiment was mustered out of service in the month of May preceding. My Son is
                    now confined to Fort McHenry and I respectfully submit in his behalf the facts
                    stated as correct and true, at the same time asking your favorable consideration
                    of his case.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Sir with sentiments of high regard<br> Your Obedient Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Daniel Leedy</i></p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Daniel Leedy is a respectable citizen of this County,
                        and an earnestly loyal man. His statements are worthy of entire
                        credit.<br><br> A.K. McClure<br> Chambersburg. Oct. 19, 1863<br><br> I
                        certify that the statements made by Daniel Leedy in regard to his Son is
                        correct and respectfully join in the request that his case be considered
                        favorably.<br> James G. Elder<br>Capt. Company H<br> afterwards Col.
                        126th Penna Vols. </p>
