<p class="p10">Dear Father, </p>
<p class="p10">I am still here but am fit to go the the Regiment at any moment. the sooner the
                    better. All soldiers here living in Michigan, Vermont, R. Island, Maine, N. Jersey and N. York soldiers living west of Albany, were transfered or furloughed. It is reported here that
                    Pennsylvania troops are to stay here and vote. I dont
                    know how it is. There was no <i>[unclear: agent]</i> around yet, to give us
                    tickets. five sixth of the men wont vote if kept here, since men from other states were transfered. the Doctors say that they have no order
                    for us yet and dont know if one will come for us or
                    not. The Ohio troops are in the same<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> fix. I expect we will be kept
                    here and not get a chance to vote. To day every man in
                    the Hospital was Vaxinated. There is now about
                    three hundred men here since the rest were transfered. Out of the 300 men here not fifty votes will be poled if they are kept here. Cant you send send me a blank filled up, all but signed, so that I can
                    send it home and still vote. If I dont get it nothing
                    will be lost. Dont write to me untill you hear further from me, but send a blank or something so that I
                    can vote, as soone as you receive this. From three to
                    eight die every day here. I am well.</p>
<p class="p10">Give My love to all.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Son </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Henry C. Metzger. </i></p>
<p class="p10">If here I will write to Ruth tomorrow. </p>
