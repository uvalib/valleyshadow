<p class="p10">July 30<sup>th</sup>
       /61</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Friend:-</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 19th inst. was received in due<br> time, I was
     sorry to hear that you were not well, but I<br> hope that you are now stout and hearty,
     enjoying the<br> pleasures of a beautiful country home. I know not<br> whether you would
     prefer a town life to one in the<br> country, but if you lived in town awhile and had<br>
     nothing to do, you would realize the truth of that<br> saying, that "nothing to do" is the
     hardest work that<br> one can engage in. I hope you will take care of that<br> and always
     manage to have something to do, for chil-<br> dren learn mischief
     when they learn nothing else.<br>
    </p>
<p class="p10"> You will excuse me for reminding me of the value<br> of health, but my object is to put you
     on your guard<br> that you may not, by unnecessary means, impare
     or<br> injure your health, for it is one of the greatest gifts<br>
     conferred upon a man by a bountiful Creator, a gift<br> which few
     enjoy, and which a still less number try<br> to preserve, how much less suffering would
     there<br> be in the world if people would regard their health<br>
     
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/BitCre6b.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitCre6b.gif"></center></a><br><br> in the proper light, The only possible excuse<br> that could be
     advanced for one's neglecting his health<i>[illeg.]</i><br> would, I suppose be, that Dr.s. must live too,<br> He who loses his health, by abusing it, will
     then for<br> the first time discover that he has forfeited <i>[deleted: it to]</i><br> all
     his claims to unalloyed and perfect happines.<br> Now as you and
     I are yet young and healthy,<br> let us resolve <i>[added: that]</i>
     our health shall claim its share of<br> attention,--that we will ever strive to preserve
     and<br> maintain it as long as it is the will of our Maker<br> to do so. </p>
<p class="p10">The war is not over yet,--the difficulties remain<br> unsettled-- the traitors still live to
     plot our destruction<br> yea: it is just beginning to assume its destructive form<br> the
     defeat at Manassas Junction, and the cruel manner<br> in which our
     wounded heroes were treated will forever<br> remain on the pages of history as a living
     testimony against<br> the humanity of the slave drivers of the South, when<br> the people of
     the North <i>[added: once]</i> suffer the cruelties which the<br>
     south chooses <i>[added: to]</i> inflict--when his life depends on
     the<br> sympathy of a southerner, he will say "the half<br> was not told us of <i>[added: the]</i> inhumanity of this people" 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/BitCre6c.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitCre6c.gif"></center></a><br><br> no, the war is not ended yet, we permitted the south<br> to
     inflict upon a poor and helpless race of Gods creatures<br> the most
     unjust tortures that was <i>[added: ever]</i> heaped upon<br> any
     race of human beings, and now we are to be asked to<br> do just what rational beings might
     have expected<br> to bow down on our knees <i>[added: before
     them]</i>, that a like burthen<br> may be placed upon <u>our</u> shoulders, but will we do it;<br> will we as freeman succumb to
     their unjust demands &amp;<br> will we sacrifice ourselves and our children to the<br>
     everlasting curse of slavedom? <u>No</u>, but we will<br> cheerfully
     sacrifice our all upon the alter of our Country<br> and stand by the Constitution and the laws
     until the<br> last drop of our hear's blood shall have oozed from
      <i>[added: our]</i><br> bosoms, not as long as we inherit the spirit
     by which<br> our fathers were actuated <i>[added: can we]</i> shrink
     from the task<br> before us, nor can <i>[added: we,]</i> until that
     spirit shall have<br> been entirely annihilated, yield to the mandate of<br> that notaious traitor Jeff. not until
     we have<br> lost everything that is noble in man, can we<br> consent to the destruction of
     the government,<br> which would be nothing less than our own destruction.<br> No the war is
     not ended yet, the fighting is 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="images/BitCre6d.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitCre6d.gif"></center></a><br><br> yet to do, and 
      Virginia
      will become a free<br> state, <u>and</u> slavery will gradually die
     out, and<br> how is this to be done? Why I will tell you<br> our troops will take 
      Virginia
     -- occupy it, --and then<br> the secessionists will have to leave to escape being<br>
     imprisoned for treason, and then western Virginia will<br> extend
     her government over the whole dominion<br> and abolish slavery herself, because the non-<br> slaveholders will carry the elections, and after Virginia<br> becomes a free state and presents to the other southern<br>
     states her advantage gained by freedom and their dis-<br>
     advantage incured by the curse of slavery they will<br>
     gradually one after the other become free, and those<br> who live to see it will behold the
      <u> whole union</u><br> cemented together by bonds of common<br> interest
     and brotherhood, this is my opinion<br> of the result of this war. </p>
<p class="p10"> I am getting along with study old fashioned<br> and have some hopes of getting home before
     long,<br> wishing you success in your efforts to get<br> a birth of
     school teaching. </p>
<p class="p10"> I remain your,<br> true friend</p>
