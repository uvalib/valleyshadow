Charles Brooks to Emmet Brooks, June 22, 1862

<p class="p10">June 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Gordonsville</p>
<p class="p10">
Dear Emmet,</p>
<p class="p10">We continued our march on yester-<br>
day and reached this place about 3 o'clock.  The march <br>
was very disagreeable on account of the heat and <br>
dust.  Today we are resting in camp.  It may be <br>
we will go on tomorrow, if so I hope they will <br>
find us on the cars.  It is said that the troops have
been <br>
getting off at Louisa Court House;
that is near<br>
enough Richmond for me <i>[added: in]</i>
this warm weather.<a href="#n1">[1]</a>
I reckon <br>
they were a little disappointed at home that I did <br>
not return with you.  I hope Dryden will
be more suc <br>
cessful next time.<a href="#n2">[2]</a>
I suppose 
Gen. Jackson is still in <br>
Richmond.
No answer yet to
Capt. White's
request to
return <br>
to Staunton.<a href="#n3">[3]</a>
Write soon and often as I feel anxious <br>
to hear from Moffet
<a href="#n4">[4]</a>.  Love to all.
</p>
<p class="p10">Your Brother,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
Charles
</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. We have orders to march tomorrow at 5 o'clock <br>
and will probably reach
Louisa
C.H. and it is
repor <br>
ted that the front troops have gone on to Hanover <br>
Junction.  
Gen Jackson's Staff are
quartered at <br>
Rev Mr Elwing's.

<p class="p11"><b>Notes</b></p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n1">[1]</a> In this letter, written just after Jackson's Valley Campaign
of 1862 and immediately before the Seven Days' Campaign, Charles Booker
describes the punishing marches that the troops endured as they rushed
eastward towards Richmond, where they were to reinforce Lee's army.
Given the broiling sun, lengthy marches, and dusty or muddy trails
that the troops faced, Charles' desire to take
a train from Gordonsville, which is on the
Virginia Central Railroad line, to the Richmond area is understandable
(Robertson, <i>The Stonewall Brigade</i>, 113-115; Robertson,
<i>4th Virginia Infantry</i>, 15).  But, as Charles remarks
in his penciled postscript,
his wish for a train ride did not come true and his company
indeed had to march toward Richmond; by June 25, they made it as far as
Ashland, which is approximately twelve miles from Richmond (Bean, 123).

</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">[2]</a> In acknowledging his family's disappointment that he
had not come to Waynesboro with his brother Emmett,
perhaps Charles is referring to their hopes
that he would be able to find a substitute and return home.  See also
Schyler Trible's letter of July 2, 1862.  Perhaps
in referring to "Dryden," Charles Booker meant
Captain T. A. Dryden, who is listed
as a nominee for magistrate in The Staunton Spectator, May 22, 1860.
Alternatively, he could be referring
to Thomas H. Dryden of Augusta County, a
farmer who joined the 5th Virginia in March of 1862 at age 41.
Thomas Dryden was listed as absent due to illness on May 14, 1862 and never
returned to service (Wallace, 113).

</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">[3]</a> While the troops were moving toward Richmond,
Captain Hugh White fell ill at Charlottesville (which is southwest
of Gordonsville), so he went home to Lexington on sick leave (Bean, 124).
Perhaps here Charles is referring to Captain White's
attempt to take sick leave.

</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">[4]</a> In late June of 1862, Moffett Brooks was in all likelihood
at home sick with typhoid fever.  He died of typhoid
fever in Waynesboro on
June 29, 1862, a week after Charles wrote this letter (Robertson,
<i>4th Virginia Infantry</i>, 40).
