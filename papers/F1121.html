<p class="p10">January 10, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Stephensville, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father:</p>
<p class="p10">Your letter of 4th and 5th came to hand yesterday evening. I was truly glad to
                    hear from you. I am well at present-hoping that these few lines may finde you all enjoying the same blessings of health-</p>
<p class="p10">I received Rachel's letter but your others I did not. I was glad to get them awls
                    and Bristles and thread and needle. I intended that you should send me shoemaker
                    threads but one of my mess mates got a box sent
                    from home and had shoe thread in it and he had a variety of provisions in it. He
                    shares with us.</p>
<p class="p10">There is 4 of us together-William H. Wolff from Bridgeport, near Loudon, Solomon
                    Dale from Centee County, Ben Bowlesboro and James Deckert. The rest of the mess
                    have sent for stores so that they can share with Solomon Dale while he has
                    shared with us.</p>
<p class="p10">I thought that I could have a small box made up for me as there is a great many
                        boxs has come through to our Regt. by express. By being addressed the same as the letter-if you
                    fix me up a small box tell Rachel to put some dry cherries-dry huckleberries, a
                    crock of apple butter and a few pounds of butter. Some fat cakes as they will
                    keep-that is if the fat is not to scarce-about 2 loaves
                    of bread and get a bucket that is like that small one of mine-with the lid
                    on-one that will hold a gallon. Fill it with sorkrout and put in some cuccumber pickles.
                    We would like the bucket to answer for making coffee in. Dale's box weighed
                    about 2 hundred pounds.</p>
<p class="p10">I wish to mention that you must not think that I am starving. I have enough to
                    eat. But the rest have shared with me and I would like to give something in
                    return. If some of the neighbors feel like helping to fix up the box it will be
                    gladly rec'd.</p>
<p class="p10">Put in some sausages-some pudding. Dale had roasted chicken sent to him. They
                    were froze over night after they were roasted then packed up. Send some dry
                    beef-some roasted chiken.</p>
<p class="p10">If they wish send some eggs as eggs are worth 60 cents a dozen here. Put them in
                    something to pack them-with some corn meal.</p>
<p class="p10">Tell Rachel to put in some dry beans-that is those that were dried green-put in
                    some apples-send a box weighing about 100 pounds more or less. You may do about
                    this as you please.</p>
<p class="p10">Now at this present time, Aunt Sally Lincoln gives us buisquits. Only they are pretty harde on the
                    teeth. It is a good thing to have a change.</p>
<p class="p10">You may send the box when it suits you. I for my part would not ask you to go to
                    any trouble for me. Dale got his box a few days ago. Deckert got his box today.
                    Willim H. Wolrff's box is on the way. They share with me. I feel like sharing
                    with them. If you cannot send such articles as I mentioned...Send anything that
                    is eatable for we are not choicy here or sneaken.</p>
<p class="p10">Now, about the weather. It snowed nearly all day on the 4th of this month as we
                    are South as they call it. It still snows here and the snow is cold here too.</p>
<p class="p10">Tuesday we were sent out on three day picket. On Wednesday night it snowed nearly
                    all night. You may guess how it goes to be out in the snow. 2 hours at a time
                    without fire and when you are off of post and want to lay down to sleep you can
                    lay down and let it snow on you. I tried it but the snow tickled my face to much to sleep.</p>
<p class="p10">We picketed along the Rappahannock River. Every 15th day comes my turn to go out
                    on 3 day picket. It has been very cold for 2 weeks back. I must close for the
                    present.</p>
<p class="p10">I will write soon again.</p>
<p class="p10">Farewll for this time.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>F. Rosenbery</i></p>

                        To John Rosenbery
