<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Sept. 17, 1861</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">General,</p>
<p class="p10">I have purchased some 8000 bushels of corn, knowing your want am sending it forward rapidly,
     together with company supplies of all sorts. Major <i>[unclear: Corly]</i> the quarter Master
     for the north west being stationed off your line at Hardy <i>[unclear: V]</i> the business in
     that Department from some cause is badly arranged on the Monterey line,for instance I have sent
     out thousands of bags with grain &amp; c &amp; not one has ever been returned for
     supplies. I have again been compelled to commence the impressments of wagons &amp; pledge
     the farmers that their teams shall only be kept one trip.</p>
<p class="p10">My object in writing to you direct, is to ask the favor of you to direct the return of all
     the bags &amp; also all the wagons &amp; teams that can be spared. I will return them
     immediately with corn &amp; oats for the horses, which you so much need. Col. J. B. Baldwin
     also wishes grain &amp; c. sent to the Petersburg Line. With your aid I trust I will be
     able to keep both lines well supplied, but it is a matter of utmost importance that there
     should be a prompt return of any spare wagon, empty bags &amp;c &amp;c. Teams are of
     little use when feed cannot be supplied. With great consideration and respect I am,</p>
<p class="p10">Your obt. Servt., M.G. Harman Major Comdg &amp; c.</p>
<p class="p10"><i></i></p>
<p class="p10">I have almost exhausted this country in the way of horses &amp;
      wagons &amp; purchased nearly all that was for sale &amp; impressing the farmer's
      teams for one trip only. You will do me the favor to see that my promises are complied with
      &amp; not kept but one trip as this will enable me to make all our people do their part of
      the transportation. I am very sorry General to trouble your with these matters, but I am
      unable to manage the transportation without your assistance. I sent out yesterday 25 wagons
      &amp; today 26 wagons loaded with corn and company (or commissary) supplies.</p>
