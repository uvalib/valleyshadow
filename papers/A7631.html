<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, July 26, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife and reports a safe arrival in Staunton after a
                    difficult journey. He says that Freddy is doing well, and mentions the work he
                    does at the hotel. He also discusses his efforts to sell the hotel, including
                    his decision to hold on to it until after the war to take advantage of better
                    currency values. He also discusses supplies he is shipping from home.</p>

<p class="p10">July 26/64</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose you are anxious to hear how we got home. I had written to you &amp;
                    forwarded with some money $100 Maryland 20$ green backs
                    but the carrier could not get it through and brought it back to me again,
                    &amp; now I start it on again hope it may reach you safely this time.</p>
<p class="p10">We reached here safely after a hard tiresome time camping out each night Freddy
                    enjoyed the trip very much. we are well now. Freddy enjoys himself here very
                    much 
                        nocking
                     about the Hotel running errand<sup>s</sup>, carrying messages
                    for me &amp;c &amp;c I find him of great help to me he stand<sup>s</sup> in the office &amp; collect tickets at the dining
                    room door thus making himself quite useful. I write this &amp; send both
                    together. I hope you are all well Freddy wishes for you daily &amp; I too I
                    do wish you were all here we are doing a good business here now.</p>
<p class="p10">I had a bidder for the hotel yesterday I think we could have sold for $200,000<sup>
                        <u>00</u>
                    </sup> two hundred thousand Dollars furniture &amp; all. but this we would
                    not take. gold is 25 for one which would make but Eight thousand dollars in coin
                    and to hold the property until after the war it will always bring about fifty
                    thousand dollars in good currency &amp; from this it would seem best to hold
                    on to it as we could not apply the money now to any advantage. I would much
                    rather rent it out but if I have to stay away from home, I dont see any better chance to make money than this although it is a
                    disagreeable business</p>
<p class="p10">I wish we could have had more time to consider this matter and have come to some
                    definite <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> conclusion on this subject</p>
<p class="p10">The things I had with me I got through safely the articles groceries &amp;c,
                    I sent out are still at the place I sent them near millcreek I could not get a
                    wagon to bring them out M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> T- disappointed me. I suppose he was afraid to venture out here. I will
                    still try &amp; get them out Capt B- is going
                    down &amp; will try &amp; get them out. I still hope the way home will
                    soon be open again if so I will try &amp; get home again Freddy dont want to go for fear he wont
                    get back again</p>
<p class="p10">Use the money enclosed as you desire. if from time to time you can, you might
                    collect up such things as we will need here, you can tell what is most needed.</p>
<p class="p10">I forgot the letter paper &amp; pencils &amp; small long narrow
                    memorandum books if have a chance try &amp; send them out to me</p>
<p class="p10">Freddy is in bed sleeping soundly all here make a greateal of him think he is sharp &amp; keen I learn bad news from
                    Jack &amp; family he had fully fixed to leave upon the Yankees return I will
                    make a change with him</p>
<p class="p10">remember me kindly to all. May god bless &amp; protect you all.</p>
<p class="p10">try &amp; keep some help with you</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever</p>
<p class="p10"><i>J Q A Nadenbousch</i></p>
<p class="p10">Henry died a few days after we reached home he had every
                        attention the doctors set up with him all night trying to save him, but he
                        died</p>
