<h4>Augusta County: [Unknown] to Annie Harris, November
                    27, 1862<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>The author discusses the difficulties of moving the army through mountainous
                    terrian. He also discusses the high prices of foods, comments on camp life, and
                    says that he suspects the army is moving to stop Burnside's march on

<p class="p10">Nov 27<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Madison C.H.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>My</u>
                        <u>Own</u> Dear Annie,</p>
<p class="p10"> For fear that you may come to the conclusion that I did not receive your last
                    letter or that I don't intend to answer it, I will embrace the present
                    opportunity of replying. We left our old camp 5 miles below Winchester on friday
                    the 21<sup>st</sup>, crossing the <i>[unclear: Massanutten]</i>
                    Mountain at New Market. We then marched up the river towards Swift Run Gap to
                    the ford near the "Columbia Bridge" (which was burnt by Col Ashby to prevent Genl Shields from
                    cutting off our forces in their retreat from Winchester to Port Republic) where
                    we crossed &amp; proceeded to the Blue Ridge, crossing into Madison County
                    about 12 miles from the Court House and on the road leading directly to
                    Gordonsville. We are now about 16 miles from that place on the road leading from
                    Madison C.H. to Orange C.H. and about 1 mile from the former place.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    We have travelled over 100 miles being on the march
                    6 days. I must say that I have never passed over such a country before &amp;
                    hope I never shall again. Some times we would travel for two miles &amp; not
                    be over one hundred yards from where we started, I mean in a straight line. We
                    were one whole day crossing the mountain, &amp; then didn't get over. lay
                    one night in the mountain amongst the rocks &amp; brush with no covering.
                    Save what could be made of oil cloths &amp; blankets it being to rough to pitch tents. rained all night. what you think
                    of that? Well I have no news, so I will have to confine myself to <u>nonsense</u>. We seen some right pretty mountain <u>
                        lassas
                    </u> who did not seem affraid to show their
                        <i>[unclear: lincy]</i>, &amp; then we saw some that were most
                    intolerable ugly, have not had the pleasure of seeing any of the Tucahoe Galls around camp yet. Think I shall walk out after I get
                    rested &amp; see if there are any to be<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> found &amp; it may be
                    that I may get a good dinner by the operation. by the way just cook there. John
                    &amp; James Beard have just come in with a fine lot of persimmons so I will
                    have to stop &amp; eat a while &amp; then finish. Well I have eatten my
                    satisfaction of them things for <i>[illeg.]</i> my mouth
                    <i>[unclear: ain't]</i> more than half as big as it was &amp; I firmly
                    believe if I had eatten a while longer I woldn't have had any <i>[unclear: 
                        attall
                    ]</i>. I will now give you some idea of the prices we have to pay for our
                    little nicknacks. Apples the size of <i>[unclear: milled]</i> walnuts sell at a
                    1$ per day. Half moon <i>[unclear: pris]</i> with two cherries in 75 cents a
                    piece, other things in proportion. <i>[unclear: Passed]</i> from two four
                    dollars per <i>[unclear: quire]</i> Envelopes <i>[unclear: 1$]</i> a pack. So
                    you see how we poor soldiers have to do, &amp; under
                    go.</p>
<p class="p10">I have heard nothing said about the Yankees since we came here, dont know whether they are still advancing or not.<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Our
                    whole army is on this side of the Ridge, making preparations to meet Burnside in
                    his advance upon Richmond, which I suppose from all accounts will not be long.
                    My impression is that we will go to Richmond before long some of the troops it
                    is said are going off on the cars now. well I must bring this to close, as I am
                    too cold to write any more.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my love to all enquiring friends &amp; <i>[deleted: ]</i> a larger portion to yourself. excuse all mistakes <i>[unclear: burn]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: when]</i> you have done</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i></i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S.<br> Direct to Gordonsville when you write again
                        &amp; if we are there I'll get it &amp; if we go on it will follow.
                        I saw D<sup>r</sup>
