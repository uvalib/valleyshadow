<p class="p10">March 10<sup>th</sup> 1862 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Bell Blain Vir. </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sister </p>
<p class="p10">I received your welcome letter of the 1<sup>rst</sup> alt. and was
                    very happy to hear that you were all in good health. </p>
<p class="p10">We were relieved from provost guard on the <i>[illeg.]</i> and had a great
                    parting time. All the people on the place white and black assembled together to
                    take farewell from us. Mrs. Seddan gave us a boiled Ham and filed our Haversacks with <i>[unclear: 
                        buishels
                    ]</i> to take along. they all said they were sorry that we were taken away
                    and they wished us to come down to see them if we could. the parting scene was
                    concluded by an old darky whom we called Uncle Tom asking blessings for us. i
                    was send to the river a few days after we were relieved
                    on buisness by Gen. Patrick. they all said they wished we were back again, while
                    we were there. there was always some fun going on, but<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br><i>[deleted: ]</i> the Infantry thats there now were like a set of Quakers. they used to call us
                    freemasons. We got to our camp near Whiteoak Church about an hour before sunset
                    and again we got our shelters put up. a snowstorm commenced, which lasted all
                    day sunday Feb <i>[illeg.]</i> we missed our good quarters very much in such
                    rough weather but <i>[illeg.]</i> without doing us harm. We were to move camp
                    on Feb. 22<sup>nd</sup> but were prevented by the bad weather until
                    the 1<sup>rst</sup> of march on which day we moved. Our new camp is
                    about one mile from Bell Blain landing within sight of the Potomac river; it is
                    situated in a pine forest on the southside of a hill, and it is the most
                    convienient campground we have had since we have been in Vir. We were busy all
                    last week building log <i>[illeg.]</i> and cleaning up the ground, the whole
                    camp looked like a carpentershop , and we are now all very comfortable fixed. I wish you could see<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br><i>[illeg.]</i> headquarters, they went home about <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    clock, their road led them past our headquarters and they halted and played us a
                    tune. they had a fiddle, tamperene, bones, and dry
                    oncle. I expect we will go on picket again next thursday morning. I have not
                    much other news to tell you. eveything is quiet <i>[illeg.]</i> think our army
                    will move from here before spring for it is impossible to move now now for the
                    roads down here are in very bad condition. it is raining every few days. it
                    commenced this morning again. Co. L. + M of our Reg. are still at frederick, Md.
                    yet but I believe our Col. has gone to Washington to get them down here. I am
                    promised to get a Furlough but I dondt know how soon it
                    will come; one of our men who is home on a Furlough now is expected back
                    tomorrow. I would be very happy<i>[illeg.]</i></p>
