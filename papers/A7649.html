<p class="p10">Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Perhaps</u> you would like to here
                    from me. I arrived here safely stopped on road &amp; lifted <u>Jno</u>. Riddles remains &amp; seen it on way to New
                    Market all right we succeeded in securing it without
                    the least trouble. I suppose it reached home last Sunday</p>
<p class="p10">In coming up here my eye got worse &amp; since I have been I have scarcely
                    been out of a dark room. I have two doctors working with me and today I feel
                    something like improvement I have got the painters at work painting &amp;
                    papering doing all I can in that way but have not been able to get out to see
                    after out door<sup>s</sup> business. I will try &amp; get home
                    next week if I even have to return here soon again &amp; finish my<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> matters up. I suppose the <i>[unclear: Sheriff]</i> has not been after me
                    since I left as I have not heard from you</p>
<p class="p10">Write me &amp; let me know how all things are going</p>
<p class="p10">Tell Fred- if any thing goes wrong in our department (stable department)
                        <i>[unclear: to]</i> write me the boys here are well &amp; all ask
                    about him</p>
<p class="p10">I cant tell yet how I will succeed in money matters here
                    but it is a <i>[illeg.]</i> scarce here</p>
<p class="p10">Remind George of the plowing at the Mill when dry enough</p>
<p class="p10">&amp; <i>[unclear: hauling]</i> out the manure in stable yard at home
                    &amp; not to work the horses too hard but to try &amp; get them well up
                    for spring</p>
<p class="p10">If you have any oppertunity any time when Lowry
                    moves</p>
<p class="p10">Have you sent the wedges up yet</p>
<p class="p10">Tell George to see Painter &amp; Young<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> and to have all the plows
                    handy single &amp; double teams &amp;c ready to move as we will not
                    delay when the place is vacated but he will not move until I come home but if he
                    thinks necessary return to up &amp; direct but the <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> place <i>[unclear: careful]</i> to <i>[illeg.]</i> to <i>[deleted: ]</i></p>
<p class="p10">I have not yet succeeded yet in hearing of a <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> if I can find one &amp; will try &amp; bring her along</p>
<p class="p10">I am writing with one eye &amp; it is hard getting along</p>
<p class="p10">When you write let me know how Staub is getting along</p>
