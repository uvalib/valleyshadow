<h4>Franklin County: Franklin Rosenbery to John Abraham
                    Rosenbery (father), December 25, 1863<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>As in earlier letters, Rosenbery writes that he does the will of God. He also
                    hopes for peace, and he wishes that northerners would further devote themselves
                    to the nation's cause. He then goes onto discuss religion as well as the value
                    of tobacco in the soldiers' camp. Finally, he discusses Christmas dinner, the
                    weather, the possibility of a furlough, his prospects for survival, the war's
                    duration, and correspondence.</p>

                    John Rosenbery
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">December 25, 1863</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">I am doing the will of God by Crying Freedom: Freedom. As much as if I was at
                    home crying repentance.</p>
<p class="p10">Oh, that all the people of the north would be as active in the engagement of This
                    Cause as they are in tryingto get exemited. I am
                    persuaded that this rebelion would soon be crushed.
                    And peace, freedom and liberty again prevail in our land.</p>
<p class="p10">I have Rec.d 3 letters from you since I left home.
                    I have written over a dozen letters to you.</p>
<p class="p10">I have Rec.d 3 letters from Rachel since I left
                    home. I have written about as many to her as I did to you.</p>
<p class="p10">I write as often to you as I can. Oftimes I have not
                    the privilege to write.</p>
<p class="p10">I would be glad if Brother John would try and write some to me as he has a better
                    chance to write than I have.</p>
<p class="p10">I re.d. that tabaco that
                    you sent to me. I sold it nearly all for 25
                        <i>[deleted: c]</i>
                    ; per plug but now we have a settler here that spoils the sale of tobaco. I can buy it here for a 1 dollar a pound.</p>
<p class="p10">While I think of it you may get a good key for my watch when you send it to me.
                    If Rineman's has not got it fixed yet. Get it fixed by some person else and
                        sende it as soon as you can. As I need it bad.</p>
<p class="p10">Keep account of what you lay out for me and for the family and I will try and
                    repay you.</p>
<p class="p10">It may be that we will get home soon and it may be we will not get home for 3
                    years and it may be we will never get home.</p>
<p class="p10">I am satisfied here as long as I fee that I am doing the
                    Will of God. I have family worship in our tent. I have prayer meeting in my tent
                    and when the wether is fit on Sunday we have
                    preaching. And on Thursday Evening we have prayer meetings.</p>
<p class="p10">So if the Army is a hard place and a Soldiers Life
                    is a hard life. There is none that need be lost. If they are lost it is their
                    own fault. It is not God's for in His Word He saith as I live saith The Lord, I
                    have no pleasure in the death of the wicked. But rather all would be born and
                    live. Turn, ye, Turn, ye, for why will ye die?</p>
<p class="p10">This is Christmast. Now, I must tell what I had for
                    dinner. I had some soup beans boiled with beef and some pork and some of Aunt
                    Sally Lincoln's buisquits-all boiled together. I
                    call the hard tack Aunt Sally Lincoln's buisquits.</p>
<p class="p10">The wether is very cold. It has been cloudy nearly all
                    day with the appearance of snow. I think that it will snow before morning.</p>
<p class="p10">I have a medling comfortable place to stay in but
                    people at home would not think so.</p>
<p class="p10">If I hear where A. Rosenbery and Ashway is I will go
                    and see them if I can get a pass. As long as I am in Winter Quarters, I will
                    write to you as often as I can. Do not fret yourself about me and if you don't
                    get all the letters that I write do not think that I am forgetting you for I
                    will ever remember you as a Father as long as I live.</p>
<p class="p10">You will soon hear from me if I live and the letters go safe.</p>
<p class="p10">No more at present. Give my best respts. to all
                        Enquiring friends.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
<p class="p10">Farewell for the present. To his
                            father, John Rosenbery
                    </p>
