<p class="p10">Dear Charlie</p>
<p class="p10">I rec'd yours of the 18<sup>th</sup>
     <i>[unclear: inst]</i> yesterday. I am sorry to tell you that your Brother John is no more. He
     was killed in the battle at Winchester, shot in the head I think, though I am not certain for I
     did not see him, though I was told by some one who professed to know, he lived but a very short
     time after he was struck. I would of written to you immediately but I
     did not have time, I wrote home, and told my wife to tell Mary to write to you about and let
     you know the worst, I have but little good news to tell you, we had another hard fight on the
     19th <i>[unclear: inst]</i>
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> were victorious until about three o'clock, the Yanks flanked us and we had to fall
     back which raised a perfect stampeed, we captured wagons, ambulences, mules, horses, eighteen pieces of artillery &amp;
     about 1500 prisoners. Though fortune turned &amp; we lost all the artillery that we
     captured &amp; I believe as much more, lost ambulance, wagons, &amp; I don't know what
     all we did not losses, though we got the prisoners out by hard work &amp; had it not been
     that they were in front of the train we would of gotten more of it out of the way. We lost but
     very few prisoners &amp; an unusual small number of killed &amp; wounded. Though Co. H lost - I think, its full share of in killed we took 11 men with
     myself <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> into the fight out of that number there were two killed &amp; one
     wounded. Sergt B.F. Hupp &amp; W.H. McClung were killed or I
     suppose McClung is dead my this time for he was shot in the head just above the right eye, the
     ball is in his head, he was <i>[unclear: insencible]</i> in fifteen minutes afterward that was
     about 9 O'clock in the morning, he was not dead at sundown but still insencible, &amp;
     seemed to be dieing, Jacob Runkle was wounded in the right shoulder
     slightly Col Williams was wounded in the right shoulder severely,
      Col
     <i>[unclear: Runk]</i> was left at Winchester supposed to be mortally wounded in the side, Dr.
     Walls pronounced it mortal, Maj Newton wounded in ankle, &amp;
     it is feared that he will lose his foot.</p>
<p class="p10">I must close as it is getting late, I would like to give you a more detailed account of our
     doings in the Vallie, but I have not got the time. I have not rec'd a letter from home for almost a month have only got two letters
     from home since I left there</p>
<p class="p10">We have only got one Maj &amp; one Col, Stuart Maj 2d Regt
     Col
     <i>[unclear: Spungler]</i> of the 33d Regt</p>
<p class="p10">I must Close, may God protect you is the humble prayer of</p>
<p class="p10">Your Friend</p>
