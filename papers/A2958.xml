                <p>I have not received a line from you yet but concluded I would not wait any longer
                    this is a beautiful Sabbath morn &amp; I wish you were here to go to church
                    with me Annie Mollie Jake &amp; George have gone &amp; I thought I would
                    stay at home &amp; write to the dear one that is far a way. I expect to go
                    to <orig reg="prayer">prayr</orig> meeting this evening Oh how I wish you were
                    here <add hand="h1" place="inline">to go with me</add> for I feel some what
                        <orig reg="lonely">lonly</orig> have not had time to have the blues much but
                    am anxiously looking for-ward for Saturday to <orig reg="arrive">arive</orig>
                    &amp; to bring my dear one with it the time will not appear long for I will
                    be so busy that I will <orig reg="hardly">harly</orig> have time to think but do
                    not disappoint me for you know Willie I will be very uneasy if you <orig
                        reg="don't">dont</orig> come think it very strange that I have not got a
                    letter yet have sent twice to the office but hope I will soon hear from you I
                    expect you have forgotten Kate as she is so selfish I reckon I had better look
                    for a sweetheart this eve perhaps I could find one that would <orig reg="take"
                        >thake</orig> your place Well Willie dear this is the first time I have had
                    a pen in my hand <orig reg="since">sense</orig> you left me I am getting <orig
                        reg="careless">carlous</orig> would have written to <orig reg="cousin"
                    >cous</orig> Mollie C but have forgotten her address so I cannot write <orig
                        reg="until">untill</orig> I see you will write to <orig reg="cousin"
                    >cous</orig> Joe this week &amp; Dottie I have been too busy to write to
                    them we are all very well I have had a slight cold but feel very well now hope
                    this will find you well &amp; happy &amp; in fine spirits &amp;
                    above all striving to do the will of our dear Mother remember thy dear Kate at
                    the <pb n="2"/>throne of grace &amp; pray that I may over come the selfish
                    feeling that rise in my bosom for you &amp; that we may both draw nearer to
                    each other by the strong ties of holy love it makes me very sad some time when I
                    think I have caused thy dear bosom to heave a sigh for my selfishness but it is
                    my nature &amp; hope you will love me dearer for it after <orig reg="awhile"
                        >while</orig> but you will say how can I love you dearer I do not know that
                    you can but that it will make you happy to think that you have it in in your
                    power to wound &amp; to heal Willie you think me very childish I acknowledge
                    I am but can not help it my love is so strong that it makes me thus do not let
                    it <orig reg="grieve">greave</orig> you I hope by the grace of God to over come
                    it &amp; make you very happy it is my <orig reg="desire">disire</orig> to
                    make you happy &amp; I believe I can but enough of this. I have no news to
                    write the boys are not done cutting up <orig reg="their">there</orig> corn yet
                    the rain prevented them yesterday we had a hail storm Friday evening it did no
                    damage here, in the neighborhood of cousin John Crist it broke out most all of
                    the window <orig reg="panes">pains</orig> &amp; cut the parlor so it will
                        <orig reg="hardly">harley</orig> be worth saving it has made quite a change
                    in the weather I expect it will get cold before we want to see cold weather I
                    wish we could get <orig reg="married">maried</orig> before it gets cold I am
                    anxious to be with you; I suppose you were teased enough about having me in
                    Augusta but I think it was for the best but I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig> stay
                    much longer I hope it will save you the trip over the mountain I <orig
