<p class="p10">My Dear David</p>
<p class="p10">I have both of your dear letters. The one by Hamie I answered Wednesday but did
                    not get to send it. Thursday Hamie went to the half Station Early some time
                    before the cars came but he could not get to see the mail Agent as the cars did
                    not stop that morning at the Hotel. one of the workman held out his hand for the
                    letter as the one I sent before was so long reaching you Hamie would not give it
                    to him. I knew you would be very much disappointed my love but you were not <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> more so then I was by not getting my letter
                    off. I love to write to you &amp; when you do not get letters from me now it
                    is because I can't get to send them that is the only reason in the world my
                    love. I am so glad you are coming up to morrow if
                    you live. Ma was not angry when she came home. she did not blame you but was
                    glad to be at home again I told her why I wanted Hamie to go with you &amp;
                    she said it was right. You must not mind any thing
                    Ada tells you for I sometimes think she don't know herself what she says. I do
                    wish she would be more considerate &amp; have some regard for your feelings.
                    I don't <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> know what to think of her You must not be troubled at any thing she may say to you. The Magazine &amp;
                    the Ledgers came safely &amp; I thank you My love for those tokens of your
                    thoughtful kindness for me when absent. I do appreciate any favor, or gift in
                    the world from you, if it was only a fragment I would love &amp; keep it
                    because you gave it to me. Have you ever been in the Mountains when the snow was
                    falling thick &amp; fast, so that you could not see any distance before you,
                    covering the Mountains in a shroud of white. imagine how it is with us this
                    Morning at the Palace. I am here by a bright warm fire surrounded without by
                    Mountains <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> &amp; snow. I am here but my thoughts are with you the
                    one dearer to me then all on Earth. I wish I could see
                    you to day if you were here I should be very happy. but
                    that cannot be just yet. I have the cheering &amp; blessed hope of being
                    with you soon my love Tell Magnus we are looking for him tomorrow with you but I
                    expect he will come on the cars. You must not think me selfish for wanting you
                    to come every week. I love you &amp; feel as if I can't be satisfied if I do
                    not see your dear face every week the time seems so long to me when you are away
                    my love. I know you have to travel a lonely road by your
                        self in the night it does trouble me to think of you coming alone
                    &amp; I do wish you could come earlier in the day or have company I am
                    always thinking of your safety &amp; comfort. I love you with all the
                    devotion of my heart &amp; soul &amp; ever shall. you are all the world
                    to me. my only happiness depends upon you. you have all my affection of heart
                    soul &amp; mind. come if you live tomorrow my heart says come &amp; do
                    not disappoint me. May God bless you &amp; let you come. My love to one who
                    loves only you. All send love. I send a loving kiss. Come.</p>
