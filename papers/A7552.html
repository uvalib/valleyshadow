<p class="p10">My Dear David</p>
<p class="p10">Ella is writing to her Magnus &amp; I will now keep her company by writing to
                    you in reply to your dear &amp; welcome letter of Tuesday. I was glad to
                    hear of your good health, glad to have the pleasure of reading one of your
                    loving, &amp; dear letters again I regretted so much after Magnus came that
                    you did not stay all week I wanted you to stay but you would not. Oh! how much
                    &amp; how long I did miss your dear presence All the world seemed lonely
                    &amp; dark to me after you were gone<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I thought if you could only
                    come back &amp; stay just a few days longer I would be so glad to have you
                    with me once more, but my earnest wishes were not satisfied for you are still
                    away from the one who loves you above all others. I know it cannot now be
                    helped. Ella has been enjoying her visit home very much, riding eating,
                    visiting, &amp; entertaining visitors. she &amp; myself were at Mrs.
                    Cupp's yesterday at a dining party given to Ella we spent the day very pleasently I wished for you so often for had you
                    been with me I should have been happy. Cap't. Riley
                    his wife, Mrs. Dr. Harris a Mr. Arbergas &amp; several others<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>were
                    of the party. had a fine dinner, &amp; music on the piano in the Evening Mr.
                    Arbergas sang some of his sentimental songs which were fashionable before I ever
                    lived. Therefore to me, &amp; other young members present, they were new,
                    but my thoughts were of you, &amp; with you only while listening to the
                    music &amp; all day I thought of my absent Love. We have had company every
                    day since Ella came. Tell Magnus he should have seen his wife on horseback the
                    other Evening she looked elegant, &amp; caught a beau who admired her
                    graceful carriage on horseback very much. Ma rec'd
                    a letter<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>from Rennie &amp; David to day
                    They are coming up Saturday if they live. When you wrote me-- Tuesday did you
                    think it was Friday? for you said "you &amp; Magnus were coming down the
                    next day." Ella, &amp; I looked for you. Are you coming Saturday I do wish
                    you would for I am so anxious to see your dear, dear face. Ella will not go home
                    before Monday Then pa will leave for Baltimore. Ada I expect will go with him as
                    far as Gordonsville to visit a cousin, Mrs. Gordon Beale Macon has been having a
                    grand time with his dear grandpa, &amp; Aunts. walked alone last night for
                    the first time in his baby life If Rennie were here now we should feel almost
                    like the happy, &amp; united family that we were in the days which are gone
                    forever. Alas! for lifes changes! we can never, never
                    again be an unbroken home circle in this world. We have been happy with dear
                    Ella &amp; her two </p>
