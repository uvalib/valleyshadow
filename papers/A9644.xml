                <p>I seat my self once more for the purpose of <orig reg="penning">pening</orig> you
                    a <orig reg="few">fiew</orig> lines. I arrived safely in camp on the 21 and have
                    been <orig reg="improving">improveing</orig> in health ever since. We have a
                    very nice camp and the water is very good. Our <abbr expan="Company">Comp</abbr>
                    numbers sixty odd at <orig reg="present">presant</orig>; more than we have had
                        <orig reg="present">presant</orig> for some time past. I hope providence may
                    smile on our armies and bless us with health. I found Brother John looking <orig
                        reg="badly">badley</orig> again. I was fearful he was taking the fever but
                    think he is somewhat better today. Charles has returned to the camp at last he
                    was <pb n="2"/> to see grand ma. he says he had a <orig reg="great">grate</orig>
                    deal of pleasure. I tried to shame him for treat<add hand="h1" place="inline"
                        >ing</add> us all so <orig reg="badly">badley</orig> by not writing. he
                    wrote home to day for the first time for the last six months I believe; We have
                    to drill <orig reg="twice">twise</orig> a day. Mr. <abbr expan="Robert"
                    >Robt</abbr> Taylor <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> his discharge to day
                    being over thirty five years of age. he has been a good soldier and I am glad to
                    see him get <orig reg="off">of</orig>
                    <orig reg="honorably">honerably</orig>.</p>

                <p>Our <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr> has a Chaplain at last he is a Baptist
                        <orig reg="there">thare</orig> was prayer meeting last night &amp; night
                    before. I hope &amp; pray that his teachings may be a benefit to the <abbr

                    unto the true &amp; living God. Our Chaplains name is Wa<del hand="h1"

                <p>Well Kate I had a <orig reg="wonderful">wanderfull</orig> time <orig
                        reg="Saturday">Sadurday</orig> night of the <unclear>19</unclear> hunting

                        place="inline">the</add> dogs. We arrested Frank Taylor &amp; brought
                    him as far as Peter Hights; and left him in the charge of Isaac Vines &amp;
                    George Hight <orig reg="until">untill</orig> I could go home &amp; return.
                    About sun up he asked permission to go down to Mr Faubers, a half miles distant.
                    Hight granted his request &amp; Vines went with him. He had not been <orig
                        reg="there">thare</orig> long before he told Ike he wanted to go in <orig
                        reg="another">annother</orig> room to see Mr Fauber who was sick Ike thought
                    all was right &amp; let him go alone &amp; then he made his escape. Ike
                    after looking around for him returned <orig reg="alone">aloan</orig>. I had been
                    waiting nearly an hour. We all <orig reg="laughed">laughfed</orig> at Ike and
                    told him he was a bad sentinel.</p>

                <pb n="4"/>

                <p>Well Kate I came away &amp; forgot my <orig reg="presents">presants</orig>
                    but I hope and pray the day may not be very far distant when I may return
                    &amp; <orig reg="receive">recieve</orig> from thee a richer &amp; nobler

                        >evry</orig> thing would be dark &amp; dreary. I would rise up in the

                    having any one to whisper the breathings of a pure and <orig reg="humble"

                    that you may be <orig reg="blessed">blest</orig> with all the mercies of our
