<p class="p10">Camp</p>
<p class="p10">My Deary:</p>
<p class="p10">Your sweet little note came to me in good time -- it was kind in you to write before you
     heard from me -- though you had to chide me "the least bit in the world" for not writing -- but
     mine has come to you before this and you understand my doings &amp; goings -- I reckon Mr.
     Walker gave you my blank envelope with money &amp; stamps. Sandy Garber is going to
     Staunton today so I will write a few lines by him &amp; enclose five dollars more &amp;
     so keep doing. -- We had a very hard snow storm Sunday last, the snow was over a foot deep
     &amp; now it is raining hard. The roads are getting desperate. The Yankees are still on the
     other side, the fired salute of 34 guns in "mockery" of the memory of
     Washington on Sunday morning last. I was amused by Nelly's comparisons -- very good --
     &amp; we had quite a laugh over them. -- I am glad she is inclined to be humorous, it will
     relieve the tedium of your loneliness. Enquire of Mr. Dankle why he did not send 4
      <i>[unclear: bbls]</i>, or if the 20 bush of wheat only made 3
     -- I have written to Nelson about the pigs &amp;c All is quiet here. I am very well indeed.
     Garber <u>goes</u> &amp; I must <u>close</u>. Write
     soon -- &amp; I will write more God bless you all -- </p>
<p class="p10">Your aff. husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
