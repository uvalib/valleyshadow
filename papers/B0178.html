<p class="p10">Dear Sir-</p>
<p class="p10">I am requested to write to you by <u>Robinson</u>
                    <u>Jackson</u>, in regard to his daughter, concerning whom I
                    addressed you some weeks since. His daughter is named <u>Easter</u>
                    <u>Jackson</u>, and resides, as you informed me, with a <u>Mr. Kelloe</u>, a few miles from Staunton. He wishes you
                    to have her delivered to your office as soon as possible, as he has made
                    arrangements with the bearer of this - a train hand on the Va Central Railroad, for her, transportation to
                    Richmond, the bearer having kindly consented to bring her at a small cost to
                    said Jackson, who is a very poor man, and is not able to pay full fare for her.
                    He is under the impression that she would be of great service to himself and
                    wife in enabling them to maintain a livelihood. <u>Jackson</u> is a very worthy colored man, and I would be obliged if you would
                    do all you can for him in this matter.</p>
