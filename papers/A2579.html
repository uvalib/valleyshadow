<p class="p10">My Dear Brother:-</p>
<p class="p10">We have just gotten back from a 7 days trip towards the enemy. We
     went to their very presence but the result was a failure and the exposure used up a good many,
     myself among the rest. I came back completely exhausted and have been lying on my back for two
     days. Added to my previous state of weakness I tell you I felt badly, and all alone as I was
     yesterday, twenty times did I cry like a child at the thoughts of home and the thousand
     attentions I should have. Oh brother I never want to spend such a weary day again. I can get
     nothing that I can eat, and so my strength will not increase here, but, thank the Lord I start
     for home this evening or early tomorrow morning. Dr. B. is getting things ready now, and shall
     be three of four days getting to Green Bank to Mr. Franklin Arbogasts and want to stay there a day or two to rest, and if you
     could send there after me I shall be very, very glad, -- though I know you are busy, for I
     cannot think of jolting in the stage as my bones and flesh are now. Mr. Arbogast's is 12 miles
     from John Yeager's on the top of the Alleghany, which is 17 miles from Monterey, so it would be
     two days drive. Start the 24th or 25th. The two horse wagon would be
     best, but do as you think best. How I long to see every one on the place, white and black. Give
     my love to all. I have much to tell you but cannot write more. </p>
<p class="p10">As ever your brother,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed.</i></p>
