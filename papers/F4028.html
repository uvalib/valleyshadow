<p class="p10">Dear Col</p>
<p class="p10">From the best information I can gather on the subject, I am induced to fear that
                    the nomination of Middlesworth would be an unfortunate selection, and I will say
                    to you in all sincerity that the nomination of Gen
                    Bell would be unfortunate for us in this county. I will be at the conference
                    myself, and if an arrangement can be affected, I will use my best andeavors quietly to get to Mifflin men to refuse to
                    nominate either, and when I think I can with propriety, I shall go in heart and
                    soul for your nomination, I do not mean to flatter you when I say that your
                    nomination would be the best one for our county that can be made; and if
                    Middlesworth's nomination will bring an organized opposition into existence frm
                    the Whig party, it should be given to him, I am <i>[unclear: promised]</i> that
                    there would be no disorganization against you, and I think you had better
                    conclude to accept it if circumstances should arise to give it to you. You had
                    better come on as a conferee, for if you don't <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>an arrangement will be
                    charged upon us and Middlesworths friends would be
                    <i>[unclear: disatisfied]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">I will not be a candidate for <i>[unclear: A]</i>, and will therefore be <i>[deleted: ]</i> as a conferee. I will explain the matter to you when I see you.
                    We can do better here by nominating another man.</p>
<p class="p10">Let me hear frm you on this subject, and rest assured that I will heartily
                    cooperate with you on anything that will aid in the consumation of my
                    proposition.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AK McClure</i></p>
