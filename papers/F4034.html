<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dr Col-</p>
<p class="p10">Old <i>[illeg.]</i> is after me hard - he has thrown several members from me in
                        Phila
                    <i>[unclear: Sainesce]</i> (Dauphin) Carey, <i>[unclear: Bugner]</i> are in
                    his interest. I have his tracks, and to day wrote him very frankly, that if his
                    personal interests were to be flung into the contest for Speaker I meant to
                    understand the case fully. I will soon have him understand that in such a fight
                    he may <u>possibly</u> throw me, but that I will <u>certainly</u> fling him.</p>
<p class="p10">I understand him; He <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>will fight as long as there is a fair prospect of
                    defeating me, when hope fades, he will fawn around all of us. If it only once
                    becomes understood that <u>he</u> has a candidate for Speaker
                    to advance his Presidential aspirations. I can safely pledge you that <u>that</u> candidate can't be nominated.</p>
<p class="p10">Among them they have flattered Patterson until he scarcely knows whether he is
                    for me or not. Can he control Wagonseller?</p>
<p class="p10">My letter to day written to him will wake him up: It is
                    respectful and conciliatory but its determined to <i>[unclear: no]</i> he will
                        <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>fully comprehend. When I hear from him I will write you.</p>
<p class="p10">I don't fear him. He may throw a few weak men into <i>[unclear: ]</i>: but before the
                    session convenes he will be better understood, and even weak men will see him
                    for they are to be used &amp; cheated.</p>
<p class="p10">Excepting to yourself <i>[unclear: B-ger]</i> &amp; a few others, I have
                    been non-committal on the Treasurer question. If circumstances can <i>[unclear: ]</i> to
                    done me from my well settled choice, and I shall <i>[unclear: informing]</i>
                    before to give pledges to outsiders. When my hand are loose I shall then be free
                    to sustain you efficiently.</p>
<p class="p10">I have a letter from <i>[unclear: Nymuller]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>volunteering to for me, and asking me to go for you and to take care
                    of him. Doubting whether he is a safe man, I told him I would not pledge myself
                    for Treasurer, but offered him to you, stating that my position was perfectly
                    satisfactory to yourself.</p>
<p class="p10">Had a letter from Frick of Pottsville, Much indebted to
                    you, I will write to the members.</p>
<p class="p10">Write me at any time any thing
                    <i>[unclear: ]</i> turns up.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly</p>
