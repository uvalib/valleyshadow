    <p>I do not like to write this evening, but as those tents are to go in the morning I will not
     have time. We have all been at Church <orig reg="today">to day</orig>. Would that you could

     your letter of the 31<hi rend="super">st</hi> this morning Just when we were <orig reg="ready"
      >reddy</orig> to go to Church we were very glad to hear from you. We thought if you had left
     Harpers Ferry we would not hear from you for some time I am very Sorry to hear that the measles
     are in Camp As it is A very dangerous disorder to be exposed in. I want you to use every
     precaution and be as careful of yourself as the circumstances in which you are placed will
     admit of. Some of the <orig reg="Ladies">Ladyes</orig> are making Soldiers <orig reg="Cloaks"
      >Cloakes</orig> out of their Piano covers; I have none But will send you one of my Oil cloth
     table covers; which I want you to Spread down when you have to make your bed on the ground it
     will keep the dampness from you I want you also to wear it Around you when you have to stand
     guard when it is raining</p>

     send you some money. I will send you a Round of Beef and would like to send you some cakes; but
     think they will be old and dry before you could get them. I will send you two Staunton papers
     you will find a piece in each marked which I <orig reg="want">waunt</orig> you to read. I will
     put the things in a coarse pocke which you can use for dish-cloths if you need them. And now my
     Dear Son in <orig reg="closing">closeing</orig> I will Admonish you once more to observe Gods
     Sabbath and all his commandments as strictly as you possibly can in the circumstances in which
     you are placed. There are many precious promises in his Holy Word to those who do.</p>
