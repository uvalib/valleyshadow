<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Nov 29 <sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Rosebanks</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cousin</p>
<p class="p10">On monday last, I had a conversation with Col David S. Bell from which I learned that it was
                    his wish, &amp; also that of Dr Alexander,
                    &amp; I believe, of the other heirs of M<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Cue, as far as their sentiments were known, that the
                    whole property, real &amp; personal, should be sold, with a
                    <i>[unclear: mind]</i> to the distribution of the proceeds. This has always
                    been my opinion, &amp; your uncle Isaac fully concurs in it.</p>
<p class="p10">I know that your regard for the wishes of M<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Cue, induces you to entertain a different view, but I
                    think you are sacrificing too much to this idea. If you desire to maintain
                    perfect harmony with all the family, this is the true plan, &amp; I am
                    persuaded, that your pecuniary interests &amp; comfort, will be greatly
                    promoted by it. If you return your dower in the land, the buildings will
                    necessarily be valued at a large sum, &amp; you will thus be substantially
                    paying a very heavy rent, for a house much too costly for your purposes. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> The remainder of the farm will necessarily have to be sold. probably
                    in two trusts, &amp; as there are no good buildings on them, the price may
                    be affected thereby</p>
<p class="p10">Moreover, if you retain the old homestead, (which in my opinion from its
                    inaccessibility is a very undesireable home) you will entail on yourself an
                    expense, which it is difficult to estimate, &amp; you will necessarily
                    become so much entangled with the affairs of other members of the family, as to
                    render collisions of interest, &amp; alienation of feeling almost
                    inevitable. By selling the property, you would probably have $15.000 at least,
                    in your own absolute right, &amp; each of your children, <i>[deleted: eight]</i>$8000 or more, - probably $10.000 - With this large amount, you
                    could buy a comfortable home, &amp; give your children complete education.
                    By holding on to the homestead, you cannot do this, &amp; you would be
                    harrassed by a thousand cares &amp; anxieties, &amp; have little left at
                    the end of the year.</p>
<p class="p10">On Monday, I had, (with the concurrance of Col Bell)
                    John Brooks, Wm M. Tate &amp; Wm A. Bell appointed Com<sup>rs</sup>, to lay off your dower in the land
                    &amp; slaves, if you should adhere to the opinion that that was the best
                    course. If, on the other hand, you should think it best to pursue the other
                    course, this appointment will be null.</p>
<p class="p10">Col
                    B. wishes some arrangement made by the close of the
                    year, &amp; it will be necessary for you to make up your mind, as to the
                    course you will prefer.</p>
<p class="p10">If a sale be deemed advisable, a bill can be filed, &amp; the answers of the
                    adult heirs put in, &amp; submitted to the Judge. He will have no power to
                    decree a Sale in vacation, but he will doubtless, advise such course as will
                    ensure his ratification of the sale <i>[unclear: 
                        <i>[added: ?]</i>
                    ]</i> when brought before him. The Sale can be made in January, subject to
                    the approval of the court, &amp; it can be affirmed in june</p>
<p class="p10">Yours affectionately</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        Alex H. H. Stuart
                    </i></p>
