<h4>Augusta County: Jedediah Hotchkiss to John H. McCue,
                    July 14, 1859<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jedediah Hotchkiss informs John H. McCue that Hotchkiss has used McCue as a
                    reference. Hotchkiss includes a flyer about the "Loch Willow School" in Augusta
                    County, of which he is Principal. He asks McCue to refer anyone whose sons need
                    an education to his school.</p>

<p class="p10">July 14<sup>th</sup> 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Churchville, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear M<sup>c</sup>Cue</p>
<p class="p10">I have taken the liberty of making you one of my references. I hope you will
                    heartily concur in it, and give us your influence. I have sent some one or two
                        <i>[added: circulars]</i> to gentlemen in your
                    neighborhood, and I enclose two which you will please give to any one that has sons to educate.</p>
<p class="p10">I hear that you are getting along well in Lovingston, and I am heartily glad of
                    it, for you deserve to do well. We are having very warm weather here just now,
                    and very dry. The Major is dealing quite largely in cattle, but is not doing
                    very well with them, I am sorry for he is a good fellow, and needs to do well</p>
<p class="p10">If you come over to the Valley you must call and see us. I got an injunction in
                    my Brodt suit, and a new trial.</p>
<p class="p10">Could you send us one of your sons?</p>
<p class="p10">My kind regards to your lady--</p>
<p class="p10">Truly your friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
