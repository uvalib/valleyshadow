<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">We have been much interested the past month in <i>[illeg.]</i> <i>[unclear: wished]</i>find out if there were any who did not attend my school.</p>
<p class="p10">The people were much pleased to see us--One of my scholars, a little girl, was standing upon a hill near her house--We saw her before she saw us but as we drew near her she recognized us and we soon knew she did--She stood a minute looking at us--Then threw up her hands and shouted a welcome turned and ran off as fast as she could to tell her mother who were coming--Arriving at the house we found it to be one of the neatest we had seen among the<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> colored people--The Mother a most interesting colored person both in manner, and appearance so much like white that if she were seen north her color and skin would never be suspected.</p>
<p class="p10">We made a visit to the home of a girl we had <i>[illeg.]</i> from school--asking her why she had not been there she explained she had to keep her house for her father while her mother who is hired out was from home--She told us almost in tears she could not come to day school and her father would not allow her to attend night school--I have <i>[unclear: a]</i> five adult scholars which meet every afternoon at a neighbors house.  I asked her if she would like to meet with these and recite her lessons--She was much pleased with the plan and has not missed coming one day yet.</p>
<p class="p10">Next we visited four houses in three of which were children who did not attend any school upon asking the mother the reason were told they could not afford to pay the ten cents per week for tuition we <i>[illeg.]</i> them to send their children without pay--They thanked us--And the next week three of the children came.</p>
<p class="p10">In another house we found the mother sick in bed--One of her boys attends our day school--but not always regular--The mother asked if we had not wondered why- we said we had--She informed us he sometimes did work for the store keepers in order to obtain money with which to pay the ten cents per week tuition; for his father had never given him a cent towards it.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>S H Davison</i></p>
