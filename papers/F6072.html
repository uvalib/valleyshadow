<h4>Franklin County: William Hayman to George W. Brewer, January 16,
     1869<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>William Hayman writes a short note to George W. Brewer concerning proposals for
     redistricting. He concludes "I think that the Educational interests of the County would suffer
     as much by these procedures as the Country does by disunion."</p>

<p class="p10">G W Brewer Esq<br>Dear
     Sir</p>
<p class="p10">John R Smith Esq. who secured the signatures in the proposed New
      Dist. will present you with the petition. I had no time to attend
     to it myself. I did not think it necessary to get signatures from the Township at large as the
     objections against division are embodied in the one in your <i>[unclear: nosasation]</i>. We
     intend building a New School House in Toms- Town to supply the increasing demand of Scholars.
     And perhaps in another year we will need one again at Mt Alto Let Quincy contribute her

      the petitions of this Tp against the 2nd Dist by Mr Logue, although they all did not sign themselves, yet they gave their
      consent to have their names put down, with the exception of three, whose names their friends
      gave as being favorable, viz John Miller, Henry Small, &amp; Amos Mortin I procured the
      names on the Mammoth one myself. Although the Secessionists have changed their programme by making their Dist have a
      . I still think their object as objectionable because it would establish precedents
      for further divisons. Altodale &amp; Mont Alto being at one end of
       Tp might put in a claim for . So might Grove Hill,
      Pidgeon Hill Opossum Hill, Oak Hill &amp; Rock Hill seperated
      by a creek from the rest of the Tp. leaving Pine Field Blue Rock
      Tom Town, Polk &amp; the Mountain to sustain themselves in a Dist which they can not do, without great embarrassment. So
      the Court might have trouble in other parts of the County. Fayetteville might wish to seperate from Krune Orrstown from Southampton &amp;c. I think that the Educational interests of the County would
      suffer as much by these procedures as the Country does by disunion. I find in business, we
      should be very careful abt establishing precedents I suppose we
      have a right to pay expenses in this matter out of  funds<br><br> Yours truley<br><br>
