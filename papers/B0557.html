<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, February 3, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How's letter endorses Frederick Tukey's decision in the E.P. Walton case
                    (although said decision is not disclosed in this letter). He also asserts that
                    he needs a detachment of at least 30 men stationed in Staunton for that area of
                    the sub-district to be able to function properly.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b>
                    Col. O. Brown A.C.<br>Richmond, Va.
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Feby 3d 1866</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to forward herewith monthly reports of Bureau affairs as made by
                    the several Asst. Supts. and I
                    would respectfully ask your attention to the sufficiently explicit suggestions
                    of Mr. F. S. Tukey Asst. Supt.
                    Sub. dist. "B" in the case of E. P. Walton and
                    I endorse the proposed action since there is no force locally available for his
                    arrest, and no military prison in that sub.
                    dist. in which he could be confined for his contempt of authority, and
                    until he should comply with the decision of the Board of Agents.</p>
<p class="p10">It will be seen that no serious disturbances have taken place during the absence
                    of military force and it must also be evident that no apparent jurisdiction can
                    be exercised by the officers and agents of this Bureau when unsupported by the
                    presence and use of U.S. Forces. I have therefore again to request that a
                    detachment of troops numbering (30) thirty or more may be sent to Staunton with
                    a commissioned officer who may be empowered to station ten (10) of them at
                    Lexington, and to send small squads when requested through Augusta, Highland,
                    Bath, Alleghany and Rockbridge Counties. The other portions of the district will
                    soon contain <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> a force including Cavalry which will suffice for the
                    maintenance of Bureau Power at the most important points and with the officers
                    on duty and the Agents at their posts, will enable me to carry out instructions
                    and protect the Freedmen in all their conceded rights.</p>
