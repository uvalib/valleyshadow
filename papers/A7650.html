                    reports on his eye injury, the renovations going on at the hotel, the political
                    climate in Staunton, and purchase and sale of property. He also includes
                    instructions for building a garden fence.</p>

<p class="p10">Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote you a week ago &amp; have not head from you
                    since I left home <u>why is it</u> I want to know how things
                    are going. My eye got better &amp; now worse again &amp; not able to be
                    out. I learned yesterday that court meets Monday next 19<sup>
                        <u>th</u>
                    </sup> I dont see how I can possibly be there, As I am
                    unable to travel in the light &amp; air I wrote to M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> Pendleton &amp; Faulkner to continue all the Cases against me if
                    possible--doubtless the best thing that can be done is to put them off until
                    things get more settled when doubtless they will be dropped I requested M<sup>

                    come in this condition</p>
<p class="p10">I suppose George Kilmer has been plowing. if not he should be let the ground at
                    the mill be gotten ready to plant &amp; if Lowry has moved he had better
                    move up to farm &amp; go to work. if has not moved let him plow the field on
                    your land (The Stubblefeild)</p>
<p class="p10">Let him go to George Nipes shop &amp; get from John Oliver the two (2) three
                    horse <i>[unclear: basshears]</i> plows he has made for me, if not already got
                    You give him the money or get M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>

                    him get as many logs to mill &amp; as much lumber home as he can before he
                    moves. If dry enough to plow &amp; cant move to
                    Lowrys let him take one team up there the two whee<i>[added: ee]</i>l horses bay &amp; brown mares, &amp; fit up a team there
                    with the mule or lame horse &amp; put Johnson to plowing for corn or if
                    necessary he could start 2 plows &amp; board himself with Johnson until can
                    move</p>
<p class="p10">Tell him to go to M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> Riddles &amp; get six (6) pair of plow traces &amp; go to John R
                    Oneals &amp; get the plow band<sup>s</sup> he made for me (6)
                    &amp; get 2 or 3 new or old colars to fit up plow
                    teams. if he has no colars give him the money to pay
                    for them at Staylys Harrnes he can get at Riddles All
                    wood &amp; iron work he will get at Painters &amp; Youngs.</p>
<p class="p10">I have the painters &amp; paperess full at work here, but it is a large job
                    &amp; it goes slow. it will take full 2 months to get through with it. I am
                    trying to make some change here in the property whilst I am here. dont know yet what I can do. I went to see the farm
                    &amp; mill which was offered me 6 miles from here. it is good &amp;
                    desirable property for this country but price is too high $45,000<sup>
                        <u>00</u>
                    </sup> for 400 acres &amp; mill. It seems like being in a new world here. all

                    &amp; strife on political matters every body is getting along well. all meet
                    me cordially &amp; want me to move up here &amp; live. have been so
                    afflicted that I have not been able to attend much to my business matters Indeed
                    if it was not necessary for me to be at home soon in putting george to farming
                    &amp; fitting up garden fencing &amp; the fences &amp;c at mill I
                    would go to Some of the Springs now As the doctors advise me that Alum water
                    would be of much benefit to me I fear that unless I take great care of my eye I
                    will loose it Such frequent attacks make it quite dangerous</p>
<p class="p10">Tell the children to take care of things right.</p>
<p class="p10">If my lawyers think best for me to remain away to give good reason for continuing
                    my cases I will stay here a few days longer if not I will start for home on
                    monday next if I am able to travel &amp; reach home tuesday</p>
<p class="p10">Do try &amp; write me &amp; let me know how things are going on
                    &amp;c &amp;c-</p>
<p class="p10">If you want to make garden get H Myers to finish the fence I commenced. it runs
                    as draft on back of this letter The division fence between us &amp; Lashhorn
                    I dont think he can fix until I return &amp; it may
