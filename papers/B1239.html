<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Augusta Jordan asks for aid on behalf of Eveline Stuart, an African-American
                    woman living in Staunton. Her husband James, living in Ohio, is afraid to return
                    to Staunton because he served as a Union guide during the war, and wishes to
