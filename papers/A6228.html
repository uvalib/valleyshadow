<h4>Augusta County: E. J. Evans to David H. Evans,
                    August, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>E. Evans writes to David Evans in outrage over a perceived insult which he will
                    hold David accountable for. He goes so far as to threaten to come to Staunton
                    and "cowhide" David in the middle of Main Street.</p>
