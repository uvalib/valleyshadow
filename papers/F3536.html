<h4>Franklin County: Washington G. Nugent, Medical
                    Certification for D. D. Swift, [n. d.]<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Washington G. Nugent certifies to the illness of D. D. Swift. He further reveals
                    that Swift had been continuing caring for soldiers of the 91st Regiment despite
                    his chronic dysentery.</p>

<p class="p10">Camp of 126th Regt. P.V.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">D. D. Swift Asst. Surg. 126th Regt. P.V. having applied for a certificate on
                    which to ground his application for leave of absence I certify that I have
                    carefully examined this officer and find him incapable of attending to duty on
                    account of Chronic Dysentery. He has been suffering for many weeks with this
                    affliction and has really been unable to be about, but has thus far continued on
                    duty-owing to the peculiar exigencies of the service-having been placed in
                    charge of the sick of 91st Regt. P.V. which Regt. Has been for some time without
                    the regular medical attendant assigned it.</p>
<p class="p10">I unhesitatingly declare my belief that Mr. Swift is entirely unfit for duty-he
                    suffers <i>[illeg.]</i> from disease of the kidney. I further declare my belief
                    that he cannot continue in camp without endangering his life or producing
                    permanent disability. I therefore must respectfully urge that he be granted a
                    leave of absence for fifteen days as I do not believe that he will be able in a
                    less period to resume the duties of his office.</p>
