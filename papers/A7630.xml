                    located. Freddy seems much pleased and quite contented he makes himself quite at
                    home. all seem pleased with him. he rides out of evenings. I will try &amp;
                    improve him &amp; not spoil him. I find he will be of good service here to
                    me as messenger &amp;c &amp;c whilst I write tonight at 11 <orig
