<p class="p10">I take this opportunity to drop you a line to let you now how and
      wheare I am through the blessing of a cind
     providence I am in the enjoyment of tolerable health at this time hoping if this reaches you it
     may find you engoying the same blessing. I have not heard from you
     for some time oing to circumstances over witch
     wee have no controle though I hope it will not
     continue so long this note I expect to send by hand to <i>[illeg.]</i> do not now
     wether you will get it or not but I thought would try it thinking
     you would like to heare from heare I have heard
     from the nabourhood of Swoops since the raid, from what I can
     learn you have not suffered this time theogh I have not heard the
      peticulars<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">Well Giney Since last righting to you wee
     have left our oald camp moved more to the left of the line wee are now in the regular brestworks a little
     to the <i>[deleted: right]</i> left of Petersburg 8 or 10 miles from whare
     wee
     <i>[illeg.]</i> before it is about 2 miles from heare to Petersburg.
     this is a better country around heare than wheare
     wee
     ware  before but our quarters are not so good as they ware this is what they call living in the ground our Pickets are in talking distance
     with the Yanks some times they traid
     <i>[illeg.]</i> for Tobacco, they call us Joney rebs sometimes they
     say come over Joney and get some coffey
     wee can see all thire works and men can see the
     cars runing Well Giney I do not now how I
     may like the change but think it no worse it is likely wee may stay heare
     a while, rite to me whenever you can</p>
<p class="p10">So I close by remain yours <i>[illeg.]</i></p>
