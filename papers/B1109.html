<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, August 8, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How's first report as Bureau Superintendent in Staunton sheds light on the early
                    post-war situation of freed blacks. He writes that their new freedom seems
                    tenuous as their former masters threaten to reestablish slavery once Union
                    troops have left. How also notes that he has had trouble hiring military
                    personnel to staff the office, and so has hired civilians.</p>

<p class="p10">Aug 8<sup>th</sup> 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to report that because of the fact that I
                    <i>[unclear: intend]</i> upon my duties as Superintendent of this District
                    nearly at the end of the month of July, I am unable to make the Month Reports in
                    detail as ordered. The Sixth District extends over two hundred (200) miles in
                    length in a straight line upon the map, with incomplete and irregular
                    communication between the principal parts along that line until my
                        <i>[unclear: ----lty]</i> when a mail route was established between here
                    and Winchester. The only Railroad in operation extends partially across this
                    section of the District.</p>
<p class="p10">No Homes or Lands have as yet been acquired, and no funds received from any
                    source.</p>
<p class="p10">For lack of time in which to obtain the information, no reliable report can now
                    be made of the Condition of the Freedmen in this district. From limited and
                    superficial <i>[unclear: observation]</i> it would appear that they are
                    generally at work and willing to work, though not treated very kindly by their
                    former masters and others, who in the presence of the military practically
                    acknowledge their freedom while they tell the freedmen that they are not yet
                    free <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>as they will discover when the troops are withdrawn. Thus their
                    former masters are not favorable to the education of the freedmen, and are not
                    willing that they should settle on their lands at any rate. This conduct,
                    together with various misrepresentations of the "Yankees" which are habitually
                    made, tends to create distrust and a desire to emigrate, or to keep near the
                    villages where they feel more secure, and think they can get warning of any
                    changes in affairs.</p>
<p class="p10">The presence of military authority is, and for months will be indispensable for
                    the maintenance of the rights of the freedmen in this section of our country.
                    The troops in the District have been subject to frequent changes of location,
                    many altogether withdrawn, and <i>[unclear: some]</i> waiting distribution, so
                    that in the counties where they are not, time will be necessary for the
                    organization of the District. I have been unable to <i>[unclear: obtain]</i>
                    officers from this Command, because they are too few for the wants of the
                    military Sub-Districts, therefore I have sought to meet the necessities of the
                    Bureau by the employment of citizens three (3) of whom have been engaged for
                    salaries varying from 80.00 to 100.00 per month.</p>
