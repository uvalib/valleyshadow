<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Orlando Brown, December 31, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson's report mentions an inflamatory comment allegedly made by a local
                    magistrate, contrasts the sobriety of blacks around the Christmas holiday to
                    "the brawling and drunkeness of the common white men," and describes efforts to
                    procure aid for the poor.</p>

<p class="p10">Dec 31<sup>st</sup> 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with the requirements of C.
                    O.
                    No. 6 B.R.F.&amp;A.L.
                    S. 1866 I have the honor to submit the following
                    report of Bureau affairs in the 4th Div 9 Sub Dist.
                    Va.
                    comprizing the counties of Augusta and Highland.
                    This office is sought daily by freedmen to have me review settlements with their
                    employers for labor performed during 1867 or to ask me to press payment of
                    amounts acknowledged to be due. Wherever I find a freedman has kept an open
                    account and taken goods <i>[unclear: on order]</i> on the store in lieu of
                    money, his earnings are absorbed and I can do little for him. A practice has
                    been attempted in several cases which I refuse to allow <i>[unclear: any]</i>
                    charging the freedmen <sup>n</sup>/5 ¢
                    <i>[unclear: $1.00]</i> per day for every day he is absent even when he is
                    working at <i>[unclear: $10]</i>
                    p month which makes his daily wages only 33¢
                    per day. Employers <i>[unclear: urge]</i> this as proper but except <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I find the laborer has absented himself during harvest or lost too much time
                    showing clear neglect of his duty I refuse to allow it.</p>
<p class="p10">Assaults upon freedmen have been much less frequent during this than the past
                    month owing to pressing charges against some of the offenders though in cases
                    mentioned in my last report action has been taken by magistrates in the case of
                    Levi Middlebrook only. Five of his assailants did not appear. two were held to
                    bail in the sum of $75 each security for $75 to answer indictment at March
                    court. Abraham &amp; Evelyn Wallace have not taken out a warrant against
                        <i>[unclear: Ford]</i> and from what I see and learn of the neighbourhood where they reside I do not expect
                    they will. Indirectly I hear today Justice <i>[unclear: Huff]</i> refused to
                    grant a warrant against Coleman to Mary Minor (c)
                    saying "the d____d niggers ought all to be driven out of the county" I have sent
                    for Mary &amp; if the above language was used will see him in person and
                    report.</p>
<p class="p10">Christmas festivities and church revivals have overshadowed political excitement
                    and but little is said by freedmen about politics except frequent <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>enquiries about what the convention is doing.
                    They are however fully alive to the vital importance to them of the issues now
                    at stake and will I believe mostly cast their ballots at the coming election
                    unless the conservative organization "by tens" is allowed to control the voters
                    at the polls.</p>
<p class="p10">In connection with a revival in the M.E.
                    Church (col<sup>d</sup>) an effort is
                    being made to establish a Temperance organization with fair prospect of success.
                    The demeanor of the Freedmen and their abstinence from intoxicating drink on
                    Christmas day stood in flattering contrast to the brawling and drunkeness of the
                    common white men.</p>
<p class="p10">Early in the month I had some difficulty in procurring prompt relief for some
                    indigent, sick freedmen on the ground of doubtful settlement. I protested
                    against sick persons being neglected while the question of settlement was being
                    argued and had an interview with two of the magistrates when it was decided to
                    relieve the pauper where he was and collect the expense from the district to
                    which he or she belonged. Since there is no ground for complaint.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully submitted</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to be, General<br>Yr obt servt</p>
