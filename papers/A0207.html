<p class="p10">My dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10"><i>[unclear: Our]</i> widow Mrs <i>[unclear: Banuiis]</i> is growing impatient
                    about her government clearance, and comes to see me frequently. I hope you are
                    in a few days of getting it through- my <i>[unclear: recalls]</i> him is that
                    the only proof required was that of the surgens of
                    the command to which her husband belonged. Give it a push, Sen-</p>
<p class="p10">I observe that you are getting restored by congress to your lost estate. I
                    congratulate you. Mine has been on the way- <i>[unclear: but]</i> I apprehend
                    has been or will be stricken off, as I have opposition here in Mr Falk, and in
                    Richmond since radicals who dont like my legislative
                    causes, especially one with whom I have a difficulty, (Mr Attorney General
                        <i>[unclear: Bruvilles]</i>) <i>[unclear: who'll]</i> a long as Chairman
                    of the Committee's investigation a matter in which himself &amp; family were
                    rather unhandsomely implicated. I should like to get <i>[illeg.]</i> in I have
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> a start- and if you have a way to help me I would <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> like you to do so.- My name was with Lt.
                    <i>[unclear: Stuhlings]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> did is an amendment to the house bill first sent up by the
                    senate. I fear it is too late for this session.</p>
<p class="p10">I was glad to hear from you all through Ellan hope a better and brighter day is
                    coming to us.</p>
