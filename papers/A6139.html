<p class="p10">i seat my self to inform you that i am well at present and hoap that this may find you injoying the same
     blessing that god has bestowed upon me. i had a few days ago a pain in the small of my back
     that i could scarcely get up when i was down but i have got about well again. i have ent much news to rite of im
      portance but i will scrach  some down at a venture. the
     majority of the peopel down this way from what they can learn they
     say their is great prospect of peace and some say that their will be peace before the first day of may but for my part i dont
     think that peace will be so soon as that. if it oanly would prove to be
     so i should be verry glad. o i dont know how i
     should feal if peace would be so we all could go hoame and get shut of this ware but i still live in hoapes that i may return hoame and find you and all
     in good spirits and in health. dont
     for get to keep the stock out of the orchard this spring if you can.
     that will be the dependent for hay next sumer. the new ground field
     if kept up would make a rite smart hay too but it will be hard to keep
     the things out. the fence is bad. rite how the fead will hoald out thinks you and grain wehter the corn will keep the hogs. pick out your sead corn
      be fore it get too scarce. i starte a
     letter last sunday to you by mail. the weather is very prety
     heare now-has bin for severl days. try and get some person to help John to soaw the
     cloverseed that understand it so they can show him how to do it. a half a bushel will be enough
     on each feald if the timothy ant
     frosen out since i left hoame. </p>
