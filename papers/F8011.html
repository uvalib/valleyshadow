<p class="p10">June 28th</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg,</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Genl</p>
<p class="p10">It will be impossible for me to be in Phila
                    next week. I expect, however, to be in Harrisburg Monday next on professional
                    business. &amp; will hope to meet you</p>
<p class="p10">Do you mean that a complaint had been made against you when you say that you have
                    the deposition? If so, and Mr. Mann has any<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>agency
                    <i>[unclear: for]</i> it, he would with me forfeit all claims to recognition as
                    a gentleman. But I cannot think it possible, while bearing no consequences
                    personal to yourself in such a <i>[unclear: warfare]</i>, I would be greatly
                    mortified to find personal malignity thus directed against the only
                    Representative Penna has in the Senate who has
                    any fidelity to Penna interests, and at a time
                    too when of all other times we need one skillful man to<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>lead us <u>to</u> victory and afterward lead us in
                    <i>[unclear: honor]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10">The record you have <i>[unclear: given]</i> in the Senate for three years should
                    obliterate all political hostility to you in our ranks, I have so felt &amp;
                    acted and shall continue to do so.</p>
<p class="p10">If I can be of any service to you, in any way, I will make it suit to go to Phila with you; but if a future time will
                    answer, I would much prefer it.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours <i>[illeg.]</i></p>

                        <u>AKMcClure</u>
