<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: John Scott to R. M.
                    Manly, May 17, 1869<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Scott reports on the end of the school year in Staunton, and writes about the
                    unlikely prospects that the black community will be able to afford to construct
                    a school house due to lack of funds. Scott inquires about the prospect of
                    receiving government assistance.</p>

<p class="p10">May 17th 1869</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">We shall close school two or three days before the first of June, or soon enough
                    next week to permit the ladies to reach home before Saturday night.</p>
<p class="p10">Will send your Reports in time. Please see that vouchers for rent <i>[deleted: are sent]</i> in time.</p>
<p class="p10">The colored people are quite anxious now to erect a school house <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    your visit, but as they owe $1200 on their cemetery which they are trying to pay
                        <i>[deleted: for]</i>, and as the Spring finds them mostly destitute of
                    funds having used their surplus during the winter, I dont see as anything can be
                    done, at least <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>it does not appear to me expedient to attempt it until
                    Autumn, unless it is likely that the Govt. money
                    will be exhausted by that time so that no aid can be had from that source.</p>
<p class="p10">If that is likely to be the case and you have any means of making an estimate in
                    regard to it, plase give your opinion.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Scott</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. I think some of going to Hampton on my return home.
                        I want to see the Normal School. What day does the boat go to Fortress
                        Monroe or when and how can I get from Richmond there.</p>
