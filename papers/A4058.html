<p class="p10">Monday Nov -- 9<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Martins House</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sara:</p>
<p class="p10"> We left Culpeper yesterday the enemy having come in the day previous &amp; got a decided
     advantage over us by capturing nearly a Brigade some 1300 men that we had on picket across the
     Rappahannock. They also got our advantage in position at Kelly's ford &amp; so drove our
     men from there &amp; then crossed in force as we came back to a line of battle -- about 3
     miles from the C.H. -- and there we waited all day yesterday
     for the enemy to come on &amp; although we only had a tolerable position they advanced very
     slowly, &amp; as Gen Lee did not like the position for a fight and intended to come back to
     Orange Co. anyhow we broke up camps &amp; came back last night to our old quarters, where I
     found the Gen -- when I came from home. I was up guiding the troops all night before last
     &amp; we rode until quite late last night before we got here<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>so am rather dull
     today &amp; only write because I have not written for several days, not since I got your
     letter - - Maj. Bell sent the butter down, it came safely to hand -- very nice &amp; we
     have enjoyed eating very much since -- as we have had light rolls &amp; you know I can do
     my duty when they are on hand. We are in a house again thank good luck &amp; very
     comfortable fixed or will be -- having a large, light &amp; airy room, and shall fix up
     today &amp; go to work again -- We think Gen. Lee will fight again this year to overcome
     the two almost disasters this army has met with both traceable to our own short comings. I sent
     you some money by Mrs. Wise &amp; will avail myself of the first opportunity to send you
     some $200 -- that may <u>have</u> to pay for your fall supplies &amp;c I
     am sorry poor Anna's arm is <u>"so sore"</u> hope it is well by this time<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>the poor little bird -- I wrote to Nelly &amp; I suppose my letter has come to hand
     -- I enclose you a Yankee stamp &amp; you can write to your mother, one page of letter,
     purely on domestic matters, and endorse your letter "By flag of truce" &amp; enclose it to
     Brig. Gen. Winder Richmond of <i>[illeg.]</i> paying the postage on the encolsure &amp;
     ask Gen. W. to forward --</p>
<p class="p10"> I wrote to Father by another channel, somehwhat doubtful, a few days ago. I hope Allie is
     getting much better &amp; I am anxious to hear from you all --</p>
<p class="p10"> Good bye &amp; God bless you</p>
<p class="p10"> Write soon </p>
<p class="p10">Your Aff husband</p>
