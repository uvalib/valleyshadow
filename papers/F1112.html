<p class="p10">November 1863</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father:</p>
<p class="p10">I would like to know if my tools are at home and further as I have not written to
                    John Markey since I am out whether it would suite you to
                    pay him some money as he may be getting uneasy but if you cannot handy do
                    it-why, it is right. I promised that as soon as I got my bounty I would send him
                    some money but I have not got my bounty yet nor can not tell whether ever I will
                    get any bounty or not.</p>
<p class="p10">I expect that I will soon be paide off again then I will
                    send you what I can spare.</p>
<p class="p10">I would like to have that watch as soon as possivle
                    and a key for it.</p>
<p class="p10">If you know where Abraham and Ashway is you can tell them that our Regiment lays
                    about 4 miles south of the camp where they came to see me, as soon as I can find
                    them I will go and see them.-That is if I get the chance for we have a great
                    deal of picket duty to do and for me to get home is impossible. Our old men will
                    hardly get home. The new men is not entitled to a furlough till next winter.</p>
<p class="p10">But I trust that we will all get home before that time--not my will but thine, O
                    Lord, be done.</p>
<p class="p10">I would thik it would be better if there would be a
                        house keeper at home. It does not suite me to be at home but I think it would suite the family-to be at home to keep house and take care
                    of things. It does not look well to see a house and nobody in it.</p>
<p class="p10">I have a great deal to talk about but I have a poor way to tell it so I will not
                    say much.</p>
<p class="p10">Now, I will say that if Brother John is going to school tell him that when he can
                    use a desk to write on like mine then he can play soldier. I lay my knapsack on
                    the ground and then I set on it. Take my in plate-lay it on my knee with the
                    bottom side up and then I write on it.</p>
<p class="p10">No wonder if my letter is dirty and greasy and witten
                    miserable poor but this is a soldier style.</p>
<p class="p10">I must close for the present. It rained all last night. It is now clearing
                    off-only our camp is very windy.</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote John A. Horn 2 letters. I am anxious to know if he got them.</p>
<p class="p10">No more but give my resp.. to all enquiring friends. You will soon hear from me again.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
