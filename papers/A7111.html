<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">As I have so recently written you I shall make my report very brief  The schools are all prospering; but I have nothing of note to tell you in regard to any of them.</p>
<p class="p10">I think that instead of the children growing more unattentive to their books as they become accustomed to study that the reverse is true; The more they learn the more they like to learn.</p>
<p class="p10">Our great trouble is in regard to suitable rooms<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> for the different schools</p>
<p class="p10">These small rooms are packed so full that it is extremely inconvenient for teachers to work to advantage, and worse than that, there being no ventilation the air becomes extremely foul and I tremble for the health of the teachers, and insist on their walking much in the open air  We have one vacant room in the building and the steady increase of numbers in each of the schools has bought the aggregate amt. Up to 434 and day schools to 224 with an average of 147 which would give 450 pupils to 5 teachers each and when Mr Coan comes I shall ask him to consider<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> the propriety of having another teacher sent to this place permanently, as 45 scholars are enough for these small rooms</p>
<p class="p10">Our S Schools has increased since we received the question books and the divisions among the people have somewhat subsided, (through much reasoning)  Last Sunday we numbered 140 scholars and 7 teachers whereas we used to have only 25 or 40 in all</p>
<p class="p10">The Lord is helping us</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Scott</i></p>
