<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: W. Storer How to Orlando
                    Brown, February 19, 1866<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>How writes Brown from Staunton regarding a problem with cashing U.S. government
                    checks in the area, necessitating that he and other Bureau employees pay
                    additional fees. He also requests information about his desired promotion to
                    Major.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Feby 19th 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Colonel</p>
<p class="p10">I of course do not <i>[unclear: like]</i> to state in an official communication
                    that I have to dispose of U.S. Drafts at a discount, but such is the fact since
                    checks on Richmond are not current funds, and the first one received cash
                    payment in Baltimore while I now pay 1/4 for each in Martinsburg, having no
                    National bank at Winchester. Hence I was obliged to carry as on hand the check
                    for 300 received in January until I could get the Martinsburg Bank to cash it.
                    If there is any way to avoid this course I shall be glad to know it for it is
                    manifestly unjust that the employees should have to pay this additional tax.</p>
<p class="p10">I received on Saturday from <i>[unclear: Hank]</i> B. Hayes M.C. from Cincinnati
                    - my District - a communication to him from the War Dept notifying him of my nomination by the Secy of War for brevet promotion to Major of Vols under date Feby
                    13th 1866, and presume that I shall receive a letter notice through you, and you
                    don't know anybody who wants it less than do I. If you wish it, just say "<i>[deleted: ]</i> an official statement on either or both of these subjects" and I
                    will.</p>
<p class="p10">Patiently yours</p>
