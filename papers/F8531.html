<p class="p10">My dear Father:</p>
<p class="p10">By <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: Van Stafe]</i> I send one of my trunks home.-- I will take the
                    other with me. I expect to go to Phila.
                    tonight or tomorrow.-- I will remain a few days and will return home probably by
                    Saturday night.-- I hope you are all getting along comfortably. I have a great
                    deal to tell you when I reach home. I knew many of the secrets of politics.--
                    The American was pretty <i>[illeg.]</i> last week on
                    <i>[unclear: Helster]</i>, Fillmore &amp; Cooper.-- The two former have
                    killed themselves eternally in P<u>a</u>. The last named has been dead for some time.--</p>
<p class="p10">The Gov. is very well &amp; bears his defeat
                    like a man. The wonder is, that he was <i>[added: not]</i>
                    defeated by a heavier vote. The majority will be about 7000. <i>[illeg.]</i> is
                    elected by a large majority.-- That is a severe blow.--</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
<p class="p10"><i>
                        <u>Edward</u>
                    </i></p>
