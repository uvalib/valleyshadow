<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Thaddeus
                    Stevens, February 2, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>This letter from McClure relates more information about the maneuverings
                    regarding Lincoln's cabinet positions. According to McClure, Cameron attempted
                    to make deal with him, which McClure declined.</p>

<p class="p10">Feby 2</p>
<p class="p10">Harrisburg.</p>
<p class="p10">DSir--</p>
<p class="p10">I have just returned from Chambersburg court, where I was detained a full week. I
                    find nothing new of special interest here.</p>
<p class="p10">Cameron himself asserts with entire confidence to his friends that he will be in
                    the cabinet. He assured Taggert so on Sunday last: and all his friends who are
                    active in the matter, treat it as settled.</p>
<p class="p10">Last night however a special messenger came from Cameron to Curtin stating that
                    the whole responsibility was upon him now, &amp; that if he would yield and
                    write a letter to Lincoln assenting to the appointment, it would be <u>harmoniously settled</u>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Curtin refused to give the letter, so that it is reasonable to infer
                    that Mr. Cameron does <u>not</u> yet consider the matter
                    harmoniously settled. In support of this view, I may mention the fact that to-day one of Gen Cameron's
                    chief managers called upon me, as he said, with full powers to make a treaty of
                    peace, and the short-term Senatorship or any thing else I might like better
                    should be at my command -- the consideration, of course, that I should join in
                    getting the Gen
                    <u>harmoniously</u> into the cabinet. The offer was attended
                    with the stereotypical declaration that the Gen
                    would go into the Cabinet at any rate, &amp; I might as well assent to it
                    &amp; make the most of it. I need hardly say that the treaty <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> was
                    not concluded.</p>
<p class="p10">I see that the Tribune of yesterday seems to have some definite information on
                    the subject. Do you know what it is? &amp; the exact source of it?</p>
<p class="p10">I have had no word from Lincoln for several weeks; altho he then said he would write me soon again on the subject.</p>
<p class="p10">I have positive evidence, in a confidential way, that immediately after the
                    election Cameron induced certain men in the State to write Lincoln protesting
                    against the appointment of Wilmot and asking for a <u>conservative man</u>. When he had Wilmot half-butchered he made him put
                    the finishing stroke to himself.</p>
<p class="p10">Write me how matters look. Can anything more be done? I am <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> ready for
                    anything &amp; can now give it proper attention</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
