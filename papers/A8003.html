<h4>Augusta County: L. Luckett to Alexander H. H.
                    Stuart, December 23, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Luckett requests that Sandy visit the Lucketts as Staunton schools "must be in a

<p class="p10">Dec 23 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Ashbourn La</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote you some two or three months ago and as there were two or three letters
                    sent off at the same time, to neither of which any answer has been recived I think it more than probable that none of
                    them reached their destination. They were sent to our office during our rainy
                    spell &amp; as our mails frequently came up more or less<i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: and]</i> by the sudden showers, it is likely the letters shared at
                    that time the same fate but <i>[unclear: werte]</i> &amp; they were
                        <i>[unclear: srcully]</i> thrown away by our Mail boy--who sometimes played
                    us other tricks by his negligence.</p>
<p class="p10">In my letter I conveyed a wish from all the family &amp; particularly from
                    Henry that you would permit Sandy to pay us a visit and <i>[unclear: uitie]</i>
                    our family school for the winter &amp; spring, as your schools must be in a
                    state of disorganization &amp; and must remain so during the war--a
                        <i>[unclear: rendence nither]</i> us too at this <i>[unclear: parune]</i>
                    would impress his<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br><i>[unclear: health quietly besides]</i> the
                    advantage of <i>[unclear: trar]</i> it to our that has led to
                    <i>[unclear: domertre]</i> a life as <i>[unclear: he]</i>. We have an
                    excellent Teacher--a Virginian but a little too much of the Puritan order in the
                        <i>[unclear: thinking]</i> of his rules &amp;c such as rising at day
                    break and an occasional confiniment in
                        <i>[unclear: May house]</i> for <i>[unclear: very]</i> minor dificiences, but I will <i>[illeg.]</i> to him
                        <i>[unclear: dffny]</i> any saturday that they may enjoy thier
                    <i>[unclear: Horses]</i> &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> to their hearts desire.</p>
<p class="p10">We have <i>[unclear: piest]</i> had the <i>[unclear: tiding]</i>, of Englands
                    demand for the restoration of our Captured ministers, which has <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    more <i>[illeg.]</i> to others than to me--I would rather she would have told
                    us a <i>[unclear: fire]</i> iron clad <i>[unclear: war streamer]</i> with
                        <i>[unclear: Armstrong]</i> guns &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> as have whipped
                    the Scoundrels ourselves. Our People here are very much at a loss to account for
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> madness &amp; folly on their part as to <i>[deleted: ]</i> a quarrel with England at this time, for judging from their acts there never
                    was a people so <i>[illeg.]</i> &amp; crazy since the world was made. But
                    there may be method in their madness--Like Macbeth they may <i>[illeg.]</i>--I
                    am in <i>[unclear: blood]</i> slipped in so far, returning,
                    <i>[unclear: now]</i> as <i>[unclear: hard]</i> as to<br>go
                        <i>[unclear: over]</i><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>They may <i>[illeg.]</i> themselves on
                    the brink of <i>[illeg.]</i> whipped they certainly are, and unable to stand
                    the <i>[unclear: outside]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: nature]</i>&amp; fear of discovery of the lies and <i>[deleted: ]</i> they have so long practiced on their <i>[illeg.]</i> of victors
                    &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> won of <i>[unclear: sin parts]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: opened]</i> that the <i>[illeg.]</i> now

                    an enormous lie when he made out his report of 6 or 700,000 men in <i>[deleted: ]</i> arms. I doubt whether they have or had over 350000 in the fold
                    of <i>[unclear: arms]</i>--I doubt too whether they ever got 150000000 loan
                    from the Banks. They are to me with <i>[illeg.]</i> Gulf Stream that takes its
