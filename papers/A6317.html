<h4>Augusta County: David H. Evans to Mary Anna Sibert,
                    September 22, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Evans approves of Sibert's views on the duties of a wife, and agrees that many
                    women cause unhappiness by thinking more of fashion than providing a happy home
                    for their husbands to return to after a difficult work day. He discusses family
                    news and plans for a future visit.</p>
