<p class="p10">Chambersburg, Pa.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear sister</p>
<p class="p10">as I am writing to sister Catharine will drop you a few lines for your satisfaction we are
     all well. hope you are the same I would like to write you a long letter but have hardly time
     now, I would like to pay you a visit soon but I often do not feel well and feel best at home.
     my mind is often with you some three weeks ago perhaps longer, Brechbill was here said they had
     written to you rec<sup>d</sup> no answer thought
     perhaps you had send something here for his wife brought one supporter here said she had Kept
     the first one found she could make it fit by altering it a little, said she was some better,
     wished to have some more drops, suppose you have heard from her ere this</p>
<p class="p10">I will send the supporter down the first good oppertuny
     perhaps you will be up soon</p>
<p class="p10">My love to you and Brother George</p>
<p class="p10">Remember us in your prayers</p>
<p class="p10"><i>E Stouffer</i></p>
<p class="p10">please hand this over to N Hoover<br> Eliza Stouffer for Bregbiles<br>
      N Hoover<br><br> As this sheet is blank, I will tell you that Jacob re<sup>d</sup> a letter from S K Snively on 30th Nov. Benjamin wrote to
      him, then Jacob wrote a few lines and laid it in his letter he writes with great pleasure, did
      I read those lines you sent in Bs letter. I must feel very thankfull that the Lord is so very merciful that he has spared my life to this present
      time. While many of my fellow soldiers and comrades, are every day hurried to a long and
      unending eternity I had to feel so in particular when those two men were struck with
      lightening near my tent. I had to feel that easily it might have been my lot, and what would
      have been the consequenc. I would have rec<sup>ed</sup> a fatal and irrivocable
      doom, Friend Jacob. I must often reflect of times past, How Satan led me from the narrow path
      to the broad and sinful <i>[deleted: way]</i> one again and how happy and contented I was
      when I embraced religion, and now how miserable and reched I often
      now feel If it ever should be my luck to get home again I will give myself up to the Lord and
      try and serve him <i>[deleted: the remainder]</i> faithfully the ballance of my days<br><br> These are his own words I thought perhaps you would
      like to hear from him N Hoover
