<p class="p10">Friday Night -- Aug. 16<sup>th</sup> 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Huntersville, Pocahontas Co. Va</p>
<p class="p10">My Ever Dear Wife. --</p>
<p class="p10">I was certain when Mr. Bear left that I should write to you the next day &amp; was almost
     as certain that I should get home this week, but it seems to be my duty to be here rather than
     where inclination would lead me, to my "loved ones at home" -- I hope you will be of good cheer
     and not repine or complain because I do not come, for I want to come badly enough -- heaven
     well knows -- but then I owe a duty to my country that I must discharge that she may be enabled
     to put the shield of her protection over my family &amp; enable me and them to spend some
     portion of our days in peace &amp; at least transmit to our posterity freedom -- of thought
     &amp; of action -- Our men moved Tuesday to the top of the Alleghany &amp; the men that
     were there moved ten miles further to <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Yeager's -- I had an interview with Gen.
     Jackson &amp; he wished me to continue to work for him on the map -- the duty by which he
     had assigned me, but he had not the power to assign me any rank and could only keep me at work
     as a common soldier, and I had not the least inclination to be changed to such a duty as that I
     was discharging from a higher rank &amp; then only to be classed as a common soldier, so I
     had concluded to come home &amp; try and go to Richmond and secure a place in the regular
     engineer Corps, by the appointment of the Pres. but Jackson thought I would accomplish my end
     better by going to see Gen. Lee &amp; get him to recommend my appointment -- so he gave me
     a very flattering letter to Gen. Lee &amp; after working until Thursday noon in Monterey I
     packed up my tent &amp;c &amp; left them in Mr. Stevenson's care &amp; I came over
     to the top of the Alleghany in an ambulance that was coming over -- saw all the boys that were
     there encamped, for a few moments -- Capt. Lilley had just got his banner back from Staunton
     where they sent it to be fitted up -- as it got somewhat rumpled during the retreat -- and I
     also ate a tomato that the Capt gave me -- it was capital -- then I found Dr. Butcher, who had
     kindly agreed to bring me in his gig to where Lee is -- the Mingo Mt -- at the head of Tygart's
     Valley River -- &amp; so we started on down towards this place at 4 pm -- he brought me 8
     miles, to his brother in law's -- F. Arbogast's -- where I was treated splendidly -- ate
     &amp; slept gloriously -- the 3<sup>rd</sup> time I have slept in a bed <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> since I left home -- lots of blackberry pies, eggs &amp;c she served us to -- her
     husband -- (we did not find Mr. A. at home.) is Captain of the Militia of Pocahontas - - and
     they are kept as scouts in Cheat Mt -- Mrs. A cooks all the provisions for his company -- she
     is a whole souled woman -- they have some chubby children -- they made me think of home -- Dr.
     Butcher lives at Huttonsville and he had to leave there when we came through -- his wife was
     sick -- had just been confined -- he has 4 children there -- one of his little girls had come
     over a few days before for a visit to her aunt here -- and now she is cut off from her mother
     -- she was close to her father all the while he was there &amp; felt very badly when we
     left today -- The Dr. heard from his home a few days ago -- the Yankees had taken all his books
     -- horses grain carriage &amp;c and they have sent away, in irons every Secessionist they
     can find, tho' they invited a good many of them to come back
     &amp; McClellan wrote to Dr. B. to come back, but as soon as they got any of them back they
     shut them up -- quite a good many got away lately -- they say there are not more than 8000
     Yankees in W. Va -- and they are very much scared -- many of them are sick -- after they heard
     of the battle of Manassas they sent home the 8 bands they had at Beverly</p>
<p class="p10"> We come on this morning towards this place, passing through to Green Bank, where I saw
      <i>[unclear: Donaghe]</i> &amp; Francisco -- two of the C. Cav -- who had been out to Cheat on a scout -- we stopped at Mr. R. McCatchen's for
     dinner -- a cousin to Bob that used to go to school to me -- by the way Bob is a Union man
     &amp; is now at Beverly -- married to a woman that ruled him into such a course -- There
     were some 20 sick at Mr. McCatchen's &amp; the old lady was seeing to them all -- she is
     the only angel of mercy I have seen &amp; Miss Ewins at McDowell is the only other one I
     have heard of in all this N.W. country -- more of the men have
     died for the want of nurses &amp; proper <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> diet than any other cause -- the women
     here flee away from the army instead of coming to its aid &amp; cheering up the men by
     their presence -- there are enough of them here but they seem to think it indelicate or beneath
     them -- or something -- I do not know what -- to take care of the sick soldiers -- there are a
     great many sick here -- I can hear them groan here where I am from the upper story of the
     tavern which is converted into a hospital -- We met with an accident and shall be detained here
     part of tomorrow -- a wagoner was driving heedlessly along &amp; did not turn out as he
     ought and we had to get on a bank to avoid his wheels -- and that threw all the weight on one
     wheel &amp; it broke down -- every spoke broke -- but we pounded it together &amp;
     walked the last mile &amp; got here just before night -- there are 3 Regiments here -- one
     from Ga. a Tenn --
     <i>[unclear: one]</i> under the command of Gen. Donalson --the one that ran for Vice Pres.
     &amp; one Va -- there are some 8 or 10000 with Lee, 28 miles from here -- where I hope to
     get tomorrow -- then I shall know what I shall do. I hope you got the sugar &amp;c I sent
     you &amp; hope they were acceptable -- try &amp; keep in good spirits &amp; get
     along the best you can &amp; I hope I shall soon get home &amp; get all things arranged
     -- write to me to Monterey -- for I shall go back there in a day or so -- we expect a battle in
     Tygart's Valley every day -- Any quantity of love for you &amp; the children -- remember me
     to Allie &amp; other enquiring friends </p>
<p class="p10">Truly Your aff husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
<p class="p10">I am longing to get home -- and if I get an appointment I shall not
      accept until after a visit home -- Capt. Lilley presented me with a pair of Green flannel
      waist bands -- wide they are very nice &amp; comfortable -- write often -- I will send you
      some money or bring it early next week -- I cannot find any thread above No. 40</p>
