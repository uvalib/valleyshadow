<h4>Augusta County: Alex Rives to Alexander H. H.

<p class="p10">13th May 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Carlton</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">Affliction and loss of health have so abstracted my attention from public
                    affairs, that I really stand in need of information and counsel to regulate my
                    vote on the 4th. Thursday in the month. I hope I may presume so far on our
                    friendly relations &amp; past concurrence of opinion as to invite in
                    confidence a brief expression of your views.</p>
<p class="p10">You can well conceive that I am not favourably inclined to our unceremonious
                    &amp; unexpected transfer to Jeff. Davis &amp; Co. I did not like the
                    Convention's adoption of Judge Allen's sophism in the preamble to the Act of
                    Secession;--it is a false gloss and unworthy of the State; I do not like the
                        secresy resting upon the vote for Secession<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I do not like the Terrorism that now reigns through the land; I do
                    not like the bribe to the West in the ad valorem tax on slaves &amp;c.
                    &amp;c.</p>
<p class="p10">But still I may have to gulph all these dislikes, if
                    nothing can be accomplished by struggling against manifest destiny. We are
                    perhaps now driven to accept separation, peaceable or forcible, as 'in fait
                    accompli.'</p>
<p class="p10">Pray, now, what will be your course, and what your counsel to your friends. I
                    have a letter from McKenzie of Alex a. stating, a great reaction is going on in
                    that city, Fairfax, Loudon, Frederick &amp;c. and a large vote will be
                    polled against secession in that quarter of the state.</p>
<p class="p10">Most truly<br>Yr.frd.</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Alex Rives</i></p>
<p class="p10">
                        Hon. A. H. H. Stuart
                    </p>
