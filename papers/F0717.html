       Oct. 18th</p>
<p class="p10">Paroled Prisoner's CampAnnapolis Md.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">You will doubtless think I have <br> been rather careless in answering your <br> letter but
     when you hear my excuse I <br> think you will pardon me. </p>
<p class="p10">Your letter was brought to me <br> on Sunday Sept. 14th, on
     the Battle= ground<br> of South
     Mountain, before the engagement <br> commenced. You have doubtless heard <br> all the
     particulars of that hard fought <br> battle. I was taken prisoner about <br> sunset, in a
     charge on a rebel Battery. <br> I was in the front and left of our reg=
      <br> iment when the Rebs. outflanked us <br> on the left and several of us were<br>
     captured. We were marched to Boonsboro
     <br> and staid their until about 10 'clock at night <br> when
     the Rebs came through on their re= <br> treat, and we got up and
     marched to 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/BitSho4b.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitSho4b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     Shepherdstown, Va where we staid that <br> day and the next when they took us <br> back to the rear
     of the rebel lines where <br> we remained during the battle of 
      Antie= <br> tem,
      and the next day, when being <br> joined by other prisoners amounting in <br> all to
     about 400 we commenced our <br> march for Staunton, 120 miles.
     During <br> our whole march we had nothing to eat <br> but green corn, until the last three
     <br> days when they gave us a pint of flour <br> each per day and about 1/3 lb of fresh <br>
     beef, without a pinch of salt for ei= <br> ther. We mixed our flour
     in the cups <br> and baked it in the ashes. We were <br> 8 days going to Staunton where we arrived <br> on Saturday evening the 27th, when we <br>
     immediately got on board the cars <i>[deleted: at]</i>
     <br> and arrived at Richmond next morn= <br>
      ing. Here I took sick and was hardly <br> able to sit up during my 8 day stay <br>
     there. I had no medical attendance what=<br> ever. I spoke to two
     secesh doctors who 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/BitSho4c.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitSho4c.gif"></center></a><br><br> took my name, but that was the last <br> I ever saw of them. I
     was placed <br> in a 3d story room of a tobacco ware= <br> house with 180 others. I lay on the hard <br> floor having
     nothing but a rubber blanket. <br> On the 6th of October we were sent to Hagers <br> Landing, where steamers were waiting to <br> bring us to this place. </p>
<p class="p10">I should like to give you the partic=<br> ulars of <i>[deleted: our]</i> the battle and of my capture <br> and imprisonment, but I have not <br>
     yet fully recovered my health and it <br> is quite a task for me to write. You <br> will
     excuse bad writing and composition <br> on this account. Answer soon and <br> let me hear all
     the news from Franklin. <br> Give my best respects to all friends,
     <br> my love to the gals and reserve my <br> sincere friendship for yourself. </p>
