<p class="p10">Dear Cynthia</p>
<p class="p10">I have tired to give you as faithful a picture of how I
                    am getting along as possible as this. There is only one drawback &amp; that
                    is my wife is far away from me. I cant enjoy the
                    pleasure of her company as I would wish too but I still
                    live on hope. In thought I am there all the time hearing your voice &amp;
                    enjoying your caress. It would be the sweetest enjoyment in the world for me to
                    be back at home with you now once more &amp; it is that hope that keeps me
                    from becoming downspirited. I will see my wife after a while, so I will wait on.
                    Hope on love &amp; a kind Creator will bless me in giving my loved ones to
                    me again. Join with me in prayer Cynthia to Him who rules all that He may permit
                    us to meet again that we may enjoy ourselves in love &amp; prepare ourselves
                    &amp; children for his kingdom in Heaven. Kiss all children fo your affectionate husband</p>
<p class="p10">Kiss all the children for your affectionate husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>S. M. Potter</i></p>
<p class="p10">Our paymaster has not come yet. Would you send me a few
                        postage stamps in your next</p>
