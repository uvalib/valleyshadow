                </opener>

                <p>My hope of seeing Dr Brown has been frustrated , &amp; I have been obliged to
                    abandon the trip to Lewisburg. </p>

                <p>The imprudence of my coming to Richmond is more evident than ever. In this part
                    of the country there is no safety for <orig reg="travelers">travellers</orig>,
                    even along the neighborhood roads. Men travel about, &amp; arrest any
                    citizen they meet without regard to law, and carry the prisoner to the army You
                    of course would be subject to no such danger, but a quiet
                    <unclear>retiracy</unclear> is my only safety. Until a few days since, the
                    country from Staunton to Lewisburg offers every facility for the test of M<hi
                        rend="super">c</hi>Causland's idea. It is not <hi rend="underline">much</hi>
                    changed now. Could you run up to Staunton and consult on the subject of your
                    letters to me? Apprise me by say two or three days notice (getting my <pb n="2"
                    />letters from town is so uncertain) &amp; I can meet or send for you. Under
                    the apprehensions, &amp; with the view I expressed in my last from the
                    Southwest, I could not venture to visit you with safety. You have no such
                    apprehensions. </p>

                <p>It seems to me that the Governor of my state (whose authority I acknowledge as
                    supreme power of government) might &amp; should protect me from the dangers
                    by which I am beset. I have frequently thought of applying to him for it. I
                    ought not be placed in a position which requires me to do that which is utterly
                    revolting to the purest sentiments of nature or to seek refuge in a prison. Poor
                    old V<hi rend="super">a</hi>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> is utterly ignored - she is powerless</p>

                <p>My uncle Mr E S Arnold now in Richmond contemplates a movement similar to that
                    suggested. In accordance with an arrangement made some time ago, he has written
                    to consult with my present intentions. I <abbr expan="received">rec'd</abbr> his
                    letter by some mail with yours, &amp; will feel it incumbent upon me to
                    apprise <pb n="3"/> him of any arguments I may make. If it should be
                    inconvenient to you, it is not all improbable he would confer with you,
                    &amp; then come up to see me, &amp; report your plans. Like yourself he
                    has something to apprehend from the causes which prevent my coming to Richmond. </p>

                <p>My kind remembrances to the family. </p>
