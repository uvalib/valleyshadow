<p class="p10">July 27 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Gordonsville</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Cousin</p>
<p class="p10">This is Sunday and I don't know how I can <i>[illeg.]</i> myself more pleasantly
                    than in writing you a short letter, although I don't feel much in a humor of
                    writing or doing anything else, I have a bad cold sore throat and headache, we
                    had a short march yesterday left camp about 5 o'clock marched to Gordonsville a
                    distance of 5 miles stayed there until nearly sundown then marched back to camp.
                    we marched very fast for a while and got very warm and it rained on us before we
                    got to camp. I got very wet and lying on the damp ground all night is what gave
                    me such a cold. I don't think I have had the cold as bad for six months. The
                    company is generly well some few are complaining.
                    We have a very nice camp here in a beautiful grove. The Brigade is all together,
                    have very good water for Eastern V<sup>a</sup>. We have a very good chaplain now, have preaching every
                    Sunday and prayer meeting every night, Warden is his name, he is a very nice man
                    and a good preacher. I met with <i>[unclear: Mr.]</i> Wheat at the spring
                    today, would not have known <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> him but heard him remark to another man
                    that was with him that Lizzie was well and that Mrs. Buchanan is dead. I found
                    out from that that he was from your neighborhood. I then made some enquiries about your mother, and found out who he
                    was. Cousin Lizzies boy or yours I don't know which I was slightly acquainted
                    with last winter. I had forgotten him. You said in your last letter that you had
                    a message for me from an old acquaintance. I am very anxious to know who and
                    what it was. I intend to have gone up to your neighborhood when I was at home
                    but could not make it suit and so many of your <i>[illeg.]</i> was sick, I hope
                    you will excuse me. I also hope you all have gotten well ere this. I suppose you
                    are well and healthy by this time. I was surprised to see that you had grown so
                    much but it had been some time since I had seen you. I would have liked very
                    much to have had a chat with you but sircumstances would not permit. I might have gone to see you that
                    evening but I am sorry to tell you that I was not there when I was at home nor
                    did have any desire to go. I was charged with things that I am <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    innosent of. I am sorry that it is so, but as <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> it is so it may remain so far as I am conserned I shant trouble myself about it. I will tell you what it
                    was. I was charged with informing on Ja's R which is entirely false. I did not
                    write a letter to any one in the company while I was at home. I will drop it,
                    will not be pleasant to you and I am shure it is not to
                    me. I am sorry I did not comply with your wishes about kissing cousin Sue that
                    is shurely a <i>[illeg.]</i> pleasant task. She is a
                    particular friend of mine I had some nice times with her when I was at home. Oh!
                    I wish this war was over so we all could return to our homes in peace. I think
                    we will know how to appreciate it if it is ever <i>[illeg.]</i> it, which time
                    I hope is not far distant. I will stop writing for the evening, probably will
                    write some more in the morning if nothing happens to <i>[unclear: prevent]</i>
                    it. I stopped wishing <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> and went to preaching, heard as often did <i>[illeg.]</i> and
                    heard a prear from from Gen' Jackson which was <i>[illeg.]</i> as good as I ever heard. I do
                    think this is the best man I ever saw. how thankful we should be that he have
                    such a General <i>[illeg.]</i> is a <i>[illeg.]</i> character.</p>
<p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I must bring my letter to a close <i>[illeg.]</i> this very poor
                    letter and answer soon. Direct to Gordonville. Give my love to all inquiring
                    friends if there be any, receive a good portion for yourself.</p>
