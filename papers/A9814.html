<p class="p10">Feb 10 <sup>th</sup> - 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Ballard House</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir -</p>
<p class="p10">On my return from Franklin County on Wednesday last I found a letter from you
                    appraising me that you &amp; Mr. Lowning, were in Richmond. I left home the
                    next morning &amp; reached the city on the same evening &amp; was
                    surprised and disapointed to learn that you had returned home. Being home for
                    several days &amp; not engaged in <u>settling </u><u>accounts</u> between the two states, I have turned my
                    attention to the <u>general</u>
                    <u>race</u> for Gov<sup>r</sup> that is likely to take place in the spring. Many of our
                    friends in the Legislature prefer you <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>for Gov<sup>r</sup> &amp; with our Conservative
                    friends on the South Side of James River you are decidedly their choice. Fayette
                    McMullin is in the field &amp; says he will be at your next court in
                    Augusta. Gen<sup>l</sup>. Thompson or
                        Gen<sup>l</sup>. Mahone will be the
                    regular <i>[unclear: 
                        Secesion
                    ]</i> Candidate. Our friends here are inclined to put you, myself &amp;
                    Nelson in the field &amp; if your Townsman &amp; kinsman <i>[deleted: was]</i>
                    <i>[added: were]</i> out of the way, there would be no
                    difficulty about the success of the ticket. Nelson is willing &amp; anxious
                    to go on the ticket for Attorney Gen<sup>l</sup>. I learn that Gov<sup>r</sup>. Boreman has appointed companions to meet us. Would it not be
                    well for us to meet here on Wednesday the 13<sup>th</sup> of March.
                    &amp; if we agree upon any satisfactory basis of settlement <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Gov<sup>r</sup> Pierpoint can convene the
                    Legislature &amp; fix the question of the payment of the States interest on
                    the public debt, which I learn will be adjourned till <u>we</u> make our report. I had a long interview last evening with Alexander
                    Mosby, who has taken charge of the <i>[unclear: Ticking]</i> &amp; who
                    prefers you for Gov<sup>r</sup>
                    &amp; is very desirous that you should become a candidate for the office.
                    Nelson &amp; I will pursue any course you may adopt. I shall remain here
                    till Wednesday at 2 oclock. Write me fully either here or at Home -- Posts Slow.</p>
<p class="p10">In haste yours Truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W<sup>m</sup> Martin</i></p>
<p class="p10">NB -- If we dont meet in March I would prefer July or
                        August as I shall be in court during the spring months &amp; the month
                        of June. W.M.</p>
