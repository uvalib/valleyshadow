<p class="p10">November 30<sup>th</sup>, 1860</p>
<p class="p10">Mossy Creek Academy, Augusta Co. Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father,</p>
<p class="p10">I rec. your kind letter a few days ago, and will now answer it.
     I was sorry to hear that you was unwell, I hope that you will soon recover, as health is the
     greatest blessing which we can have. I see by your letter that you have purchased a lot of
     cattle, at 2.80 weighing 800 pounds. They must be nice cattle to weigh that in a hollow
     condition. I think the price of cattle are pretty heigh, considering
     the price of the Baltimore market last summer. Since I have been up here, I have not heard
     anything about the markets, but that is not what I came up here to do. News is very scarce in
     this part of the country. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> We do not get about any to hear any
      thing. I rode to Staunton the other day only to see the town and get the ride. I did
     not get to see much of it then as the days are short and it is sixteen miles there, the ride
     consumed nearly all of my time. I did not get to go in the asylums, and that I would have liked
      to done very much. I do not think Staunton is a pretty place
     at all, it is all hills, but I had a very nice ride on Prof. Turner's horse, he has a very fine
     horse, and he loans him to me, whenever I want him. This evening I rode down to Bridgewater,
      <i>[deleted: an]</i> I saw Eph Neff, he seems to be in fine spirits, and if report be true
     is getting along very well. I think I can get Prof. Turner's horse to come home, if I can I
     will borrow a pair of saddle-pockets and there-by save all expenses, if I make this arraingement I will let you know. I do not know though what is your
     intention, wither to send after me or let<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>me come down to
     New Market on the stages, any way will suit me, so that I get home, for I would hate to stay up
     here through the hollidays, when the ballance are all gone.</p>
<p class="p10">The State has went for Bell I suppose without a doubt, but the Whigs can not claim it as a
     victory. There was a greater democratic vote polled than was ever known before in this state. I
     suppose Doctor and Uncle Mason lays low about Douglas now. They said he was the man to vote for
     to save the union. I should like to know where his strength was, he taken off about enough
     votes to sever the solid front of the South which should at this time more than all others, be
     shown undivided. I wrote to Mr. <i>[unclear: Zirkley]</i> about my vest, and to Mr. Robinson
      immeatly on receipt of your letter. Give my love to all.</p>
<p class="p10">I Remain your Son</p>
<p class="p10"><i>C.C. Branner</i></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p> To Mother<br> I rec your
      letter the same day I rec fathers, and was very glad to hear
      from you. You say you have the turkey ready for me. Well I say just hold on to him, for I am
      coming down if I have got to walk. Mother if I only had some of your good pudding and sausage!
      I tasted some up here the other day, and I think I just found out what good sausage was. You
      appear to have had plenty of company last Sunday. I would like to have been there and enjoyed
      my-self with them. if you see Gennie Bowman give her my best respects, also to all of them. I
      do not know what is the matter with Mary, she never writes to me any
      more. Tell her if she dont write soon I will pull her ears
      good, when I come down, you must write soon, for I am always happy to hear from any of
      you.<br>Your Son, <u>C.C.</u>
      <u>Branner</u></p>
