      </sup> 1863 --</p>
<p class="p10">Hd. Qrs. 2<sup>nd</sup> Corps
       -- Morton Hall</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear One:</p>
<p class="p10">Capt. Carroll, one of Gen. Ewell's aides is going up to Staunton today and I avail myself of
     the opportunity to enclose you One Hundred Dollars, as you may need it for some purpose, and I
     may not soon have another opportunity as good. If you can you may take up the a/c of Dr. Butcher in James Bear's hands, one or both, just as suits
     you -- see that they are receipted to me as "Exr of Dr. O.
     Butcher dec'd" and that they have been sworn to before a
     Magistrate, I will send more if you need it -- I shall be under the necessity of buying a
     horse, for I can hear nothing of mine, and that is terrible at such a time as this with horses
     at present prices, $600 to $1000, but there will be a way though I may not see it now -- I
     trust in a Providence that has always stood by me -- Do the best you can to spare and provide
     -- which I know you do &amp; will, bless your sweet heart--: I do hope the days of rest
     &amp; peace may come again when you will <u>not</u> have to be thus left
     alone to endure so much - - I hope you can succeed in getting Allen fixed up -- has Thomas made
     his shoes yet? &amp;c &amp;c -- It will require $200 to pay sent him at Christmas -- I
     now have $230.-- &amp; shall have $280. more at Christmas - - &amp; hope to lay $200
     aside for helping to pay for a horse - We are still at the Morton house, but were started
      off<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>day before yesterday, as the Yanks made a demonstration, but we came back -- I
     have not time to write more, as Carroll goes this moment --</p>
<p class="p10"> God bless you all &amp; love to all </p>
<p class="p10">Your loving husband</p>
