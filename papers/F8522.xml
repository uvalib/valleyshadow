                <p>In your letter, received a short time ago, I think you are somewhat mistaken,
                    when you say, I was in your debt. I had written once to you &amp; twice to
                    your Mother before I received an answer-- however, that would not have made any
                    difference with me, had I been well, but I had been suffering for a week or two
                    with rheumatism in my shoulders, though the primary cause was too constant
                    knitting, which produced great soreness of the muscles; as the needles &amp;
                    the work were both heavy. Last week, Ellen Birnie came down to pay us a short
                    visit, &amp; on Tuesday of this week, the Presbytery of Baltimore met here,
                    &amp; that occupied most of our time until <orig reg="today">to day</orig>,
                    for we not only attended the religious services, but the business meetings,
                    which I think very interesting. And we were very much <orig reg="favored"
                        >favoured</orig> with delightful weather all the time, until yesterday <del
                        hand="h1"/>. <pb n="2"/> It is very unfortunate that there is any
                    dissatisfaction in your church towards Mr. Van Wycke, &amp; I am surprised
                    he remains under the circumstances, for it must greatly interfere with his
                    usefulness. These crooked sticks in a congregation do a great deal of mischief,
                    &amp; though they are to be found <orig reg="everywhere">every where</orig>,
                    I think you have a large share of them. We hope Aunt continues better &amp;
                    that you both will be able to pay us the promised visit, but it must be before
                    the middle of July as your cousin C-- expects to go to Georgetown &amp; P-
                    George's, at that time when John's vacation commences. I was truly sorry to hear
                    of Louisa Gillespie's death. I remember her well and admired her very much. You
                    must <unclear>expect</unclear> a dull letter. You <orig reg="perceive"
                    >percieve</orig> I have run out of paper &amp; have to take any in the
                    house; All join me in much love to you &amp; Aunt. Mine to all friends-- I
                    did not expect your <orig reg="bank">Bank</orig> officers to be liberal in their
                    offer for your house-- they would <hi rend="underline">not survive</hi> any such
                    act. Write very soon--</p>
