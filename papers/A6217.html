<p class="p10">My Dear David,</p>
<p class="p10">The letter which disappointed me so much on Tuesday, came to
                        day (Thursday) &amp; how pleasantly my heart was relieved of all
                    anxiety. I wrote to you yesterday by Mr. Jerry Hall telling you of my
                    disappointment, &amp; suppose you rec'd the
                    letter, &amp; was surprised to hear that I did not get your letter Tuesday.
                    I have it now &amp; tho' short I thank God for
                    it, as it is from you my love. I would rather get <u>one</u>
                    <u>line</u> written by your dear hand then sheets full from any one else. but I love
                    for you to write me long letters when you have time. This last one <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I
                    willingly Excuse as you were busy. I can't tell you how many things I <u>imagined</u> which made me just as unhappy as any one ever could be in this life, by not getting your
                    letter Tuesday. I was perfectedly miserable from Tuesday evening, until 10
                    O'clock to day when your dear letter came &amp;
                    made my heart free from suffering. I love you so that when I do not see you or
                    get letters from you I suffer deeply, &amp; long. The whole world seems
                    dark, &amp; dreary to me, &amp; I cannot find peace &amp; pleasure
                    with any one, or in any way. I find happiness in
                    nothing on Earth when I think I have lost your love &amp; I know by my
                    heartaches then that with you is my <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>only real happiness in this life
                    &amp; do beleive that I could not live if you did not love me. You must not
                    smile &amp; say I just think so now. I do not just think so, for I know that
                    my happiness depends upon you, &amp; that I never truly loved until I loved
                    you, &amp; it is my nature to love you with all my soul my heart, mind
                    &amp; strength &amp; loving you so could I ever be happy, &amp; live
                    without your love? I feel that I could not. May God bless our love for eachother always is my daily prayer. I was so
                    disappointed when I read in your letter that you cannot come Saturday. how can I
                    spend another long week without seeing you my love. It seems that I cannot wait
                    so long <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>for Oh! I do want to see your dear face so much, so much--I
                    am saying truly just as I feel. I do want to see you this week for it is so long
                    since you were here, &amp; then you were with me such a short time,
                    &amp; to be with you is the greatest pleasure of my life--a pleasure I love,
                    &amp; thank God for giving me. My dear pa &amp; Ada have not returned
                    yet. we are looking for them to day. There is a letter
                    here for pa from Gen'l Imboden who is well again.
                    My Editor Mr. Wartman of Harrisonburg is here attending the Musical Convention.
                    his wife just died a few weeks ago. Ella would say he has no heart, I think so
                    myself. I love you with all my heart, Soul, &amp; nature, &amp; will
                    while we both live. I want to see you more then I can
                    write in words Oh I do wish you could come Saturday, if you cannot come (but I
                    hope you will) write to me Tuesday. All send love. I send love &amp; a
                    loving kiss to you. God bless you my love, my heart is only yours</p>
<p class="p10">Yours</p>
