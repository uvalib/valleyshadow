<p class="p10">December 28<sup>th</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Manassas Junction Va. </p>
<p class="p10">Dear John </p>
<p class="p10">I received Mary's of the 26<sup>th</sup> this evening and as she
                    writes about going to Kellanning I have concluded to drop you a few lines. We
                    had every thing nicely fixed at Warrenton
                    Junction, very comfortable quarters etc. etc. but unfortunately we awoke on the
                    morning of the 26<sup>th</sup> and found marching orders awaiting us.
                    We are now Stationed between Manassas Junction &amp; Bull Run near about the
                    same position we first occupied when first on this road. The object in moving us
                    was to put a stronger guard on the RR. The 2<sup>d</sup> Division now guards the distance formerly guarded by our
                        Brigade<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> and our Division occupies the line of the 1<sup>st</sup> Brigade. We were put down here without a house or any
                    place to go into and to add to the unpleasantness of the situation it has been
                    raining for two days which is a serious drawback on building operations. When we
                    marched from Warrenton Junction some of the men remained behind, in order to
                    ride down here on the <i>[unclear: 
                        cars
                    ]</i>. The Train in which they happened to get run off The Track near
                    Bristol Station, killed 4, and wounded 20 or 30. One of the Killed was from our
                        Regt (Moses Broad Co
                    H)</p>
<p class="p10">Lieut
                    <i>[unclear: 
                        Lehmen
                    ]</i> left for Pittsburgh on the 26<sup>th</sup>. I sent with
                    him for a Coat, and I suppose you have got the letter by this time. I wish<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> you would also give The Lieut about
                    $30 of the money belonging to Regt Post Fund on
                    deposit.</p>
<p class="p10">No news of any importance. A happy New Year. My love to all</p>
