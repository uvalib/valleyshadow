<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: J. Marshall McCue to John
                    W. Jordan, April 27, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McCue summarizes the results of a case against six men for assault and battery.
                    It appears as though the case against some of the parties involved was
                    dismissed, while it will be continued against others.</p>

<p class="p10">The case referred to within was disposed of by the County Court on yesterday, as
                    to Fisher and Wm. Ross, upon confession of
                    judgement for costs, and dismissed as to A. Ross, and continued as to the
                    Craigs. This disposition of the case was made at the instance of the prosecutor.</p>
<p class="p10">The Court has no knowledge whatever of the facts of this case. It stands upon the
                    records as an indictment against the parties named for Assault and Battery. It
                    has been the custom of this Court in <u>such cases</u> to
                    dispose of them in the manner indicated when so requested by the prosecuting
                    witness. It was stated by the prosecutor that A. Ross was improperly indicted.</p>
