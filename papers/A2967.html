<p class="p10">My Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your letters by your Pa last Friday night
                    was truly glad to hear from you. My health is not very good I have been
                    suffering for some time with a bad cold &amp; coughf &amp; headache through the day time I think I am getting
                        somwhat better &amp; hope ear long to be myself again. hope this may
                    find you enjoying health with all other worldly blessings.</p>
<p class="p10">I have sad news to communicate in this; Brother Thomas is no more; He was killed
                    in the skirmish near Bratton Station the 26th of last month poor Bro never new what hurt him he was shot in the left breast <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>the ball ranging through or near the heart. I never new what it was to have a brother shot down in battle before. It seemed
                    to me at the time that if I had have been owner of the Confederacy I would have
                    given it to have life restored to his inanimate frame once more I got his body
                    hauled back to our camp near Brandy I tried all day long the 27th to get a
                    furlough for John to take his body home but failed Mr. Anderson came down the
                        eav of the 27th &amp; I got him to start back
                    next morning with Brothers corpse. Oh it will be a severe blow on Pa. He had
                    been from home as it ware, but a few days we ware born, &amp; we must die. The time allotted to us
                        hear below is short indeed. If we stretch out over
                    hands, we may almost touch <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>the portals which terminate the path of
                    our mortal pilgrimage. If we listen with attention we seem to hear the labour of him who is engaged in diging our graves. And if the holy spirit is pleased to open our
                    ears, we may already descern the sounds wich proceed from the celestial abodes, Listen oh my soul
                    to the warming voice, with the deepest attention, "All flesh is grass &amp;
                    the glory of man is as the flower of the field, fresh &amp; verdent in the
                    morning. It adorns the meadows, the sight is gladdened at its beauty, &amp;
                    it sheds sweet perfume around, In the eavning it is
                    cut down &amp; withered. The glory is departed &amp; it tells us that a
                    few hours must suffice for earthly enjoyment I will trust continually in God let
                    come what will I know it shall be for my good The drum beats &amp; <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I have to go on drill just came. Your Pa starts home in the morning I had
                        hurd how badly Mr. Neff treated Kate B I am sorry
                    indeed never would have thought Neff to be such a man I must say I was duped in
                    him. The person that told your Ma that I knew he was going to fool her was
                    certainly mistaken for I never spoke of such a thing any one poor Kate has my
                        simpathies Tell Lizzie I wish her much luck
                    but she must not get married while the war lasts so all her friends may get to
                    see her off. Did I not write to you my reasons for not getting to see your Cous
                    Lizzie before leaving Staunton If I never I will now. I was runing around through town untill late then
                    I went out to the provost camp fully intending to come back before dark but your
                    cous, insisted on me staying with them &amp; that I would have plenty of
                    time in the morning before the cars would start so I stayed <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br>Early the
                    next morning I went to town the first plase was to Mrs
                    Stevison Shop &amp; thare was no one thare then I went to the post office to try and get some
                    postage stamps &amp; thare
                    thare was no one up so I waited awhile then went back
                    to Bro S Shop &amp; no one had came yet I was about to start to Mrs S
                    dwelling house when the cars warned me by thare whistle
                    they ware about to be off I was sorry indeed that I did
                    not get to see Miss L before leaving town as I only had a few minutes
                    conversation but I was to blame for idling my time the eavning before hope she will excuse me as it can not be helpt now I could not have stayed all night as I had <br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>Brother Tom to take care off. I recieved the cheese you sent me was very thankfull indeed as it was a nice little treat then
                    the giver made it so much better you sad you would like
                    to send me a box; Dear Kate you know I dont expect such
                    things but your noble heart is so kind &amp; generous that you seem to never
                    tire in giving I hope the time is not far distant when I may constantly eat of
                    your paking. Poor Jinnie she has bad luck hope her
                    wound will not cost her a docter fee. Again you
                    admonish me to quit chewing topackco It is my only
                    toothache preserver I had quit chewing for a day or two when my tooth commenced
                    aching I immediately recommenced using the weed The drum beats for dress perrade

                    have no candels I ask your simpathies in my late berevement I
