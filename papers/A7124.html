<h4>Augusta County: John Scott to W. E. Whiting, December 31, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Scott writes to announce the imminent arrival of Margaret Burke and also reports recent expenses for teachers' board.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b>
Mr Whiting 
Staunton Va 
</b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dec 31/67</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">As Miss Burke is soon to come to this place as teacher, she will make three to board in our Mission family and the 10 cent tax that I lay on the scholars here will not pay the board of more than two;</p>
<p class="p10">I have therefore advised Miss Davison to send for $15 one months board for herself in advance; which added to what is already due her (10-50) makes Twenty-five and 50/100.  I hope there will be no other expense here for next month aside from the salaries--as I think the school will pay the board of Miss Burke and myself until warm weather comes.  The past week has been a holyday with<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> nearly all the school--which is the reason why Miss Davison has had to pay her own board one week.  The <i>[illeg.]</i> price ($3.50) per week covers the proportion of board and <u>house rent</u> as we have to have a shelter as well as food.</p>
<p class="p10">Please send me two or three Blanks for Mission House Expenses.  The expense for my board seven weeks and Miss Davisons time, making nine has nearly all been paid by the freedmen as you see  That is they have paid $26.50/100 out of $30.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>J Scott</i></p>
<p class="p10">Mr Whiting<br>
	Please send me Twentyfive and 50/100 Dollars, as Mr Scott suggests.<br>
					S H Davison
