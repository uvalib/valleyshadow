<p class="p10">I shall give you all the information I can in regard to Corpl.
     Altymier. He was missing at the Battle of "Hatcher's Run" on the 6<sup>th</sup> day
     of February 1865. I have never been able to say whther he was taken
     Prisoner or Killed. He was with the company on going into the fight and <i>[unclear: when]</i>
     we was driven back late in the evening. It is very probable that he was taken prisoner. I had 3
     (three) missing in my co. Never heard from any of them. However, I don't think he was killed.
     We advanced over the same ground next day and would very probable
     have seen him. I am sorry for him. He was a noble soldier, miss him very much in the company.
     We have had a very exciting time a few days back there was great excitement when Lee
     surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia. I think the war is about at an end now. We have just
      recd. an official Dispatch of the Surrender of Johnson's Army.
     Great cheering going on.</p>
