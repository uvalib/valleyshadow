<p class="p10">I Henry H. Breneman, having been appointed Second Lieutenant of Company "E" 126th
                    Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers do solemnly swear that I have never
                    voluntarily borne arms against the United States since I have been a citizen
                    there that I have voluntarily given no aid, countenance counsel, or
                    encouragement to persons engaged in armed resistance and hostility thereto that
                    I have neither sought nor accepted nor attempted to exercise the functions of
                    any office whatever under authority or pretended authority in hostility to the
                    United States, that I have not yielded a voluntary support to any pretended
                    Government authority or power or constitution within the United States, hostile
                    or inimical thereto, and I do further swear that to the best of my knowledge and
                    ability I will support and defend the constitution of the United States against
                    all enemies foreign and domestic that I will bear true faith and allegiance to
                    the same. I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or
                    purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of
                    the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.</p>
