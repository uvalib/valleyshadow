<p class="p10">Dear Imboden</p>
<p class="p10">I have a chance by my "Dutch" neighbor Fredk.
                    Baker to say a word, and it is that you write me by <u>him</u> if you have not done it, in answer to mine of yesterday by Mr. Brodt
                    which I hope you have recd. Also get me a
                    Spectator <u>this</u> evening if possible and send by him--I
                    get it two days sooner--</p>
<p class="p10"> Talbot Coleman is here since yesterday mng.
                    fr. the Augusta <i>[unclear: Spns.]</i> taking
                    another sketch of our town from another point below my<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>barn. He thinks
                    the scenery around, water included, the finest he has seen any where. M<sup>r</sup> Beyer &amp; lady came down
                    with him in the stage on their way to Harrisonburg, where he designs sketching
                    the city of the "Suabians"--He was much very much pleased with our town as also
                        <i>[unclear: was]</i> his "brow"--</p>
<p class="p10"> Two of our young friends, Allen Trimble Thompson &amp; Sam<sup>l</sup> Hubben Jr are on their way <u>horseback</u> from
                    Hillsboro to see us--So wrote Gen Trimble to me on
                        Sat. They are in delicate health, having first
                    finished their collegiate course are both preparing for the ministry<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>the first in the Methodist the other in the Presbyterian church--and are both
                    unusually clever--Hibben is a nephew of Thos. Barry,
                    Thompson a gr. son of Uncle Allen Trimble--</p>
<p class="p10">Be sure &amp; drop me a line this evening--</p>
<p class="p10">All well--Yours Truly</p>
