<p class="p10">August 28<sup>th</sup></p>
<p class="p10">Camp Stonewall Brigade</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Aunt</p>
<p class="p10">As I have a good opportunity of sending a letter by Lieut
     Wright who is going home on furlough I will improve it by writing you a few lines to let you
     know that I am well &amp; hope you all may be enjoying the same kind blessing I have not
     much news to write except that every thing is quiet<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Smiley50b.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley50b.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      We are in camp yet at the same place we have been since the first
     of August. The Seasons has been good here plenty of rain to keep the ground in good order. The
     last few nights have been very cool almost cold enough for frost.</p>
<p class="p10">Yest day passed off very well here we had no drills. nothing at
     all was done but what was nescessary Reverend M<sup>r</sup> See preached in the morning &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Hopkins in the evening
     We expect to get M<sup>r</sup> See for chaplain in<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/Smiley50c.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley50c.gif"></center></a><br><br>
     our regiment as he is almost universaly wished for by the men,</p>
<p class="p10">Every thing wears a more cheerful look now than when we came to
     this side of the mountain. Our army is filling up rapidly We have over fifty men in our company
     which is more than we had when we started to Pennsylvania. Every
     body is in good spirits they think that should Gen
     <i>[unclear: ]</i> Meade advance we will be enough for him although he had the best of us in the battle
     of Gettysburg<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<a href="images/Smiley50d.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley50d.gif"></center></a><br><br>
      I send by Lieut Wright an Over shirt and pair of drawers and a book which he has promised to
     leave at your house or Uncle James's As he is nearly ready to start I must close by asking you
     to write soon &amp; excuse this short letter Give my love to Aunt Ann Uncle James's Family
     and all other enquiring friends.</p>
<p class="p10">Nothing more but remain your affectionate nephew.</p>
