                <p>It seems an age since I have heard from you. I miss your regular letters very
                    much, and am anxious to hear from you oftener, but, I suppose you are so much
                    engaged you have not much time for letter writing. I think you must be very
                    tired going on in this way from day to day and no prospect- of a Speaker-- Dr.
                    thinks matters are wearing a very serious aspect--. I had a letter from Andrew
                    this eve he says Lizzie is improving, able to sit up about- half the time and
                    exercises the length of the room at suitable intervals as soon as she is able
                    they go to Old Point- <pb n="2"/> perhaps week after next. I feel so relieved
                    she is better. I felt -- so uneasy about her even after the Dr thought her
                    better. it is such a dangerous disease and often takes persons of very suddenly.
                    I have not <orig reg="received">recieved</orig> my interest - yet - from Andrew.
                    I thought he would be more prompt -- and I do not like to remind him of it. he
                    has only paid me the $80 I bought -- my watch with, I would like to have it as I
                    calculated upon <orig reg="receiving">recieving</orig> it about -- the first of
                    this month--. How do you get along in money matters? I know you draw no pay
                    until you have a Speaker. I heard of your being in <abbr expan="Gettysburg"
                    >G--</abbr>. Miss Ginnie Smith paid Mr Gesey a visit. I called to see her and
                    she told me she had seen you and she thought -- Washington agreed with you, you
                    were looking better than she had ever seen you. <orig reg="Can't">Cant</orig>
                    you find time to write to us. I wish you could get -- a Speaker and get to
                    business. I may <orig reg="go">to</orig> to Rose Hill this or next week for a
                    few days Mary Emma is alone, her Mother is with <unclear>Jimmy</unclear> Mary
                        <unclear>Shunk</unclear> is very ill. <orig reg="Her">her</orig> life has
                    been despaired of, her friends were telegraphed for a week ago. The children are
                    very well and growing very fast. Dr. wishes to be remembered. <del hand="h1"
                    >and</del> do write soon. </p>
