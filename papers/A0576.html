<p class="p10">Feb 14<sup>th</sup> 61 </p>
<p class="p10">Richmond </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mother </p>
<p class="p10">Yours came duly to hand. You ask if I had writen you a
                    letter previous to the one which you answered? Yes I wrote the next day after my
                    arrival here. And put it in the Post Office myself.</p>
<p class="p10">The reason I did not get a cockade with yellow pendants for Frank was because
                    there were none ready made at the time I mailed my letter. So I sent such an one as I could get. It answeres
                    all the purposes of one with the yellow and signifies the same thing. You ask if
                    things do not look more like peace. I think not the air is redolant with the
                    fumes of powder and I believe we will have war with the North in less than sixty
                    days. If Virginia refuses to go out there will be a revolution in this state
                    which will be the special wonder of the world and go down to posterity as the
                    bloodiest picture in the book of time. I have said before and I say now that I
                    will be free and will maintain my rights even though I have to fight "looking a
                    halter gallantly in the face." I am a man who knows my rights and knowing dare
                    maintain. One of those rights is secession but if the convention<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    refuses to give us that there is another which I will maintain even at the foot
                    of the gallows and that is rebelion. Rebelion has its <i>[unclear: 
                        horrows
                    ]</i> so <i>[deleted: does]</i> has any other war. But like that gallant
                    Henry who rose in rebellion aginst the mightiest
                    empire on earth my words are "give me liberty or give me death." Tell Frank that
                    I will have the tobacco sent up by the Express Friday morning so that he can get
                    it any time after your receipt of this. I am very sorry that I could not see
                    Mrs. McChesney. As I have the <i>[unclear: 
                        vaity
                    ]</i> to class her among the best of my friends. </p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to all and believe me your affectionate son</p>
