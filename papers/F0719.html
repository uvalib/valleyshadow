<p class="p10">Feb. 22 '63</p>
<p class="p10"> Camp near Nashville, Tenn.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Henry:</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 18th ult. is at hand, <br> having been forwarded
     from Somersville, Va; and I will <br>
     have to answer it in brief to=night, as we are under <br> marching
     orders for to=morrow morning at 3.30, and <br> I do not know when
     I shall have an opportunity <br> of writing again. Our destination is unknown to <br> your
     humble servant. I do not know of any regiment <br> in the service which has been moved about
     quite as much as <br> the "Gipsies," as  Gen<sup>l</sup> Wise used to call us.-- <br> I am glad to hear that you
     are having good times <br> in old Southampton. Do not imagine that
     the <br> toils and privations of a soldier's life have made <br> such a misanthrope of me
     that hearing of those <br>
     <u>good things</u> you describe would cause "hard <br> thoughts." As far as
     wishing myself out of the <br> army is concerned I have wished it long ago, <br> but shall
     only get out honorably--either an honorable <br> discharge or death. </p>
<p class="p10"> Give my "Best" to all the friends and espe= <br> cially
     remember me to "Katie darling." How I wish <br> that instead of lying down to=night with my cold <br> and bony masculine bedfellow, and being bothered <br> by
     those parasites which even poor soldiers have, I <br> could have the pleasure of folding -a--
     what <br> in the D--l was I going to say? The tattoo 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/BitSho6b.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitSho6b.gif"></center></a><br><br> has just commenced to beat, and I must close <br> as taps will
     beat in 15 minutes for <u>"lights out"</u>. </p>
<p class="p10">Your old friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>D.R.P. Shoemaker</i></p>
<p class="p10"> P.S. I think our destination is Cumberland <br>
       Ford, Kentucky. <br> D.R.P.S. P.P.S.- Carthage, Tenn. Feb.
      28, 1863 <br> We are here. Direct your letter <u>via</u>
      <br>
      Galatin, <i>[deleted: Ky]</i>
       Tenn.
