                <p>This report by Jackson primarily concerns the relations between whites and blacks
                    and political attitudes in Augusta County following an election. Jackson also

                    >B.R.F.&amp;A.L.</abbr>) I have the honor to submit the following report of
                    condition of Bureau affairs in this 4<hi rend="super">th</hi>
                    <abbr expan="Division">Div</abbr> of 9<hi rend="super">th</hi>

                    <abbr expan="Virginia">Va.</abbr></p>

                <p>The election held on the 22<hi rend="super">nd</hi> of October passed quietly at
                    all the Districts in this county (Augusta) and the excitement consequent on this
                        <unclear>canvass</unclear> has postponed much of the ordinary business of
                    this office. There was excellent order at all the places of voting, but since
                    the election there has been a most outrageous attempt to deter freedmen from
                    voting again except they vote as ordered by their masters. Owing in a great
                    measure to this, contracts have not been so frequent the last half of this
                    month.</p>

                <p>The circumstances of Freedmen, as a rule, are comfortable but those with families
                    realize but little over a base subsistence.</p>

                <p>There are many applications for relief by aged and helpless freedpeople and when
                    the time comes, I shall endeavor to have the county authorities provide proper
                    maintenance for deserved poor.</p>

                <p>The Social relations between white and colored have not become more amicable by
                    the recent election, but I advise patience and forbearance on the part of
                    Freedmen and they <pb n="2"/>refrain almost entirely from discussion.
                    Politically the whites have compelled the freedmen to take sides against them.
                    The Conservative candidates openly proclaimed their opposition to education,
                    franchise or elevation for the Colored men and of course they naturally voted
                    for the Republicans who were willing they should enjoy these privileges.</p>

                <p>The Moral condition of the Freedmen is not as it should be but education for the
                    young will in time bear good fruit. I am unable to report any temperance
                    organization as yet among the Freedmen but there is much less drunkeness than a
                    few months back and when the political excitement has subsided I may succeed in
                    forming a branch society of the Lincoln Temperance Association.</p>
