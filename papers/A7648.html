<p class="p10">Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">I have been to Richmond &amp; returned here on Saturday night I got my papers
                    approved without difficulty. I would have written you on Saturday, but was
                    waiting for a letter from you first. When if there was Any particular occurrance I could answer all at once</p>
<p class="p10">I am not so well today took medicine last night &amp; weak today I am
                    progressing slowly here with business. I sent off all my cotton &amp;
                    tobacco 3 load<sup>s</sup> it will be delivered to H.L.S. Some mattrasses will be sent to you Capt H started with the 2 horses 1 died <i>[added: (sorrel)]</i> 1<sup>

                    </sup> night the other got too lame to travel so left it on the road</p>
<p class="p10">I could go home tomorrow, but Geo<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Schoppert wrote me he would be here
                    tomorrow &amp; was going down with me &amp; ask me to wait here for him
                    As the business he attends to for me can<u>
                            <sup>t</sup>
                        </u> be done without him of course I will have to remain for him I
                    have a bidder for the Tannery if can will sell it out whilst here &amp; get
                    all my matter in a small scope of Country Business here is dull for want of
                        fund<sup>s</sup></p>
<p class="p10">I have looked all around &amp; the people here all want me to move here to
                    live But I think I will settle down at home for the present &amp; see what I
                    can do.</p>
<p class="p10">Tell M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> Staub to grind up what wheat he has &amp; prepare one (1) car load
                    (80) Barrels of flour for to be sent to Richmond so soon as I<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> return
                    home. Tell him to strip the head<sup>s</sup> with old hoops ready for
                    shipping. I will start a trade in that way as it doubtless will pay much better
                    than Bal<sup>
