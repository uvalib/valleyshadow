<p class="p10">7 Dec 1853</p>
<p class="p10">Office Lynchburg Ho &amp; F Ins Co<br> Lynchburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Your esteemed favour of the 5<sup>th</sup>
     Inst is just to hand and in reply I herewith enclose your renewal
     receipts for Mr Imboden and the Messrs G &amp; M Hirsh. You will see that I have issued
      recp<sup>t</sup> to Mr I. for $25<u>
      <sup>00</sup>
     </u> which is 1 1/4 % the amount suggested in my last letter. Your remarks relative to an
     increase of $2,000 on Messrs Hirsh' risk has been noted, and our board declines either to
     increase the risk or diminish the rates.</p>
<p class="p10">We would be satisfied to take the risk on the lives of Dr. F. E Lucketes negroes provided
     they are proper subjects for Insurance. In order to Insure them you may select some Physician
     of standing in D<sup>r</sup> L. neighborhood to examine them but he (Dr L) must pay
     the Examination fees, and we will allow him a credit of Fifty cents on each policy that being
     the fee we pay our Medical examiners. We will Insure the negroes to an amount equal to three
     fourths of their value provided it does not exceed Eight hundred Dollars the head. Have you
     declarations for such risks? if not, I will send you the requisite number, upon hearing from
     you. What is the prospect for that kind of business with you? it is increasing here very
     rapidly. </p>
<p class="p10">Yours Truly,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>C.T. Wills, Scty</i></p>
