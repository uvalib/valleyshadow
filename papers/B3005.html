<p class="p10">There has just been referred to me for information, a letter of Geo. T. Cook, Lt &amp; Asst Supt. at Staunton, asking for information from
     the Quartermaster General as to the disposition made of and the action taken on some papers
     forwarded by F. S. Tukey, in April or May last, viz. Claim of
     Doctor J. W. Shelton of Augusta Co. for one Horse seized or stolen
     by a U.S. Soldier. <i>[illeg.]</i> This letter on being forwarded to Genl
     O. Brown A.A.A.G. was returned with endorsement stating that these papers were returned to Mr.
     Shelton thro' W.S. How Bt. Maj.
     &amp; Supt at Winchester on the 9th of April last,
     informing him that the Q.M. General could not assist him.
      Lt. Cook reforwarded his letter stating that the papers seem
     to have been reforwarded by Mr. Tukey since which time nothing has been heard from them. This
     was referred to me as stated <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> at the outset. <i>[unclear: It seems]</i> the matter
     appears on <i>[deleted: rec]</i> this office.</p>
