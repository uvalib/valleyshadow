<p class="p10">Yours of Dec. 16<sup>th</sup> came to
                    hand. I was please to hear from you, also that Frank was recovering from his
                    illness. </p>
<p class="p10">I have nothing to write about except inform you I am well and in good Spirits, I
                    do not know when we will be released from this place. Prehaps we are here for during the war unless we are liberated, by
                    our own Army, which is probable; but that like the exchange, is at an indefinite
                    period. Under the existing circumnstances our Government cannot and will not
                    change <i>[unclear: 
                        their
                    ]</i> policyin this matter if all the prisoners on either side has to
                    suffer by the Stand already taken. Although I think there can be an honorable
                    agreement made between the two governments provided Our Commissioner of exchange
                    would be recognized by the Authorities here. no more. write soon again. My love
                    to all the family. </p>
