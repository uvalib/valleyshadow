<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Simon

<p class="p10">April 12</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Genl --</p>
<p class="p10">Your favor is at hand. Like you I am amazed at the embarrasments thrown upon us
                    in the formation of the committee. It is unaccountable indeed that men, so far
                    forget themselves as to <i>[illeg.]</i> for places on the committee, &amp;
                    it is scarcely reconcilable with a proper sense of duty to the party</p>
<p class="p10">I am fully satisfied that<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>two mistakes have been made--first in not
                    forming the committee at once, and second in <i>[unclear: you]</i> &amp;
                    Curtin not just saying to Pollack make a fair &amp; proper committee to suit
                    the interests &amp; the necessities of the party. But it is too late for
                    that now, and you will both be <i>[unclear: censured]</i> most unjustly in any
                    event. I am willing to take any responsibility in the matter that is proper,</p>
<p class="p10">I do not know that Mann desires to be on the committee; but looking solely to the
                    harmony of action in this State, I though it a <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>matter of good policy
                    to put him on at least I feared that his omission would be charged to you and
                    upon you the state of his retaliation would fall, I hope still that he will be
                    added; and I would <u>add</u> Slocum &amp; let the two
                    Lancaster Editors remain as one cannot be taken &amp; the other left,</p>
<p class="p10">What I have recently feared is an inharmonious committee, and I could not take
                    charge of the campaign with such. Whatever even are committed, no matter upon
                    whom the responsibility <u>should</u> fall, it always falls
                    squarely upon the Chairman; and no man<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> can live long enough to
                    survive the suspicion of losing the election by bad management.</p>
<p class="p10">Things look well. The 4th district of Phila
                    suits you exactly and I judge that the 5th is also right, though the telegraph
                    goes to their second choice. Penna must have
                    no second choice until the Convention demands it of the <i>[unclear: would]</i>
                    accomplish anything.</p>
<p class="p10">I can be in Washington but not, I think, until after the Phila Election I will go there about the 18th or
                    20 &amp; remain until it is over After that I can be with you at any time
                    &amp; place, Command me</p>
