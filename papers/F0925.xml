                <p>I discover from the <orig reg="Congressional">Congrefsional</orig> proceedings
                    that an effort will be made to repeal the section of the drafting or
                    conscription act known as the $500 commutation provision. This in this County
                    and in many other parts of this state would be a bad move. The
                        <unclear>drunkards</unclear>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> &amp; other <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of the Union Cause who has
                    conscientious scruples about bearing arms would all or nearly all cease to
                    support the administration. It would be playing into the hands of the <orig
                        reg="secessionist">secefsionist</orig> sway as the great objection to said
                    act is the <pb n="2"/> length of time that men have to serve. If it were for one
                    year there would be not much trouble in getting men. Volunteers for one year
                    could be got I believe in large numbers. If any change is made in said
                    commutation principle it would be better to have it raised to $500.00 and to
                    have it graded so as to make it popular with the poor men.</p>



                <p>If for instance all who have not property worth $1000.00 were to be let off with
                    150.00 and all who have over 1000.00 and not exceeding 8000.00 were required to
                    pay 300.00 and all who are worth over 8000.00 were to pay 500.00, it would take
                    better withthe people.</p>



                <p>There is one other matter that should in my judgment be <pb n="3"/> acted on by
                    Congrefs - as the law now stands our Silver currency is a legal tender for only
                    $5.00. They should <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> be a legal tender for 1000.00 or 2000.00 a
                    fee any <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>. When <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> bank <unclear>directs</unclear>
                    well the banks were paying specie we found great <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> in businefs
                    from the provision of the act of Congrefs of I believe 1853.</p>



                <p>We had at one time 400.00 as silver currency and when <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> called
                    with large sums for redemption we could only pay 5.00 in silver and had to pay
                    the rest in gold. Where businefs again sums in the do <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> a change
                    such as I suggest would be highly beneficial to the county. I trust you will
                    pardon me <pb n="4"/> for troubling you with these suggestions for I do not wish
                    to encroach on your time as I know you must be very much engaged.</p>
