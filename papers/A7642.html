                    mutual friends. He reports that the railroad near Staunton has been destroyed,

<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Wife</p>
<p class="p10">As I have an oppertunity I write you again. Whilst
                    I write this Sunday night about 9 ohc PM sitting by
                    the fire little F is leaning on the bed looking at me &amp; dictating the
                        word<sup>s</sup> for him</p>
<p class="p10">We are quite well &amp; have every thing comfortable &amp; full &amp;
                    plenty Jack &amp; family &amp; Louise are quite well Jerry has gone off
                    with the last raiding party. he may have gone home if so you will see him Let
                        M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> S know that he has gone The R Road has been
                    much distroyed here which cuts off the travel
                    &amp; makes it quite dull here nothing doing</p>
<p class="p10">I am still at the Hotel &amp; keeping it open<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I have been trying
                    hard to make some disposition of it but it seems impossible to do it &amp; I
                    fear the only way to save it until after the war is for me to keep it open
                    &amp; dont know now who to get in it &amp; for
                    the present will have to stay here myself</p>
<p class="p10">Sometimes I think it best for you to come out here &amp; live &amp; when
                    I think of the risk of all of our property I hesitate &amp; cant decide what is best for us all round but I think it
                    will not be long until we will be able to judge more fully what is best
                    &amp; what to do</p>
<p class="p10">I assure you I am very anxious to be with you but I cant
                    ask you to abandon home with all its comforts to come here with me for my own
                    comfort &amp; pleasure &amp; of course I<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> have concluded to
                    try &amp; stand it longer.</p>
<p class="p10">The people here from our town are quite well Robert Hunter was here some few
                    weeks ago. he is well Drebbing was here he is well &amp;c Jack Harrison is
                        allright M Locke has been Married in Richmond</p>
<p class="p10">B Kilmer was married last spring in this neighborhood Robert Stewart I have seen
                    lately. his wound seems to trouble him some he is not doing duty now George
                    Schoppert &amp; family are still here &amp; well Jacob Light &amp;
                    family are here all well but him who is not so well now</p>
<p class="p10">Miss Ellie is quite well &amp; heard from her sister not long ago</p>
<p class="p10"><u>Sometime since I heard from you</u> Sister M- wrote me in
                        Dec- &amp; Feb Moses wants to know if I applied his fund<sup>s</sup> I
                    have not applied it<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> in property as none valuable can be gotten here
                    for less that 20 to 50 of old prices &amp; it is not desireable to invest in
                    it. I keep it so employed that in any event it will bring something. tell him I
                    will try &amp; take care of it for him at least &amp; if possible put it
                    in such fund<sup>s</sup> as he can use there as oppertunity offers which I think the best
                    investment for him</p>
<p class="p10">Tell him to say the same to J. Wilson for his. I will try &amp; save it for
                    them as best I can. good chances for investment here are rare Let me know if you
                    received all the drafts I sent you &amp; if you have collected them if not
                    collected try &amp; have them collected so soon as can Write &amp; let
                    me know the news</p>
<p class="p10">Michael Sincindever started home a few days ago to remain</p>
<p class="p10">I have not time to write more now remember me kindly to all friend<sup>s</sup> &amp; may god bless &amp; protect you &amp;
                    Our little ones</p>
