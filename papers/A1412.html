<p class="p10">July 22nd 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton V<sup>a</sup></p>
<p class="p10">To,<br> His Excellency, Gov:
                    Letcher</p>
<p class="p10">Company "A" 160 th Reg: V. M. was detailed to do guard duty, over
                    the public property, at this place, which was "Totally unprotected." We were
                    regularly mustered into the Service of the State, on the 29th of June (last) by
                    the order of Genl
                    R. S. Lee, we have been
                    and are now performing that duty. <i>[deleted: ever Since.]</i></p>
<p class="p10">When mustered into Service we numbered 110 men, but So many of them have been
                    detailed to work on armory work, our number has been reduced to about 50, which
                    throws Each man on guard duty twenty four out of forty Eight hours. The
                    necessity now <i>[added: for a guard]</i> is vastly greater
                    than when we were first called out.</p>
<p class="p10">I wish to Know if under the above Circumstances Your late proclamation relates to
                    my Company I am of opinion that my Company is exempt from draft and being called
                    away, believing that my Company which has been regularly mustered into Service,
                    and now on active duty, Cannot be drafted and Taken from their present position
                    to do duty in other portions of the State - I however deemed it best to address
                    you on the Subject, and in the event my Company are embraced in your Call, I
                    will have to make the necessary arrangements to have them relieved from their
                    present duty, So that they may prepare themselves to leave <i>[added: which]</i> it will require Some days, as we have no
                    equipments for a campaign whatever, and a greater portion of them poor men with
                    large families unprovided for -</p>
<p class="p10">Your immediate reply is Earnestly requested by your<br>
                        Obt
                        Sert.</p>
