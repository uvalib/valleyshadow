<p class="p10">Campt Near Fairfax C.H.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I have taken the presant opportunity of <i>[deleted: writing]</i> time, to write you a fiew lines for
                    the purpose of answering your last letter which I recieved a fiew days since. You wrote as if I was
                    trifling with your good nature. I would rather fall in the cause of our country
                    than to blindfold you in any way. You ware mistaken in
                    seeing a letter of mine to Miss Hiss as you stated. I recolect well at the last of my letter to her I had.- <u>from your</u> devoted friend and if you do'nt believe me I only ask you to look at it again none <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    but Sam Fitch new my motive in writing her that letter
                    it was for his benifit she had lost confidence in
                    him, on account of some lies that had been told on him about her. Shee wrote to me stating that I was in Sams
                    presance when he talked about her. She said that if
                    the things ware true she was done with Sam for ever. It
                    was all a lie that some of his enimies had
                        <i>[unclear: made]</i> on him, through Sams
                    persuasion I tried to write a forcible letter for I new
                    that Sam still loved her. &amp; I am sertain that
                    she once loved him. I suppose if she was my devoted lover I would have written
                    to her since wich I have never done. Very proberably this will <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> be hard to believe
                        put it is eaven so; your
                    advice is good but in no way. I do'nt think that I have
                    tried to fool any one &amp; God forbid that I should. I have had <i>[deleted: ]</i> blues ever since I recieved
                    <i>[illeg.]</i> letter. I used to think that <i>[illeg.]</i> nature was to strong to <i>[illeg.]</i> be subject unto grief but
                    alas it is far from it.</p>
<p class="p10">Thare are no news of importance to write. Our regament was on piket last
                    week. I could see the dome of the Capital in
                    Washington City on masons hill I could see vessels going up and down the Potomac
                    at Alexandria. I could see the Yankee fortifications to the right of Alexandria.
                    I couldent get to look through <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> the spy
                    glass. Capt said he could see the Yankees working
                    on the breastworks. Capt counted eighteen pieces of
                        canon on one of thare
                    earth work entrenchments. I was the first one to discover after <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    ware put on post a large balloon up in the direction of
                    Washington that had climed a large white oak tree for
                    the purpose of getting a good view of the country thare
                    was some shooting evry day that we ware
                    thare; we could hear the Yankee drumbs beating evry night the last two or
                    three days it was very rainy weather. We had blenty of
                        rosting ears while we ware at Pagets tavern thare was a large field
                    of Yankee corn close. We had to fall back about three miles before our time was
                    out as the Yankees ware advancing but I believe it was
                    done to draw them on. Nothing more but remain your affectionately. Write soon</p>
<p class="p10">yours &amp;c,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W.F.B.</i></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10"><br><br>[<i>page 1</i>]<br></p>My health is very good &amp; hope this
                        will find you enjoying the same blessing. It is my desire that this letter
                        should be kept secret as it might make enimies
                        someday. Write soon nothing more from your umble
                        friend W.F.B.</p>
