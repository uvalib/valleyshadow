<p class="p10">Hiram Thompson (cold) who lives near Fishersville in
                    Augusta Co. states that a General Long an officer in
                    the rebel army has in his possesion at or near Leesburg, Loudon Co.
                    Va. a Bay horse, (black leg, mane &amp; tail,
                    nearing 8 years old) which is the property of said Hiram Thompson and was stolen
                    from his stable during the war, by a Lieut.
                    Hunter of Rockbridge Co. and by him transfered to
                        Genl. Long in exchange for another horse.
                    Thompson claims to have information that his horse is not branded and was
                    claimed by Genl. Long as <i>[added: his]</i> private property when Gen. Lee's army surrendered. Thompson attempted to reclaim the horse
                    immediately after it was taken from his stable, but while he was seeking
                    evidence required, the command to which Lieut.
                    Hunter was attached left Staunton, taking off the horse. Thompson bean an excellent <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>character and reliable
                    neighbors say there will be no difficulty in identifying the horse which was
                    well known as a valuable animal of Morgan stock. I am further informed that the
                    horse was taken by Lt. Hunter without any
                    authority whatever and has never been known as a public animal. I have the honor
                    to request such enquiry be made as will restore the
                    horse to Hiram Thompson if above fact can be proved. </p>
