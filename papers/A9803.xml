                    <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>I hope my daughter sent you, according to my request, a copy of my sketch my
                    butler Jo, which appears in the <abbr expan="Valley">Val.</abbr>
                    <abbr expan="Journal">Jour.</abbr> of the 9<hi rend="super">th</hi>. It swarms
                    with very great typograhpical errors -- many of which you must have observed.
                    The greatest of them <del hand="h1">in</del> connects in changing <hi
                        rend="underline">foibles</hi> or the not horrible word <hi rend="underline"
                        >follies</hi> in the sentence; "Undoubtably he had his foibles &amp; his
                    faults" &amp;. I have requested Sandy to correct <hi rend="underline"
                    >that</hi> in his paper, &amp; and that alone out of a hundred, some of
                    which pervert my meaning.</p>
                <p>I have sent a clean copy to the <abbr expan="Richmond">Rich.</abbr> Whig, with
                    several additional paragraphs, &amp; and a number of smaller additions <add
                        hand="h1" place="inline">&amp; some vital changes</add> throughout the
                    piece. If it appears in the Whig, I would thank you to read it there (if you <hi
                        rend="underline">can</hi>) &amp; then give me your candid opinion of it
                        <hi rend="underline">as a delineation of Jo's character</hi>. I think it
                    paints the man to the life. If the coloring is rather warm, I agree with
                    Macaulay that the best portraits have something of caricature -- making up in
                        <unclear>impessureness</unclear> what they want in fidelity.</p>

                <p><pb n="2"/>Is any trait omitted? Is any thing awry? Please run your pen through
                    any <unclear>usage</unclear> &amp; word you think ought to be struck out,
                    &amp; write me any additions. I want to make the thing as perfect as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>I intend of course to send copies to our friends in California, &amp; if they
                    approve it, to submit the piece for De Bow's Review (De Bow having requested me
                    to write for it.)</p>
                <p>I would like to have Aunt Martha's opinion, having the highest respect for her
                    literary taste. Present her with my kind regards.</p>
                <p>I am sorry I did not retain the sketch to retouch at my leisure. I wrote it in
                    two days <hi rend="underline">currente calarro</hi>, &amp; I hurried off to
                    Garter. I had just <abbr expan="received">recd</abbr> a letter from Cornelia
                    giving me the particulars of Jo's last illness, &amp; enclosing a copy of
                    the proceedings of the San Francisco bank &amp;c. She returned from Europe
                    last spring. Her health is delicate but she thinks improving. I have
                    incorporated in my sketch nearly all the information she gave me. I do not know
                    what the surgical operation was, but I <hi rend="underline">guess</hi> it was
                    for the <hi rend="underline">piles</hi> -- an hereditary disease <pb n="3"/>in
                    our family -- I mean my father's. Pa is quite well for a man of 76.</p>
                <p>By the way, permit me to introduce to you Briscoe G. Baldwin the 3<hi
                        rend="super">d</hi>, a fine boy of mine, just a year old. Please introduce
                    him also to your family &amp; to Aunt Martha.</p>
                <p>I have only two children by my present wife -- both boys -- the oldest Charles
                    Cornelius Cyrus -- 7 1/2 years old.</p>
                <p>I hope to be in Staunton in a few weeks.</p>
                <p>Favor me with an early answer.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>Yours very truly</salute>

                    <seg type="postscript">P.S.: Among the typographical errors alluded to, let me
                        note the following: In speaking of my ever-revered mother -- the best human
                        being I ever knew -- I described her as <hi rend="underline">refined</hi> --
                        not <hi rend="underline">retired</hi> -- I said Jo's life was <hi
                            rend="underline">un</hi>eventful -- not eventful -- that his <hi
                            rend="underline">instincts</hi> were all chivalrous> &amp; -- not
                        his interests -- that he was fond of field events &amp; horse-racing --
                        not <hi rend="underline">some</hi> racing -- meaning racing horses along the
                        road -- that in conversation was well-<hi rend="underline">informed</hi> --
                        not well-expressed -- that his tales were all <hi rend="underline"
                        >natural</hi> -- not rational -- that there was no cant, bigotry, or
                        intolerance about him -- not <hi rend="underline">intemperance</hi>
                        &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c <lb/><pb n="4"/>Among the addenda in the
                        Whig, are these <unclear>thoughts</unclear>. <lb/>His sense of the
                        ridiculous was very keen, &amp;, when his blood was up, old Sam Kasm
                        himself could hardly excell him in sarcasm, ridicule, invective, and
                        denunciation. X X X <lb/>He was an original, adventurous, &amp; and
                        intrepid thinker, even to audacity -- I go on for ten or fifteen lines.
                        <lb/>His highest ambition was to be a chivalrous high-toned gentleman,
                        spotless &amp; reproachless; next and accomplished lawyer &amp;
                            a<del hand="h1">n</del>

                        writer &amp; speaker -- a backwoods Lord Broughkam as he would have
                        expressed it. We <add hand="h1" place="inline">are</add> inclined to think
                        that he would have preferred the jures intellectual
                        <unclear>sermon</unclear> of Marshall as <hi rend="underline">the</hi> great
                        Constitutional and philosophic jurist of America, even to the effulgent
                        glory which emblazons the name of Washington. <lb/>I beleive this is
                        strictly true. In all his letters to me he was a better lawyer than any
                        thing else &amp; that his highest ambition was to be a great jurist.
                        <lb/>I may show you some of these times portraits &amp;c drawn of you
                        &amp; Mr B in strong contrast in some respects. Neither of you had any
                        better friend in this world -- Excuse the trouble I give you.</seg>
