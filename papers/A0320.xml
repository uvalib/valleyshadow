 <salute>Dear Bob-</salute> 
 </opener> 
  
 <p>I fled from Clarke some three weeks ago, on the invasion of the Yankees,  
 Thinking that they intended a permanent occupancy of Winchester and our end of  
 the Valley.  I had intended leaving at any rate before Christmas, And they only  
 expedited my movements.  Before reaching the Army I heard of their departure  
 back to Harper's Ferry, but as I had parted with my family, I did not care to  
 return, and undergo the pain of another leave-taking so came direct to the Army  
 at Fredericksburg and have been at Gen. Stuart's <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>, and with Bro.  
 James since.  I am now with the latter, giving him what assistance I can in  
 arranging his papers.  The Brigade Q.M. having been absent for some time, Bro.  
 J. is acting as Brigade Q.M. Reed consequently has much to do and much bother  
 and trouble, I shall remain with him for the present and until something better  
 offers - I can be of much assistance - And some company and comfort to him.  All  
 of which he deserves for he has had rather a hard time since he has been ...</p> 
  
 <p><pb n="2"/>... I left the Yankees were there, and Bart's brothers absent  
 in Loudon, endeavoring to recover thirteen young horses, which they had stolen  
 from him a few days before - He was to have been married on the 9th Inst. but  
 perhaps the Yanks <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> him and his horses also.  I witnessed a portion of  
 the Battle last Saturday but as the papers have given you full details I need  
 add nothing to their account.  It was a most signal victory and the loss of  
 <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> - I rode over the right of the battleground  
 on Tuesday and the dead of the enemy were there laying in heaps - I counted  
 Eighty five in one pile unburied.  We do not hear in camp where Burnside now is.   
 There are various rumors--but none reliable - since the Battle we have moved  
 Camp and are now between Fr'burg and Port Royal, some Eight miles to the right  
 of Guineas Depot.</p> 
  
 <p>We manage to keep passably comfortable, getting our occasonal meals of  
 <unclear>Oysters</unclear> and plenty of Ginger cakes at 50c a piece.  The worst  
 of it is, <unclear>James'</unclear> servant has left<pb n="3"/> and we have  
 to do our own cooking - However, I find necessity - makes me a pretty good Cook.   
 I have managed to get up several very savory dinners.</p> 
  
 <p> If you can meet with any one coming to this Brigade, send us a Bale of good  
 smoking Tobacco.  We are entirely out.  It is getting cold, but there is an  
 abundance of wood, and the troops I think are generally comfortable - Write when  
 you receive this &amp; let us hear what is going on in Richmond.  Jim says he has  
 not heard from any of you since he left the Valley - </p> 
  
 <p> With much love to <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> and all -</p>
