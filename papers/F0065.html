                        <u>Dear</u>
                        <u>John</u>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 16<sup>th</sup> came to hand this morning, and found us
                    all well. We have been under arms all day in expectation of meeting Gen Stewart, who is on this side of the Rappahannock
                    with a considerable Cavalry force. I suppose he wants to give us a <u>set</u>-<u>off</u> to Kilpatricks
                    recent trip to Richmond. Should he come any way near us he will find this a warm
                    climate.</p>
<p class="p10">If you think it better that that matter respecting the property should rest a
                    little while I am perfectly satisfied. In my letter to Father I told him what I
                    intended doing<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">Your letter, also one received from <i>[deleted: Mary]</i> Tillie, speak about
                    little <u>sis</u> being unwell. What little <u>sis</u> do you refer to. Is there a member of the family
                    that I have heard nothing of? and if so what might be its age, name etc. and to
                    whom does it belong?</p>
<p class="p10">Your enquiry as to a <u>substitute</u>
                    <u>Veteran</u>. Could the arrangement your mention be made?
                    If so, I will keep a look out. Had you mentioned the matter six or eight weeks
                    ago when the Veterans out of our Regt.
                    re-enlisted, I might have made arrangements with a couple of them. At present,
                    there are none in the 9<sup>th</sup> re-enlisting. We only had about
                    twenty-five or six in the first place.</p>
