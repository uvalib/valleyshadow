<salute>Dear Sir</salute> 
</opener> 

<p>We are this morning to lose one of our teachers Miss Dewey as you are aware that the time is up at which she is relieved by your approval my "Report" informs you how her place is to be filled and I have nothing to write concerning that, but as she is not in very good grace with Mr Tukeys family, I fear her very sanguine temperament may lead her to speak with less credit of them than is deserving perhaps presenting facts from her own stand point in such<pb n="2"/> <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del></p>
<p>I am confident that I have been misrepresented to her intended husband Mayor How Ex Supt of Bureau, and the influence of which misrepresentation has not worked favorably in school so far as it has been felt, though it has amounted to but little</p>
	<p>She has been faithful in school but a greater willingness on her part to conform to what seemed to others and myself to be proper measures would have saved me from the trouble of once or twice insisting on a conformity to them which might look like an arbitrary exercise.  This same Sanguine and rather willful temperament has made it<pb n="3"/> difficult for <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> counsel as much <del rend="none" hand="h1"></del> done of others especialy even aged experienced and amiable Miss Williams who has been particularly useful to me in advising.  I would say for Maj. How that I think him naturally a fair and good man when not hoodwinked.  A remark was made a few days ago that led me to think perhaps a letter of this kind might be proper as a meanse of forestalling bad impressions</p>
	<p>I might send you further explanations showing more fully the cause of my writing this note but do not think it best or necessary</p>

<salute>Respectfully</salute>
