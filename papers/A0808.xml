                <p> I have been for some time <orig reg="intending">intended</orig> to write you,
                    but pressing times have prevented my doing so. For a wonder I am quiet this
                    morning with nothing but the usual camp duties to perform. </p>

                <p>Tom is well, tell his Mother that I have been very much &amp; <orig
                        reg="agreeably">agreably</orig>
                    <orig reg="disappointed">disapointed</orig> with him. When he left Staunton with
                    me I though he would be hard to manage &amp; in truth I thought him little
                    or no account. But I have found him not only <orig reg="useful">usefull</orig>,
                    generous and Brave to a fault, But I have found in him a pious regard for the
                    truth, His word when given never <orig reg="broken">braken</orig>, a disposition
                    and temper rarely if ever muffled, and for one of his age a Boy that any one
                    might be proud to call their son. In the Ardous &amp; hotly contested fields
                    we have operated on. He has <orig reg="always">allways</orig> been at his Post.
                    And at Brandy Manasas &amp; Poulsville my heart <pb n="2" entity="garb8b" pid="uva-lib:503032"/>
                     beat with pride, when I saw the flag of my Regiment
                    ever in front &amp; borne proudly in the hottest of the fight by him. Say to
                    his Mother that I will care for him as I would <del hand="h1">&amp;
                    will</del> for one of my Boys if they were old enough to fight for their <orig
                        reg="country's">Countrys</orig> freedom. I have made no request of Tom, but
                    that is has been readily granted. He has thrown aside whiskey smoking &amp;
                    tobacco, and I think is trying very hard to be all that you &amp; his Mother
                    would desire him to be. I have not written this to flatter him, but as a just
                    tribute to a good &amp; gallant Boy. My kindest Love to Aunt Mary Jane Addy
                    &amp; the Children By the way the Boys tell me Addy &amp; Gen. Thomson
                    are about making a match, tell Addy she must wait <orig reg="until"
                    >unttil</orig> Tom &amp; me can come Home, to enjoy the fun &amp; good
                    things. Cousin Jimmy shall give her a big fuss. Good bye.</p>
