<p class="p10">Dear Brother</p>
<p class="p10">I take my pen to drop a few lines leaving you know that ive sent fifteen dollars to day which you will
                    receive of Thomas Holland i have received no answer yet from my last We
                    evacuated James Island on the second of this month for what purpose i know not
                    we took the rebels plan of Manassas Junction of placing wooden cannon on our
                    entrenchments to fool them we had rough work up there Regt is all together Just
                    now it only numbers six hundred a great<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> many have been discharged
                    upon acount of being Sick there were only about three
                    killed and five wounded of our Regt the weather is very hot but i can stand the
                    heat as well almost as some of the Georgia darkies but i could take a drink of
                    Pennsylvania water once again and i would not mind to take a little Old Rye with
                    it it is a scarce article down here i guess you heard the particulars of our
                    battles the troops are all on the move i do not know whether our Regt will be
                    kept for to garrison this Island or not i would just as soon remain here untill the cool weather because it is very disagreable on board of a Steam boat when it is so
                        hot<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> I do not like to ride on a Steam boat the way they pack
                    soldiers like a parcel of hogs i would like to get to Penna in time to hang Some rabbits in the fall but i guess i will
                    have to wait untill next fall or the fall after if you
                    have not received what i sent before then you will receive thirty dollars of
                    Thomas Holland we are expecting a mail boat in every minute but there is nothing
                    coming but Schooners and gun boats no more at presant
                    but remain Your affectionate brother </p>
