<p class="p10">Dear wife</p>
<p class="p10"> I seat my self to in form am still injoying good health and wishing when this may reach you it will find
     you injoying the same blessing that our god has bestowed upon me. I
     received your letter yesterday eavening which was dated the 2nd. I
     was glad to heare  that you all was well and hearty but i was sorry to
      heare that you was disappointed in my [not] coming home but I thought
     it best to tell you the truthe. I dont see
     any chance of a well man to get away from heare
     with out
     runing off and I dont like to do that
     without a good cause but if sickness get in our family I will strain all the nerves I have I
     will raise the blockades and come home let the consequences be what it may or will try but if
     it is so that I dont get home you must trust in providence. I think
     you will have some neighbours that will give you and you nead not be oneasy about me volunteering before i
     see you and the children thats one thing sertain. conserning the barger business I have riten
     to you the first of October so I thought you new that we oad [owed] him. their has bin
     severle letters I sent that I received no answers. I sent some money
     to you with J. Skeles [Skyles] when he was heare last $21 it was. I
     sent 2 other letters one by mail one by F.J. Sheats. rite whether you
     received them or not. we have had some too or three very coald
     wether snowing and sleating raining as usual. Smith Jones wants some
     20 bushels of corn. he said they would pay the money down when they take it away but i think it
     best for to get the money first as you no him as well as I do. if you
     have the corn to spair
     rite me and if he pays me i will rite to you
     for he said he would pay when we draw a gain. it is dew us now but its uncertain when we get it.</p>
<p class="p10">So no more at preasent but remain yours until seperated by death</p>
