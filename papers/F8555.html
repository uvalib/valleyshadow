<h4>Franklin County: W. H. Buehler to Edward McPherson,
                    January 2, 1860<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In a passionate letter to Edward McPherson, W. H. Buehler advises McPherson (and
                    Republicans) to adhere to the Chicago Platform. Buehler also mentions Sherman's
                    Rice Proposal and the possible secession of Southern states.</p>

                    Hon.
                        E. McPherson:
                </b><br></p>

<p class="p10">Jan. 2, 1860</p>
<p class="p10">Gettysburg</p>
<p class="p10">My dear friend --</p>
<p class="p10">I often think of you, and sympathize with you, in the trying position which, in
                    common with others, you occupy at Washington. You have opportunities,- which, of
                    course, we have not, of knowing the sentiments <i>[added: of]</i> your entire district; but I thoughts a word with reference to the
                    feelings of your immediate friends and constituents here; in regard to the
                    various propositions for adjusting the difficulties which now threaten such
                    serious consequences <i>[added: would not be unacceptable.]</i>
                    <u>
                        <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    </u> upon the part of Republicans, <u>we all agree in
                        thinking</u>, is essential just now; but you can be <u>generous</u> with all. Any sacrifice which does not involve our essential
                    principle of the Chicago Platform, we can cheerfully submit to,- but for
                    Heaven's sake, don't give us the Missouri Compromise, <u>as
                        proposed</u>. The proposition, known as the <u>Rice</u>
                    proposition, <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    <i>[illeg.]</i>, I believe, to the mode suggested by G Sherman, in some respects -- would give universal satisfaction here.
                    If the border States could only be harmonized by some reasonable adjustments,
                    the Government, in its intercourse with the Seceeding States, might exhibit its power, and enable us to realize that
                    we have a government.</p>
<p class="p10">You know that we have as despicable Locofocos here, as can be found anywhere.
                    Well, even Adams Co. democracy is becoming <u>patriotic</u> -- and evidences it by curses -- loud and
                    deep -- of Buchanan Poor Fellow! Is he really so weak? -- or is it wickedness in
                    the the old <i>[unclear: Rascal]</i>?</p>
<p class="p10">I had a letter to-day from <u>Morris</u>. He wants me to run down to Baltimore and go with him to
                    Washington; but it is out of my power You know John is a decided democrat. I have confidence in his opinion of the
                    People of Balt., and <u>he</u>
                    says that the feeling against the Southern <i>[illeg.]</i> is about unanimous
                    in Maryland. I hope you <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>will not consider me impertinent in writing
                    you this. I write not to advise you, but to give you evidence of my sympathy in
                    the dark <i>[illeg.]</i> which is before us all, and to express the earnest
                    hope that some way may be found by which our country may be extricated from the
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> which beset <i>[added: it]</i> -- some
                    way <u>not dishonorable to the North</u></p>
<p class="p10">Sincerely your friend</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W. H. Buehler</i></p>
