<p class="p10">Monday, May 26<sup>th</sup> 1862</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">My Dr. Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I wrote you a brief note, yesterday, telling you of our victories and that I was well, and
     this evening I will write you more fully, after a day of enjoyment in which I wish you could
     have participated &amp; enjoyed some of the good things they left behind in their hasty
     retreat -- delicacies of every kind, in getting up which the Yankee nation seems to have
     surpassed itself -- But to begin, I will not say at the beginning for that would embrace thirty
     days -- but after the battle of Kernstown, on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of March, and
     briefly relate the movements by which we got Winchester and drove the haughty &amp;
     insolent foe back from our Valley -- From the 23<sup>rd</sup> of March to the 18<sup>th</sup> of April we slowly retired before the superior numbers of the enemy,
     resisting his <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> advance at every favorable spot, and only moving back when he came on
     in force, and, finally, when we reached Harrisonburg, by leaving the main road and throwing
     ourselves into a defensible mountain pass near to the forces of Gen. Ewell, we prevented the
     advance of Banks upon Staunton &amp; put ourselves in a position where our movements could
     be concealed, we were there until the 30<sup>th</sup> of April, showing resistance
     down the river, below us &amp; also towards the enemy's front at Harrisonburg, completely
      <i>[unclear: puzzing]</i> everyone in regard to our movements, on the 30<sup>th</sup> Gen. Ewell &amp; his army moved up to Conrad's store and we moved off to Port
     Republic, the force at Conrad's Store being still about the same, so Banks thought it was all
     there still, then on the 3rd of May we crossed over the Blue Ridge, and Banks heard that we had
     gone to Richmond, but the force still there i.e. at Conrad's <i>[unclear: puzzed]</i> him the
     more <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> then we rapidly crossed back to Staunton and on to North Mountain &amp;
     pushed back the forces of Milroy &amp; fought the bloody battle of Bull Pasture Mountain
     &amp; drove Milroy, demoralized, back to Franklin &amp; by leaving the Valley made
     Banks think we had run away from him to carry on the war in Western Va, then he moved back to
     New Market for fear we wd. fall on his flank, but let Shields go
     away to Fredericksburg to join McDowell, supposing, no doubt, that Jackson was too far off to
     get back soon to his front, but was completely deluded by the appearance of Cavalry all along
     the Mt. coming to the conclusion that Jackson was at Brock's Gap, Jackson having, by the move
     westward, divided Bank's forces, at once moved rapidly to New Market and making a demonstration
     towards Wood-<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>stock as if he intended to go that way, he suddenly sent the forces of
     Gen. Ewell, which had been concealed by the movements of Cavalry, towards Front Royal, preceded
     by a large body of Cavalry, which place they reached on Friday and by a sudden attack drove out
     the forces of the enemy there, captured a large amount of valuable stores, about 1000
     prisoners, two locomotives and trains of cars, the stores worth from one to two hundred
     thousand dollars. The regiment that made the attack on our side was the First Maryland, and the
     one that it attacked was the 1<sup>st</sup> Yankee Maryland, neighbor against
     neighbor, ours took the flag of the other &amp; then the Louisiana Tigers joined in the
     pursuit and followed them so closely that they could not burn the bridge behind them though
     they got it on fire, and when some attempted to escape on the train to Strasburg the found that Ashby had been sent across the country to our left and <br><br>[<i>page 5</i>]<br> had after a hot engagement, in which Capts. Shotts, Fletcher &amp; other gallant
     men of ours were killed, drove away the force of the enemy at Buckton Station, between Front
     Royal and Strasburg and torn up the track and cut the wire before the attack at Front Royal, so
     when the train ran up that way it found the track up and came back to find us hotly pressing
     behind, so there was no alternative but to flee towards Newtown, 14 miles distant, which began
     at about 6 P.M. and then the splendid cavalry Regiments, two, some 1000 men under the command
     of Gen. Steuart, charged after them like a whirlwind, capturing wagon after wagon, loaded with
     valuable baggage ammunition, them horses that had been cut loose and
     squad after squad &amp; company after company of men, officers &amp; all, until some
     wearied out by the hot pursuit, halted behind a fence and build<br><br>[<i>page 6</i>]<br>ings, and, in the
     darkness, poured a deadly volley into our men, but, though some 10 or 12 were killed or badly
     wounded, there was no halt, but with uplifted sabres our men rushed upon the ambuscaders, over
     the fences, and scattered them to the four winds, causing many of them to bite the dust, and
     inflicting horrible wounds upon others, there a perfect stampede of them occurred in every
     direction, seeking to escape from the dreaded "horse &amp; his rider", but in vain, and
     hundreds of them were captured that night and the next morning they were brought in from all
     sides by men women &amp; even servants, (what few were left, for many preceded them in
     their flight and we captured many of them.) The spoils were large embracing 2 pieces of
     artillery and about 800 stand of arms -- all the field and staff officers were taken -- We
     desisted from the pursuit and rested after <br><br>[<i>page 7</i>]<br> midnight, but at an early hour the next
     morning, the 24<sup>th</sup>, the forces were in motion, moving on the road as if
     going to Newtown, but about 11 o'clk the Gen. started me on the
     road towards Middletown and Strasburg to find where the enemy was, I soon started up a picket,
     that fired into us, (some 20 Cavalry and myself), which I reported to the Gen. and he sent up
     some infantry of the 8<sup>th</sup>La. Regt
     to aid me, which we threw out as skirmishers and pushed on through the woods, and drove to the
      enemys picket, and found that they must have a force in that
     direction, the Gen. then sent up Col. Ashby with cavalry and flying artillery and we moved them
     up rapidly, reaching to near the McAdamized Road, when we discovered a body of Cavalry massed
     before a church in Middletown, and saw their trains moving up the road, previously we were
     informed by the Gen. that Gen. Ewell had gone to near Newtown with <br><br>[<i>page 8</i>]<br> with a portion
     of the army, thus protecting our right flank -- as soon as the shell fell away the Yankee
     cavalry they began a stampede, and as there was a Regt of some
     700 hundred they filled the road for some distance, the companies of the 8 La. moved promply forward and just gained
     the crest of a low ridge, along one side of which the road ran, as the cavalry passed, and
     poured into them a deadly volley, and such a tumbling of men and horses, as the General
     afterwards remarked, "it looked too bad to see so many of them disposed of at once", the
     artillery was at once brought up and thundered on the retreating line and Ashby and his cavalry
     dashed rapidly forward to a turn in the road and cut off those still going on, and captured the
     train of several regiments, any number of sutler's wagons, loaded with every luxury, and
     hundreds of men <br><br>[<i>page 9</i>]<br> and <i>[unclear: richly]</i>
     <i>[illeg.]</i> horses -- the pride of the Yankee army, it's superbly
     mounted Vermont, N.Y. &amp; Pa. Cavalry, that had
     exultingly and insolently rode over our Valley, was melted like snow before the sun, and the
     road, for miles, strewn with the choicest of viands &amp; most valuable of goods. I am not
     vindictive, but I really did not feel sorry to see the horse &amp; his insolent rider laid
     low, it seemed a just retribution for the evils they had inflicted on an innocent people.</p>
<p class="p10"> We had by this move cut off the rear guard, two regiments, of the enemy at Strasburg, and we
     turned towards them, when they set the bridge on fire, across Cedar Creek, set fire to their
     stores in Strasburg, and then commenced throwing shells at us, but we soon stopped them and
     they started in flight, but we could not cross to pursue them, so we could only drive the from
     their <br><br>[<i>page 10</i>]<br> baggage a distance, and then start, at about 5 P.M. with our whole force,
     save one Regiment, towards Winchester, and lustily did the Regiments from that part of the
     state cheer when they were ordered towards their homes, then commenced one of the movements in
     which Gen. Jackson shows forth his iron will, he wished to reach Winchester, on the hills West
     of it, before the next morning, and he was now 12 miles off, after a march of 12 miles, and it
     soon became evident that the foe intended to dispute his progress, for they began, soon, a
     heavy fire of artillery at our advance, from every hill top, made a stand near Newtown and drew
     up in line of battle trying to turn our flank, but we drove them from that at about dark,
     capturing many more wagons, then they began to burn up their train, loads of every thing, rice,
     sugar, bacon &amp;c, and 6 long boats intended for <br><br>[<i>page 11</i>]<br> a pontoon bridge and, by
     the light of these, they fought us with desperation for miles ambuscaded and fired upon our men
     from behind walls and from thickets, but still Jackson's iron will was bent on attaining a
     certain point and he rooted them from every strong hold, resting not through the long and wery night, driving them across the bloody field of Kernstown and, early on
     the morning of the 25<sup>th</sup> he drove them from the hills before Winchester,
     and aided by Ewell on his right, who had moved along in that position, he poured a deadly fire
     into them, and when Banks attempted to retake the hills he met such a storm of leaden hail from
     the "Stonewall Brigade and our other gallant troops that, though he fought well, and we even
     ordered up reinforcements, at that moment the intrepid leader, in front, amid the roar of
     musketry and artillery, devoutly raised his hands <br><br>[<i>page 12</i>]<br> to heaven, as if for Divine aid,
     when the enemy's line wavered, fell back, and fled, "now" says the General, "swinging his plain
     grey cap, Let's shout, and at his shout up went that of the host with him and all dashed
     forward in pursuit, the day was won, and through the streets of Winchester we pursued the foe
     that had gloried in its pride and power but two short days before, amid the huzzas, shouts,
     tears, thanks, looks of unutterable delight, waving of Confederate flags &amp;
     handkerchiefs of its whole liberated population and <u>by</u> the crackling
     of the flames where the vandal foe had set on fire the very center of the town where his stores
     were, piles of shells that would have blown the town to atoms, it was a proud entry, and
     through we went, the sons of Winchester in the lead deling death to
     the foe at every corner and when we reached the other <br><br>[<i>page 13</i>]<br> side of the town, the
     General, now thoroughly aroused, turned and said "Order the whole army to press on to the
     Potomac," and on it came, and on sped the foe and after them we hurled shot, shell and iron
     hail, for miles, until the General ordered our men to halt, and the cavalry to be brought up to
     pursue, he then turned to go back to meet the cavalry, passing along through our 3 united
     armies, who had had eagerly sought the ordered rest after 40 hours of exeration, but they felt not the labors they had endured for <u>all</u> even the dullest, now was the consummation of the long marches, the short rations,
     the sleepless nights, interdicted furloughs -- victory had come from them, and as the hero of
     it turned back there was one shout of triumph, one spring up, one waving of hats from one end
     of the long line to the other, all murmurs were hushed, and "Old Jack" was the greatest of
     warriors to them and the idol of the hour's affections <br><br>[<i>page 14</i>]<br> We pursued the enemy with
     Cavalry 22 miles beyond Winchester and have captured in all over 2000, over 200 wagons with
     horses &amp; harness, a vast store of medicines &amp; hospital supplies, more I suppose
     than we had in the whole Confederacy, a large amount of valuable ammunition &amp;c
     &amp;c and sent Banks and his proud army in confusion and dismay across the Potomac and
     where we go now will be for our own choosing We destroyed the B.&amp; O. R.R. at Martinsburg and captured
     more stores there than here, large stocks of provisions &amp;c.</p>

     desire. Love to all. </p>
