<p class="p10">3rd June 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Dear John</p>
<p class="p10">I send you the shirts as per Your Order. Your letter was received in due time and
                    it was read with much pleasure. I glad to see that you are well satisfied and
                    enjoying the luxuries of the land or at least a part. Henry arrived safe home on
                    last Thursday from Richmond he <i>[unclear: start]</i> back this morning for
                    the same place he says he has an appointment in the provisional army of Virginia
                    or he says he will in all probability take an office in the Wise Legion. The
                    West Augusta G. I suppose treated Henry badly - how
                    is the company getting along now. With the absence of Henry &amp; Baylor -
                    Baylor will accept the <i>[unclear: mayorship]</i> - we have had quite an
                    exciting time in town for a week past. We have two or three suspicious
                    characters <i>[unclear: lodged]</i> in Jail. They are thought to be spys. I don't know what will be done with them. We had a
                    fire here onlast Monday Evening about 4 oclock Old <i>[unclear: Ma
                    Shumates]</i> stable caught &amp; Burnt to the ground the wind was
                    blowing a perfect torrent and several other houses caught from the Stable, but
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> they we all put out. but considerable damage done to the
                    property &amp; furniture.</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Boy. I am almost worn out - the old Militia have been ordered out in some
                    of the Western Counties the next pass old <i>[unclear: Letcher]</i> makes it
                    will take all, &amp; then we'll all go to Dixie land together. Several of
                    the Boys is going down and they will tell you all the news. I have several other
                    letters to write to night and it is now late, so I must close with the hope
                    seeing you ere long Write soon</p>
<p class="p10">Your friend,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>G. J. Dalius</i></p>
<p class="p10">My regards to all the Boys.<br><br>P.S. I wish you
                        would see John Bucker and ask him what he did with the Bundle he carried
                        down for Sandy Cochran tell him to hand it over to Geo. M Cochran</p>
