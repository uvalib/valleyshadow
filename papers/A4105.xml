    </opener>

    <p>I wrote to you a few days ago -- the evening before we started <orig reg="down">dow</orig>
     the Valley -- I now write again from the same old camp -- We went down to Newtown -- drove the
     Yankee Cavalry away from Middletown -- found them fortified at Newtown -- made some
     demonstrations -- Our Cavalry on the "Back Road" -- three regiments -- were attacked by <orig
      reg="Custer's">Custers</orig> Division of the Yankee Cavalry &amp; driven back several
     miles -- we then brought up the rest of Rosser's Division &amp; fell on the flank of the
     Yankee Div. &amp; routed it &amp; drove it over 3 miles, scattering it in every
     direction &amp; capturing over 200 prisoners &amp; holding our first position -- in the
     meantime another body of Yankee Cavalry attacked McCausland's Brigade of Cavalry at Cedarville,
     in the Front Royal Road &amp; he drove them back, they came again &amp; he drove them
     back &amp; supposing they would not come on again he was grazing his horses, when they got
     reinforced &amp; came on again &amp; found him unprepared &amp; drove him back
     several miles &amp; got 2 pieces of artillery from <pb n="2"/>him -- he lost about 100 men
     -- all told we skirmished some with the Yankees on Saturday then fell back that night to
     Fisher's Hill, then came back here yesterday -- We went to find whether Sheridan was still in
     the Lower Valley &amp; found him with his whole force &amp; strongly entrenched - we
     got the late papers &amp; found that Lincoln was elected -- by a large majority -- the
     Yankees are rebuilding the Winchester <abbr expan="Railroad">R. R.</abbr> &amp; fixing to
     have winter uqarters in the Lower Valley -- . I got chance to sketch the line of battle
     &amp;c at Cedar Creek William came to me at Fisher's Hill - got back here when I expected
     -- I got your letter, &amp; Maj. <orig reg="Bell's">Bells</orig> about Green's baggage, but
     found no letter from Mrs. Butcher in the coat pocket -- you certainly did not put it in -- send
     it to me &amp; I will attend to it -- her funds were not lost by the burning of the bank's
     money. Col. Smith has come up here as Chief Engineer of the Army -- just the news I want here
     &amp; he tells me that the <abbr expan="Chief Engineer">Chf. Eng.</abbr> will give me the
     highest civil <pb n="3"/>appointment in his power &amp; a salary of $4000 a year -- he
     cannot commission me because I am from Virginia -- they all make such a fuss about appointments
     from Virginia -- that will be better than I expected &amp; I shall be very much gratified
     by it -- &amp; hope soon to get the appointment -- say nothing about it -- I am glad you
     got <hi rend="underline">some</hi> wood &amp; hope you will have enough until I can get you
     more -- I suppose our winter quarters will be some where in Rockingham -- if so I shall get
     mine at or near home -- at least in Staunton -- won't that be good -- then I can get home at
     least once a week -- hope you are not going to have the rheumatism. I can let you have my two
     smaller flannels (shirts) as I have two others in my box in Staunton &amp; you had better
     use them -- Mr. R's things were all right -- I sent you $20. in my last. I send you $20. in
     this also. -- &amp; I will try &amp; supply your wants -- the <abbr
      expan="Quarter Master">Q M.</abbr> has no money now or I <pb n="4"/>would send a larger amount
     -- but will keep sending -- You say you got your 4<hi rend="underline">
      <hi rend="super">th</hi>
     </hi> bbl. of flour -- &amp; do not see where the 5<hi rend="underline">
      <hi rend="super">th</hi>
     </hi> is to come from -- I engaged from Sieg Trimble, Hanger, &amp; Geeding &amp; you
     got one from Smith through Glossbrenner I thought -- that makes <hi rend="underline">5.</hi> I
     want to provide for being at home some during the winter -- Mr. Seig is also to have some
     potatoes for us -- I sent to <abbr expan="Maryland">Md.</abbr> for the articles Miss Kate wants
     -- Put me up some pickles &amp; things &amp; buy some apple butter if you can if you
     have none to spare. I shall be after my meds chest again in due time -- I shall not draw on
     your resources though as heretofore -- things are too scarce -- but then your storehouse always
     seems to yield something -- &amp; I have unbounded faith in it -- It has been bitter cold
     &amp; I found my blanket a great comfort I tell you -- The <hi rend="underline">new</hi>
     coat fits <hi rend="underline">finely</hi> -- only I did not mean to have it sent here -- Many
     thanks for the chestnuts to Nelly and Anne &amp; the 3 apples -- Heaven bless you all I am
     glad your pest is gone -- All things "work together for good" Write <hi rend="underline"
     >soon</hi>
