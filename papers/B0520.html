<p class="p10">I have the honor to state that there is a house on New Street, near the building
                    used as Commissary Storehouse, which I am informed was owned by James Campbell,
                    colored, who went North and returned to find his house confiscated by the
                    so-called Confederate Government, by whom it was sold to Mr. William Stevenson
                    of this place.</p>
<p class="p10">I respectfully ask an investigation to establish the facts in the case, and if
                    they prove to be as stated, I request that the property may be seized and turned
                    over to me for restoration to the owner, who is not now here.</p>
