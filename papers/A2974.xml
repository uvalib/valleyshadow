                    degree of sadness now I have taken your letter before me, for the purpose of

                    subject. Now believe me I am going to try to write what my heart shall dictate.
                    You are well aware I once loved you devotedly yes passionately up to the time of

                    that I changed, I withdrew my affections at a time when I thought all was lost
                    that was dear to me. Oftimes since then I have tried to be the same loving

                    its desired effect. Alas you will say Willie will soon be a ruined youth it may
                    be so, but I hope to the contrary I am certain the intoxicating cup shall never
