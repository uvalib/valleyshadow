<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Huff, the Justice of the Peace in Churchville, details what he knows about a
                    dispute between a Mary Minor and a Mr. Coleman. He describes Minor's personal
                    situation, as well as her demeanor, characterizing her as a woman "of high

<p class="p10">June 14th, 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Churchville, Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">I received your note of the 22nd Dec. 1867 on last
                    evening 13th instant. Mary Minor came to me and made a statement of the threat
                    that Mr. Coleman had made, which was a breach of the peace. I told her if she
                    made oath to her complaint I would give her a warrant and have Coleman arrested.
                    she declared she would swear to nothing and got very angry and went off. I have
                    not heard of it till I received your note. Mary Minor has always claimed to be
                    an Indian. She was free born &amp; some twenty years ago took up with a
                    black Negro who was free born and having been living together since She is a
                    woman of very high temper lives close to the public Ward &amp; has several
                    times gathered up stones &amp; threatened to knock persons brains out. I
                    have been told that she stopped Coleman in the public road and threatened <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> him &amp; he told her if she struck him he would shoot her, her
                    husband has since told me he did not wish her to have any warrant &amp; told
                    her not to stop Coleman.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours with Respect</p>
