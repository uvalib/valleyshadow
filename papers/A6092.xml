    <p>I will endeavor this evening to write you a few lines to let you know that I am still in
     Staunton and will probably be here for a week or two yet as the Doctor told me this morning
     that I might not get well enough for service until the weather got warmer<lb/> I would have
     tried to get home again when I came here But the Ward Master told me that there was no use to
     try as the Surgeon had Just received orders to grant no more leaves of absence. I have seen Dr
     Baldwin since: he spoke very kindly to me and asked if my trip home had done me any good; I
     told him it had, Well he says I am glad of it. but cant let you go back again. I have a very
     good room to stay in the same one I was in when Pa was down I seen Davy Hanger since I came
     back he has gone along with part of his detail and a couple of companys from Staunton to the
     South mountain to gather up some deserters they have not all come back yet But some of them
     have come back bringing with<pb n="2" entity="Smiley62b" pid="uva-lib:503255"/>
      them five or six of the deserters I did not learn the names of any
     of them but understood that one of them was a preachers son who I suppose was a Rankin. There
     was two regiments came up yesterday on the cars the twenty fifth &amp; thirty first
     Virginia they are on their way to join Imbodens command I seen Captain Stuart he says <orig
      reg="everything">every thing</orig> is quiet at <orig reg="Fredericksburg"
     >Fredericsburg</orig> our men are Still in the same <unclear>old</unclear> camp. </p>
