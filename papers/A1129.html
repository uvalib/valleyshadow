<h4>Augusta County: Malcolm Fleming to Fleming's mother, August 10,
     1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In this letter, Fleming discusses recent orders, recounts the burning of Chambersburg, tells
     of recent battle experience, reviews strategy, mentions life in camp, and describes the
     experience of being captured by "Yankees," after having been turned in by "the negroes."
     Fleming also writes about encounters with local citizens. Unfortunately, the letter has a large
     number of illegible words and sections. Nearly everything after the first few paragraphs should
     be considered "unclear."</p>

<p class="p10">My dear Mother-</p>
<p class="p10">It has been a long time since I have had an opportunity of writing to you; &amp; now that
     our <i>[unclear: prefent]</i>
     <i>[unclear: myself]</i> of sending a letter to <i>[unclear: this]</i> mail, I have time to
     write only a line - Give to me before this doubtless heard all the particulars of our Maryland
     &amp; Penn; last, the burning of Chambersburg &amp;c - To give
     an abstract account of all our adventures meant consuming more time &amp; paper than I have
     to spare. <i>[unclear: Nothing]</i> exaggerated can be fair about the burning of Chambersburg
     - we we who did not <i>[unclear: fire]</i> it could form an approximate idea of the horrors
      <i>[illeg.]</i> this occasion. I <i>[unclear: intend]</i> this Town (&amp; a beautiful
     place it is) <i>[unclear: with]</i> a<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> stiff nect &amp; stubborn

<p class="p10">Gen<sup>l</sup>
     <i>[unclear: McCausland]</i> commanded his two Brigades (his own &amp; Gen<sup>
       <u>l</u>
      </sup> Johnson's)- His orders from Gen<sup>
       <u>l</u>
      </sup> Early were to buy a tribute of one hundred thousand dollars in gold or its
     equivalent in Northern funds ($500,000) which money was to be paid to Gov. Letcher _Alex Butler
     &amp; owing to <i>[unclear: indig]</i>nify <i>[illeg.]</i> for the losses
     <i>[unclear: Nety]</i> had sustained at the hands of the Yankees.</p>
<p class="p10">The citizens regarded this as an ample threat &amp; <i>[unclear: favorably]</i> refused
     to pay the tribute <i>[unclear: voluntarily]</i>
     <i>[unclear: Mc'Causland]</i> at once ordered the city to be laid in ashes. The scene which
     followed baffles all description. Shrieking children &amp; panic stricken men &amp;
     women running<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> In <i>[unclear: every]</i>

<p class="p10">The most <i>[unclear: objectionable]</i>

      <i>[unclear: appeared]</i> to hope that proper to <i>[illeg.]</i> this be in <i>[deleted: ]</i> into <i>[illeg.]</i>

      <i>[illeg.]</i> march broken <i>[unclear: down]</i> to follow us. In this we <i>[illeg.]</i>
     <i>[unclear: enemy]</i> made mistakes. By making forced marches they came before us
      <i>[unclear: any]</i> unexpectedly in the morning of the 7<sup>
      <u>th</u>
     </sup> about light. Our pickets were captured &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> meeting with any
     opposition. The Yankees charged <i>[illeg.]</i>iple our Camp. So great was the surprise that
     many men were aroused from their slumbers slumbers by the demand to surrender. <i>[unclear: Gen<sup>

     <i>[unclear: Johnston]</i> &amp; myself were sleeping in the same room, luckily for him he
     slept in his clothes. even with this <i>[unclear: start]</i> of <i>[unclear: me]</i> he would
     not have escaped had not one of the men sacrificed himself by giving the Gen<sup>

     concealed ourselves behind some barrels. Before <i>[illeg.]</i> going to my hiding place I
     handed my watch to the lady of the house. It was very well that I did for I had not been long
     in the game before I heard the <i>[unclear: hiss]</i>ing of sabers upon his steps. the negroes
     informed on us. In a few moments more we were Surrounded by about fiften (15) fiends &amp;
     their pistols pointed at our breasts. They first demanded my pocket book containing
      <i>[unclear: more]</i> Six hundred dollars. Some little gold I had bought &amp; my gold
