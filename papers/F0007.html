<p class="p10">Dear Wife </p>
<p class="p10">This is quite a wet morning. Keeps us in our tents, but we are comfortable. Have
                    had a very good breakfast. You say that you want me to come home so bad that you
                        cant stand it much longer &amp; again you ask
                    me why I dont try to get to be Assisstant Surgeon. These two questions depend one on the other dear
                    wife. While in my tent listening to the pattering rain the greatest pleasure I
                    enjoy is to imagine that you are with me. I can remember exactly how you looked
                    when I kissed you goodbye. I can feel the pressure of your arms about me, your
                    warm sweet breath on my cheek. I can see the tears in your eyes. I picture you
                    to myself in smiles. You look lovingly &amp; pleasantly into my eyes
                    &amp; encourage me with your cheerful conversation. I think your living
                    breathing presence is here warming &amp; cherring my lonely tent, but it is only a day dream. Yet I call it up
                    each day &amp; if the dream is so pleasant how much more pleasant the
                    reality. Then why dont you come you ask? You will tell
                    me that I have travelled the dark &amp; stormy night to be at your side in
                    your loved presence. Yes &amp; the coldest weather could not keep me away
                    from you. Your love warmed my heart &amp; it seemed nothing could keep me
                    from you. Then your love is growing cold, you will say to me. but now comes the
                    answer to the question why dont you get to be Assisstant. Well that missing order from Gen. Pleasanton which found its way from the dead
                    letter office to my wife will tell her that my sickness was the reason at the
                    time. As the board for electing candidates closed in July &amp; you see I
                        didnt get the order until too late. Do you think
                    my love is getting less because I deny myself the enjoyment of it. It would make
                    me very happy to be in Good Intent with you by my side hand in hand. I could
                    live my days out in such enjoyment, but would it be wise. You know that we have
                    talents that Christ has ordered us to improve. To some he gave Ten, to some he
                    gave Five &amp; to another he gave One &amp; he that had the one went
                    &amp; digged in the earth &amp; hid his Lord's
                    talent. You have read the sentence of condemnation pronounced on him. Let us
                    beware. We have talents given into our care. My profession is a talent which I
                    must improve. To ease the bed of pain, to cure disease when in the reach of
                    medicine &amp; in endeavoring to improve I must seek a higher position with
                    its greater responsibilities. Our children are talents intrusted to us. We must
                    cultivate their minds, teach them their duties, to be kind &amp;
                    affectionate to one another teach them the love of God to them who sent his only
                    son the Lord Jesus Christ into the world to die for them, for they are sinners
                    as all men are &amp; would have their portion with the devil &amp;
                    fallen angels, but for the love of Christ our love for one another is a talent
                    which we must improve Cynthia &amp; if we improve it all right like a
                    fruitful field each day it will give us new &amp; sweet pleasure. See how
                    all things work together for good to those who have blessings of God upon them
                    &amp; this is a talent for us to improve by prayers morning &amp;
                    evening to God. If by the blessings of God I can procure the position which I
                    seek it will bring more responsibilities, attended with it will be an increase
                    in pay, making me a Steward in the hands of God, to make use of the bounties he
                    will place in my hands, &amp; thus the pleasures of our love will be
                    increased. We can see the greatness &amp; goodness of God. We can make our selves useful &amp; travel improving our
                    minds. We may have means to visit Niagara Fall &amp; there see the power of
                    God. We may visit Washington City together &amp; see the State House with
                    all its beautiful pictures &amp; statuary. How much more pleasure we can
                    have by improving our talents, than sitting down hand in hand in Good Intent. I
                    want to introduce my wife &amp; children into the best society. I want to
                    have people honor her like I do. How proud I will be of her &amp; how happy
                    we can go thru the world, see all the beauties by the
                    way &amp; together reach the Gates of Heaven, be admitted by the grace of
                    God &amp; spend our Eternity with our children singing the praise of God
                    &amp; the Lamb, clothed in Robes of white, have no more parting, nor sorrow,
                    nor pain, nor death. This is what I want to attain with my wife &amp; family
                    &amp; wont she lend me her loved assisstance to reach it. Aint I right to say yes that she will assisst
                    me &amp; encourage me when I get tired. She will sooth me with her love. To
                    gain the position it may be necessary for me to remain with the regiment until
                    another board meets in Harrisburg. When it does the Surgeon General will send my
                    permission to go &amp; if I leave the regiment I may miss the papers again.
                    I think the board will meet this fall. You watch the newspapers for me. We dont get very many here. Hoping soon to enjoy your
                    beloved society I remain </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband </p>
