<p class="p10">Decr 21<sup>st</sup> 60 </p>
<p class="p10">Richmond </p>
<p class="p10">Dear Mother </p>
<p class="p10">Your letter was received on the 19<sup>th</sup>. I will send Franks
                    gun up on monday by the express train. There is nothing talked about here but
                    that all absorbing <i>[illeg.]</i> subject secession. South Carolina has
                    gloriously vindicated her honor. She has passed her ordinance of secession and
                    henceforth the 20<sup>th</sup> day of December will be as glorious a
                    day for the South as ever the 4<sup>th</sup> of July was to the
                    United States. We speak now of the United States as of a nation that has <u>passed</u>
                    <u>away</u> as of a government that has lived out its
                    allotted time and passed away into the dim past. More glorious things are
                    looming up in the now <u>near</u> future. </p>
<p class="p10">Enclosed I send your bill. Mr. D. gave me $25. I would send the change but it
                    would not be safe I will bring it up with me when I come. As you see it is
                    $2.85.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my respects to all my friends. Hoping all are well I remain your
                    affectionate son.</p>
<p class="p10"> </p>
<p class="p10"><i>J. H. Cochran </i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Franks letter was received today I will answer soon
                        it was missent. J.H.C. </p>
