<p class="p10">Oct 21<sup>st</sup>, 1858</p>
<p class="p10">Frederick</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Aunt</p>
<p class="p10">I returned home on Tuesday last from Baltimore when I received your last letter.
                    For some days before leaving there, I was not very well, or I should have
                    written to Ned to congratulate him on his Election -- it is not too late yet,
                    however &amp; we all beg he will accept our heartiest congratulations on
                    this great event -- I am quite uplifted at the idea of a <u>Member</u> of <u>Congress</u> in the family, &amp;
                    my being a <u>great Aunt</u>. Cousin was still suffering with
                    her arm when I left. We both felt very much grieved that we missed seeing you
                    when in Baltimore. I had sent to Barnum's a short time before, thinking it was
                    about the time for your return. We are very glad to hear you are so much
                    improved by your visit to Old Point &amp; hope you will pass a comfortable
                    winter. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>At any rate, we hope you will get to see us while you are
                    enjoying the benefit of it -- you find now by experience that you can bear
                    travelling. I had a letter from Lizzie Law from Marietta -- they were well
                    &amp; expected to leave in a few days. Why do they return to N. York if Mr. M. has resigned his office? Thursday of
                    last week we spent at I. Stevenson's to have a jollification over Ned's
                    election, as he expected to hear certainly by that time, of the result -- but we
                    could hear nothing certain, so we rejoiced in anticipating. We found Mrs.
                        <i>[unclear: Luann]</i> there, &amp; Miss Nancy, the <u>picture</u> of <u>woe</u> or <u>dignity</u>, I could scarcely decide which -- the girls
                    could not get over her looks &amp; manner. It was not so new to me. John
                    &amp; M are so kind &amp; hospitable, we enjoy a visit there very much.
                    Mary Emma &amp; Linnie Williams were in Baltimore a week or ten days, during
                    my stay there-- We passed some very pleasant time together, &amp; I have a
                    very pressing invitation to the wedding. I was very glad to hear through them of
                    Kate &amp; her little family. Nannie Page resides on the Track-- She is to
                    be in town soon, to remain <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>during Lucretia's absence. Nellie is
                    growing almost as fast as Miss Mary. I think she weigh
                    160 lbs.-- Mr. Tyler had made up his mind to try
                    Baltimore as his residence-- of course, we cannot go until he clears his way-
                    living is much more expensive there, than here. Whatever my own feelings may be,
                    I would not throw a straw in the way of his going wherever he may see an opening
                    for a better support for his family. I will not indulge in painful feelings
                    until the time arrives, when they are called for. Lizzie &amp; the babe were
                    well when we heard from them. She had had a good deal of experience already in
                    housekeeping, having had to do her own cooking for some days, but she continues
                    very cheerful &amp; does not complain in the least. I did not know of Mrs.
                    Wallace's death until I saw the Williams! Kitty forgot to tell me after you
                    wrote. I wrote to Mr. W. from Balt. &amp; had
                    a reply since my return. It is a very pretty letter. I do feel truly sorry for
                    him. I think he has made the wisest disposition of the children he could. Excuse
                    a short letter, I have to go down street to see some friends from the North. All
                    join me in much love to you &amp; Ned-- write soon --</p>
<p class="p10">Yours affecty</p>
