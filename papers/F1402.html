<h4>Franklin: Franklin Rosenbery to John Abraham
                    Rosenbery, March 4, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Rosenbery recounts what he knows of an operation against the Confederates and
                    notes that war is a "reality" where he is but a mere "report" at home.</p>

<p class="p10">March 4, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Camp Near Stephensburg, Va.<br> 2nd Corps-1st Div.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Father-</p>
<p class="p10">This evening I seat myself with pen in hand to inform you that your kind letter
                    of the 27th came to hand this morning.</p>
<p class="p10">I was much rejoiced to know that you were all well. Through the Mercy and
                    Goodness of God, I can that that I am well-both in
                        Soule and body. Hoping that these few imperfect
                    lines may find you all enjoying the same blessings of health.</p>
<p class="p10">We are still in Camp yet, not knowing how soon we may get orders to go out on a
                        reconnoter. I do not think that we will make
                    a general move till, May as we cannot mover our artilery before that time through the swamps of
                    Virginia. Although at this time the weather is very pleasant and has been for
                    some five weeks.</p>
<p class="p10">We had some rain and a few pretty cold days. A few days ago it commenced to snow.
                    The snow only fell about 1 inch deep. The weather here changes very soon. And it
                    does not take very much snow or rain to make it very mudy.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not heard wether General Killpaterick has returned to camp or not. I will know 'ere long if I
                    live.</p>
<p class="p10">While the weather is pleasant no doubt the cavelry may
                    make some raids; if they do then we will be very apt to support them. The raid
                    that was made the 6th day of February, we supported them or as I say our Corps
                    will support this present raids. The 6th Corps supports them while we are kept
                    in rediness. We got orders to prepare 3 days
                    rations last Sunday Morning at 7 O'clock and to be ready to march at a moment's
                    warning.</p>
<p class="p10">On the 6th of February the time we marched to the Rapidon, General Warren, Our Corps Commander-while General Hancock is
                    not here Warren is in his place, to make this plaine as
                    I can to you in my ignorant way of writing. General Colwell commands the first Division.</p>
<p class="p10">Now, this is our Division. General Hays did command or was commander of the 3rd
                    Division at that time. Well, General Warren, acting Corps Commander, while
                    General Hanock is at home recruiting for our Corps.
                    Warren told Hays to advance to the Rapidan and not to cross or atack the enemy. But him having his senses deranged with
                    whiskey took the 3rd Division across. Made his men wade the river; Some of the
                    men got drowned while crosssing. Then he had to
                    march by the flank in front of the enemy's artilery
                    while they showered with grape and shell into the ranks of the 3rd Division. The
                    report was 250 killed, wounded and missing. But I do not believe it.</p>
<p class="p10">The 3rd Division was not all across. Well, then, our Division stayed on this side
                    of the river from where we stayed we could not stop the rebs. The object was to draw the rebs
                    attention there while Kipppaterick would make a
                        raide. You will understand there was only 2
                    Divisions on that reconnoiter here.</p>
<p class="p10">I will tell you how a Corps is divided. There is 4 Regiments in 1 Brigade. 4
                    Brigades in 1 Division and 4 Divisions in a Corps.</p>
<p class="p10">I cannot think but there was more men killed than was reported. I hope there was
                    not that many killed.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, at home the war is only a matter of report but here it is a reality.</p>
<p class="p10">I have not heard from A. and Ashway for some time.</p>
<p class="p10">I sent a memmorial of Our Company to Rachel some time
                    ago. But I expect that it got lost, well, I think that the rebelion must soon toter and fall to rise
                    no more. May the Lord hasten the time.</p>
<p class="p10">Well, I must close. You will soon here from me again. Rachel sent me some post
                    stamps but they all are gone. If you can handily sent me
                    some you may sende some.</p>
<p class="p10">Write soon. Give my respect to all enquiring
                    friends.</p>
<p class="p10">My love I send to you all. Hoping if it is the Will of God to meet you all again
                    on earth and if not His Will I hope to meet you all in Heaven.</p>
<p class="p10">Farewell for this time,</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Franklin Rosenbery</i></p>
