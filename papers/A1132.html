<h4>Augusta County: George Wils(?) to Writer's sister,
                    March 18, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>George chastises his sister for writing short letters and gossips about friends,
                    acquaintances, and family. He also expresses his wish that Virginia would
                    secede, proclaiming his southern allegiance and disparaging the "Black
                    Republican party."</p>

                    </sup> I had almost concluded that did not intend to write to me anymore or at
                    least you waited very long &amp; then when it came it was only a short note.
                    You must write longer letters (than) you have been in the habit of doing. every
                    one of my correspondents write longer letters than you, with the acception of one or two, So Miss Kattie has left old
                    Woodstock perhaps never to return, to the old place where she has so often
                    enjoyed herself and where she made one person (at least) a happy being, but it
                    may turn out the reverse and it may be said she made him miserable<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    instead of happy. I hope not. They certainly have my best wishes. Miss Sallie I
                    suppose spoke in the <i>[unclear: 
                        bigest
                    ]</i> terms of <i>[unclear: milton]</i>, and is still in love with him. I
                    think he must be a very nice boy from what I can learn, and is worthy of the
                    love she gives him, but I think he must beware of me or I might spoil his
                    calculations especially if we all get to Texas to
                    gether, which I hope we will. I am almost confident that I will be there
                    in less than twelve months <i>[unclear: From]</i> this time, I want to wether
                    <i>[unclear: Pee]</i> goes or not, for I am asshamed
                    of V<sup>a</sup>. I don't desire to
                    call her my home I shun the very idea of submitting to Black Republican party,
                    who desire to place the insignificant negro on an equality with us, who will
                    submit none but those who at heart if they would but express themselves are
                    partial to the North<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> I fear Va has too
                    many of them in Convention, how glad I was when I saw that Va wished to pre sent an
                    ordinance of secession to the convention. I thought then if they were all like
                        <u>him</u> we would this moment be honored &amp;
                    loved by our seceding Southern Sisters, who now almost as it were despise us. I
                    am ready at any time to join the southern army although I am not prepared to die
                    but <i>[unclear: this]</i> I know <u>Dulce</u>

<p class="p10">I am sorry to learn that Cousin Pet is going to leave I was in hopes that she was
                    going to stay until I came home and in all possibility would be married. I dont think she ought to go back to Ohio such a mean tale,
                    but I am of your opinion that she will not stay long; but then the <i>[unclear: D<sup>r</sup>]</i> is so very fickle. I can scarcely trust
                    him he must certainly be in earnest this<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> time,</p>
<p class="p10">Nothing surprised me more then to hear of the death of Uncle <i>[unclear: Hen,
                    Clower]</i>, he was the last person that I expected hear was dead but we
                    know not the hour when we shall be called to give a final account of ourselves,
                    and oh! how many are unprepared to meet the doom &amp; how the words (depart
