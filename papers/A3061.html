<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">I, George Kersh, of the County of Augusta and State of Virginia, being of sound mind and sane memory, do hereby make, publish and declare this my last will and testament in manner and form following to wit</p>
<p class="p10">1st  It is my desire that all my just debts and funeral expenses shall be paid by my executor out of my personal estate.</p>
<p class="p10">2nd  I give and bequeath to the heirs of my son Jacob Kersh dec'd, namely to Eliza Craun, Rebecca Craun, wife of John Craun, George Kersh, Jr, Adam Kersh and Amanda Kersh, children  and heirs of my said son, Jacob Kersh, dec'd, the following property, namely I give and bequeath to the aforesaid heirs all jointly and severally and their joint and several heirs forever three hundred acres of land situated in Rockingham County Virginia and adjoining the lands of Mathias Kersh, Peter Haynes and Stoutamoyer being the same land I purchased of Jacob Ringer's heirs. I also give and bequeath to the same heirs of my son Jacob, twenty seven acres of land being the whole of an undivided fifth part of a plantation of my brother Jacob Kersh, dec'd. and the said fifth part of which I inherited at his death this also lies in Rockingham County adjoining the aforesaid three hundred acres and also adjoins Mathias Kersh and Haynes.  Upon condition however that the said heirs of my said son Jacob Kersh, dec'd. shall for the said three hundred and twenty seven acres of land pay to my executor the sum of one thousand six hundred dollars in the following manner viz fourteen hundred dollars of which shall be paid within twelve months after my decease and the residue thereof within three years thereafter and the said sixteen hundred dollars when so paid into the hand of my executor shall be deemed personal estate to be disposed of as hereinafter mentioned.</p>
<p class="p10">3rd  To my son Mathias Kersh and his heirs forever I give and bequeath the plantation on which I now reside containing about two hundred and fifty acres of land being the same I inherited from my father.  I also give and bequeath to my said son Mathias twenty eight acres of land being the whole of the undivided fifth part of one hundred and forty one acres which I inherited from my brother Jacob dec'd.  the said land lies in Rockingham County and adjoins Haynes and my said son Mathias, two shares of which said tract having been already purchased by said Mathias Kersh, for and in consideration of which said bequest herein before made my said son Mathias shall pay to my executor the sum of one thousand eight hundred dollars in the following manner viz fourteen hundred dollars to be paid to my executor within twelve months after my decease and the residue thereof within three years thereafter.the said sum of eighteen hundred dollars when so paid to my executor to be deemed personal estate in his hands to be disposed of as hereinafter mentioned.</p>
<p class="p10">4th  To my daughter Mary Ann Kersh and her heirs forever I give and bequeath one hundred and sixty four acres of land adjoining the aforesaid tract on which I reside and which I have bequeathed to my son Mathias, being the same tract of land I purchased of James Rankin and Matthew Blair upon condition nevertheless that my said daughter Mary Ann shall pay to my executor within twelve months after my decease the sum of twelve hundred dollars which said sum is to be considered personal estate in hands  to be distributed as hereinafter mentioned.</p>
<p class="p10">5th  It is my desire that the undivided fifth part of a tract of sixty five acres of land which I inherited from my brother Jacob and which lies in Rockingham County adjoining the lands of Mathias Kersh shall be sold by my executor  and the proceeds thereof to be deemed personal estate in his hands to be distributed as hereinafter mentioned.</p>
<p class="p10">6th  In my lifetime of my son Jacob, each of my three children among themselves made a divide of my household furnature stock and other moveable property except money and except also a bureau some beds and furniture retained by me.  and all the articles each received was charged to them respectively with the price  annexed in a book.  Now in the division of my personal estate it is my desire that this book account shall be taken as so much received by each of my said heirs and as it is my desire ultimately to make an equal distribution amongst my children I wish the amount each has received to be deducted from their proportional part of my personal estate so as to make them equal.</p>
<p class="p10">7th  It is also my will that the bonds I hold against my sons Jacob and Matthias for money loaned shall be charged to them respectively and also a receipt for money paid for my son Jacob is to be charged to his heirs and all of which sums are to be paid to my executor and to be considered as part of my personal estate.</p>
<p class="p10">8th  It is my will and desire that all the aforesaid money so paid by my said heirs to my executor as well as all other monies and all the residue of my personal estate of every kind shall be equally divided between my said heirs Mathias Kersh, Mary Ann Kersh and the heirs of my son Jacob Kersh dec'd.  that is to say that the
<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>

heirs of my son Jacob shall receive their fathers proportion or the one third part of my said personal estate.</p>
<p class="p10">Lastly I hereby nominate and appoint my beloved son Mathias Kersh executor of this my last will and testament hereby revoking all other and former wills and testaments  by me heretofore made. It is also my will and desire that my said executor shall not be required to give security for his performance as usual in such cases. In testimony whereof I have hereunto assigned my name and affixed my seal this sixteenth day of July in the of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty one.</p>
