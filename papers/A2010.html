     before yesterday to tell me Col Stuart would not let him send a man up to attent to me and for me to get on the cars and go home until I got well, but George
     did not see me and I knew nothing of it until I got here I told the Capt that I had a
     certificate for 30 days furlough he said I ought have stayed at home that it would have been
     all right I was very much surprised to find my commission here The Capt had it sent up to me by
      <i>[illeg.]</i> but I did not see him if I had I could have gone back and stayed at home for
     some time but I think it was all for the best we call encamped here at the Court House with
