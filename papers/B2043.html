<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: R. M. Manly to N. C.
                    Brackett, April 28, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Manly asks for details about potential school room accomodations in Staunton. He
                    also refers to the pending construction of a church in Staunton that the Bureau
                    wishes to have space in for school use, if they are to provide funding. This
                    question will later provoke conflict in the community.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b>
                    Rev. N. C. Brackett
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">April 28-</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">Your communication of the 8th inst. should have had earlier attention; the
                    hindrances have been various and I will not enumerate them. I should like more
                    distinct understanding than I now have.</p>
<p class="p10">1st. of the No. of pupils to be provided with school room accomodations (I mean
                    the whole No. in Staunton.)</p>
<p class="p10">2 What facilities are already available, by rent or otherwise, for the future.</p>
<p class="p10">3d The extent of the accomodations to be provided in the proposed church
                    building.</p>
<p class="p10">It must be borne in mind that the Bureau does not aid in Building <u>churches</u>, as such, but if aid is given for such a
                    building, it must be with security that it may be continuously used for school
                    purposes. Please inform me on the above particulars, and in the same paper, make
                    application for a specific sum, making it as small as you can.</p>
<p class="p10">
                        Respy
                    </p>
<p class="p10"><i>R. M. Manly Supt. Ed.</i></p>
<p class="p10">Perhaps the Church Trustees had better make application
                        in connection with yours furnishing the assurance desired.</p>
