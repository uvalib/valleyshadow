<p class="p10">June 10th 1868</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Mollie</p>
<p class="p10">Your dear letter of the 4th came Safely to hand &amp; gave me much plesure to heare that you were
                    well. I was exstremly sorry I disappointed you on
                    last Saturday. My Business was of Such a Nature I could Not posibley leave if I live I will be down this coming Saturday. My
                    Brother left for home on Yesterday I did not like to give him up he is my favort Brother. Our friends Cold us twin Brothers for we were to gether
                    all the time that he was in Staunton. Magnus read a letter from your <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    Pa on Yesterday they rived Safely your Pa &amp;
                    Ham were quite well I Suppose Magnus will Send the letter down to your Ma by
                        to days Mail. You Express the wish in your letter
                    that I will Never love money. I must confess that all my Energey is amed at making a fortune the
                    reason I Strive to do so is to make others comferbley &amp; happy &amp; for them to have all the comforts
                    of this world. Some have abused the wealth that God has placed in there hands hording it up it dus
                    them no good or there
                    famley Such Persons is a Curse to them Selves &amp; those that Surround them</p>
<p class="p10">While on the other hand <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> others use there
                    wealth in permoting the Interest of the Community
                    in which they live in relaving the wants of the
                    Poor, &amp; giving there
                    famleys all the comforts of this world. I cant agree with you that wealth takes a
                        way all tender &amp; holy affection from the heart wealth nor
                        any thing Else on this Earth can Step in between
                    Husband &amp; wife if they do they have never truly loved Each other</p>
<p class="p10">oh I would like so much to See your dear face it has bin
                    so long Since we have Seen Each other it Seames as
                        tho it has bin months
                    Since I have seen you my love. A few more days if God Spares <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> my life
                    I will See you. See the one that I truly &amp; devotedly love one that I
                    love with all my Strenth &amp; Soul. No one Else has a place in my heart but
