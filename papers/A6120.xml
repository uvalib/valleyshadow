     <salute>My darling Cousin:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>It is with the most exquisite pleasure that I once more endeavor to pen you a few lines;
     although there is a <orig reg="probability">probbability</orig> that you may never see these
     lines. But I have an opportunity to send a letter <hi rend="underline">North</hi> by a
     gentleman who has been working here for some time, but is going home, &amp; I sincerely
     hope he may be permitted to mail this letter to you.</p>
    <p>Dear Mollie, there has been many sad changes since last I wrote you, my heart aches as I
     think of them, but I try to submit without murmuring, for I can not but feel that it is the
     Lord's will, that our once prosperous &amp; happy nation must be divided; and where peace
     &amp; happiness, once Shed their smile to <orig reg="gladden">gladen</orig> the hearts of
     the people, now <hi rend="underline">civil war</hi> is devastating our land. It is very sad to
     think of, but you know, dear cousin, as well, perhaps better than I do, the state of our
     beloved country. But do not let us despair, we are in the hands of a merciful God, &amp; he
     will surely work all things to-gether for our good, &amp; his own glory. His ways are
     mysterious.</p>
    <p>I suppose, dear Mollie, that you have not heard from Cousin Will since the war commenced. He
     is in Virginia, at Norfolk, a city about two hundred miles from here, I have not heard from him
     for some time, the last I heard of him, he was well.<pb n="2"/>There has been no fighting where
     he is yet, &amp; I hope there will be none. I wish I could see him, nothing would afford me
     more happiness. He has promised to come as soon as he can.</p>
    <p>I know where Will is, and can hear from him some time; But <hi rend="underline">where</hi>
     <hi rend="underline">is</hi>
     <hi rend="underline">cousin</hi>
     <hi rend="underline">Tom?</hi> Oh! how unhappy I have been <orig reg="about">a bout</orig> him
     since I received his last letter, which was in May. If I could feel sure of his safety I would
     be <hi rend="underline">so </hi>happy. I know <orig reg="wherever">where ever</orig> he is,
     &amp; in <orig reg="whatever">what ever</orig> circumstance he may be placed, there is One
     who ever watches over him, when human friends are of no avail I have looked at his picture
     many, <hi rend="underline">many </hi>times, since I heard from him, and read his letters again
     &amp; again, while tears of anguish flowed from my eyes, as I thought of the <orig
      reg="probability">probbability</orig> of never hearing from you all again. But I hope, dear
     Mary that there is a brighter day ahead, &amp; the time may soon come when our
     correspondence will recommence not to be stopped by any national calamity. I wish you had sent
     me <hi rend="underline">your</hi> picture I hope <orig reg="someday">some day</orig> to see it,
     &amp; not your shadow merely, but your own dear self. What a happy day that <hi
      rend="underline">would</hi> be!</p>
    <p>Tell dear Aunt not to be unhappy because Cousins Will &amp; Tom are in opposite parties.
     Tell her, cousin Mollie, that I would try to console her but I know not how. I can only pray
     for her Her situation is one of <orig reg="peculiar">peculair</orig> Sadness, &amp; I would
     that it were in my power to administer to her consolation, but I <orig reg="cannot">can
     not</orig> I am too weak &amp; ignorant, I fear, to comfort her, but I pray the Lord<pb
      n="3"/>
     <orig reg="may">my</orig> console her in her affliction. He is able &amp; willing to
     comfort her. There has been some changes in our family since last I wrote. Sister was married
     the <hi rend="underline">Fourth of July</hi>. She married Mr. Williams <orig reg="believe">I
      beleive</orig> I wrote <orig reg="something">some thing</orig> about him to you or cousin Tom.
     He would say, "she did remarkably well." He is not <hi rend="underline">very</hi> wealthy, but
     he is an honest &amp; industrious man, esteemed by all. I know they would send you some
     message or perhaps write, if they had <orig reg="known">know</orig> that I intended to write to
     you, but I did not know it myself until nearly eleven o'clock to-night, &amp; as their home
     is some distance from mine I could not go to see them. I will send their love to you (all)
      <orig reg="anyhow">any how</orig>. Unfortunately mother is away from home to-night also. Give
     her love to Auntie &amp; tell that she often talks about her.</p>
    <p>I must stop for it is getting late, &amp; I am <orig reg="afraid">a fraid</orig> I will
     not wake in time to send this down. Excuse me, dearest Cousin, I intended to write you a long
     letter, but time will not permit it now. Give my love to Cousin Tom, and tell I often think of
     him &amp; long for the time when he can write to me again, I miss his and your letters more
     than I do any of my other correspondence I would give <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig> to
     receive one of your'<del hand="h1">s</del> or his' long &amp; interesting letters.
     Remember, dear Mary, if I should never hear from you again, I shall ever feel the tenderest
     affection for you, &amp; deepest <orig reg="solitude">solicitude</orig> for your happiness.
     All send much love, Do not forget to give my love &amp; a kiss to your youngest brother. If
     it is in your power, dear Mollie, write to me. A letter from you would<pb n="4"/> give me more
     happiness than I could express.</p>
    <p>You wrote to me once <orig reg="about">a bout</orig> being a <orig reg="Christian"
     >Christain</orig>. Do you still love Christ &amp; his cause? Are you striving to please
     him? You have my prayers in your behalf.</p>
    <p>Good bye dearest Mary, if- if I never hear from or see you while living, I hope to meet you
     with the redeemed &amp; blessed above. Tears are blinding me, I am compelled to stop<lb/>
     Remember me in your petitions, cousin.</p>

     <salute>I am, and ever shall be Your fond &amp; loving cousin</salute>
     <signed>Sue.</signed>
