<p class="p10">My dear Sir,</p>
<p class="p10">As you have <i>[unclear: observed]</i> I have been nominated; and I will next
                    week begin the campaign in Earnest. I have an appointment in Bedford next week,
                    (their Court), &amp; will go then to Mifflintown, Sept. 6.- I wanted to go to Harrisbg
                    to see you before reading the latter point, but cannot do so in consequence of
                    the engagement in Bedford, which was made without consultation, and which I
                    cannot break. From all quarters I hear <i>[illeg.]</i> from
                        Juniata--<i>[unclear: although]</i> I knew something of the facts upon
                    which the favorable opinion in based--I hope to stop in H. on my way from
                    Juniata, the latter part of that week, &amp; will be glad to have a talk
                    with you in relation to this <i>[illeg.]</i>, which I believe it is within our
                    power to carry, with proper effort.-</p>
<p class="p10">I <i>[unclear: regret]</i> not be <i>[illeg.]</i> able to<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>write my
                    place more definitely, but I will be in H, Earlier or later in the week,
                    according as I am detained in Juniata. <i>[unclear: Probably]</i>, I will not
                    be needed there, the whole week.</p>
<p class="p10">If you have any special personal friends in the District any the lukewarm in the
                    Democrats, I will be gratified if you exert what influence you have over them in
                    my favor,-It will give me great pleasure to remember the kindness, &amp; to
                    serve you <u>in kind</u>.--For we intend that you shall, some
                    day soon be before the people.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>

                        <u>Edwd. M. McPherson</u>
