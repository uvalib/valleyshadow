<h4>Franklin County: Thomas Barnhart, George W. Brewer, and H. S.
     Stoner to Members of the Grand and Subordinate Lodges of Pennsylvania, September 15, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>After the Confederate burning of Chambersburg, the George Washington Lodge appointed Thomas
     Barnhart, George W. Brewer, and H. S. Stoner to request "relief for the destitute and suffering
     brethren" of Chambersburg from the Grand and Subordinate Lodges of Pennsylvania. In their
     letter, Barnhart, Brewer, and Stoner emphasize the destruction of Chambersburg and the
     subsequent poverty of its residents.</p>

<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">September 15th, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg, Penn'a</p>
<p class="p10">To______,</p>
<p class="p10">Worshipful Master of Lodge No. ______, A.Y.M.<br>The undersigned, at a meeting of George
     Washington Lodge, No. 143, A.Y.M., located at Chambersburg, Penna., were, by resolution, appointed a Committee to address the Grand and Subordinate
     Lodges of this Commonwealth, and to invoke some relief for the destitute and suffering brethren
     of that place. We would gladly refrain from recital of the melancholy cirumstances of the
     recent terrible conflagration at Chambersburg, and which are now a part of the history of the
     times. It is perhaps enough to say, that a large number of the members of our Lodge, from
     circumstances of ease and comfort, have been reduced to the sad condition of a houseless and
     homeless poverty. We make no argument- we would indulge in no eloquence, but we would simply
     point you to the black and smouldering ruins of that once happy and prosperous town-to business
     destroyed, to labor prostrated, to the burning tears of widowhood, to the moving sorrows of
     orphanage, to the desolation of home, and to the ashes of the altar where devotion knelt or
     love fed its flame of perrenial joy.</p>
<p class="p10">The undersigned, as the representatives of their unfortunate brotherhood, make, with great
     confidence, this earnest and anxious appeal to the sympathy and generosity of the Masonic
     heart. This august and venerable Order, renowned for her mighty achievements, and cherished her
     for noble and princely charities, will, we indulge the fond hope, turn a listening ear to the
     cry that comes from the distressed and destitute-the stricken and unfortunate brethren of
     Chambersburg.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10"><i>Thos. Barnhart,<br>
      Geo. W. Brewer,<br> H.S. Stoner.</i></p>
<p class="p10">To ______,<br>Worshipful Master of Lodge No. _____<br>As the
      Principles of Masonry are universal, and as Charity knows no bounds, we have deemed it not
      improper to extend this Appeal to the sympathy and benevolence of your Lodge. The estimated
      loss of the brethren of the Lodge is, two hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars.<br>Thos. Barnhart,<br>
      Geo. W. Brewer,<br> H.S. Stoner.</p>
