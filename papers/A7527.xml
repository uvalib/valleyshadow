                <p>I have just finished a heavy day's work &amp; the closing of Monday finds me
                    seated alone to answer your dear letter of Friday. I was so happy to hear from
                    you thankful to know you were well. How much I wish I could see you this
                    evening. I <orig reg="cannot">can not</orig> wait until Saturday arrives with
                    calm patience I am wanting the day to come &amp; hurrying time for it seems
                    it does not pass swiftly enough to bring you near me. I was so glad &amp;
                    thankful when I read that you were coming this week for I do want to see your
                    dear face more than I can tell you or than you can ever believe<pb n="2"/>for I
                    love you so truly &amp; entirely with all the deep devotion of my heart
                    &amp; nature that I am only happy &amp; contented when you are with me.
                    Oh I do indeed love you more &amp; more every hour of my life. I feel that I
                    am sinning by giving to you the love of both <hi rend="underline">heart</hi>
                    &amp; <hi rend="underline">soul</hi> I sin because I think more of you <orig
                        reg="than">then</orig> of my God which makes you my Idol. I know this should
                    not be &amp; my most earnest prayer is that God will moderate my affection
                    so it will receive His holy blessings &amp; smiles. I fear in God's jealous
                    anger that He might take you from me for loving you more <orig reg="than"
                    >then</orig> I do "my father who art in Heaven." I will with His<pb n="3"
                    />Divine aid love you in a way pleasing to Him then He will love &amp; bless
                    us both as nothing in this world can do but God</p>

                <p>Cousin David Sibert brought Rennie home yesterday she will not return to
                    Bridgewater till she is the bride of cousin David when you come I will tell you
