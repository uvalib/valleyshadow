<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Orlando Brown, March 24, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson's report refers to a defect in the Hustings (Or Corporation) Court and a
                    special report he submitted to Brown on March 10. He notes that it is very
                    difficult for freedmen to receive impartial decisions.</p>

<p class="p10">In compliance with C.O. No. 10 BRF &amp; AL
                    S. 1866 I have the honor to report that during this
                    month session of Hustings Court, Staunton has been held and County Court has
                    just opened its sittings. As to the decisions of Hustings Court I respectfully
                    refer to my special report of March 10/68 in cases of Comm v. James Brigham &amp; Comm v. John McNinch whether the defect <i>[unclear: inheres]</i> in
                    the law or in the officers I cannot decide, but although impartial justice may
                    not be denied in <i>[unclear: terms]</i> to freedmen it is very evident it is
                    difficult for them to obtain it either before courts or magistrates. From this
                    remark I would except controversies as to property but these as compared with
                    breaches of the peace are very rare with freedmen.</p>
