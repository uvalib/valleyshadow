<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Uncle Jed's brother, Nelson Hotchkiss, and his noble, sweet wife, Harriet (Russell)
              ran a boarding department for both boys' and girls' schools. Their children were
              Sarah, 13; Lora, 11; Elmore, 9; Olive, 7; Ned, 5; Stiles, 3. Sarah was my room-mate and for 50 years since has been my loving, loyal and
              dearly beloved friend. Aunt Sara's children were two - Nellie, 8; Annie, 4. Annie
              still had her nurse, "Toog". I rapidly became accustomed to colored servants. They
              swarmed everywhere, a jolly set; so fat, shiny and comfortable looking, and seeming
              kind and friendly, yet politely deferential, and I soon realized I had been
              transferred <u>South</u> of "Mason &amp; Dixon's Line" to a
              peaceful, restful, happy land, and geographically, politically and socially new and
              refreshing to me. To find people "behind the times" and devoid of the restless "hurry
              and push" of the North seemed a beautiful dream. The people, rich and poor, were
              warm-hearted and hospitable. The men so chivalrous in their bearing to women. In those
              days "befo' de wah" there was a large and interesting circle of young folks in and
              about Churchville. So as different ones called on me I felt as tho' being introduced to the dramatis personae of a pleasing new romance
              from real life and enjoyed it accordingly.</p><p class="p10">Foremost among the ladies was Mrs. Dr. Gooch, a widow, and sister of Col.
              F. F. Sterrett. She had a queenly and gracious
              presence. Tall and large; fair, blue eyes, long abundant flaxen hair; beautiful teeth
              and a proud but bewitching smile; a perfect hand and small foot. No wonder she was so
              admired and sought after by all, especially gentlemen! I felt at once that she would
              prove a most desireable and congenial friend. She was very cordial and she said she
              should send her daughter Nannie, 11 years old, to take music and painting lessons of
              me.</p><p class="p10">I was soon busy with my singing, music, and painting classes. Nannie and Lora took
              painting and both music. They and Sarah were bright pupils; Sarah my most advanced
              musician. I taught drawing in my room, so the three "boon companions" were much with
              me and I was very proud of my interesting trio of "little women". They read aloud to
              me "Children of the Abbey", "Scottish Chiefs", "Thaddeus of Warsaw" etc. Old Dr.
              Wilson's daughter, Suie, was one of my guitar scholars. Eventually she became the
              first wife of Willie Hite (a son of Aunt Eveline Hite's of Bridgewater). One of the
              Loch Willow boarders was a lovely girl from Buffalo Gap, a Miss Lizzie Kunkle,
              afterwards the wife of John D. Hill, a member of the Churchville Cavalry. Another
              splendid girl was Ella Allen, who rode in every day behind her brother, Brown Allen,
              from Jennings Gap. She became the 2nd wife of Dr. R. S. Hamilton, whose first wife was
              Mrs. Henrietta Gooch (May Sterrett's own aunt). Among Aunt Sara's pupils were Marrie,
              Ellen and Hattie Cook. The latter married Louis Wise, of Florida. There were also Mary
              Lizzie Bear and Retta, and their cousins Rebecca and Siddie, &amp;c.</p><p class="p10">One lovely P.M. Uncle Jed, Aunt Sara and I were invited over to Willow Glen, the old
              home of the Sterretts, to eat watermelons. We rode horeback to the outskirts of the
              village, where a pleasing picture met my eye. First, the old Sterrett flour mill,
              looking very picturesque and back from the road a considerable distance; then opposite
              it the garden and grapery. As we alighted at the stile, our attention was attracted by
              a Virginia trumpet creeper, which had wound about the trunk of a tall locust near by and gemmed its emerald foliage with its many scarlet
              trumpets, all quite four inches long, the first I had ever seen! The low rambling,
              old-fashioned house seemed lodged against the upward slope of a gentle declivity upon
              which was an orchard, and also the servant's quarters. The dormer windows of the upper
              (1/2) story gave it a very quaint expression, and a long front porch ran the length of
              the building from end to end, giving an air of comfort and hospitality which was
              unmistakable. There we sat to partake of the coming melon feast. But my hair having
              tumbled down in my ride over, Mrs. Gooch took me to the parlor bedroom, where I
              arranged my roving raven locks, while my hostess remarked, "You certainly have a
              lovely suit of hair, so long and glossy". The light came thro' a long open sliding window whose red curtain reflected a becoming tinge
              to my lips and cheeks and with the compliment raised my spirits still more. Mrs. Gooch
              introduced me to her sister, Miss Rebecca, (the housekeeper) and to her father, Capt. Henry Sterrett, (the dusty old miller) whom I noticed
              has a mischievous and merry twinkle in his blue eyes and whose thick, long iron-grey
              hair was as straight as an Indians! And I wondered where "the colonel" got his curly
              head! As we all sat chatting I had opportunity to take in the view. Across the road
              was the low-lying green meadow, through which ran the creek, traceable by the frequent
              water willows, and in its way filling the fore-bay which
              fed the big water wheel of the mill in plain sight. Its music I that day heard for the
              first time, but its soothing monotone was to bless and soothe me inumerable times in the future! I saw a path leading across
              the branch down to the spring-house, where for many
              years a grand old weeping willow had stood guard. Looking westward and over the hill I
              descried a delightful glimpse of the mountains blue! The whole scene made me think of
              Raselas and the "Happy Valley", especially as three of their slave boys stood alert
              and waiting a chance to serve these guests and their dear "old marster". So far and
              contented looking they were; Jim, John, and Leonard, and as black as their parents,
              Aunt Charity and Uncle Kit.</p><p class="p10">It was not long after this pleasant visit that Col.
              Sterrett began coming regularly to Loch Willow on Wednesday and Sunday nights, and
              usually on Friday evening Mrs. Gooch sent a boy over for my guitar, a horse for Nannie
              and me to ride, with a note inviting me to come prepared to remain until Monday
              morning. How I did enjoy those outings! The rides, farm rambles after apples, grapes
              and nuts; calls at the old grist-mill and getting weighed. The true, everyday life
              among the slave owners, where I saw and heard of no cruelty or oppression, and no one
              servant was overburdened, but each had their respective tasks. I fell in love with
              dear old Aunt Charity, the cook, and Amanda, the laundress. Then there was a
              dairymaid, a housemaid, a table waiter and an errand boy, &amp;c. &amp;c. The
              days had their charms, but the nights were impromptu receptions. One or more gentlemen
              were sure to "drop in" and one could generally count on Dr. R. S. Hamilton (associate
              of old Dr. Wilson), whose beaming face and banjo music and "darkey" songs could not be
              excelled by Polk Miller himself! So with the colonel's flute, my guitar, and Retta's
              and my vocal duets, the ensemble was pronounced "fine"! In fact on pretty moonlight
              nights our quartette distinguished itself on various occasions by serenading special
              friends. Retta often had one or two lady friends visiting her. Mag Baylor (Mrs. Wash.
              Swoope), her cousin Mag. Trimble (Mrs. George A. Hanger), Puss Fultz, Bettie Eidson,
              or Miller and Ginnie Cochran. A cousin of Retta's, Wm. A.
              Sterrett from Hebron (David Sterrett's old home, now a parsonage of Hebron church) was
              often a guest at Willow Glen and Wm. B. Sterrett made a
              visit this same year from Galveston, Texas, and sad to relate fell desperately in love
              with his captivating cousin Retta and as she was engaged to Dr. Hamilton, trouble
              ensued and many startling sensations; quite enlivening to so quiet a borough as
              Churchville!</p><p class="p10">A merry crowd at Willow Glen always inspired me with a wish to improvise a charade!
              So choosing my characters, I quickly "coached" them in a separate room, taking the
              most important part myself, and sometimes, by a slight change in costume, acting in
              two different parts. I was blest in the happy faculty of
              inspiring others with my boundless enthusiasm and thus my efforts were surprisingly
              successful. Retta was my ready, able and willing coadjutor; being a poet, a witty
              conversationalist and very quick-witted, I knew I could depend upon her part being
              perfect and telling. So after each act we left our audience to study out the syllables
              and at last to guess the whole word! It always proved a lot of fun and spontaneous
              entertainment.</p><p class="p10">Invitations from some of his particular friends were received by the colonel to bring
              Miss Rounds to see them. In compliance I was favored with a visit to Hill Crest, the
              sightly and delightful home of Bishop Glossbrenner, where I met his two daughters,
              Nealie and Josie, and saw a most interesting relic of the past in the shape of a
              diminutive piano that had once belonged to the Jefferson family.</p><p class="p10">Another time we were invited to a party at the Cochrans' country place, where the
              hostesses were Misses Miller and Ginnie Cochran, and the hosts were Messrs. Jim, Bob
              and Sam, all three members of the Churchville Cavalry. Jim was first lieutenant. That
              night while playing Blind Man's Bluff, Bob sat in the chair blinded and we all marched
              around him, each extending a hand to see if he could recognize the passer by. When my turn came he called out, "Yes, yes, this
              soft, crushable hand is Retta Gooch's". "Wrong! Wrong!" they all screamed. "Well, I'll
              be hanged!" exclaimed Bob. "I didn't know any other woman on earth had such a hand."</p><p class="p10">A third trip was three miles west to Oakwood, the estate of Gabriel Hite, to visit
              his daughter Ella, who became my devoted friend. Next a ride three miles east of
              Staunton to Bear-Wallow the charming country seat of Judge Fultz. There I was
              delighted to meet his wife and daughters, Puss and Gussie. Also Mr. John Alby, the
              tenor of the 1st Presbyterian church choir, a musician as well as a vocalist, and a
              successful clothier of Staunton. He was then courting Gussie, who later became his
              wife and was the sweet mother of Libbie Alby, a missionary to Korea with the Rev. Mr. Buhl, her husband.</p><p class="p10">Another treat that Col. Sterrett gave me was attending a
              concert in town, "The Cantata of Queen Esther". We put up at the Virginia Hotel and
              drove back next morning.</p><p class="p10">But of all my good times that never to be forgotten that autumn, the <u>Tournament</u> at Stribling Springs was the climax! How eager,
              glad and happy I was when that fair morning I saw the colonel's handsome turnout and
              spanking bays drive up to the Loch Willow stile. Glorious the day and drive of six
              miles to that romantic resort, where a large hotel and several rows of pretty
              cottages, two alum, a sulphur and Chalybeate spring. An enjoyable dinner over, the
              excited crowds gathered at the Tournament grounds. And <u>I</u> was
              at last to witness a real old <u>Virginia Tournament!</u> Soul
              stirring band music echoed and re-echoed through forest and from rocky mountain side.
              The knights in gay and varied costume mounted on their restless steeds looked handsome
              and "eager for the fray". Col. Sterrett, the Herald
              ("noblest knight of all") sat his fine charger like a commanding general, as he
              announced the names of the riders, while one by one, each dashed forward and essayed
              to cast his spear through the coveted ring in the arch over his head. How hearty and
              contagious the cheering when the Herald announced the name of the successful knight
              who had won the honor of dancing with the "Queen of Love and Beauty" at the coming
              Ball! And also when the 2nd and 3rd honors were conferred on the two knights who had
              won the privilege of dancing with the two maids of her royal Majesty, the Queen! That
              night I wore my black and green silk; The fashionable flowing sleeves worn with
              embroidered lace undersleeves having several strips of pink ribbon run through the
              meshes lengthwise. At my neck and in my hair were bows of the same becoming color. At
              9 o'clock the ball opened with a burst of dance music -- amid profuse floral
              decorations -- pretty young girls beautifully gowned, brilliant lights, and gay
              knights in costume; the Queen in crown and diamonds; the Maids of Honor none the less
              lovely. The whole scene combined to present a picture rivalling any Vanity Fair! Early
              in the evening Rob Ruff (2nd lieutenant of the Churchville Cavalry) asked if I would
              join him in the next set. When I thanked him, saying "I never dance", he replied,
              "Well, Miss Rounds, I cannot doubt your word, but still I am convinced that anyone who
              can sing and play like you could certainly dance." I noticed, however, that the
              gallant and handsome lieutenant had no difficulty in securing a partner. My noble
              Prince Charming was a most graceful dancer, but that night he declined to take the
              floor, declaring he would prefer a promenade with me in the hall or on the long piazza
              among the Chinese lanterns and where we could hear the music and chat uninterruptedly,
              and I verily believe we were the happiest couple at that Tournament Ball!</p><p class="p10">Before November was over Retta and I had begun to plan for some Christmas gayeties at
              Loch Willow, in which all our circle agreed. So it was decided we would have three
              entertainments. 1st, an oyster stew; 2nd, a Christmas Tree; 3rd, some tableaux. So I
              was at Willow Glen with Retta more than usual, especially when getting up the costume
              of Minnehaha, a character for which I was unanimously chosen. I remember that amid the
              tryings on and dressings (behind closed doors) old Capt.
              Sterrett would knock at Retta's door and beg to come in and see how I looked,
              remarking that that was all he would see of those wonderful tableaux. So Retta gave
              him an occasional peep, which pleased him mightily and always after that he called me
              "Little Indian Girl" and would pull me down on his lap and ask me "Whatever makes your
              eyes so bright?"</p><p class="p10">The tree was very popular and well patronized. All had been busy making gifts and I
              did a monochromatic for Frank and made a pine cone watch case lined and faced in blue
              plush and edged with blue chenille cord. I did another in pink for Bob Ruff, but he
              was too jealous to come to our splendid tree, so never got his gift.</p><p class="p10">All three of our social efforts were successful, but No. 3 was the best. Our scenes
              were from Longfellow's Hiawatha, and Uncle Tom's Cabin. In the latter "Uncle Tom" was
              personated by the Sterrett's oldest slave, grey headed Uncle Kit Matthews, and Nannie
              Gooch made the loveliest "Eva". In the former we had a veritable wigwam, outside of
              which sat old "Nicomis" (Mr. N. H. Hotchkiss). Bob Ruff was Hiawatha and I the dusky
              Minnehaha. When I tripped down the stairs to the library door to be ready for my time,
              there stood Bob Ruff in blanket, paint and feathers, and when he saw me in flowing
              hair, black silk waist low neck and short sleeves, bordered with white fur, decorated
              with many strings of beads and spangles and tinsel ornaments on red petticoat and
              beaded moccasins, he exclaimed, "Oh, you beautiful Minnehaha! The character suits you
              admirably", and I was thankful when the cheering stopped and the curtain dropped for
              my turn! Frank liked me in all, but admired me most in Light in Darkness. Footlights
              lowered to enhance the effect, my hair floating over back and shoulders, costume
              white, gauzy and soft, attitude one of rapt devotion, hands clasped and eyes looking
              upward. It and Hiawatha were encored heartily.</p><p class="p10">Thus swiftly and happily sped September, October and November. And December was
              passing and with it the most important event of my life, when I gave my hand and heart
              and future life into the keeping of another! I recalled the last evening before I left
              home, when sitting on my father's lap and brushing his hair and whiskers, he said,
              "Allie, I shall miss all these loving ministrations of yours when you are gone."
              "Papa," I said, "Do you know I am never going to marry until I find a man as near like
              you as possible, tall, blue eyes, fair skin and dark hair." But <u>now</u> I <u>had</u> found his counterpart in Col. Francis Franklin Sterrett, and we were engaged provided
              my parents did not object, Aunt Sara and Uncle Jed having heartily approved of the
              match, and my whole heart and soul being involved, my father and mother gave their
              willing consent and on Dec. 3l, 1860, Frank's 39th
              birthday, he called me his future bride!</p><p class="p10">Although frequently hearing the distant but angry mutterings of approaching War,
              little did we imagine a cruel 4 years' war would interfere and separate us! Despite
              the pranks of mischievous students at the lower house, "the colonel" continued his
              regular visits to Loch Willow. Sometimes on a dark night he found himself halted on
              his homeward way by a rope stretched across the road, which caught him just under the
              chin and temporarily intercepted the progress of horse and rider.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>1861

<p class="p11"><b>January 1861
            
          </b></p>
<p class="p11"><b></b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">In January an unusual snow of 6 or 8 inches fell, whereupon the "hurry jumpers" were
              knocked together and presses into immediate use ere the snow
              should melt. I shared with other girls in the exciting, unexpected and ungraceful
              precipitate plunges into convenient snowdrifts! Our escorts pleaded "not guilty" when
              we emphatically declared our belief that complicity had designed these
              "unpremeditated" accidents' So we joked and laughed over our <u>
                slaying
              </u> adventures as best we could.</p><p class="p10">Through the kindness of my friends I witnessed two novel scenes that winter. A cake
              walk and dance of the Willow Glen servants and a "darkey wedding" at the home of a
              friend of the Sterretts to which they and I were invited. Both were comical, mirthful
              and hilarious affairs to black and white alike. The refreshments proved "tip top" and
              tony and lavishly prepared by these slaves and by them also dispensed to those "down
              at the house" as well as all at the "quarters."</p><p class="p10">But alas! fun and social recreations were fast being relegated to the background and
              fiery political speeches took their places. For "coming events cast their shadow
              before". The two antagonistic factions of North and South were daily growing more and
              more embittered and determined. The one declaring slavery must and shall go; the other
              vowing never to give up their slave property <u>by force</u>.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Jan. 24, 1861.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Frank called for me with new sleigh to take me to hear speeches of Augusta candidates

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">President Davis inaugurated at Montgomery, Ala. The
              Peace Congress, with its 22 delegates from states north, south and west, met and
              adjourned with no apparent result than an increasing tendency towards war rather than
              peace. During this month (Feb.) commissioners from the
              Confederate States went to Washington to assist in a plan with Secretary of War
              (Seward) for a just and honorable peace adjustment, but were repulsed. Then followed
              news of great activity at the Navy Yard of New York, and later the departure of 75
              ships for Fort Sumpter. The South having seceded and
              established its first Confederate Capitol at Montgomery, Ala., President Davis authorized, through his Secretary of War, the military
              protection of Charleston and ordered General Beauregard to go to Ft.
              Sumpter with 60,000 men and demand its immediate evacuation
              by Colonel Anderson and his whole force. Colonel Anderson refusing, the bombardment of
              Fort Sumpter began April 12 and lasted 22 hours, a grand and
              terrible sight which the fleet watch, but did not participate in. Providentially not a
              life was lost on either side. Colonel Anderson and his force left in order with music,
              and all their personal and material belongings. Thus commenced the most cruel and
              determined war (of four years) the world has ever seen.</p></p>

              Then followed the sad farewells of mothers, wives, sisters, sweethearts and friends!
              Many a strong man quivered with emotion and tears fell from eyes unused to weep! We
              watched the cavalrymen as they mounted, whirled into line, waved their hats, and
              galloped out of night, leaving aching hearts to mourn their departure. They belonged
              to the army of Northern Virginia and were bound for West Virginia.</p><p class="p10">These "War notes" seem like a "bridge of sighs" as I read over journal from early in

              underneath the sad "bridge". So I will copy verbatim a few pages by way of relief.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I now copy from another paper.</p><p class="p10">"Notes on the 1st battle of Civil War in Virginia. This encounter occurred June l,
              186l, at Phillippi, W. Va., not far from the home
              of Eveline Sterrett Hite, 'Cherry Hill'. A letter soon after from F. described the 1st shot as wounding Jimmie Hanger, of his company
              (Churchville Cavalry) so severely that he had to lose his leg! He had run away from
              school to enlist as a southern soldier boy and it seemed sad that his military career
              was cut short as soon as it begun! But he was led to study over his misfortune and try
              to manufacture an artificial leg for himself and succeeded so well that he ultimately
              established several manufactories making artificial arms and legs for maimed soldiers!
              Frank wrote me that the enemy surprised the "Rebs" so suddenly that his Cavalry Co. had to make precipitate flight, leaving behind horses,
              tents and baggage; among the "spoils" was Frank's valise, and the following day one of
                <u>my letters</u> was published in the "Wheeling Intelligencer"
              headed 'A model love-letter'! A very aggravating and mortifying fact to Frank and me!
              So he asked me to burn every letter of his and all he should write me thereafter! That
              was a heart breaking request, but he declared he should destroy all of mine. So I
              planned to try and save my precious war-treasures. Put them in a close wooden box and
              secreted the box under one of the floor-planks of the attic at Loch Willow. Southern
              women everywhere were hiding their silver and other valuables in safe places and I
              felt quite comforted when I thought <u>my letters</u> were safe
              forever! But alas! when Frank wrote again, he said 'Did you burn my letters?' Then I
              had to confess what I had done and Frank said it would not be safe to leave them
              there. And so fate obliged me to destroy what would now prove most interesting
              heirlooms to my children and grandchildren, and would have afforded an excellent
              war-history of experiences from the pen of an eye witness during the campaigns of the
              Army of Northern Virginia."</p></p>

              very kind. Allie Hanger came three times, bro't me bottle
              blackberry wine 3 years old! from her mother. Can oysters from 'a constant friend' -
              who called often. Only doctor I had as Dr. Hamilton was awy.
              We discussed changes to be made in the spring when Mr. N. H. should sell Lock Willow, and the removal. Its bearings upon <u>our</u> future. A separation was inevitable. At 7 p. m. girls
              almost carried me down to parlor. Had biggest kind of fire in fireplace - so warm and
              cozy. Piano had been drawn up towards fire. First time I had played for so long! I
              enjoyed it once more. All children in to see and hear me and some of the servants,
              too, - a real family party. When I becaue weary I lay down
              and the girls played for me. Mr. N.H. and wife
              and Mr. Harvey called in to see 'Miss Allie'. Snow nearly a foot deep! I hope for a
              sleigh ride soon.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Wednesday. Getting stronger fast. Sewed all day on new poplin dress. Eve. Borne off
              at fairy-like speed over the snow by side of same constant friend who gave me my first
              Virginia sleigh ride in 1860. At dusk found myself snugly seated in Mrs. Sam Wilson's
              own room disposing of a tempting little 'snack'. Watched the stowing away to bed of
              two rosy lipped boys. Pet Charlie's eyes soon closed by the gentle rocking of his
              crib, but the little fat hands of Loydie suddenly unclasped and his childish voice
              sang, 'I wish I was in the land ob cotton'. Then after one verse, he asked, 'Mama,
              please take me up - I forgot to kiss Miss Allie goodnight.' It was sweet to embrace
              the childish form, have the soft round arms about my neck, to press my lips to that
              rosy mouth, and sweet memories of scenes in my own home rushed over me in that
              peaceful moment.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Snow melting fast. Felt depressed all eve. but all here at Lock Willow met me so
              cordially - children welcomed me at Mrs. N.H.'s
              door and fairly carried me to a rocker - took off my wraps and begged to know if I was
              quite well now, chatting of all that had happened while I was away. Lora surprised me
              with some neat pencellings of flowers. Sarah showed me her poor fingers, so sore from
              practising guitar 6 hrs. a day! Later Sarah and Lora bore me up to my pleasant room, a
              cheerful fire and freshly reddened hearth. Soon seated between the dear girls. Loral
              read me some stories she wished me to hear; Sarah sewed, looking up often with beaming
              smile into my face, as if to say, 'I love you just as dearly as if you were my oldest
              sister!' Presently a servant brought up a letter to me from my dear Uncle Jed,
              affectionate and cheerful, just like himself. Gave to L.
              &amp; S. to read and a happy trio enjoyed it

<p class="p10"><p class="p10"> Mr. N.H. Hotchkiss gone across Blue Ridge to look at a farm on James River. At night
              all in Mrs. N.H.'s room. Mr. Diedrich came with
              his violin and scattered cheer with its merry strains - which brought us all down
              stairs in a hurry; after supper to Mrs. N.H.'s
              large sitting room. In background servants were keeping time with thumbs and claps,
              all a very agreeable experience to me, such a relaxation after school duties of the
              day, for which I was physically unfitted. The jolly dance music led me to forget there
              was ought beside in this world of weariness and woe. My ear was charmed; my heart and
              spirits lightened. My eye was fascinated watching Lora, a natural ballet dancer, in
              her unstudied but graceful evolutions - readily carrying out a few suggestions I gave
              her and so perfectly as to surprise us all. I never can forget how beautiful she
              looked in her green muslin, without hoops, her glossy, jetty hair streaming over back
              and shoulders in massive waves - face and neck so fair by contrast - raven tinted
              brows and lashes, her finely chiseled lips glowing more and more like rubies every
              moment! White teeth gleaming out like pearls, eyes darkly bright but firm in their
              expression as usual whole face so sweet and attractive, indicitive, I felt sure, of a strong character. Wish I could paint her
              portrait, not with a pen, but with a <u>brush</u> as she looked
              when she arched her arms above her head, hair floating back in the air as she poised
              herself on toe of one foot before swinging around so queen like! I admire the lovely
              casket, but far more the soul gem it enshrines! Olive took the floor to-night for the
              first time in her life - seemed perfectly inspired by the jolly music. I wished her
              father could see her. Mr. Diedrich played several times for her to dance alone and she
              just seemed to float away on the gay airs. We were all convulsed by the antics of her
              little black kitten, which followed her in and out of every figure, whirling when
              Olive whirled, but with such an utter lack of grace and agility that our screaming
              applause seemed to mortify Tabby, for she soon skuttled
              away and could no more be prevailed on to supply merriment for the crowd!</p></p>

              two horses. Had waited a week for roads to get dry, so started though traveling only
              tolerable - but we had a jolly ride. Went Friday - returned Sunday p. m. Sorry Frank

              so Frank and I rode horseback over the hills and fields to salt the cattle - get fresh
              air and fine views. After tea sung again with Miss Bettie Frank's two favorites, 'Come

              with Sam Bell and spent the night. I thought how happy he might be there with all his

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">And now come many blank pages in my journal covering weeks and months. During this
              interval occurred the final entertainment at beautiful old Loch Willow mansion, (now
              1912 forever passed away) "Coronation of May Queen", a poetic cantata, both recitative
              and vocal, by different flowers.</p><p class="p10">The pleasing rendition of this cantata elicited much applause from an appreciative
              audience, consisting of many soldiers, citizens of Churchville and vicinity, and
              Staunton, all pronouncing this a "red letter day", with its cantata and concert
              following at night. The latter, as well as former, given by my vocal and instrumental
              classes. The <u>Finale</u> was a Refreshment Sale - all conducted
              for the pleasure and benefit of our brave Southern Soldier boys. At the midnight hour,
              as we laid our tired heads and weary frames to rest, we felt amply repaid for all our
              time, trouble and care in arranging this "farewell to Loch Willow".</p><p class="p10">The lovely poem, "Cantata of the May Queen", was lent us for the occasion by Miss
              Kate Seig. I afterwards copied it in a blank book and recently had same typewritten by

<p class="p11"><b>Notes to Memoir</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">And now comes a long interval again of weeks and months, and many blank pages in my
              diary. But following the Final Entertainment at Lock Willow there occurred several
              marked changes. First the departure of Mr. N. H. Hotchkiss' dear family to "Sunny
              Side" farm, on James River, in Buckingham Co., Va., near Howardsville, a sweet place in a grove, on an
              eminence. I was charmed with its simple, quiet beauty. However, my health began to
              give way and in the midsummer I returned to Churchville and old Loch Willow, the
              former seat of Uncle Jed's Preparatory School, and now the home of Aunt Sara and the
              children, Annie and Nellie. During my short visit at old Loch Willow there occurred an
              episode in my life that proved to me in a very sad way that "the course of true love
                <u>never</u> runs smooth." Frank was brought home from the Army
              of Northern Virginia ill with a very severe attack of rheumatism. He had taken so much
              morphine to deaden pain it has affected mind, body and nerves and left him "in the
              depths". He was so blue, so depressed about the war and its outcome, the world looked
              very dark to him and to me! He knew of my intense desire to see my mother once more in
              her declining years, but had never yet been willing for me to undertake the perilous
              task of getting thro' the lines of both armies,
              Confederate and Federal! But <u>now</u> he relented and was willing
              I should make the experiment! Saying <u>if</u> he should live and
              the war <u>ever</u> be over, and the gulf between the north and
              south was not <u>too</u> deep and wide he would go to my home and
              marry me! I was paralyzed by this change of sentiment; my pride was touched and my
              heart deeply wounded. So I bade him <u>good-bye</u>, as I thought
                <u>forever</u>! How I got back to Loch Willow I know not, but I
                umbosomed my grief to Aunt Sara and she tried her best
              to comfort me. That night when I was utterly prostrated and crushed, she read in the
              bible to me and prayed with and for me.</p><p class="p10">The next morning I sent Frank a note relinquishing all the <u>past</u> and leaving him free of all care and anxiety about me and returned my
              engagement ring and all keepsakes &amp;c., all of which were speedily returned,
              without comment.</p><p class="p10">My eyes soon began troubling me and I determined to try the sulphur water at
              Stribling Springs and put myself under the care of Dr. Hendren. So for several weeks I
              was an inmate of dear Mrs. Chesley Kinne's sweet home on the hill, near the hotel. Her
              husband was the proprietor and a noble man. To defray board expenses I gave their two
              daughters music lessons. I was tortured for hours daily with leeches on my temples.
              But finally and providentially a letter came to me from Miss Mary Julia Baldwin,
              Augusta Female Seminary, asking if I would come and take Prof. Ettinger's overflow of piano pupils (17) and teach vocal music; that
              Mrs. Crawford taught all beginners, but Prof.
              E. had more pupils than he could teach; that between times she would like me to
              assist the other teachers by classes in Dictation, Botany, History and Latin. Said she
              needed someone to entertain the boarders our of school hours with charades, plays,
              etc., such as she knew I possessed a talent for writing and managing. That the town
              was so full of soldiers much of the time it was not safe for them to take daily walks
              as heretofore and so there was sad lack of recreation and entertainment. So in Sept. I became a teacher at the A. F. Sem. and roomed with my dear old music
              pupil, Maggie Eidson (afterwards Mrs. Capt. Pete Wilson)
              and worked <u>hard</u>, as did all those teachers in wartimes.</p><p class="p10">I always loved the study of human nature and the A. F. S. boarders offered an interesting
              field for observation and inspiration - the various girls suggesting topics and
              characters. I was very busy and took my turn with the other teachers in study hall at
              night, but managed to write two charades that winter. 1st, Mad-a-gas-car, in 5 scenes
              - 5th whole word, the Queen of Madagascar. The 1st scene a glimpse in the music room
              of an insane asylum, where Josie English (daughter of Col. English, and afterward the wife of Dr. Eyster of Balto.), one of the
              charming flowers of the Sem., represented Jenny Lind and
              sang with piano several of that Prima Donna's beautiful songs. Queen Victoria was the
              character I took and after the entertainment was over, as my friends came up to
              congratulate me on the success of the evening, our pastor, Rev.
              Wm. E. Baker, shook my hand cordially, saying, "Well,
              Miss Rounds, I feel sure your feet must have pressed the boards of a theatre, for you
              have the stage walk and stage step perfectly." He was much surprised when I assured
              him I had never seen either the outside or the inside of a play house. Because I was a
              "perfect brunette" the girls had conquered and compelled me to sit on the throne of
              their Queen and with a full array of my pages and gaily attired attendants, we must
              have presented, as was remarked, "a most imposing spectacle", for we had ransacked the
              town for costumes, ornaments and draperies!</p><p class="p10">I am glad I saved the other charade, "In-dig-na-tion" and have it typewritten for May
              and my other grandchildren. In the 4th scene of that "tion" (shun) I took the part of
              the adopted orphan cousin and sung with my guitar the popular southern war songs. </p><p class="p10">I will now make several extracts from my journal while at the A. F. Sem'y. in Staunton.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Notes to Memoir</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A letter from Papa in which he told me of Mamma's rapid decline, fixed my
              determination to plan to try to get thro' the lines of
              both armies, and when I had once decided it was <u>duty</u>, I felt
              that Providence would help me. So at 4 p. m. I went down to Uncle Jed's office, where
              Mr. Oeltman and Mr. Robinson were assisting him in drawing maps as fast as he surveyed
              them. Uncle Jed took a long walk with me and we discussed the situation and he
              promised to appraise me of any safe opening to start and to help me. all in his power
              - that if Pa could secure me a <u>pass</u> at Washington he tho't he could procure me one thro' the Confederate lines. This assurance was encouraging and braced my
              spirits.</p><p class="p10">The next day I told Miss Baldwin I would like to have a talk with her, but she was
              busy till after supper. Then she found me on my bed weeping and praying. She was
              surprised and distressed but did not blame me for leaving them. That day after dinner,
              as I was waiting in the parlor to give a music lesson, I saw a well known form pass on
              horseback! I almost felt my heart stop beating. I was glad he had recovered
              sufficiently to ride into town, but I felt as if. it was a "last look" and I don't
              know how I ever kept up until Miss Baldwin came. And when she heard all my sad story,
              she said, "My dear child, I know how you feel. I had just such an experience and I
              realize how you suffer - just how heartbroken you are." And she took me tenderly in
              her arms and pillowed my head upon her breast and let me cry, weeping and sympathising with me and tenderly caressing and kissing me
              like a mother, and with her arms about me, knelt beside my bed and prayed for me as
              none but an angel could. God bless Miss Mary Julia Baldwin!</p><p class="p10">The weary days that followed seemed to lengthen into never ending weeks while I
              waited. Cherished plans failed, cheerful openings suddenly closed up. Fresh
              opportunities tantalized by quick departure. Hopes were dashed. Prayerful wishes
              unfulfilled, until March 10th, when I decided to risk going down the valley by stage.
              One of my dear music pupils, Miss Estelle Hieronimus of Winchester, Va., having asked
              and received their cordial consent, invited me (through her parents) to go to their
              home, as soon as I arrived in Winchester, and remain until the coveted <u>Pass</u> from Washington arrived. When I heard of this unlooked
              for and providential arrangement, my heart leaped for joy! The next Sabbath Mr. Baker
                rec'd. into the church at communion, a young soldier
              of 18, with a crippled arm. It was a touching scene when surrounded by his sisters, he
              partook for the 1st time, the bread and wine!</p></p>

              a Capt. and a colonel. A Capt.C. B. Manton, who used to mess with Uncle Jed, belonged to the old
              Stonewall Brigade, captured when Gen. Stonewall Jackson
              was killed - taken to Camp Chase - after some weeks paroled to <u>stay at home</u>! Lived near Berryville, Clark Co.
              Very agreeable and entertaining. Shared my lunch with Capt.
              M. and a poor soldier who was going home without money to
              buy a single meal! Saw Mr. Coffman at Harrisonburg. Called on me at the hotel. Sorry
              to bid adieu to Capt. Manton at sundown at Mt. Jackson. I could scarcely keep back the tears. Felt so <u>alone</u> and night coming on. Left me in care of Mr. Baker,
              living 8 miles from Winchester. Moonlight, smooth macadamized pike. 4 hours more - but
              we travelled fast. Mr. Baker was very kind and attentive, but I grew too weary to be
              communicative and slept most of the way to Strasburg. There we found only tolerable
              accommodations. It was eleven o'clock and I was so worn out as to find it difficult to
              undress. Next morn. was the Sabboth, March 13th.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>March 13th.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Mr. Baker kindly assisted me in getting my Pass endorsed by Capt. Davis, commandant of the Post. We encountered some difficulty because
              my 1st Pass did not have the signatures of persons (public men) whom he knew in
              Augusta Co. that could identify me. I told him of my Uncle
              Jed Hotchkiss, one of the Corps of Engineers on Gen.Stonewall Jackson's staff - said yes, he knew Maj. Hotchkiss well and if only had <u>his</u> signature it
              would be <u>all sufficient</u>. I was in a distressing dilemma! But
              Mr. Baker vouched for me and my tears seemed to turn the scale - for after one look at
              my brimming eyes, the provost left me and presently sent in my Pass!</p><p class="p10">Had a miserable dinner and at 2 p. m. we started in small hack for Wincester, Mr.
              Baker and I. Had to offer $50 before we could secure a driver and conveyance! Cool,
              but pleasant ride. Mr. Baker narrating how he was captured and imprisoned by Gen. Milroy - Mr. Baker left me at sundown and I rode alone
              the rest of the way - 8 miles. Mr. B. had intrusted me
              with several business letters to deliver to his friend and my future host, Mr. J. P.
              Heironimus - at whose door I arrived about 8 o'clock and where by Mr. and Mrs.
              Heironimus I was most cordially and hospitably received, although to them an utter
              stranger! And generously entertained for three never to be forgotten weeks, while
              waiting day after day for the desired Pass from Washington, D. C. to reach me. I
              whiled away many an hour beginning a hexagon worsted quilt - such as I had seen and
              admired on Grandma McClung's bed in her room at the A. F. Sem., where the girls gathered daily
              for awhile after supper to be "mothered" by that sweet, delightful old lady, whose
              gentle, loving influence combined, with that of Miss Agnes McClung, gave a home
              atmosphere to the Seminary it can never have again. (The matron was Miss Agnes
              McClung.)</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Notes to Memoir</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Mother and daughter, "Grandma" and "Aunt Agnes" were so good to everyone and kindly
              gave me the pattern of plan of putting the bright colored patches together with black,
              Mrs. Hieronimus' friends called on me and donated many gay an dchoice pieces for
              patchwork. It was a sweet home - with fine conservatory where they raised oranges and
              lemons. The town was occupied first by the "Yankees" and then by the Rebels. We could
              tell at night by the sound whether the troops passing along the streets were on the
              saddles of the Yanks, as they squeaked like new and the thud and tramp of the cavalry
              horses proclaimed their well shod steeds - while the poor Johnny Rebs made a very
              different impression in their turn. Whenver the "coast was clear" we took walks about
              town - to the public gardens - Mt. Hebron cemetery - to the
              Fort, built by Gen. White and used after by Banks and
              Milroy - battle grounds, fortifications, etc., and the various churches. I had been
              sorry to travel on Sunday to reach Winchester, but it was my only alternative, as they
              told me a raid of Averill's was daily expected up the valley - but I found kind
              friends and every attention and so enjoyed my frequent visits with Mrs. H. to the
              greenhouse, among her oranges and lemons, roses, verbenas, geraniums, etc. And thus
              the time of my detention passed until April 4, when the journey over unknown country
              of 22 miles was begun to Martinsburg!</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>April 1864

<p class="p11"><b>April 4</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">After the farewells to my kind host and hostess, I started in a small oldfashioned one horse hack - steps and door on each side
              and open in front to the driver's seal. This was occupied by an old grizzled darkey -
              Uncle George - one of the old time respectful polite kind, of whom I was not at all
              afraid. My trunk was fastened to the rear and I had the one seat to myself. I felt so
              thankful for past blessings and not at all nervous or timid, for I seemed to hear the
              promise, "I will never leave or forsake them!" It was a dull, cloudy, chill day, but I
              rejoiced over every foot of the road as so much accomplished toward my desired haven.
              My important and precious Pass was safe in my hand bag and I was going on to Papa! A
              misty rain began to fall, but I was comfortable. I had enjoyed an early and fine
              dinner, so was neither tired or hungry and the rain could not touch me - so we plodded
              on, altho' our driving nag was thin, old and slow of
              gait. But after 5 or 10 miles he was forced to stop his jog and take a rest. All at
              once down came my trunk into the middle of the road! So "Uncle George" and I were soon
              attacking the situation and in due time the repacking was over, the trunk tied
              together and lifted inside the vehicle, one end rest on my seat and the other end on
              the front seat. The position cramped my knees and crowded Uncle George, but there was
              no other way and we traveled on, uncomfortable, silent and patient as possible. At
              length, as an early dusk grew on apace, we saw before us on a hill top a soldier on
              horseback. I recognized him as our first outpost! The hill was short, but steep, and
              when we were about half way up came the loud command "Halt!" I said to the darkey, "We
              can't stop, so drive right on." I was not the least bit frightened, but very indignant
              as he yelled again "Halt!" "We will halt," I said "when we get to the top." He rode up
              in front of us as if to block our way and asked, "Who are you? Where are you going?
              What do you want?" I answered coolly "I'll show you presently" and produced my Pass,
              which he examined critically - then returned to me saying, as if confering a <u>great favor</u>, "Pass on." Before long we encountered several
              infantry outposts; but they were gentlemanly and on telling them I wished to see the
              commanding General of their camp, they offered to take me directly there. On arriving
              at the woodland where were many troops and tents, several soldiers approached and I
              asked one of them to please inform the General that a lady wished to speak with him.
              He soon returned with the message. "The General is at supper, but will be here
              shortly." When he came I found him very pleasant and a perfect gentleman, so when I
              had shown him my pass and explained that my father was awaiting my arrival in
              Martinsburg, he said, "All right, Miss Rounds. I will order a guard for your
              protection the remainder of the way to town and to the Provost's office." I thanked
              the General heartily for his great kindness, we shook hands and presently I found
              myself "traveling in state", escorted by a convoy of soldiers filed on either side of
              my vehicle. But I smiled to think for friendly were the darkness and misty rain of the
              dimly lighted streets in partially concealing the ludicrous spectacle of a bony horse,
              an antiquated carriage, an old grey headed negro and a girl within, half hidden by her
              trunk and altogether paralyzed, <u>she thought</u>, by its cruel
              pressure; all affording a picture of a Southern spy under arrest and being taken
              before an officer of the law! When at last we halted I asked one of the guard to
              please run up to the office and ask for Dr. Nelson Rounds. He quickly came back with
              the news he had not come back from supper, but would probably be there now in a few
              moments. My guards were faithfully at their posts of duty when I heard my father's
              voice in the distance. He was hurrying back and saying, "Yes, I have been here about 3
              weeks waiting for a safe chance to send my daughter her Pass so she could meet me here
              and we could go right home together." "O, Papa!" I cried. "I am <u>here</u>, <u>right here</u>." The next moment Pa's arms were
              around me, his loving, warm lips pressed to mine! O, the relief in that sudden change
              from care, anxiety and solicitude to the restful love of my father's protection; the
              music of his sweet voice that I had not heard for nearly four years! We drove at once
              to a saddler's shop and while my trunk was rehinged and strapped, I took a much needed
              refreshment at a restaurant close by and Papa settled accounts with Uncle George. Then
              we repaired to the depot, checked our baggage, got our tickets and sat down to wait
              for a belated train. The tantalizing bulletin board promised its appearance in "an
              hour or two", and so sped the whole night, but I got several happy naps on Pa's
              shoulder and was delighted that we were at last "homeward bound!"</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Notes to Memoir</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We got an early breakfast and were quickly on board when the train for Harper's Ferry
              left at 7 o'clock. We arrived there at 3 p. m., but were doomed to another delay,
              until 9:30, when we took the sleeper for Harrisburg, Pa. In the morning the first thing that greeted my sight was the broad, noble
              Susquehanna, alive with rafts. It reminded me sadly of the Potomac and the loved blue
                mts. of the Shenandoah Valley! I saw soldiers in blue
              on the train, at the stations, but they failed to elicit my admiration and sympathy as
              the "boys in Gray" would have done. As we proceeded farther and farther north, I noted
              the prosperity and public pride of the country, evidenced in farms, villages, towns,
              highways and by-ways. Meadows were green - pasture lands rich in herds of fat horses,
              cattle and sheep. I saw no wildness of barren, neglected fields, no women ploughing or
              planting corn, no ashes of burned homes, none plundered, wrecked or abandoned. On one
              side of Dixon's line, plenty, comfort, peace; on the other desolation, want,
              sacrifice, trouble, poverty and <u>war</u>.</p><p class="p10">I had admired the view at Harper's Ferry - the scenery as we approached Baltimore -
              and now we were nearing the beautiful cities of Harrisburg, Pa. and Elmira, N. Y. Here we were detained
              again, but at Waverly (where Rev. Leland Jackson
              Huntley, Ettie's husband, was pastor of 1st Baptist Church) we were gladly surprised
              by seeing Mr. H., Ettie and Nellie Huntley! Ettie kindly rode with us to Smithton's,
              where we bade her good-bye and were once more homeward bound to Nichol's parsonage.
              There joy and sadness were mingled for me amid affectionate welcome, and caresses -
              for my mother was so pale and thin, tho' convalescing -
              but my dear brothers Fred and Arthur were now young men, tall as I, and my sisters,
              too, Emma, Mattie and Ruth, were superb young ladies. So I felt almost as if among
              strangers and it remained for us to grow accustomed to each other. How the girls
              laughed when I unpacked my trunk! "O, Allie!" they said, "Your clothes are so out of
              style and funny!" When I told them the debaige I had on cost $200, they nearly took a
              fit! The very next day goods for a new dress was bought and I taken to a dressmaker
              post haste - and then as I tried on my new waist the anti-slavery madam ordered, "Hook
              it up yourself!" "Thank you", I answered "I prefer to do so." On all sides I seemed to
              be curiously stared at as a monster of a red hot rebel, and I felt I was being dubbed
              "a copper head" for daring to like the South and to believe they were right! So when I
              found the whole family packing up to leave in a few days for a new pastorate at
              Berkshire, Tioga Co., N. Y.,
              I was rejoiced and very much relished the change from Nichols to Brookside Parsonage!</p><p class="p10">There the town was mostly one long street, on which were residences, churches,
              stores, P. O., &amp;c. At one end our new home nestled in a lovely sugar maple
              grove, thro' which ran a babbling brook, where we all
              would meet to visit, read, sew, or write letters as the case might be. It proved an
                <u>oasis</u> in the desert of life to me. I soon found myself
              among kind neighbors and friends. I was made the organist - head of a large infant
              class - and had also a large class in piano music, as there happened then to be no
              other music teacher there. So I was very busy and gave my sisters lessons, too.
              Besides I taught on the intervening days of Tuesdays and Fridays a class of piano
              pupils at Newark Valley, 6 odd miles away. Pa had a comfortable buddy and a gentle
              horse and I enjoyed the drive in early morning and returning in cool of evenings.
              Sometimes I stayed all night with one of two intimate friends, Sophie Noble or Amelia
              Patterson, whom I knew 4 years before when we lived there and Pa was pastor (and I
              left in 1860 for the Southland!) Occasionally one of the girls would accompany me and
              visit old friends. A nephew of Sophie Noble's was one of my scholars and a niece was
              another.</p><p class="p10">I also took French lessons of Amelia Patterson, she having had fine advantages at a
              French boarding school in the vicinity, where was a colony of cultured Swiss French,
              who insisted their accent and pronunciation was purer than the Parisian.</p><p class="p10">Among my new friends at Berkshire was a Mrs. Lily Ducloux, whose maiden name was
              "L'Esperance de Dieu". We were all fond of these dear French people, one family in
              particular - that of Mr. and Mrs. Albert Chavannes, with whom we corresponded for
              several years.</p><p class="p10">Until this April of 1864 I had never seen my baby sister Clara Gertrude! But now the
              family chain was united. At one end, the eldest child Allie, the <u>southern</u> girl; at the other the youngest, baby Clara, now nearly three years
              olf, having been born at Newar<i>[deleted: d]</i><i>[added: k]</i> Valley August 10, 1861. I loved her dearly and she was my almost constant
              companion about the house or out in the maple grove. She sat in her high chair at
              table beside me and I loved to study the expressions of her changing countenance. She
              and Pa's large blue eyes and long eyelashes. She added her music to that of Ma's two
              canaries, "Allie" and "Frank", and with the cheer of Ma's flowering plants and vines
              helped to make our parsonage home bright and happy.</p><p class="p10">Early in April visited Ettie in Waverly with Emma. Afterwards to see cousins Esther

              Lamb Harris at Owego. Trips to Newark Valley and lessons to my Berkshire class filled

              household pets, Bessie and Jack, Cotton Tail and Tabby Cat were disgracefully noisy
              for Sunday. Everytime Jack attempted to help himself to the saucer of mill, Tabby
              would box his ears soundly and then the thumping and scampering antics were most
              undignified and ludicrous!</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>May 2.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Was just improving from an attack of diptheria, when a letter came to me, via
              Phillippi, in Frank's own handwriting, sealed and no eyes had read it but mine! What a
              comfort! He called me "Ever dear and precious Allie". Yes! The old pride <u>in</u> and love <u>for</u> me were there! He
              wrote asking if I could <u>ever</u> forgive his consent to my going
              North in the dangerous time of Civil War. Said 'twas racking
              pain, heavy cares and pressing fears conspired to make him do it. Begged me to ask my
              parents if they could pardon such unkind and unjust treatment of their noble child.
              And if we all could and would forgive him he promised to devote his whole remaining
              life to my care and happiness; and as soon as the war closed and it was practicable,
              he would come to claim me for his bride! This tangible proof of his long continued
              devotion caused the tears of joy to start, but thro' them
              I saw a glorious rainbow of promise, peace, hope and love. They said to me, "How
              bright and happy you look! Now you'll soon be well and strong!" After this I loved my
              south window more than ever. The sunshine seemed to stream in warmer, the air to be
              more balmy, the bird music sweeter than before. There I penned a prompt reply to one I
              had never ceased to love, granting entire forgiveness and bearing the sincere
              assurance of a cordial welcome to Brookside Parsonage whenever he should favor us with
              a visit!</p><p class="p10">Ah, me! How little we either of us <u>dreamed</u> that a long

<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>May 20.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I took early stage at 7 o'clock for Newark Valley. Lessons all the A. M. Eve. Ma called for me at Sophie's with buggy and we had a
              nice ride of 16 miles on fine road to Owego - where we shopped till dark. Stayed at
              dear Cousin Scott Harris'. Next morning Amelia arrived on stage and at 10 o'clock she
              and I started for Humphreysville, Penn., to visit
              our brothers, Joseph Patterson and John Rounds.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>(May. 21.)</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Amelia and I visited the big saw mill, Joseph showing us his fine Washington engine,
              its machinery, working, &amp;c. After I arranged John's trunk, took needed
              stitches, and read John's private paper, the "Observer", edited and compiled by and
              for himself, for mental diversion. P. M. He and I walked to the pine woods, sat on a
              log and chatted, he reciting his experiences the past five months and also a synopsis
              of his life for 4 years past. This interchange of confidences was very sweet and
              grateful to us both. All spent eve. at old Mrs. Weiss';
              where there was a piano, so we had music and sang together out of Golden Choir and the
              Jubilee - had all four parts. Seemed so like old times with John singing by my
            side.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Joseph took Amelia, John and me in a carriage to Buttermilk Falls, 4 cascades. Passed
              Campbell's Ledge at head of Wyoming Valley. On same Mt.

              depth. We saw it <i>[added: in]</i> returning that night and
              falling from such a height its music was very sweet, wild and romantic. We stopped to
              listen and I fell into a pleasant reverie from which, when the horses started, I
              disliked to waken. We were traveling along side the canal and the lights of
              approaching baots streamed across the dark water, as on hearing the locks their horns
              sounded musically in the distance and carried me back where bugle notes always do.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>May 25.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">p. m. We visted "Queen Esther's Rock". We gathered flowers from the very spot where
              the heartless Queen had stood and let the blood of the poor mangled whites flow
              beneath her cruel feet! She was of Indian and French descent and very influential with
              the Indians, in the time of the great "Wyoming Massacre", when a brave lot of old men
              and boys were met and overpowered by a large force of British, tories and Indians and
              brutally slaughtered. We also visited the monument at Wyoming, erected by the
              descendants of these noble patriots. In a beautiful quiet spot near the village we ate
              our picnic supper. We bought strawberries from a garden opposite, whose owner from 1/2
              acre had already sold 5 bushels at 40c per quart! As we
              rode through this far famed Wyoming Valley I feasted on its blue mts., wonderful scenery and delicious air. We passed thro' Kingston and by the Wyoming Seminary, where Ettie,
              Emma, Mattie and I had all been students. Recalled the times when I used to ride over
              the 2 miles from Wilkes-barre to Kingston in one of 3
              omnibuses running from Wilkesbarre to Kingston when Pa
              was pastor of the M. M. church in Wilkesbarre, 1850 and 1851.
                Enjoyed crossing the covered bridge 1/4 of a mile long over the Susquehanna; this
                immensely long bridge of two roadways and raised foot-walk on either side, was lit
                up by gas and rafts were floating peacefully down the river. We drove to the
                Exchange Hotel and put up for the night.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>("Next morning")</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Next morning our carriage was in waiting to take us to Prospect Rock. Started at 8
              o'clock for the Mountain Top House, where we relished a cool lemonade and then pursued
              our way on foot to the crest of the mt., which commanded
              an extensive prospect for many miles in each direction. Wilkesbarre, Kingston, Plymouth, Wyoming and Troy, all were plainly visible
              along the river and with our spy glass we decerned the Sem'y. at Kingston and the monument at Wyoming. It was from this lofty point
              "Prospect Rock" that the Indians formerly took their treacherous observation upon the
              valley below. On returning to the hotel we visited the Billiard Rooms and a gentleman
              kindly explained the game to Amelia and me. Said the balls cost $40 and the tables
              $600 apiece. A rest on the back piazza and one more iced lemonade, and we started to
              visit a coal mine! There was one not far away and Amelia and John had never seen
              inside one before, altho' Joseph and I had both been
              within such dark, black underground caverns. We decided to enter by a drift rather
              than a shaft or a slide. It was a new mine and not many chambers to explore. But the
              click of the picks in the hands of the miners, the little lamps fast on the front of
              each laborer's cap, making the darkness visible, as well as the columns left at
              intervals to support the walls overhead - the track on which the mules conveyed the
              loaded box cars to the entrance, made a depressing picture we were thankful to forget
              as we emerged once more into daylight and life above ground.</p><p class="p10">We stopped for a rest and a good dinner at Eagle Hotel. There I read in N. Y.

              Comfortable, happy ride beside John on back seat to Greenwood. The quantities of
              laurel in bloom along the mountain roads looked by starlight like patches of snow.
              That pleasant midnight drive will long be remembered as the delightful close of my 3rd

              can leave a tangible memorial behind me when I flit <u>Southward</u>! For I've had a short, hurried letter from Frank saying he <u>hopes</u> to be with me early in October. But has been very busy
              since the surrender settling up his father's business and estate. (Capt. Henry Sterrett died during latter part of Civil War.)
              This he finds a most discouraging task amid the sad conditions now prevailing thro' the entire south, where every sort of industry is
              paralyzed. Just as soon as the public routes of travel are again established
              northward, he will leave all his work and cares and <u>fly</u> to

              have a dressmaker in the house sewing on my <u>trousseau</u>! I
              consider myself most fortunate in a gift of the latest N.

              early in Sept. married Mr. Proctor, a young Boston

              inside, so it and my travelling basket suggest that I really must soon be going on a
                "<u>bridal trip</u>"! Pa and Ma have given me a beautiful wedding
              silk, a light brown seeded silk, $50, and we have the stylish black lace, jet beaded
              sets, $10, for caps and cuffs of sleeves and collar piece. It is to be worn on the
              approaching "church wedding occasion", with white kids, dainty white lace bonnet and a
              rather large circular cape of soft White French merino, tied with long white silk cord
              and tassels. My "going away" gown is now finished - a dark tan ladies' cloth suit,
              with coat all trimmed with several bolts of ribbon to match - skirt very full - 7
              breadths!</p><p class="p10">[Memoir addition: (A contrast 50 years after is the <u>other</u>
              extreme, when in 1913 a dress can be made and worn of only 3 or 4 yards of goods, and

              of the Goddess Fashion!)]</p><p class="p10">I do hope and believe Frank will admire all of my wardrobe; he is so <u>observing</u> and knows when a lady is dressed tastefully and
              becomingly. My green silk was fortunately so full it could be remodeled into a handsom Princesse and the decorations on skirt and sleeve are
              of the "buckle and tongue" pattern, made of black velvet ribbon and spangled with
              steel beads. The dress I like best of all is a dark brown Alpaca, with white hair
              stripe-corded at arms and bottom of basque in white, with while ball buttons at bottom
              of skirt a deep ruffle of darker solid brown alpaca, machine fluted, and one of same

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Well, I was spared the waiting of but <u>one</u> more "long, long,
              weary day", for on the night of Oct. 5th something
              happened. At ten o'clock, when the stage passed by, I sat in the parlor disconsolate
              and with a touch of earache. The night was cool and raw and I was on the floor in a
              heap beside the warm stove heating my handkerchief and pressing it to my ear, with my
              head on a nearby ottoman. After a half hour or so my ear became easier and I more
              comfortable, so that when I heard a knock at the front door, I was rather loth to get up and answer the summons. But on one else had heard
              the knock and I went on, wondering who could call at such an unseasonable hour. I
              unlocked and opened the door, when lo! and behold! who should be standing there with
              valise in hand, but "my own brave Cavalier!" "Why, Frank!" I exclaimed. "Did you drop
              from the clouds? The stage went by some time ago." "Ha! Ha!" he laughed. "I was tired
              and preferred to walk from the hotel, though they told me it was quite a long walk to
              the end of the street." As soon as I could recover from thiswonderful surprise I ran to proclaim the glad news to the rest of the
              household. First I brought in Ma and Pa to be introduced and I ran to the diningroomto help make the coffee and spread the supper for
              our way worn guest. None of my family having ever seen Frank before, I was curious to
              note their first impressions. Ma came out first and I eagerly asked, "Ma, how do you
              like my sweetheart?" "Oh, I love him already and can believe he is all you have
              represented him to be". The girls, Emma, Mattie and Ruth, went next to shake hands and
              offer words of welcome to the <u>new</u> brother to be and when
              they came back confessed to have "fallen in love" at first sight and they praised his
              sweet, rich voice - his military bearing, etc. At the first opportunity I asked Pa
              what he thought of my Cavalry officer. "I admire him very much indeed, Allie, and
              believe you have chosen well." All this overflowed my cup of bliss and until the "wee
              sma'" hours I was so happy the reality seemed like a most beautiful <u>dream</u>!</p></p>

              listener but little Clara, who flitted about, gay as a bird. We had so much to tell
              and the saddest news to me was that our dear Retta Gooch Hamilton was no more. She
              died Sept. 8! And we are to be married Oct. 8. Next Sunday! I hear Ma saying to Frank, "You will
              have to curb Allie's ambition. It has always been greater than her strength. So to <u>keep</u> her you will have to hold her in check and <u>make</u> her rest." So now I'll fly back.</p></p>

              room used to be at the <u>other</u> end of the long porch. Ours is
              "West End" and now that we are nicely settled and well rested, I must jot down some
              memoranda of that final Sunday at home - when "Miss Rounds" disappeared forever! That
              joyous, beautiful morning in the church, when Pa read the notices; this came last
              "There will be a marriage ceremony in this church at 8 o'clock to-night." Then he read the 2nd hymn, but I fear its beauty was
              unappreciated for a rustle seemed to pervade the congregation and many eyes were
              turned toward the handsome <u>stranger</u> beside Mrs. Rounds in
              the minister's pew; and not a few looked around to see if "Miss Allie" was at her post
              before the new organ in the gallery. She was there, but so disconcerted that she found
              it difficult to play the tune thro' first as a prelude,
              and while the first verse was being sung, actually lost her place and had to stop and
              listen to the choir before she found it again! As soon as the benediction <u>Amen</u> was spoken, she hurried home to avoid observation - the
              gaze of the curious and the amused smile of friends.</p><p class="p10">That P. M. Ma and the girls made boquets for the altar
              table and the pulpit and with the help of a kind friend and neighbor, burnished up the
              chandelier to lend added brightness to the night scene.</p><p class="p10">Pa gave me a gold watch that had descended from his uncle Amasa Lynde of Canada among
              other keepsakes after his death. It being a large Hunting case, Pa had procured in its
              place a pretty small one with white face, I wished Frank to "Christian" the watch for
              me, so I had already a chain made of a strand of my long jet black hair. It had gold
              clasps at each end and a plate in the center, with "Frank" on one side and "Allie" on
              the other. Frank was delighted with the chain and I with the watch. My three sisters
              acted as my maids and dressed the bride! All pronounced the ensemble <u>lovely</u>. Frank kissed me, the bell thrilled my every nerve as
              the whole family followed in the wake of the officiating minister, Rev. Nelson Rounds, D. D., across the street. As the bell
              ceased, Frank and I, with our waiters, Mr. and Mrs. Albert Chavannes and Mr. and Mrs.
              Allen, walked over to the church. One couple of our attendants entered the right
              aisle, the other couple the left aisle, starting a little in advance of the bride and
              groom, who took the middle aisle, and thus all met before the altar at the same time.
              Pa had married sister Henrietta, but I thought I never heard his voice sound sweeter
              than this night when he propounded the marriage vows to Frank and me. Frank's
              responses were so clear and dignified I was encouraged to do likewise, altho' my heart was beating loudly and I realized the
              solemnity of the hour that made us husband and wife.</p><p class="p10">As we passed down the aisle I could hear the audible whispers of "Yankee and a Rebel"
              and I felt like saying, "You are greatly mistaken. It is <u>two</u>
              Rebels!"</p><p class="p10">On our return to the parsonage parlor, Ma served refreshments to the bridal party of
              6 and the family of 8, three kinds of cake and lemonade - congratulations from each
              and all followed - the parting good-nights said and I flew to the girls' room and
              undressed - then with kisses and loving embraces, I left them and went to Frank in the
              South chamber, where Frank and I read together the page for Oct. 8th in my "Mind and Words of Jesus", and kneeling side by side, asked God
              to bless our united lives!</p></p>

              point out the line of sugar maple groves all along the pike. Arriving at the depot we
              had a half hour to wait and Pa said, "Well, Allie, I have a new chapter to add to your

              horse and asked, 'Isn't this Dr. Rounds?' 'Yes,' I said, and he proceeded to relate

              the sweetheart ties of his and your early years at N. Y.

              we were most hospitably entertained. Unfortunately I had a bad headache and so Cousin
              Lizzie accompanied Frank "sight-seeing". On Tuesday p. m. in N.
                Y. we had witnessed from our balcony the passing of a long procession, in
              celebration of the birthday of Father Matthews, a Catholic Temperance Reformer. One of
              the bands played a march which struck me as being particularly sweet, and afterwards I
              found the music - Fredonia March - committed it to memory and often play it for the
              sake of dear "Auld Lang Syne".</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We left Philadelphia for Staunton and spent a night at Aunt Sarah Ann Hotchkiss' -
              where Nellie and Annie were delighted with my dresses, etc., and where I met once more
              my dear friend, Sarah B. Hotchkiss, who was then attending the A. F. Sem. and boarding at Uncle Jed's, on
              Water St.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Next day, Oct. 14, we arrived a<i>[deleted: r]</i><i>[added: t]</i> dear old Willow Glen. The "wedding
              trip" was over, but our "honeymoon" but just begun. (Sept. 1913. And I am happy to say it lasted for 34 years!) And I sang with
              heart and lips, "The happiest time is <u>now</u>!"</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We are boarding for the present here with Rebecca, Dr. R. S. Hamilton and his sister,
              Mollie. The latter I shall teach and give her music lessons. They all talk of moving
              up to Hill Top before long.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Letter from Ma says she is homesick to see me. Misses me sadly and all of them do.
              How I long to whisper in her ear my joys - my hopes and my fears!</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Feb. 1st.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">When Frank returned from town to-day
              bro't me a beautiful little sewing chair, $8.00, so very
              comfortable. (It has had a history of its own, for in it I named each one of all my
              five children.)</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Feb. 3.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Have bought a bible dictionary and a larger volume, Testament and Psalms, for our
              evening worship. Uncle Jed had given me $5.00, the price of the Confederate money I
              left with him to get changed before I went North in 1864. All with expenses paid
              $6.50.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Feb. 4.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">In Staunton - went to church services at Lunatic Asylum. Rev. Mr. Dice preached in their handsome chapel. Prof. Ettinger played the
              fine organ. I felt a great sympathy for the poor insane inmates and so thankful for
                <u>my</u> reason.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Feb. 10.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Sat in parlor p. m. with Mollie Hamilton and Mary Lizzie Bear. Then enjoyed an hour's
              practice on piano. After tea, in our cozy room - Frank reading in big rocker; I
              knitting pair of stockings. If all the pleasant thoughts I had were woven into my
              knitting, there would be not a few happy chapters - as I rocked in my sewing chair,
              Letter to-day from Emma saying John was clerking for Mr. Ziba
              Bennett in Wilkesbarre.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Feb. 14.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Dressed in green velvet and Frank took me down to spend day with Mrs. Harvey Bear. A
              very sweet visit. Read the beautiful poem Retta had written for her after Mr. Bear's
              sudden death in Army of Virginia. Think it by far the finest production I ever saw
              from Retta's pen. Found it good to "weep with those who weep."</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Feb. 22.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Mollie Hamilton getting along nicely with her studies and music. Eve. Frank brought up the saddle horses and we rode up the
              hill beyond the woods to get the fine view. Coming back through the fields we watched
              from our horses as the brilliant sunset glowed and then faded - and I thought</p><p class="p10">"All that's bright must fade,</p><p class="p10">The brightest still the fleetest!"</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Morn. Fed colt, Charlie, to make him love me. Enjoyed
              inhaling the bracing air and listening to red and bluebirds. Rode with Frank to top of
              hill facing Elliott's Knob. Magnificent view from summit in all directions. In a grove
              nearby coziest spot for a cottage. Night begun Frank pair of woolen socks.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I pause here to insert a page of "now" by way of contrast with the "then of 1863".
              The July papers of our day fill me with a joyful gratitude as I read the accounts of
              the recent Peace Jubilee celebrated at Gettysburg, Pa., July 1st to 5th inclusive, and the actors were 70,000 Federal and
              Confederate Veterans who met to review the scenes on the fields and hills around
              Gettysburg on July 1, 2, 3, and 4th, 1863, where was fought the most terrible
              engagement of the Civil War. It was called the "turning point", for although many
              fierce battles succeeded this up to the surrender of Robt.
              E. Lee to Ulysses Grant, April 1865, at Appomattox, yet Gen<i>[deleted: .]</i> Pickett's advance to meet the Yankees in the face
              of a murderous shower of artillery is acknowledged by universal consent to have been
              the bravest and grandest charge in all history. He was writing a last letter to his
                sweethear<i>[added: t]</i> wife - a few pencilled lines each
              day, which was so beautiful, so eloquent, so tender and pathetic, it would start tears
              from the stoniest heart!</p><p class="p10">At the Reunion, 50 years after, the cordian handshakes,
              the sincere smiles, the hearty words of welcome and the acknowledgements that time had
              melted away the asperities of antagonistic feelings, and the ready assertion that they
              now believed every man on the other side in 1863 had fought for what he thought was
                <u>right</u> - the sweet and forgiving spirit these old men
              exemplified in this, their last earthly meeting, reminds me of the angelic song,
              "Peace on earth, good will to men! Glory to God in the Highest!"</p></p>
