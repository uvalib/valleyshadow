<p class="p10">December 24<sup>th</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Captain:</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to request that I may be again allowed to employ a clerk. My
                    last clerk was discharged on the 30<sup>th</sup> of September 1866.</p>
<p class="p10">I consider it very essential that I should be at liberty to visit the different
                    portions of my Sub-Dist. that I may be thoroughly
                    acquainted with the condition of the Freedpeople and the disposition of the
                    whites. As I am now situated I am obliged to be at my office almost constantly
                    to attend to the wants of those who come.</p>
<p class="p10">I believe that much can be done toward securing just treatment of the Freedpeople
                    by traveling about; noting their condition; and when necessary reasoning with
                    their employers. There is already much destitution among the Freedpeople and
                    before the winter is through there will be much more <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>and it is quite
                    necessary that I should know of the extreme cases of destitution that I may
                    endeavor to have them properly cared for by the County Poor Commissioners.</p>
<p class="p10">Hoping that this application will receive favorable consideration.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Captain<br> Very Respectfully<br>Your Obt. Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Geo. T. Cook<br>1<sup>st</sup>
                        Lieut.
