<p class="p10">Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">I will attempt to write you a few lines in addition to what is enclosed to let you know that
     I am well and in good spirits except now and then, when we run short of rations which is very
     often As we are now across the mountain we have some prospect of rest soon. It is reported that

     Valley. The sound of the rail<i>[deleted: road]</i>car whistle is a great relief to men
     whose appetites are sharpened by hunger it betokens more to eat and of a better quality. I
     received a letter to day by A Smiley in which you said for me to write
     if I needed pants but I expect to draw a pair soon and thus save the risk of having them sent
     to me while we are not settled I was not surprized to hear of Miss
     Jennies marriage as Lieut Carson had told me of it before I
     received your letter But I will now close for the present by asking you to write soon and let
     me hear all the particulars.</p>
