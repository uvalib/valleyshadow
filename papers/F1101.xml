                <p>Smith describes camp life and remarks upon the terrible winter weather. He goes
                    on to complain about the war's length, angrily questioning the motives of
                    "rebels" and complaining about Virginia's terrain. Smith concludes by recounting
                    a recent skirmish with "rebel" forces. He goes out of his way to mention seeing
                    a "dead rebel."</p>
