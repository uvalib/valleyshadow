<h4>Augusta County: Margaret Ott to Enos Ott, December
                    6, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>In this letter to her brother, Margaret writes of efforts to start a petition to
                    get Enos out of the army as well as the efforts of neighbors to harvest their
                    crops. In the postscript, she mentions Confederate efforts to impress slaves
                    from citizens and her refusal to send their slave, Alf, off to them.</p>
