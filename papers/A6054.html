     Harpers Ferry we would not hear from you for some time I am very Sorry to hear that the measles
     are in Camp As it is A very dangerous disorder to be exposed in. I want you to use every
     precaution and be as careful of yourself as the circumstances in which you are placed will
     admit of. Some of the Ladyes are making Soldiers Cloakes out of their Piano covers; I have none But will send you one of my Oil cloth
