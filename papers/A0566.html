                    furlough he received on account of his typhoid fever, and talks about how hard

<p class="p10">My Dear Friend </p>
<p class="p10">As I feel quite lonesome this beautiful Sunday morning, My Thoughts wanded back to the good Old Times I have spent in
                    Winchester and also in your presence and I thought there would not be any
                    impropriety in dropping you a few lines as I thought you would be glad to hear
                    from me if I am a <i>[unclear: 
                        Rebel
                    ]</i> as I believe you are hard on them. Oh<sup>o</sup> if I
                    could hear that Miss Julie <i>[unclear: Hremer]</i> was still living when I
                    think of her (and that is often) it seems that it is not Possible that she is
                    dead. some times I think I am dreamming. But Alas it
                    is True Miss Lizzie I have been spending some <i>[deleted: very]</i> happy
                    days since I last saw you. I went from Winchester to Staunton and staid there in the Hospital a month and I went to my
                    company and did not <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> remain there but a few days when I was taking
                    with the Typhoid fever and got a furlough for 50 days. I just got back. no
                    person ever enjoyed themselves better than I did. It is reported every wher I am engaged to be married. They had a
                    day set. I did not know it untill the time had past. I
                    wish I had of know it sooner I might of not disappointed Them. you know who it
                    is I guess. That Young Lady I was <i>[unclear: 
                        corresponing
                    ]</i> with when I was staying with you all. I enjoyed myself very much in
                    her company whilst at home. We took a trip to Richmond while I was at Home. I
                    wish you could of been with us. I often wish I could be at your house. I made My
                    Sisters believe I was engaged to a Miss Dieffendaffer
                    off Winchester. I just done it to
                    get them to tease me. has Miss Maggey got well and <u>is</u>
                    <u>she</u>
                    <u>married </u><u>yet</u>. I guess she is
                    &amp; Miss Camilla &amp; Sallie how are they all also that Good Old
                    Father &amp; Mother <i>[added: of yours]</i> are they
                    well &amp;c<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> give them all my kindest regards. Tell M<sup>r</sup> Dieffendaffer I hope he will be at Home next time I go
                    to Winchester. M<sup>r</sup> Williams sends his respects to all I
                    suppose <i>[deleted: he is]</i> you are acquainted with him. he claims Miss
                    Maggie as a sweetheart. I am trying to get a transfer to the Calvary in the
                    Valley for I want to see Winchester so bad. We are seeing hard times now.
                    building fortifications along The Rapidan. we are expecting a Battle ever day. our independence is mighty hard to get, but we
                    are not discouraged yet I do not belive it ever will
                    be settled that is by fighting.</p>
<p class="p10"><u>President</u> Davis reviews our corps tomorrow. I wish he
                    had of staid where he belongs for I do hate this
                    inspection. we have been building winter quarters for 2 months but cannot get to
                    stay in them the Yankees got our best <i>[unclear: 
                        houses
                    ]</i>. I wish I was in that fine house beyond Winchester I built. Some mean
                    Yankee is living in it now I expect. <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> If I donot get killed in this War I expect to visit old Winchester and
                    hunt me a wife for I have taking a perticular favor to the Ladies of that place. all
                    Soldiers speak more of Winchester than any place we ever been at.</p>
<p class="p10">I will bring my badly written letter to a clos. Hoping
                    you will honor me with a letter Tell all of your Sisters to write to me. Give my
                    love to M<sup>rs</sup> Hremer &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> and all of
                    my kind friends.</p>
<p class="p10">And much love to you all</p>
