<p class="p10">March 28, 1864</p>
<p class="p10">MITCHEL'S STATION, VA.,</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Our Regiment -- the 108th Pennsylvania Volunteers -- expects to be home in a few
                    days. No doubt our place of rendezvous will be Camp Reynolds or Curtin. It is
                    now a little over two years since we left Harrisburg for Washington about nine
                    hundred strong. We can return with something over two hundred, all told. With
                    few expectations, nearly all have reinlisted as Veteran Volunteers.
                    Unfortunately we are none of the pet Regiments; but what have those darlings
                    performed? Let the honest soldier answer. When you look upon the decimated ranks
                    of the 107th, and ask the question, Where are all those bouyant souls that left
                    Harrisburg March 8th,1862? I can only say -- let the battles from Cedar Mountain
                    to the Three Days' fight at Gettysburg furnish the reply. -- Our Regiment has
                    indeed seen active service. Never favored, but knowing our services in the field
                    were required, we always held in remembrance, when a soldier is called upon, to
                    battle he must go, and nobly would the 107th carry aloft the bright "escutchon
                    of our own Keystone State, in the din of battle," amidst the clash of arms, and
                    the cannon's roar. We have established a bright record in the service of our
                    country, and I hope the historians will do us justice. I could write a volume,
                    but I must be brief. We are holding the post of honor on the extreme front. I
                    will close by adding, the boys are all well, and as we expect soon to be home, I
                    will give you a greater detail of our doings, &amp;c. </p>
