<h4>Augusta County: Geraldine McGuffin to John B.
                    McGuffin, [no date]<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Geraldine McGuffin writes to her cousin, John B. McGuffin, with news from home,
                    including other members of the extended McGuffin family. She also writes that
                    she has fallen in love with a cousin of hers from Louisiana. Although there is
                    no date, the tone of the letter possibly places it in the early years of the
                    war.</p>
