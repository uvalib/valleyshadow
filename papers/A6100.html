<p class="p10">April the 22<sup>nd</sup> 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Columbia Boon Co.Mo.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">I have just arrived at home once more, was glad to find youre letter
     here waiting for me, it is always a pleasure to received them; and take great delight in
     answering your letters, but the great misfortune is, I never have any
      thing interesting to write. I have been trying to make me a school for some time but
     have failed in every attempt. I was late in beginning I was in Johnson Co. and when I came back the schools were all taken or at least the ones that I wanted.
     Mary and Darthula are teaching we have to paddle our own canoes. I am afraid my canoe will be
     very hard to manage this summer, but I <u>trust</u> that I may land on the
     shore safe. We are not living on the same farm we were, when I last wrote to you but on a great
     deal prettier place, I feel<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/Smiley70b.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley70b.gif"></center></a><br><br> more like I was at home here than anywhere I have been since I
     have been in the state The dwelling is of brick, two rooms above &amp; two below; brother
     Frank is living in one end of the house, he &amp; pa are going to farm together; we will
     have plinty of fruit of different kind if nothing happens it, the
     trees are all in bloom, We are having a very backward spring, the farmers have never began to
     plough yet. Southern persons are very low spirited here they think we will have worse times
     since the death of Lincoln. I am loth to believe the southern men,
     after having so much of the best blood of the South spilt will
     surrender to the very ones that caused so much trouble, I am glad to find that there are some
     that are true to the cause. I would like to have peace but not the way we are to have it, I
     would be willing to suffer the hardships of war four years longer if at the close, we could
     have <u>freedom</u> with our peace.<br> I am glad to know your Sister Mary
     is going<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/Smiley70c.jpg"><center><img src="images/Smiley70c.gif"></center></a><br><br> to school, for it is the only thing a person can retain, education
     I mean. It always was very important to have an education, but it appears to be more essential
     now than ever. The family join me in love to you and the other boys that are in prison; also to
     friends who are now living in the Old Dominion state. I remain as ever </p>
