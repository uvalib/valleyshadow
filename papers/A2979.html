<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">April 7th 1863</p>
<p class="p10">At Home</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">Truly time has seen many days pass &amp; your letter remained unanswered, I
                    have procrastinated untill I am aschamed to seat my self to write eaven to
                    the kindest of friends. One request I will ask of you that is to forgive
                    &amp; forget, I intended writing before I left camp. But after I had a
                    chance for a furlough I thought I would wait untill I
                    got home &amp; then I might come down, But alas it seems that I can never
                    get away from home, I have had very bad health ever since I came home. Some days
                    I suffer with chills &amp; fevers with violent headeache &amp; pains in my limbs. Father is very ill with the
                    mumps, though I think he is getting better, It will be my time to have them
                    next, as I never had them, I have had chances to have taken them before, Proberably I may miss them this time, I wount care if I ware so
                    fortunate. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Well I reckon you think, "What have I been doing towards
                    enjoying myself" since I came home, The blues have been my most constant
                    companion I declair I never was as lonesome in my
                    life Time seems to stand still on her wheels, Tom is busy blowing so if I wanted to go anywhare I
                    have no horse to wride. I formed a slight acquaintance
                    with your friend Fannie Seems to be a very nice girl, Kind I think would make a
                    noble coquet, But you must not tell her that I ever
                    thought such a thing, well you know that it is natural for self willed man to
                    form an opinion of the fairer sext on first sight. Well I
                    do not know what to write to interrest you I promist to answer the questions that I asked in my
                    last letter in reference to your Cousin Lizzie, But I will wait hoping that I
                    may see you before long. Then I can answer you verbaly, I know that I can sadisfy you in
                    that way better than by writing I suppose you have already form some idea of my
                    reason for asking you. <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>I hope that I may soon get my health &amp;
                    be able to help work some on the farm as we will be late with the spring crop I
                    suppose you ware surprised to hear of me coming home as
                    you wrote that I wount come home for six months, <i>[deleted: Thare]</i> if I could get a furlough. Tharefore
                    dont suppose you are very ancious to see me, But for my part I never was as ancious to see you in my life Though you may think my actions do not
                    prove it, Well you must recolect my health
                    &amp; more I have no way of getting about, Dispair not I will be down ear long, And then my
                    long absence will make it a hapier meeting, Often you
                    are by my side in my nightly dreams them it seemes that
                    I am happy, But I wake up &amp; find it all delusion I must bring this uninterresing letter to a close I hope this may
                    find you enjoying your usual good health if I have written anything in this
                    letter to mar your feeling your parden I crave</p>
<p class="p10">From your attached friend</p>
