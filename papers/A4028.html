<p class="p10">March 20<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Hamilton's Crossing</p>
<p class="p10">My Dr Wife:</p>
<p class="p10"> This is the middle of the week, we are comfortably fixed in our new quarters, about a mile
     &amp; a half from Hamilton's Crossing and a mile from Gen. Lee's Hd. Qrs. we got fixed just in time to avoid the snow storm which
     is now raging, and which will keep the Yankees quiet, for a time, at least. You have seen in
     the papers the account of the attempt of the enemy to make a raid towards Gordonsville
     &amp; of Stuart's meeting them, with great inferior force and driving them back across the
     river -- the cannonading was very heavy, I suppose you heard it -- it was some 20 miles from
     here and we heard it very distinctly. our loss was considerable, but that of the enemy was
     greater, yet we repulsed them and broke up their intended raid. The loss of Maj. Pelham of
     Stuart's Horse Artillery was a heavy one, for he was a very gallant man &amp; yet had a
     child like look &amp; was a mere boy in appearance. The signs of an early fight were quite
     numerous, but this storm will put it off again -- Tom Kinney has been ordered to report to
     Richmond &amp; he is going home to await orders, so I shall send this by him and enclose
     $20, twenty dollars to you -- my stock of butter is running low -- <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>but other things
     hold out well and will last a long time yet. I do not expect you to try to keep me in butter
     dring the spring, it will be too much labor for you to collect it &amp; I can get along
     very well without it while my fruit lasts -- the S. C. soups go a good ways too &amp; help
     out amazingly. I am getting up a map of the county along the Rappahannock, as we may want it
     soon -- Breakfast is brought in &amp; so I must eat &amp; go to work -- I will give you
     the bill of fare -- stewed apples, butter, biscuits &amp; middling, all in limited
     quantities.</p>
<p class="p10"> Write me very soon -- I have waited long &amp; written several times - - but the mails
     are so irregular I lay it to them, not to you, for I know you have written -- I shall write to
     Nelly in a few days</p>
<p class="p10"> Your note of the 15<sup>th</sup> has just been handed --. I am sorry your throat
     is so badly off -- put some sweet oil on the outside -- it is the best thing I ever tried. The
     storm rages without -- my kisses and love to you all -- &amp; may God's richest blessings
     be with you all -- Write soon</p>
<p class="p10">Good bye -- your aff. husband</p>
