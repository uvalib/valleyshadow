                <p>Nadenbousch writes his wife and describes the lonely life he and Freddy are
                    leading. He expresses his frustration at a life separated from his family, and
                    laments the four years they have been apart. He discusses running the hotel and
                    a store in Staunton. He also sends several I.O.U.'s his wife can collect for her
                    own use.</p>

                <p>As I have another <orig reg="opportunity">oppertunity</orig> to write you I
                    embrace it hoping it may reach you soon</p>

                <p>Freddy &amp; I are both quite well &amp; live here quite snug rooming
                    together it is quite lonesome but we get along quite well F passes away his time
                    at night in learning his lessons I pass part of my by helping him. he learns
                    fast. I have got him a Michels geography which he is studying hard I also got
                    him a latin grammer which he is studying &amp; learns quite fast. He
                    frequently wishes to be at home but says he would not be satisfied there, but
                    wishes you were only here with us (<hi rend="underline">&amp; I say so
                    too</hi>)</p>

                <p>From present prospects I think very probable we will be home in the spring. I
                    long for that time to come I am <orig reg="sorely">soarly</orig> tired of this
                    life nearly 4 years separated loosing this much time in the prime of life (<hi

                    but provide for the future.</p>

                <p>I am still in the Hotel yet, seems no hope for a change yet We change our plan of
                    keeping it tomorrow, furnish rooms &amp; prepare meals &amp; let persons
                    call for what they want &amp; pay for what they get. I think this mode will
                    pay much best. I am conducting the<pb n="2"/> store with M<hi rend="super">
