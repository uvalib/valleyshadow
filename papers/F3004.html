<h4>Franklin County: Jacob Christy to Mary Jane Demus, August 10,
     1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Christy is glad that his sister and family did not incur any harm or damage during the
     Confederate raid of Chambersburg. He expresses frustration that the Union soldiers in and
     around the city were not able to stop the Confederate forces and suggests that his company
     easily could have prevented the raid. Christy also comments on the treatment of black prisoners
     of war and on the unequal pay of African-American soldiers.</p>
