<p class="p10">Latest dispatch 4 P.M.  <u>Great rush to the "Excelsion" school of Mr Scott</u>!!  Help and Books wanted!--<u>immediately</u></p>
<p class="p10">My numbers have gone up to day from 55 to <u>80</u> more are coming tomorrow  Numbers are coming from the country to take board in the city that they may attend school.  Children are <u>teasing</u> their parents to let them come.  Others are begging for <i>[illeg.]</i> and one woman told me her sick daughter a little girl of seven had not sat up for days but arose immediately on hearing of my arrival--and begged to go school  Here I am without books or help</p>
<p class="p10">I am going out immediately to hunt up a temporary assistant among the older scholars till the teacher arrives, and even then she will be wanted at this rate.</p>
<p class="p10">I have just written an order to Chaplain Manly at Richmond for a few books till those you send me shall arrive.  I do not have to visit as I expected to <u>keep out of sight</u> as much as possible, for the sight of me in the street is a guarantee for a fresh crowd of children next day.  I am compelled to send for more books<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> in view of the certain increase of numbers but will be as sparing as possible</p>
<p class="p10">In my letter this morning I did not order any Outline maps but if you can send them I hope you will  If you are obliged to strike off anything from the bill for which I send at present let it be the charts.  But primary charts are of very great use in the absence of suitable blackboards--and primmers</p>
<p class="p10">One little girl this morning who had no book was learning the Alphabet from the fragment of an old <i>[illeg.]</i> was gone.  Don't get expensive ones on pasteboard as cheep paper ones will do, and I can put a cloth back on to preserve them.</p>
<p class="p10">There were but few books in the city suitable for these children and I have bought them all and sold again to day to the children who still begged for more.</p>
<p class="p10">I hope this will reach you in time to enable you to add to the bill I sent this morning,--befor you have boxed up those books I then ordered.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully</p>
<p class="p10"><i>John Scott</i></p>
<p class="p10">Send in addition to the bill of Books ordered this morning the following<br>
Arithmetic Davies written (Com Schl) 1/2 doz<br>
Arithmetic (any Primary (with multiplication table)--1 doz<br>
Geography Montieths No 1-- -- -- 2 doz<br>
Outline maps -- -- -- one set<br>
(Cheep) Primary Charts (not for drawing) one set<br>
Crayon a few, 1 small box &amp;lt 2 Boxes
