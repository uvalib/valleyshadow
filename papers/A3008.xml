                    <p>Carson writes to someone, almost certainly Annie Harris, about his army's
                         recent preparations to defend against a Yankee force. He expresses some
                         doubt about whether he will survive this encounter which will take place
                         somewhere along the "Rapidan river" near "Orange C.H."</p>

                    <p>Once more it is my inestimable privilege to take my pencil in hand for the
                         purpose of writing you a few lines. We are now laying in line of battle,
                         about 14 miles below Orange <abbr expan="Courthouse">C. H.</abbr> on the
                         Rapidan river. Came here yesterday evening. Since which time we have busily
                         engaged throwing up <unclear>fortifications</unclear>. The Yankee Cavalry
                         are visible on the opposite side, they have made no attempt to cross since
                         this day one week ago; this being the day they drove our cavalry out of
                         Culpeper. Our line is at present about 15 miles long, the enemy has some
                         three places of crossing. If they should attempt to cross at either or all
                         of these <pb n="2"/>places, they will meet with strong resistince I assure
                         you, as we have a very good position.</p>
                    <p>Your letter dated Sept 4<hi rend="super">th</hi> came to hand a day or two
                         previous to our leaving camp; the envelope was torn all to pieces, and was
                         probably read more than once before it was handed to one, but if it was it
                              <orig reg="don't">dont</orig> matter.</p>
                    <p>Since I commenced writing the Canons has commenced firing &amp; I should
                         not be surprised if before this time tomorrow we will have bloody times
                         here. A detail is just starting back to the wagons to cook rations
                              <unclear>Mr McEllence</unclear> has been with us for more than a week.
                         I heard him preach two sermons since <pb n="3"/>he came into camp. he is
                         staying with the 25 <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt</abbr> in the end Brigade.</p>
