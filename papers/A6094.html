<p class="p10">Oct 26<sup>th</sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Moffetts Creek V<sup>a</sup></p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Brother:</p>
<p class="p10">I seat myself this morning to write you the limited page. Received a letter dated 12 Sep last week. All are well this morning. Hope you also are in health
     and tolerable comfort. I have sad news to inform you of. Your friend Sergt Ben Hupp was killed last Wednes 19<sup>
      <u>th</u>
     </sup> at Cedars Creek. 'Twas a great shock to me to hear of it and I judge will be much more so
     to you who was an (almost) inseperable companion. Seems as if death has come nearer to you than
     ever before. We can't help but feel his death. Not more than 3 weeks since he was at home and
     now dead Can scarce believe it's true. Ought not this to be sufficient to rouse you to
     reflection? Yes and God grant we may not be hardened by this, his Providence. Mrs H only
     yesterday eve received a letter from Baylor informing her of the circumstances the first she
     knew of it Dave Beard's detail has been out short and he has now gone to the company started
     last Friday. Had been in the trenches at Richmond 3 <i>[illeg.]</i> weeks appears very willing
     and glad to go back. Details from neighborhood all gone Suppose as I (thoughtlessly) was the
     cause of a misunderstanding in the case of Wrights negroes had best rectify it Twas only the
     men who went away the one belonging to them and the hired man. Reed Hanger is home a young man
     with him stoped as you had requested Hope you will get home before
     winter if not can we send from here any thing for your comfort or
     will you be allowed to receive.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain Your affectionate sister</p>
