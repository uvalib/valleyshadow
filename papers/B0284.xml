                <p>Hanger recounts his experience with Harriet Lee, an employee of his. He claims
                    she ran off leaving one of her daughters behind and being in debt to Hanger.
                    Hanger also notes that she wanted much higher wages than he was willing to pay,
                    considering that he also provided for her three children.</p>

                    Two of her children &amp; left one at my house of no service to me, I found
                    out where she had gone &amp; sent her child to her, which <pb n="2"/>she
                    didn't like as she wished to get clear of the Trouble of attending to this Girl
                    - she is some 15 years old. But foolish &amp; hard to manage. My wife
                    attended to this Girl &amp; made her clothes <orig reg="etc"
                    >&amp;c</orig> as long as she was at my home. H. Lee had no trouble with
                    her. I keeped all three of her children &amp; clothed the older Girl
                    &amp; gave her $2 per month. Since <hi rend="underline">Xmas</hi>- before
                    that time I have been giving her $3.00 per month &amp; informed her at the
                    time if she could do better to go &amp; do so <pb n="3"/>as her children
                    were all of <orig reg="expence">espence</orig> &amp; no service to me. She
                    had no objection &amp; left for <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> But she wished high wages,
                    she wanted $5.00 with her children as high as women <hi rend="underline"

                    also got her to come to you. You can ask Mr. H. Risk about me or any person who
                    ever heard of me or any colored &amp; white man about Waynesboro who know me
                    from childhood if I ever did or had the means of not paying my debts. Never had
