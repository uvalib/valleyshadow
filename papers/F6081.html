<h4>Franklin County: Benjamin S. Schneck to Margaretta
                    S. Keller, September 12, 1862<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Schneck writes to his sister, Margaretta, about his trip west through Ohio, and
                    how he was forced to turn back after rumors of an imminent Confederate march
                    into Pennsylvania.</p>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p11"><b>
                    Mrs. Margaretta Keller <br> Boalsburg, Centre Co.
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Sep 12, 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sister-</p>
<p class="p10">Lest you should be alarmed at our safety, I write to say that we are indeed in
                    the midst of a frightful <u>panic</u>, but I myself do not
                    yet apprehend any immediate danger. But more than half our people have left and
                    are leaving. Just think, I left for the <u>Far West</u> a
                    week or 10 days ago -- got to Cincinatti in a similar confusion -- and on
                    Tuesday night last at Dayton, I heard of the contemplated (or rather, expected)
                    march of the Rebels from Hagarstown to Chambersburg. So I just took the cars at
                    midnight <i>[unclear: east]</i> and came here yesterday at noon. I found our
                    folks packed, ready to start with Mr. Kennedy in carriage and baggage wagon. But
                    the night has again passed, + now nearly the day, + things look rather more
                    favorable. Indeed, I doubt whether the Rebels will come here at all. I think
                    it's a <u>feint</u> to draw troops from Washington. <u>Should</u> they come, we must just submit -- we are
                    defenseless -- I myself will stay, but the females will go first to Carlisle, +
                    if things prove worse, across the mountain into Perry County. These are
                    sorrowful times. Where is our boasting and glorifying now?</p>
<p class="p10">I was so sorry I did not know that Daniel (your son) was at Harrisburg last week
                    when I was on my way West. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> I had to visit 1 1/2 hours there + might
                    have gone for half an hour to see him. But I only found it out when it was too
                    late first from Lieut Edwards, and then from
                    good Mr. Kelker, who told me that he had seen him at Church + Sunday School +
                    was so well pleased with Daniel + in speaking with him found he was my nephew. I
                    felt proud to hear him speak so kindly + well from a sisters son of mine. Mr. K.
                    is a most excellent and prominent officer in the Reformed Ch in Harrisburg.</p>
<p class="p10">I must close -- all confusion around us. Let one of the girls write to me and
                    tell me the Company, Reg<sup>t</sup> +
                    place of address of Daniel. I will then occasionally write to him + send him
                    papers etc.</p>
<p class="p10">Rebecca and Kate send much love to you all, while I remain</p>
<p class="p10">Your aff. Brother</p>
