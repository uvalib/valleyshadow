    <p>I promised to write to you from McDowell the next day after Nelson left -- I found myself
     sick -- truly sick from head to foot -- had a severe pain all might in my abdomen -- was
     fainting sick -- one of the boys gave me a dose of <unclear>Radmay's</unclear> Ready Relief
     &amp; I commenced vomiting &amp; purging in earnest, but was still in much pain so I
     took another dose -- the <unclear>hottest</unclear> medicine I ever saw -- it produced no
     nausea but vomited me in a moment &amp; I kept on -- then I <orig reg="bethought"
      >besthought</orig> me of the tea you so kindly sent me &amp; had one of the boys go to a
     house nearby &amp; get some made for me -- it was good but it did not stop my ailings -- so
     Capt. Lilley proposed about dark that I should go to Mrs. Alexander's, near by, where I was
     very kindly cared for, put in a clean bed -- the first one I have been in since I left home --
     was very sick until midnight, lonely enough too in the midst of a house full of sick &amp;
     well -- but by keeping quiet my <orig reg="diarrhea">diarrhaea</orig> got checked &amp; I
     slept some, in the morning they gave me a nice cup of scalded bread &amp; milk &amp; it
     braced me up a good deal -- that was Sunday morning &amp; the order came for us to move
     back here -- it is too bad that they will always move here on Sunday, but there was no choice
     &amp; as I was the only staff officer here I was almost obliged to come so I got Mrs.
     Alexander to give me a canteen full of boiled milk &amp; laid down <pb n="2"/> on the top
     of a baggage wagon &amp; jolted over here -- kept up by my canteen of milk -- we pitched
     our tents in the edge of town &amp; I went to my bed on the ground -- I was not able to
     help fix up but Cadet Holt who stays with us -- who formerly lived at Jenning's Gap, kindly
     fixed up things &amp; made me a good cup of tea &amp; one of the boys got me a nice
     piece of light bread &amp; I ate quite a supper &amp; slept very well -- Yesterday I
     had a good many orders to issue &amp; copy &amp; was asked to copy a map for Gen.
     Loring too &amp; so the day wore away in full employment &amp; I did not get a chance
     to write &amp; today I have been very busy &amp; made a map which was a theme of much
     praise &amp; <unclear>which</unclear> will <orig reg="no">not</orig> doubt secure me a
     situation in Gen. Loring's or Lee's staff, so Col. Stevenson, Gen. L's Adjutant says &amp;
     he has the Gen's confidence -- they all want me to stay in the <abbr expan="Regiment">Regt.</abbr>
     <orig reg="though">tho'</orig> as Adjutant but that is not my sphere -- I am promised a
     furlough -- but do not want to come home until <orig reg="the">they</orig> paymaster comes here
     so I can get my pay for what I have done, that I may be able to do what I wish to for your
     &amp; the children's comfort. If I get the post I want I shall continue at that all the
     time as that is congenial to my taste. Maj. Reger got back today -- fixed up in good style -- a
      <orig reg="brand">bran</orig> new suit from head to foot -- he was in Richmond &amp; went
     to see his family -- he came back through Churchville &amp; is full of praises of the
     pretty girls he met there - - in the road as he passed through. Since dark Cadet Holt &amp;
     I went out on a straw or hay -- <pb n="3"/> seeking expedition, as the ground is getting rather
     hard since it has been dry for a few days -- the Quarter Master <abbr expan="said">sd</abbr>
     there was none, but we went way down the road to where the hay stacks had been &amp; I
     filled up from the leavings one of my blankets which I had sewed up into a bay for the purpose
     &amp; I expect to sleep gloriously tonight, as I washed up this morning &amp; put on
     clean clothes -- the new shirt you sent me -- it is first rate -- sleeves a little long, but it
     makes no difference -- I want pay day to come so I can buy you a lot of calico here -- as they
     have a good deal &amp; sell it at the old prices -- I have been trying today to get some
     washing done, but the pollution of the place is such that the waters are not in a condition to
     wash with, unless brought from some ways -- it is the worst place in the state for men to be
     that are not well -- there are few houses &amp; they are full of all sorts &amp;
     conditions &amp; the sick have a hard time, some of them die daily -- but the well men are
     now very well supplied with tents -- we got ours today &amp; I wish you could step in
     &amp; see us -- a wall tent, quite like a house -- stand 1 chair &amp; 1 camp stool,
     boxes, clothes guns &amp; swords all round -- &amp; Maj. R -- &amp; myself along
     writing to our wives -- he has quit &amp; I am very tired -- and then tattoo has beaten
     &amp; we must off to bed -- I have a very bad cold but that will do me good &amp; am
     feeling very well -- write to me here &amp; I shall get it -- there is no news here -- we
     may move to the Alleghany or to Huntersville any day -- God bless you &amp; the children --
     Love to all -- keep in good spirits my love -- </p>
