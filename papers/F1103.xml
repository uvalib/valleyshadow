                <p>You cannot imagine how sorry and disappointed I was when I found I could not join
                    you all in Philadelphia I had been refused any leave of absence but had
                    persevered and had been more fortunate in a second application and had a leave
                    of absence for five days. I received this "leave" the <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> evening
                    before leaving Falmouth and should have left<pb n="2"/> for <abbr
                        expan="Philadelphia">Philada</abbr> the next morning had the regiment not
                    received an order twelve o'clock that night to leave for the upper Rappahannock
                    at three o'clock. We have been here ever since guarding the Ford to prevent the
                        "<abbr expan="rebels">Rebs</abbr>" making a raid into my Maryland-and
                    frightening the politicians in Washington. We are under orders again to move and
                    may leave <orig reg="tonight">to-night</orig> where to or when is not yet
                    divulged.</p>
                <p>Your kind letter of the 6<hi rend="super">th</hi>
                    <abbr expan="instant">inst</abbr> was received yesterday. My letters do not
                    reach Washington until the evening of the second day. I fear that many of them
                    are delayed as the mail<pb n="3"/> is frequently detained for prudential
                    reasons. The authorities here are exceedingly cautious, in some particulars,
                    regarding contraband information. Politicians have so much information and
                    influence in this army that many of our best Generals are leaving for other
                    fields and none but the favored few enjoy indulgences or privileges. Old
                    officers in subaltern positions with difficulty procure leave of absence for
                    fear that they will not return preferring lighter service not in the field</p>
                <p>Remember me kindly to your Father &amp; Mother and with the kindest wishes
                    for your health &amp; happiness I<pb n="4"/> am as ever</p>
