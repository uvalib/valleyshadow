<p class="p10">My Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 19 of Aug &amp; 26 of Sept have been recieved. Oh I cannot find
                    words to express my joy at the receipt of your letter of the 19 August twas
                    after I had waited so long &amp; anxiously for a letter from you that I had
                    concluded that something had happened &amp; then wrote that my letter might
                    be opened by your Pa in order that I might get some information of you. meantime
                    your dear letter came on in other words an Angel's visit. I seized the dear
                    letters messenger &amp; with anxious eyes &amp; heart full of joy
                    unspeakable I perused its contents with un
                    parralelled interest &amp; pleasure the relief of my anxiety was so
                    forcibly impressive that I could but (umanly or childish as it was) press the
                    dear sheet to my lips &amp; cover your name with numerous kisses. I really
                    was never more delighted at the receipt of a letter all my life. One would have
                    supposed from <i>[illeg.]</i> emotions, that I was much in love with <i>[deleted: ]</i> than that of friendship. Sweet <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>dearest Kate you know
                    I <i>[added: have]</i> long since defined my position fully,
                    I have claimed to love you only as a friend &amp; as a proof of the fact
                    have openly told you of my fond relations with another a friend of early life
                    whose constancy &amp; devotion I can <u>scarce doubt</u>.
                        our attachment was formed in early life. long separations during the protracted perils of war
                    &amp; blood Shed, my reduction (by the same) to comparitive poverty has made no change in the dearest objects of my
                        <u>undivided affection</u> like you my dear <u>Sister</u> who has proven to be a devoted friend. She too
                    has proven to be all that one could be, who holds the place she does, in my
                    hearts dearest affections and nothing prevents the consumation of what has been
                    vowed between us but my limited means &amp; the depressed condition of the
                    Country.</p>
<p class="p10">But my dear friend I dont think there is a freind on Earth that I love more as a pure &amp;
                    constant freind than my fond &amp; affectionate
                    Sister Kate she <i>[added: is]</i> truly <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <i>[unclear: short]</i> a freind can be on whom I
                    hold very dear in freindship love &amp;
                    confidence.</p>
<p class="p10">Now my dear freind I will with painfull emotions communicate to <i>[added: you]</i> news that is sad to me, the death of a young man, a warmly attached
                    &amp; well loved freind of mine. he was <i>[illeg.]</i>
                    <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>Brother of my dear Lou, he was an associate from his early Boyhood
                    when he <i>[added: was]</i> quite a small boy I engaged with
                    his Father to conduct a merchantile business for
                    him which I did till the commencement of the war. My constant association with
                    the family &amp; their marked kindness draw out my warmest attachment for
                    them all, particularly this dear Boy Calvin, he was always so particularly fond
                    of me that I had really learnd to love him almost as
                    a brother. he was 18 or 19 years old when he died Entered the Army the last year of the war. he was sick about six weeks with a Billious Typhoid affiction &amp; fell a victim to the disease the
                    17th of august. I visited him constantly during his
                    illness watched with pain-full anxiety the last
                    breathings of his existance while around his dying
                    bed stood the almost heart broken family his dear parents &amp; fond sisters
                    Oh dear friend how deep the unspeakable grief and anguish of all amid this scene
                    of death. he was a lively &amp; very cheerfull young lad &amp; very thoughtless of here
                    after but during his long illness he was visited by Christian freinds prayed for by the Church &amp; before he
                    died gave some hopeful evidence of his fitness for a home beyond the grave. Well
