<p class="p10">My Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">You kind and welcome letter of the 8th inst reached me safe today which found me
                    well &amp; very glad to hear from you for I was anxiously awaiting your
                    reply. I felt so lonely lying in camp with no excitement but at last your dear
                    letter came which was indeed a healing talisman in writing &amp; anxious
                    hearts if ever I prize a letter it is when <i>[illeg.]</i> such circumstance I
                    am satisfied there is no one who is more fond <i>[added: of]</i> communicating with dear friends than I am. Letter writing is a
                    pleasant mode of binding a vivid remembrance of friends &amp; I think I
                    enjoy it as much <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>as any one but some times it does not suit my
                    purposes. I pine for a more general &amp; extended chat, I wish very much
                    that I could have the pleasures of meeting with you again &amp; again that
                    we might become better acquainted my short stay with you I have discovered many
                        <i>[illeg.]</i> qualities in you which has made undescribable impressions
                    on me ours is a very singular case it is not often the case where such a
                    friendship springs up <i>[deleted: two]</i> between two relative strangers
                    Ever thankful I hope our friendship may be a lasting one &amp;c Sister you
                    say that you have lately hurd that I met with one of
                    your neighbors &amp; made enquiry in regards to your self. I am indeed
                    surpised to hear <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>that it is indeed a mistake let me assure you that I
                    have never met with any one from your county since I saw you it <i>[added: is]</i> not my interest that I should have done as you heard
                    I did but I assure you I did not have the opportunity <i>[illeg.]</i> I dont claim to be all <i>[illeg.]</i> Sister but I dont
                    hesitate to say that your pleasant appearance gave me entire satisfaction as
                    regards your definitive worth Many thanks, Miss Kate, for your favorable oppinion of me I am very sorry that it is not a <i>[deleted: ]</i> matter you asked if I was in the fight near Richmond, I was not.
                    I had not been relieved from duty in Westemoreland, I returned to camp on the
                        9<sup>th</sup> of this month. have not been very <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>quiet
                    since I got here as the enemy kept <i>[added: us]</i> moving
                        untill two days ago at which time we settled
                    affairs all is quiet now. Our losses were very slight. Well Miss Kate fearing I
                    may bore you <i>[added: with]</i> my uninteresting letter I
                    guess I had better close. My kindest regards to your fair family, please let me
                    hear from you ever sooner. your letters are most welcome messengers, with my
                    warmest wishes for your wellfare &amp; happiness </p>
<p class="p10">believe me to be fondly your friend</p>
