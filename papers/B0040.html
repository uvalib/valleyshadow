<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to J.

</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Thomas Jackson writes Lieutenant Hall, the Military Commissioner for Augusta
                    County, concerning the handling of cases where men have been accused of stealing
                    horses while associated with Federal troops.</p>

<p class="p10">Dec 10, 1867.</p>
<p class="p10">Woodstock</p>
<p class="p10">Lieutenant</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to report that Mr Alexander Curry now of Bath Co. late of Highland has been indicted in Highland
                        Co for theft of a horse from Mrs Sarah Bird of
                    Highland Co. during the war.</p>
<p class="p10">There is another of the suit instituted in Highland Co. against all in any way connected with the Federal troops during the
                    War and the scouting parties so frequently sent out by them and as enquiry is now being made into some of these cases at
                    Winchester. I notified Mr. Somers the Sheriff not to arrest Curry until some
                    decision had been given on such case. Without defending the conduct of such men
                    in all cases, I am satisfied all such suits should be dismissed for as the
                    courts are constituted in Highland the <u>same</u> law will
                    not be administered if the <i>[unclear: Union]</i> man is <u>plaintiff</u> as if he is <u>defendant</u>. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    The case of Curry's may likely come up at court held at Monterey Dec 12/67. I respectfully ask instructions, </p>
<p class="p10">Very respectfully<br>Yr ob
