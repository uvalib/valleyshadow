<p class="p10">A. F.<br> Seminary Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sister</p>
<p class="p10"> I received my clothes yesterday evening by John but didn't have time to write so
                    I thought I would write today. I have gotten nearly well of my cold. I was very
                    much surprised to hear of Miss Tassie Houston's death, as I had not heard of her
                    sickness. Becca had a letter from home this morning, which said they were all
                    better but Miss Jane. It certainly must be a dreadful kind of fever. Miss Bettie
                    Loyle, Miss Agnes' neice died about two weeks ago. Grandma &amp; Miss Agnes
                    were very much distressed about it. Mattie Tate came here yesterday as a
                    boarder. M<i>[added: r]</i><i>[deleted: iss]</i> Haddell
                    is going to Richmond to enter into business. I think she feels right sorry. We
                    have had a new boarder since you were here. Miss M<sup>c</sup>Garrek,
                    from Pulaski. Becca wrote to her cousin M<sup>
                        <u>rs</u>
                    </sup> Dunlap to send for her Friday evening. Miss Mary told her she had better
                    write. Her father was down to see her Sat. I tell
                    you she was glad. We all went to the Episcopal church last Sunday night.
                        M<i>[unclear: r. Jenkin]</i> will preach on Friday night &amp;
                    Saturday. We walked out to Capt Byers last Saturday
                    morning met M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> Leckey there. Mary Dudley stayed all day. <i>[unclear: Suslie]</i>
                    Stephenson &amp; I wouldn't stay but we had mighty work to get off from
                    Mattie. I believe M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> M<sup>c</sup>Gauly is to be one of M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> East's waiters. wonder who he will wait with. It sounds funny to say were going home week after next. it seems like Christmas
                    oughtn't to be here yet. I reckon its because we haven't
                    had any cold weather. Think Ean Fulton did have a rainy day sure enough for
                    wedding. why in the world didn't they both get married the same day. just two
                    troubles &amp; expenses. Tell <i>[unclear: Niza]</i> she musn't laugh when<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> she gets married. I wish I
                    could go to some of their weddings. did you have much fun at Eme's wedding. How
                    is cousin Nancy Berry now? where will John &amp; <i>[unclear: Niza]</i>
                    live? &amp;c. What did the <u>
                        thing
                    </u> look like that day? &amp; how did the <u>
                        Jucen
                    </u> enjoy herself? I dont think the glove pattern is
                    at home. I know I loaned it to Bettie Echard. &amp; I dont think I could tell you how to trim the dress...I have seen some
                    trimmed <i>[deleted: across the]</i> with three rows of velvet across the
                    breast. then turned &amp; go up to the seam on the shoulders. I dont know where I could get a pattern for the tails.
                    perhaps M<sup>
                        <u>rs</u>
                    </sup> Turk has the pattern like Lucy's, if you like them you can make them that
                    way. I have not thanked D<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> Spragins for my present yet. Miss Howard has given up having Geometry
                    examination before Christmas as we would have too much to<i>[deleted: o]</i>
                    think of at once. We will have our examination on Heaven Tuesday before the
                    Cantanta. I don't think braided bodies will do wear then, will send my white
                    body home and have it done up before that time. I reckon that will do. I expect
                    you will be right busy until after the wedding. I want to send this down to the
                    office now so it will go up tomorrow. I will look for you Sat. a little, bet you wont come through.</p>
