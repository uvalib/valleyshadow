                            Va.
                            Campt in the Woods 3 Miles below
                            Martinsburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Kate</p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your kind and much welcomed letter a fiew days since and was glad to hear from you. I should
                    have answered it sooner put we have been mooving from plase to plase for the last two weeks &amp; hardly ever neer a Post office &amp; to day I am Twenty five miles
                    from one put I have concluded to write at any rate hoping
                    that I might <i>[added: have]</i> a chance of sending it
                    before long. My health is very good and I hope theese
                    uninteresting lines may find you enjoying the same blessing. Cous. Jas. V. is well and harty. Your friend J.P. Lightner was hear
                    yesterday eavning he belongs to the Rockbridge Collige boys it is a fine company he said when he got
                    to Strawsburg it was reported that we ware fighting in Winchester &amp; when he got thare
                    <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> he hurd that we ware fighting in Martinsburg &amp; he pushed on and when he got
                        thare he was told we ware
                    fighting at our encampment it seemes that it does some
                    persons good to lie just to keep up the excitement put it
                    will not be long I hope untill we shall soundly whip
                    the deamons of the North for the bloodthirsty villions
                    has invaded our soil at different points &amp; taken
                    property &amp; surched the houses for money. I
                    cannot write any thing to day that will interrest
                    you it being Sunday &amp; to see no change in the soldiers if one did not
                    keep the account of the days he would not know when Sunday comes. Some of the
                    men are blaying cards, oh that men would fear the
                    lord more &amp; searve him better. Sam Fitch has to
                    go on duty this morning for an our or two &amp; he
                    looks mad I reckon he thinks he is violating the Sabbath put it is not his fault. I have had good luck I have not had to go on
                    duty on Sunday yet.</p>
<p class="p10">I had to stop writing for a little while as one of my mess wanted in his box he
                    took out his Bible and I opened it &amp; commenced reading at the sixty
                    third psalmn and read three or four Chapters they
                    seemed to revive my low spirits I shall ever put my trust in the lord who is
                    able to do what so ever he will.</p>
<p class="p10">You asked me to send you my likeness to you I will the first opportunity though
                    it will not be a good one for I am purnt almost black
                    with the sun.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not know when I may have the opportunity of having it taken. I must bring
                    this uninterresting letter to a Close hoping
                    that it may not be long untill I may get back to old
                    Augusta give my love to all inquiring friends remember me <i>[deleted: when]</i> in the hours of your devotion if no whare
                    else.</p>
<p class="p10">I remain yours &amp;C as ever</p>
<p class="p10"><i>W.F. Brand</i></p>
<p class="p10">P.S. Please write soon for I am most happy to hear from
                        at any time yours &amp;C. W.F.B.</p>
