<p class="p10">Well Jennie I cant quit yet it is not quite bed time and
                    I am alone I have concluded that it is a well to be
                    writing to you as to be thinking of you till "<u>sleepy</u>
                    <u>time</u>." The rest of the boys are out in the bake shop
                    at work but my turn comes to work in daytime so I have a good chance to write to
                    my friend. But here comes one of the boys with two letters for me one from
                    Mother and one from my sister Alice - Mother tells me that you are really verry ill this is bad news to come so unexpected you did
                    not tell me all this - and I supposed you were able to go visiting at pleasure -
                    Mother tells me you were bolstered up in that big chair and verry delicate and in other respects it was just as I expected she
                    was well pleased with "Your Jennie" as she calls you. She is verry anxious to have you come and live with her a while - she will
                    soon pay you an other visit and I shall hope to hear
                    of your rapid recovery - rest assured dear girl<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> that the love you
                    have so lavishly bestowed upon me is warmly appreciated and with your concent and that of your parents I should be the
                    happiest man on earth if I could be the housband of
                    so true hearted a lady as yourself.</p>
<p class="p10">Now Jennie you have heard what I long have wished to say I love you as truly as
                    man can love and I have flattered myself that no one has ever loved me so truly
                    and if you will concent to become the wife of this
                        "<u>ugly</u>, <u>mean</u>
                    <u>rascal</u>" you will make me the happiest man in the
                    Yankee Army.</p>
<p class="p10">Well now it is time for me to retire for if I sleep tomorrow in the bakery the
                    boys will torment the life nearly out of me. Give my regards to all your famile and write soon to</p>
