<p class="p10">June 18th 1861.</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Henry:-</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 16th was<br> received in due time, which found <i>[added: me]</i> wa<i>[illeg.]</i><i>[added: iting]</i><br>
     and also well and hearty with a good<br> appetite. The troops have all left<br> here but one
     Regiment <i>[added:  and that had left too]</i> so that our town is
     coming<br> back to its former quietness. but false reports
     and<br> rumors are in great abundance, and correct reports<br> are very scarce. but as I enjoyed Saturday<br> evening with its scenes and a mess of
     strawberries<br> I will commence a description, if I should not<br> get it finished in this
     letter, look for the balance<br> in the next. so here goes. </p>
<p class="p10"> The boisterous winds of noonday had died away and given<br> place to the gentler zephyrs of
     a delightful June<br> evening. The intervening clouds, which had emerged in<br> mountain like
     masses, from the Western horizon had<br> dispelled the scorching rays of that luminary,
     which<br> was gently sinking in the western sky and all was calm<br> and serene, save the
     evening notes of a few joyous 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<a href="images/BitCre4b.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitCre4b.gif"></center></a><br><br> birds whose carrolls seemed sweetened
     by the quiet &amp;<br> beauty of the surrounding landscape. indeed nature was<br> gently wrapping herself in her most gorgeous robes<br> of
     beauty, while the odors of a thousand flowers had<br> filled the air with their sweet perfume.
      and thus<br> while my mind was straying in unknown channels  contempla<br>
      <i>[deleted: pleting]</i>-ting the magnificence and glory of surrounding<br>
     nature, a sound from the distance fell upon my ears<br> which by its unrivaled powers for
     engulfing the mind in<br> paroxyms of unconsciousness, had so enlarged my former  concep-<br> tion of instrumental music, that the perpendicular of
      astonish-<br> ment fell outside the base of consciousness and
      conse-<br> quently submerged my powers of reason in a "ker
     splash," how<br> I extricated myself from the strong embrace of that fit<br> of ecstacies, could only be told by a scrutinizing observer,<br> however,
     when reason again returned I found myself<br> journeying towards that place from whence
     proceeded those be-<br> witching strains of music, soon I was
     standing in the su-<br> burbs of a very splendid little city, the
     appearance of which<br> was quite picturesque of itself, and grotesque when compared<br> with
     the cities of the country. This modern city is about<br> one-half of a mile in length and
     about one-eighth of a<br> mile in breadth having a population of about 3,000 
     
     <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<a href="images/BitCre4c.jpg"><center><img src="images/BitCre4c.gif"></center></a><br><br> inhabitants; the dwellings were of uniform size, the<br> largest
     being a little more spaceous than the smallest<br> and the
     smallest being somewhat less in dimensions than<br> the largest, with streets leading along
     every side of the dwell-<br> ings; and running either straight or
     crooked from <i>[added: the]</i> one end<br> to the other side so
     that strangers could amuse themselves by<br> turning as many times as there is differences of
     direction. </p>
<p class="p10"> The architecture was of the latest style being neither<br> Grecian nor Gothic but a style
     of necessity. The rooves<br> of <i>[deleted: which]</i><i>[added: the houses]</i> were shingled with canvas, and the end of
     those<br> that were not round were neatly lapboarded with canvas<br> the rooves of some reached so near the ground that the ground<br> came in contact with
     the rooves, while with others the rooves<br>
     came in close conjunction with the earth, but others had a<br> partition wall of about 3 feet
     in height, this wall being of<br> solid masonry, the material of which was canvass, served to<br> point out the dimensions of the edifice by plainly distin-<br> guishing the outside from the inside of the
     structure, but I<br> would have you also remember that where the eve of the roof<br> reached
     the ground, there was no such wall, but in all<br> such cases the roof separated the inside
     from the outside<br> so that there still remained and inside and outside
     to<br> every temple. These buildings for convenience could not be

     after becoming <i>[deleted: iniated]</i>initiated into the presence of the<br> occupants of
     the building and wishing to leave, you will<br> always find the door just at the place where
     you <i>[added: come out]</i>
     <i>[deleted: entered]</i>,<br> and if your company has been burthensome to the inmates<br>
     of the house, you'll find no difficulty in  leaving,<br> Among all
     the Ancient and Modern <i>[added: cities]</i> of the world
     perhaps<br> none were so well adapted <i>[deleted: to the]</i>in a point of con-<br> venience, to the wants of the aged and infirm, there
     being<br> but one apartment in each dwelling in which were<br> found all the necessaries for
     house cookery, with the couch<br> on which to rest the weary head, which was usually
     placed<br> upon the soft earth, and in the left corner of the<br> room was the clerk's desk
     at which all the business<br> of the family is transacted, these halls are large and<br>
     spaceous while one person is occupying them, and<br> small and
     precious while six or seven, the usual<br> number in a family, where
