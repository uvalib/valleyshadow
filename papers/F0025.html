                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Jan. 11 1864 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp on Turkey Creek Near Warrenton Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Wife </p>
<p class="p10">Your most welcome letter was received yesterday evening relieving me very much on
                        Bells account, as I was more uneasy about her
                    since leaving home than I was when there. I am glad you did not wait to answer
                    my letter as it would have kept me longer hearing from home. When I wrote last
                    the regiment had taken some quarters deserted by infrantry since we had to come here and build quarters for ourselves.
                    The first night or two we camped out on the snow. Since, the Doctor has taken a
                    house for our quarters &amp; we have a very comfortable place. The Doctor
                    expects his wife in a few days so he rented a furnished room with a feather bed.
                    Until his wife arrives I am sleeping with him in a warm room in a feather bed.
                    As you will see by my last letter I got here on Saturday the 2<sup>nd</sup>. On Sunday I wanted to see my wife &amp; felt in my pocket for
                    that picture when <u>lo</u> &amp; <u>behold</u> it was gone. The Doctor &amp; I looked all over our tent,
                    under the bed up &amp; down. So I gave it up for lost when I got a letter
                    informing me where it is. I am glad that it is not lost &amp; hope you will
                    send it in your next letter. As we have no woman here but an old dried up
                    vinegar-faced Virginian, who is cross as an old bear because of her fences and
                    so on I want a good looking woman to look at, so send the pictures along. Any
                    time you have a chance to get pictures of the children I wish you would have
                    them taken &amp; send them to me. The weather has been very cold since I
                    came out. Today the sun is shining brightly making a little mud. I got two of
                    your letters since I came. Perhaps I told you the Regiment was out on a raid
                    into the Shenandoah Valley &amp; have returned. They burned some tanneries,
                    captured some horses &amp; some rebs. You need not be uneasy about my
                    blanket as I am sleeping very comfortably &amp; hope it will help to keep
                    you warm. Wisby gave me the mittens &amp; I have to thank you for your
                    trouble as they keep my hands warm. I guess you need not make any catnip tea for
                    me as my headache has left &amp; my cold is getting better. I would like
                    very much to be at home with yourself and the children as it is the pleasantest
                    place I have found in all my travels &amp; as a matter of course there is
                    where I want to be, to hear Josey's drum, to hear Lucy &amp; Bell singing
                    &amp; have Jimmy running to get up on my knee &amp; then jump down again
                    like a little mischief &amp; then to have Cynthia making catnip tea
                    &amp; curing my headache. How pleasant our prayers have been heard &amp;
                    we have been permitted to have one reunion. The same God is still the hearer
                    &amp; answerer of prayer. Let us still look to him for blessings &amp;
                    among them the privilege of meeting again around the family altar praying that
                    God may keep you all in his care I remain </p>
<p class="p10">Your affectionate husband </p>
<p class="p10"><i>S. M. Potter </i></p>
<p class="p10">I got the stamps &amp; envelopes you sent &amp;
                        was glad to receive them. You will please send the picture as I am lost
                        without it. We will try to save money enough to buy the Anthony house
                        &amp; lot for you in the spring. </p>
