<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: R. M. Manly to Crammond
                    Kennedy, October 9, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Manly writes Kennedy that he has decided to send Mary Rowell to Staunton to serve
                    as a teacher, since the teachers who were in Staunton the previous year have not
                    returned. He also refers to Thomas Jackson as one of the Bureau's best
                agents.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>
                    Rev.
                        Cr. Kennedy
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Oct. 9--</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I am sorry the teachers delay their coming so long. It would be better not to
                    wait for the transportation but to collect it afterward.</p>
<p class="p10">I have directed Miss Rowell to go to Staunton. The Free Baptists who were there
                    last year do not return, and there was no provision at all for that fine post.
                    One of the best Bureau Officers in Va. is there
                    Mr. Thos. P. Jackson, who will aid in every way possible. I have instructed him
                    and Miss R. also that the people will be expected to
                    raise the means to pay the board and have suggested that 10 cents per week be
                    collected from the pupils.</p>
<p class="p10">What about books for our schools, and what are the instructions in reference to
                    sale and exchange, and in reference to collections of "Peter's pence" from the
                    scholars?</p>
<p class="p10">Truly yours &amp;c</p>
