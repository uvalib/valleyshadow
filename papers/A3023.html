<h4>Augusta County: Tony Pastor to Annie Harris,
                              May 4, 1861<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>This letter, written soon after Pastor joined the main army, details the
                              difficulties of a soldier's life even before the war began. He asks
                              the ladies of his town to send him clothes, which in the postcript he
                              says he received. Further, he mentions that he is doubtful that the
                              conflict can end peacefully and says that he is ready to die for
                              Virginia.</p>

<p class="p10">Saturday morning, May 4 Th<i>[deleted: ]</i> 1861</p>
<p class="p10">Head Quarters Harpers Ferry -</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Annie</p>
<p class="p10">I have just finished eating my breakfast, &amp; seated myself for the
                              purpose of answering your <u>very</u>
                              <u>welcome</u> &amp; <u>interesting</u> letter which I received on yeseterday.</p>
<p class="p10">The weather is quite gloomy indeed this morning, it is snowing like
                              everything. Our Capt. had just returned
                              from the mountain. The company all went with the exception of a few.
                              myself being one of the few _ I have been unwell for several days with
                              cold &amp; sore throat. but I am considerably better this morning.
                              what would you think of our boys having to stand out in the rain all
                                    <i>[added: night]</i> without shelter, or
                              anything to eat. They went out yester<i>[unclear: are]</i> evening
                              &amp; will not return untill
                              <u>this</u> evening. I tell you they had a nice
                              time of it standing 24 hours. This thing you call soldiering is not
                              what you think it is. Although we have had very good times considering
                              everything - we will be mustered into service for the term of one
                              year, from to day. Its pretty hard to think of being tied down to this place for
                              that length of time but so it is, &amp; so it will be I presume.
                              Some of our boys have just come in. They say they never put over such
                              a night in their lives. All last night was <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br><i>[illeg.]</i>
                              <i>[illeg.]</i>
                              <i>[illeg.]</i> spies pickets &amp; <i>[illeg.]</i> my brother
                                    Johns wife &amp; cousin Mary <i>[deleted: ]</i> I tell you it was the greatest treat I have had
                              since Ive left home - it was sent by <i>[illeg.]</i>
                              <i>[unclear: Supple]</i> who was at home on a furlough of seven days
                              &amp; returned yesterday. Ed Neig was also at home &amp;
                              returned yesterday.</p>
<p class="p10">I want the young ladies of Old Providence to make me up clothing of any
                                    discription &amp; send it
                              down. however if I can, I will get a furlough to come home, as I have
                              some buisness to attend to which must be
                              done. but its a hard matter to get off on any
                              pretence whatever.</p>
<p class="p10">your friends are all well, so far as I know &amp; they request me to
                              send their love to you when ever I write.
                              I have received but one letter from home since I left except the one I
                              received from you. I hope you all will not forget me although I dont write often. Tell miss Jimmi I would
                              like to hear from her at any time, that I often think of the times we
                              used to have at your house &amp; the school room but they are past
                              &amp; gone, never more to return.</p>
<p class="p10">My position is not as bad as some of our company. I have not much duty to
                              perform. I am orderly Sergeant of the company &amp; then
                                    <i>[unclear: fine]</i> have no guard duty to perform. I have to
                              make out reports <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> &amp; hand them in to the adjutant
                              every morning - make out guard details - call the roll - parade the
                              company - etc., etc. This is what you wished to know whether I
                              retained the office I had when I left Staunton <i>[illeg.]</i>. I am
                              now <i>[illeg.]</i> of the company &amp; would greatly prefer it
                              to Commissary.</p>
<p class="p10">All our big fellows have been "<u>decapitated</u>" -
                              &amp; good &amp; a good many fell<u>back</u><u> </u>into<u> </u>ranks.</p>
<p class="p10">we are now under the strictest military discipline. cant get out at night for fear we are taken up &amp;
                              put into the Guard House. I have seen lotts of
                              fellows put in, &amp; there they have to stay untill released by their Capts.</p>
<p class="p10">As to the prospects for peace. I hardly know what to say. we get but very
                              little reliable information here. my own impression is that we will
                              have to fight before it is settled &amp; the sooner it is done the
                              better. It is a terrible thing to think of fighting. but Virginia has
                              done all that she could do <i>[added: to]</i>
                              settle the matter without war &amp; all to no purpose. so all I
                              have to say is let the north pitch in. I'll sell my life as dearly as
                              possible, &amp; will fight for the rights of V<sup>
                                          <u>a</u>
                                    </sup> while one drop of blood flows in my veins. but I
                              must stop, as I have some duties to perform immediately.</p>
<p class="p10">So farewell for the present. from your absent <u>friend
                                    &amp; lover</u> write me as often as you can &amp; keep
