<p class="p10">Wednesday Night Sep. 24. 1862</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">My dear Sister:</p>
<p class="p10">I have just returned the second time from the Battlefield -- was there during the
                    fearful battle of <u>Wednesday</u> when I remained for two
                    days and nights (with Mr. Bausman) waiting on the wounded in the Farmhouses
                    around. It was an unexpected sight and experience. On Monday (of this week)
                        Revd Mr. <i>[unclear: Gutilius]</i> (like
                    hundreds of others) was here. Since Saturday unable to get on to look after
                    relatives + friends, the cars not being permitted to take civilians. He had a
                    son, nephews and others after whom he was to see, and as he was very anxious, I
                    took him over + returned (with him) last Evening, he having the pleasure of
                    seeing his son and nephews safe, altho they were
                    in the thickest of the battle (the <u>Penns Reserves</u>). I
                    thought it <u>possible </u>tho
                    not <u>probable</u> that Daniel was there. So I went around
                    from Regiment to Regiment in which there was Centre County men -- but found him
                    not. Hence I suppose he is near Washington and you have doubtless heard from
                    him. I will be glad to hear from you in what <u>Company</u> +
                        <u>Regiment</u> he is.</p>
<p class="p10">We have already a great many wounded here + more are to come tonight. Our Ladies
                    are engaged almost day + night getting up beds and nursing them. Rebecca is
                    almost worn out.</p>
<p class="p10">Our united love from us all.</p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate brother</p>
<p class="p10"><i>B. S. Schneck</i></p>
