<p class="p10">Feb. 20<sup>th</sup> 1863</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">My Darling:</p>
<p class="p10">I know you are waiting anxiously to hear from me, so I will write now, the first chance, so
     that "hope deferred may not make the heart sick". My whole trip back was one of haps and
     mishaps -- only think -- four days for one day's ride: but I may as well tell you the ode (I
     mean the way) &amp; the episode -- You [underscore] know when we started, but how we found
     the roads I only can tell &amp; so we made slow progress, and my watch was a half hour too
     slow, so we got to Staunton just as the whistle sounded &amp; I jumped on the cars with my
     heavy carpet bag and told Cy to put on my box -- I got on but the box was too heavy, so it
     missed &amp; I had the mortification of seeing myself born away and my box standing on the
     platform, but "faint heart never won fair lady" or a good dinner either, so I rode on to
     Waynesboro, telegraped to the agent to take care of my box, found a freight train going to
     Staunton &amp;, free of charge, rode back, found my box, all in order, transacted some
     business, found a letter there from Boswell asking me to get him numerous little fixings, which
     I got -- went with Maj Bell to dinner, and home with Capt. Lilley for the night as he was going
     to the army in the morning -- so passed the first day (By the way, Mr. Phillips promised to
     send you, or leave at Kaysers or Dr. Young's some Martins seeds for you.) I saw Mr. Walker in
     town and gave him $5. for you and some stamps -- he told me a good story of Mrs. Gaines
     &amp; "the one that is to come", which I told the Gen. and amased
     him very much --. We were up in time Tuesday morning, you may be sure, through the snow, and
     got off in time -- Maj. McCue on board says Aunt Margaret has been very sick, but is now better
     -- he was going to Richmond - <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>Everything went well till we got to Gordonsville and
     there our engine ran off the track &amp; we were there several hours before it was gotten
     on the track Stuart passed there on his way to Culpeper Co. -- where I suppose he is going to
     make a raid. An old man on the train amused us much by his witty stories -- about pitch, tar
     &amp; turpentine &amp;c Mr. Van Meter, from Hardy Co. was on the cars, he says the
     Yankees have left that region - says Wm. Maslin is now teaching
     school on Lost River. -- Mr. V. wanted to know if I would not
     come to Hardy Co. and teach -- says he will find me fifteen scholars at $100 each for tuition,
     if I will come there -- and he is wealthy enough to make good his offer -- so there is one
     chance (D. V.) only it is too far North. I opened my satchel and divided my loaf of bread with
     Tate, Lilley, Van Meter &amp;c, as they could get nothing there to eat. We got off from
     Gordonsville at a late hour and in the night, when near the Junction, 4 miles off, we found a
     freight train off the track, in a cut, so we were fixed and there we spent the night and the
     next day until noon, when we waded round, through the mud and got on a train that came up from
     Richmond, and by dint of hard lifting got our baggage transferred also -- the Richmond
     passengers coming round to our train, and then we backed to the Junction -- there I got my
     dinner with Maj. Kearsley &amp; gave him some sausage, got my baggage on a freight train,
     sat up until midnight, Wednesday, then went on the freight train to Guiney's -- got there at 3 A.M. Thursday -- got into Maj. Hawk's tent wet and cold --
     made a big fire &amp; laid down on the bare floor and went to sleep -- tired out -- The mud
     &amp; water cover the whole country, and some of the troops that were moving were almost
     lost in it. William brought my horse to the depot by noon and I got to camp a while before
     sundown -- almost miring, several time, on my way here -- I have not
     got my box up yet, for we are hav- <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>ing all our carrying done on horse-back -- but
     the heavy rain of Wednesday night settled the roads some and yesterday and today the wind and
     rain have been busy wiping up the wet &amp; we may soon have wagons going again. I cut my
     cake today -- it was very nice -- divided among my friends and took the Gen. several pieces --
     all said it was very good indeed -- Boswell took a piece to Mrs. Corbin &amp; what do you
     think he says she said? Why that "she loved me for it." Are you "just the <u>least</u> bit" jealous? I have been at work today, but it goes hard -- I have been up so
     coming here &amp; exposed to the cold &amp;c &amp;c that I feel quite dull
     &amp; unfit for d<i>[illeg.]</i>.</p>
<p class="p10"> Everything is quiet here, and it is thought a good many of the enemy have left the other
     side, but they still have pickets there. Humpheys brought back some fruit &amp; butter so
     we get along very well until my box can come up -- his wife was "big with child" and he is
     sorry he went quite so soon -- so he told Brown.</p>
<p class="p10"> I hope my babies did not cry themselves sick but were well the next morning after I left --
     . I was much gratified to see how much they were improving and growing girl like -- on the way
     to woman hood &amp; hope they may continue the same good road --</p>
<p class="p10"> I am too weary to think or write more, so excuse me this time -- write to me quite soon --
     for I am anxious to know how you all are --</p>
<p class="p10"> God bless you &amp; keep you safely</p>
<p class="p10">Your loving husband</p>
