<h4>Augusta County: Diary of Joseph Addison Waddell (1855-1865)<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>About Joseph Addison Waddell:<br></b><a href="images/waddell.jpg"><br><br><center><img src="images/waddell.gif"></center></a><br><p class="p11"><b>Joseph Addison 
Waddell</b></p><a href="images/signature.jpg"><br><br><center><img src="images/signature.gif"></center></a><br><p class="p11"><b>Joseph Addison 
Waddell</b></p>Joseph Waddell lived in Staunton in Augusta County, Virginia, during 
the Civil War.  The surviving portions of the diary held by the 
University of Virginia covers the period from June 1855 to October 
1865.  His diary presents a neglected perspective from the Confederacy.  
Most Civil War diaries by Confederate men followed marches and battles 
across the South.  Diaries of the Confederate home front are usually 
the diaries of the women left behind, struggling to maintain order in a 
world increasingly depleted of men.  The home front was not solely the 
sphere of women.  Joseph Waddell told the story of the men who stayed 
home.Before the war, Waddell owned and edited a newspaper in Augusta 
County, Virginia, the <i>Staunton Spectator</i>.  
On the pages of his paper, Waddell supported Southern institutions.  
Privately, however, he noted in his diary his misgivings over slavery 
and his desire to see it extinguished in God's time.  In the prewar 
sections of his diary, Waddell described everyday happenings of 
family and community life as well as extraordinary events like 
feared slave uprisings.Waddell opposed secession, but supported his state in the Civil War 
nonetheless.  Initially too old to be drafted and later exempted by 
disability, Waddell did not serve his fledgling nation as a soldier.  
Instead, he performed his duties to the Confederacy as a clerk in the 
Quartermasters Office.  During the war years, Waddell recorded his 
views on slavery, abolition, politics, secession, and the war in his 
diary with great detail and clarity.  His commentary ranged from 
perceptive political observation to extensive battlefield rumors.  In 
his diary, Waddell recounted the confusion that greeted news from the 
battlefields of the South and the trepidation that greeted no news from 
the same quarters.  He described gatherings with friends and family, 
remarkable not for serving delicacies like "genuine coffee" but for 
their juxtaposition with the sacrifices of everyday life.  As 
conditions on the home front deteriorated, he celebrated the homespun 
ingenuity that transformed handkerchiefs into suit linings and 
"Confederate candles" into meager, but treasured, lighting.  Surrounded 
by hardship and tragedy, he expressed anxiety for loved ones separated 
by war and gratitude for those close at home.  He bemoaned the 
institution of slavery, but feared for the fate of an inferior people 
left to their own devices.  Through the war, Waddell remained a 
believer in the Confederate cause, but became increasingly depressed 
about its chances of success.Once Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox, Waddell counseled 
against further attempts to wage war.  In the subsequent months, 
Waddell described the looting of Confederate property in Staunton 
following surrender, occupation by Union military authority, and the 
assassination of Lincoln.  He expressed his disapproval toward both 
those who ingratiated themselves with Union commanders and those who 
flaunted symbols of Confederate patriotism.  Waddell became 
increasingly disturbed by the unruly behavior of ungrateful "negroes" 
emboldened by the presence of the Yankee occupiers.  Toward the end of 
his diary, Waddell discussed early attempts to restore Virginia to the 
Union, an endeavor in which he desperately wanted to participate.  
Waddell ended his diary in October 1865 when he ran out of writing 
paper.</p>

<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, June 2nd, 1855.  &#8212;  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This morning I took Virginia<a href="#n1">1</a> and Martha 
Lyle down to Tinkling Spring Church, in the carriage.  Presbytery has 
been holding a special session there since Thursday.  There was a large 
number of people, from every quarter of the county, in attendance.  Mr. 
Trimble and Mr. Emerson preached.  A heavy rain came up during the 
first sermon, and many persons going out to see after their saddles +c, 
the congregation was very much disturbed.  As the rain continued after 
the service, the people dined in companies in the church.  The scene 
was more like a merry picnic than an assembly met for religious 
worship.  &#8212;  We had quite a pleasant time.  Got to town about half 
past five o'clock.</p><p class="p10">Pa, "the old lady,"<a href="#n2">2</a> and aunt Sally<a href="#n3">3</a> returned from Richmond and Prince Edward this 
afternoon.  Mr Steel, our old Pastor, came up with them in the cars.  
It is eighteen years since he left Staunton, but I remember him 
distinctly.  Addison Alexander, of Princeton, staid with us last night.  
He is very social and agreeable, and appears to enjoy this visit to 
Virginia as much as the former one.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>August 1855 </b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, August 21st 1855.  &#8212;  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Since my former date we have had heavy affliction in our family, 
which is likely to be broken up.  Sad feelings oppress me, and there 
seems to be very little bright and cheering in this world.  "The old 
lady" left for Richmond this morning; Sister<a href="#n4">4</a> + 
her children will go soon.  The old house is left by the flood more 
gloomy than ever.  None of us can ever live there comfortably.  I 
wished to have the appraisement to day, but 
could not get the persons appointed to meet.  Hope to have it over 
Saturday.  We (or at least I) are greatly bothered in reference to the 
division of property.  In Legh's<a href="#n5">5</a> account we 
must keep the farm, for a while at least, and sell every thing that can 
be spared.  Sister must have her share and to let her have it now and 
leave something for Kate's<a href="#n6">6</a> present support is 
a difficulty.</p><p class="p10">My printing office partner appears discouraged about the business, 
and throws nearly the whole labor and care upon me.  For months past he 
has attended to affairs very little.  I feel that we are getting along 
badly  &#8212;  certainly unpleasantly.  He has much to complain of, 
however.  &#8212;  oppressed with company.  The Cooks are all here  &#8212;  two 
Gordons from Richmond  &#8212;  several of the Waynesboro' folks 
latterly  &#8212;  +c.  +c.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, Aug. 23rd 1855.  &#8212;  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This morning about 10 o'clock.  I rode up to the farm with Addy 
Stuart<a href="#n7">7</a>  &#8212;  he riding Alick's<a href="#n8">8</a> young bay mare, and I the old sorrel.  At the creek 
near Peaco's saw mill we encountered three men who had stopped with 
their wagons.  They were drinking out of a large bottle, and one of 
them invited me to join them.  On my declining the oldest man of the 
party, who was evidently a good deal intoxicated commenced cracking 
jokes upon temperance men, but his gibberish was unintelligible to me.  
&#8212;  The day was remarkably pleasant, and I enjoyed the excursion 
exceedingly.  Legh and I walked out to the woods, by the new ground 
corn, and tried to find the boundaries of the land, but did not 
succeed.  We then went up to the Henderson house to see a pear tree, 
full of fruit, which, however, is still quite green.  As we returned 
through the meadow, we heard the dinner horn.  Addy Stuart was blowing 
us up.  Lilly<a href="#n9">9</a> had set a table under the oak 
tree, and had provided a good dinner of middling and sundry vegetables.  
We then walked through the garden to the barn, where John Hill<a href="#n10">10</a> was <i>[illeg.]</i> a new plough <i>[illeg.]</i>.  
Joshua<a href="#n11">11</a> was cutting down some of the 
useless apple trees on the place.  About 5 o'clock 
we started home, but were driven into the saw mill by a shower of rain.  
Addy was impatient to return that he might attend a juvenile party at 4 
o'clock.  Found Mr. Cook and Lyt. at the 
office.  Went over to the Hotel, where Va 
was, and came up with her in the rockaway, bringing the papers of the 
morning.  &#8212;  The crop of wheat at the farm turns out 150 bushels, and 
the rye 140.  The newspapers dull  &#8212;  my business dull  &#8212;  in every 
department.  Va in the parlour at present with Mrs. T. of Wythe, and Miss 
P. P. of this county, who will depart tomorrow.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>September 1855 </b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, Sept. 9th 1855.  &#8212;  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">There was no preaching in our church to day 
(Mr. Wilson being at Bethel) and Virginia + I with the two little 
girls<a href="#n12">12</a>, rode out to Hebron.  Legh overtook us 
on the road.  The day was fine and the excursion in many respects 
pleasant, but my spirits were depressed and I was glad to get back 
home.  I met many acquaintances at the church, and received friendly 
greetings.  Mr. Lore preached.  Congregation not large.</p><p class="p10">Between 4 and 5 o'clock I went down home as Mr. Stuart and family 
leave to-morrow.  Their going makes me feel 
very sad.  Va talks of visiting them this 
fall, and I feel some desire to go myself.  Sister had two young Bantam 
chickens which we gave her to take home  &#8212;  I fear they will not 
arrive safely.  (My Shanghai cock has a return of his singular 
malady.).  Kate, Martha, Legh +c went to the Methodist Church to-night; the rest of us staid at home.  Mr. Taylor Lomax called in the 
afternoon and also at night, having just arrived from the Springs.</p><p class="p10">Until Friday the weather during the whole of this week was very 
inclement  &#8212;  clouds and rain  &#8212;  rain.</p><p class="p10">The corn crop generally is magnificent.  Peaches quite abundant  &#8212;  
for money.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This has been a very damp uncomfortable day.  As Virginia says we 
are now having the third equinoxial storm in this month.  All the fore 
part of the day I was at the office working on a circular for the 
Augusta Female Seminary.  Found it difficult to get a good impression, 
and about 12 o'clock laid it by, and came home.  Another reason for 
coming up earlier than usual (in addition to discouragement about the 
job) was, that we had company.  D<sup>r</sup> James Alexander, of New 
York, his wife and two sons  &#8212;  James and William  &#8212;  spent the day 
with us.  We also had aunt Sally, Miss Agnes M<sup>c</sup>Clung<a href="#n13">13</a>, Martha, Kate, Maria, and Lyt., to dinner.  &#8212;  The dinner was as good 
as common on such occasions  &#8212;  bacon, roast beef, chickens, ducks, 
Irish + sweet potatoes, Lima beans, corn, tomatoes, peaches + cream +c. 
+c.  I sat with the company so long after dinner that I thought it 
useless to go down to the office again.  &#8212;  Felt dissatisfied, 
however, as the jobs are pressing.  Legh came up just before day, to 
consult about the sale of a horse, and remained till after supper.  He 
and Tate went to town together.  Yesterday Tate bought F. Bell's farm 
on the M<sup>c</sup>Adamized road for $60 per acre, not, as he says, 
$50 according to the usual payments.  The children  &#8212;  Jimmy, Nanny 
and Matty<a href="#n14">14</a>  &#8212;  started to school on Monday 
to Martha Lyle, and seem much interested.  Kitty<a href="#n15">15</a> goes to Sue Campbell  &#8212;  very unwillingly.  We 
have all marked the contrast between James and Addison Alexander.  &#8212;  
the latter is so much more simple in his manners, and conversation  &#8212;  
and so much more agreeable.</p><p class="p10">Having a $1 Tennessee note and a $1 New York do last week, I enclosed them to Putnam 
for the first vol. of Irving's 
Washington.<a href="#n16">16</a>  It arrived yesterday by 
mail.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We have just returned from the Hotel.  Va went down street after dinner, and remained 
to supper.  A large number of strangers there, returning from the 
Springs.  This has been a most delightful day, and I have enjoyed it 
much  &#8212;  been unusually free from anxiety and care.  James Alexander 
has been a good deal at the office.  Wrote an <u>editorial</u> for me suggested by the fever in 
Norfolk.  He preaches tomorrow, and will leave on Monday.  Had a talk 
with Alick to day about our affairs.  &#8212;  
Martha has returned home, leaving Kate very lonesome.  Va suffered greatly yesterday and last night 
from head ache, but is quite well to-day.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">It was Court day to day  &#8212;  a number of 
persons in town, but nothing of interest occurred  &#8212;  Persons from the 
country brought in $18.50 for Norfolk + Portsmouth, which with $8.50 
previously received I sent to Col. G. W. 
Mumford of Richmond.  The collection in church yesterday, for the same 
purpose, amounted to $98.  We had two jobs today  &#8212;  hand bills.  The 
Alexanders left us finally this afternoon.  Went down to Waynesboro' 
accompanied by Aunt Sally.  James A. 
preached yesterday morning + night.  His text in the morning:  "The 
story in the grace which is in Christ Jesus," at night:  "Come now and 
let us reason together."  His preaching is not so lucid and able as 
Addison but more practical and it may be more useful.  He gave me a 
gold watch key, with the Gordon coat of arms on the seal, which he had 
cut in London.  Alick sent by him to N. 
Y. Pa's daguerreotype to have it engraved.  John Hendren 
informed me this evening of his anticipated marriage.  When I came 
home, found Ann + Lucy Peyton, Maj. Cochran 
+ Mary Donaghe here; also Mat, Lyle and Legh  &#8212;  The two last remained 
to supper.  I dined to day at Aunt S's</p></p>

1855.  &#8212;  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This afternoon we got news of the capture of Sevastopol by the 
Allies!  I felt a good deal exhilarated by the news, although most 
persons about here sympathize with Russia  &#8212;  Virginia is particularly 
zealous that way.  My feelings are more to be attributed to the regard 
one has for those of his own family and blood, than to any opinion I 
entertain of the merits of the controversy between the belligerents.  
The British are somewhat akin to us  &#8212;  and their literature and 
religion are ours.  In the French I feel no interest.<a href="#n17">17</a></p><p class="p10">Craver, is putting up the fence around the garden at this place.  He 
informed me today that he would be absent tomorrow, attending a Sunday 
School celebration at Churchville.  No wonder that laboring men who 
leave their work thus get along badly.  But some recreation and 
amusement is necessary, and perhaps it is well enough for him to 
go.</p><p class="p10">This morning we had a slight frost.  I finished Irving's Washington 
(1<sup>st</sup> Vol) to 
night.  &#8212;  rather disappointed with it.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Mr. Wilson preached this morning and to 
night  &#8212;  congregation on both occasions pretty good.  I was 
surprised to find on going to church this morning that the foundation 
was dug, for the front improvement  &#8212;  did not know that a plan had 
been agreed upon.  We had the first heavy frost of the season, this 
morning.  Va + I came by "home" tonight, 
returning from church, to get our lantern.  &#8212;  Alick all agog about 
putting up a house on the lot opposite.  We expect to go to P. E. about the 25th.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, Oct. 8th, 1855.  &#8212;  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Cloudy, damp, cold day  &#8212;  This morning about 11 o'clock, after 
getting through with matters at the office I came up home and went over 
to Simpson Taylor's sale.  Met a number of persons there, but nothing 
of interest occurred.  Before I went out I purchased a pair of under 
shirts at Kayser's, and in the afternoon I took a silk vest to 
Sterrett's to be made up.  Received a copy of the London Times by mail  
&#8212;  perhaps from Henry Alexander.  A rare communication came to the 
office also, from a man named Watson, at Churchville.  He sent an 
obituary notice of a Miss Cox, and requested its publication on 
moderate terms.  In a postscript he suggested that although he was not 
much of a writer he might be able to send us a few lines to pay for the 
publication, adding "on time, death, religion +c."  I regret that I 
have not preserved all such documents received at the office.  They 
would form a curious collection of literary, or rather <u>illiterate</u>, curiosities.</p><p class="p10">At dinner time time I observed that my young 
Shanghai cock was much duller than usual.  This evening he died, and I 
buried him in a hole dug for a post.  I shall miss him.</p><p class="p10">I have been galloping through Sydney Smith's Memoir by his daughter.  
Not much of a book.  He appears to have been personally an amiable, 
kind-hearted man, but too frivolous, and his whole character 
inconsistent with his profession.  So I cannot admire him as a 
man.<a href="#n18">18</a></p><p class="p10">We have lately been much amused at Nanny Tate's attempts to form the 
various parts of verbs.  She says "I clumned," for I climbed", and 
"rud" for rode.</p><p class="p10">Va is busy preparing for her trip to 
P. E.</p></p>

country, hunting, and I alone in the office.  Va came down street this morning, and we dined 
at the Hotel.  Mr. Tate went to his farm, and returned with Mrs. 
Walters who is now here.  About 3 o'clock N. Brooks + I started to the farm for a walk.  
The day had been delightful, but before we arrived at the farm, we 
observed the clouds forming in the West.  We had not been there long 
<i>[deleted: before]</i> until it commenced raining, + we took refuge with 
Legh and the servants in the barn.  We waited till near dark when the 
rain ceased, and then hitched up the spring wagon to come home.  I 
borrowed Joshua's oil cloth overcoat, which was useful as the rain 
commenced again before we started.  N. 
B. had a sack over his shoulders, and covered up his legs with 
the straw.  We reached town after dark, I stopped at 
the office to get the papers.  Arthur had taken them to the Academy, 
and I sent for them when I reached home.  No news of interest.  The 
Democrats are carrying everything before them in Pennsylvania and 
Ohio.</p><p class="p10">Very much bothered about our family arrangements.  Alick is anxious 
for Va and me to go down to live with 
them, and it is certainly desirable for some one to become house-keeper 
and take charge of affairs; but my expenses would be greatly increased, 
besides the trouble I would have to encounter.  Cornelia Christian is 
with Kate at present.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Felt very content and happy yesterday, last night, and this morning, 
but from about 10 o'clock have felt depressed.  N. Brooks and I went with Tate and Jimmy down to 
the Bell farm to get some corn.  We took the rockaway, and brought up 
about six bushels, which we had to shuck.  Jimmy drove back  &#8212;  the 
rest of us walked.  After dinner I went down street, got a new vest 
from the tailor's, settled an account with Peaco, waited for the mail 
and started home about 5 o'clock.  At "our house" I overtook Va and Mrs. Walters  &#8212;  The carriage met us 
there and I rode up with them.  Have read a little in a book called the 
Augustan Age of France  &#8212;  and reading the Spectator regularly.  &#8212;  
How frequently my mind dwells upon those words in Isaiah "Fear not 
<u>thou worm</u> Jacob!"<a href="#n19">19</a>  What could be more comforting!  If God addressed 
us in a different manner  &#8212;  if he said, "Fear not thou <u>man</u> Jacob; be strong and show yourself a man," 
when we feel weak, helpless, there would be no consolation in the 
passage for us.  He does not mock or reproach by calling us <u>worms</u>, but does it to let us know that he is 
fully aware of the extremity of our need.  Who does not often feel 
himself to be a very <u>worm</u>?  Yet, "fear 
not thou worm Jacob"  &#8212;  rely on my strength and protection  &#8212;  I am 
mighty to save and strong to deliver.  &#8212;  Oh that I may live nearer to 
God, day by day  &#8212;  to love him more  &#8212;  to serve him better.</p><p class="p10">"Lord, with this guilty heart of mine,<br>

country were in the office to day.  Capt. Henry, Tom. 
Galbreath, Frank Davis +c.  It did me good to see them, + find them so 
cordial.  As William Wirt said, "But for Friendship, literature, and

o'clock, stopped at the St Charles Hotel, and went on the next day  &#8212;  
reaching Keysville about 10 A. M. and Mr. Stuart's after 11.  I 
remained there till the following Tuesday when 
I returned to Richmond.  The cars were crowded with persons going to 
the Agricultural Fair.  We reached Richmond after dark, and finding the 
Hotel full, I sought lodgings at Mr. Gordon's, where Alick and Legh 
were staying.  On Wednesday (last) I visited the Agricultural Grounds  
&#8212;  on Thursday went to see the Penitentiary, and then to Slash Cottage  
&#8212;  and Friday came home.  Have felt restless ever since  &#8212;  miss 
Va exceedingly  &#8212;  have heard from her 
twice, but have written to her four times.  Tate goes to Richmond 
tomorrow, to attend Railroad meeting, from thence he will go to Briery,

not come up.  We arose early this morning and came up to breakfast, in

unpleasantly about her not writing.  &#8212;  She will get home on Wednesday

sleighing for so long a time in this section of country.  Yesterday was 
just such a day as the previous Saturday snowing from morning till night.  The cars which should have come

Never before, perhaps, has there been so much sleighing in this region 
during the same space of time.  The weather too has been very cold.  &#8212;  
There is no incident of interest to record in these pages.  My life has 
glided on quite smoothly for several weeks, or, indeed, moths-past, I have been unusually free from those

over me, and embittered existence, I have much to thank God for, since 
the "Union Republican" was merged into the "American," I have felt 
solicitous about the effect it would have on our business.  They lost a 
great deal about their large circulation, but so far have not taken off 
our advertising patronage.  The influx of business within the last week 
encouraged me a good deal, and to day I felt 
very cheerful, but this afternoon we received the Richmond papers, 
which contain notices of D<sup>r</sup> G. who is in the city soliciting 
advertisements, and proclaiming the immense advantages of the

however, interfering with our operations.  &#8212;&#8212;  Kate sought an

her grievances, I sympathize with her deeply.  Va got a fall to day,

was very severe.  Monday the 4th was probably the coldest day.</p><p class="p10">As to the "hard times" I have never known anything like the present

upon meeting a friend, "Any more failures since dinner?"  In the County

others in the Corporation Court.  We shall lose a good deal in the 
aggregate by these failures.  Lytt has 
been vigorously prosecuting our claim against G. + D<sup>r</sup> H. and

that he should pay the money for the balance on his account.  Not only 
the office, but the estate (my father's) will lose by the numerous 
insolvencies.  But I cant harass and <u>persecute</u> people however hard it is to have to 
bear these losses.  Since the 1<sup>st</sup> Jan, I have had very 
little money that I could have used for personal expenditures if my

fell into line marched about town, preceded by the Churchville Band in

no notice of Marshall, but commenced a furious tirade against "little 
Nisbet" (of Georgia?)  &#8212;  a Presbyterian preacher (Elder Stuart said) 
who weighed only 115 pounds.  Nisbet was the most amiable, benevolent 
man living, and would have walked a long distance to avoid treading on 
a fly.  He was thunderstruck, and rising with great astonishment and 
excitement informed Wise that it was not he but the gentleman from 
Kentucky that had offended him, and finally turned the tables on his 
assailant completely.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Little to do to day, and did very badly.  
No job work, very few advertisements, and no facility at editorial.  
Had a visit about dinner time from Oliver P. Baldwin, of Richmond.  
Late in the afternoon Mr. Marquess called in, and detained me at the 
office till after dark.  By the way I got into trouble by undertaking 
to act as trustee of the Seminary.  Mr. M. is decidedly complaining, and unfortunately 
he has a good deal to complain about.  We are trying to press on the 
buildings to completion, although we have not a cent of money.  &#8212;  
Yesterday was communion in our church      Rev. D<sup>r</sup>. Baker, of Texas, preached 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, and D<sup>r</sup> 
M<sup>c</sup>Farland Saturday and Sunday mornings      D<sup>r</sup> 
B. is collecting money for Austen College, 
Texas, of which he is President.  As he has a great reputation as a 
revival preacher I was a good deal surprised at the character of his 
sermons.  Parts of his discourse Friday night were very ludicrous.  The 
text was "Precious faith," and he told the story about Abraham offering 
up Isaac in a way to make every body laugh.  I understand that he 
remarked to D<sup>r</sup> M<sup>c</sup>F. 
+ Mrs. Wilson that it often did good to make people laugh in church (!)    
Yet there is an execution in his preaching that is 
very agreeable.  He said in one of his sermons that he had preached in 
this place some forty years ago, when he was pastor in Harrisonburg.  
He got no money here, I presume.  &#8212;&#8212;  Rev. Nathan Rice, D. D. of St. Louis, preached 
for us twice yesterday week  &#8212;  two very fine discourses.  I saw him 
at Healing Springs.  He is extremely unpretending and plain in his 
appearance and manner for a man of his ability and distinction.  &#8212;&#8212;  
The trial of Rev. T. T. Castleman is 
progressing before a council of Episcopal clergymen.</p><p class="p10">Alick informed me to-day that he felt quite 
uneasy about sister's health.  Her lungs, he thinks, are somewhat 
affected.  It has depressed my spirits.  &#8212;  When I came home to-night supper was over, but Va had set a cup of coffee away for me.  We 
took the lantern and went out to look after a hen with young chickens.  
I patched up a coop, and put the hen and chickens in it  &#8212;&#8212;  Politics 
are still in a tangle.  The recent elections in Iowa, Vermont and Maine 
have elated the Black Republicans.  The Buchanan men are rather cast 
down, and the Fillmore men more hopeful as the Republican triumphs go 
to show that the Democracy (Buccaneers) have no strength at the 
North.</p></p>

evening that the Whig National Convention at Baltimore had endorsed 
Fillmore and Donelson too.  The prospect brightens.  &#8212;  Business in

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The news this evening from Pennsylvania is decidedly bad  &#8212;  the 
Democrats appear to  carried everything before 
them.  With this state of affairs there seems to be little or no chance 
for Fillmore's election.  His friends throughout the country will be 
discouraged, and probably suffer the election to go by default.  &#8212;  
The Democrats here are rejoicing, and the Whigs and Americans 
correspondingly depressed.</p><p class="p10">This morning the ground was covered with snow, and everything 
without wore a wintry aspect.  It commenced snowing yesterday 
afternoon, and continued, at intervals, till late to-

been detained by the storm.  Mr. T. + Mary 
acted as attendants  &#8212;  father and daughter!  &#8212;  but he only took the 
place of one who failed to be there.  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  I was at the Corporation 
office to-day, and looked over the report of 
the assessment of real estate in town, lately made.  I find quite a 
difference between the assessment and the appraisement by commissioners 
of my father's property.  The brick house was appraised at $3000, and 
assessed at $2500; the stone house was appraised at $1700 and assessed 
at $2000; the garden cot + stable assessed 
at $800 and appraised $900 respectively.  This reminds me to enter a 
list of <u>my</u> possessions here, at this 
date, for the gratification of curiosity hereafter.  First, I presume 
my interest in the Printing office, accounts and all, is worth at least 
$3000; then I have 10 shares in the Central Bank  &#8212;  worth at this 
time probably $900  &#8212;  I have a Central Railroad Coupon bond for $1000  
&#8212;  worth $800.  I have bonds, which with interest and dividends coming 
due, will amount to about $1000 on the 15<sup>th</sup> of January next; 
the balance of my interest in the estate (exclusive of the property in 
which the widow has a life estate) is some $1500 to $2000; Selena is 
valued at $1000 (I have been offered that for her), and Moses is 
probably worth $200 to $300.<a href="#n27">27</a>  Our furniture, 
silver +c (including Virginia's) is worth some $200  &#8212;  Besides I have 
books and pictures  &#8212;  the former accumulating rather too fast for my 
means  &#8212;  which might bring $100 to $150.  Aggregate of <u>my wealth</u>  &#8212;  $8700.  I think this rather 
under than above the real value.  The following is an inventory of our

horrible to me  &#8212;  the money would eat into <u>my</u> flesh like hot iron.  Slavery itself is 
extremely repulsive to my feelings, and I earnestly desire its 
extinction everywhere, when it can be done judiciously, and so as to 
promote the welfare of both races.  Yet I am no abolitionists.  The day for emancipation with 
us has not come, and we must wait God's time.  For the present all that

at Waynesboro'.  Legh and I and the servants were at the Depot to 
receive the precious dust, and convey it to the Cemetery.  We were 
detained there till dark, the preparations not being completed.  How we 
all loved dear Kate, who was much older than little Bert at the time of 
her death; and she was the most beautiful and lovely child my eyes ever 
beheld.  How I  &#8212;  not to speak of her mother  &#8212;  grieved at her 
death, and even yet sorrow fills my breast when I think of it.  But 
yesterday we deposited in the ground all that is left of her on earth,  
&#8212;  calmly and without sensible emotion.  My spirits were heavy and sad  
&#8212;  I could not realize the words of Jesus, "I am the resurection and the life"  &#8212;  I could not 
look beyond the tomb.  Nearly all the day just past, my thoughts have 
been brooding over the scenes and transactions of yesterday.</p><p class="p10">While they were about lifting one of the boxes into the wagon, the 
horse took fright at the railroad whistle + dashed off.  Nathan, who 
was on the seat, was thrown out, but not injured.  The horse made a 
circuit in his flight, which enabled me to overtake him and seize the 
bridle; but I found it impossible to cluck him, and he ran some 
distance with me in that position.  I could not let go without danger 
of falling and being run over by the wagon.  It has startled me since 
to think of my peril.  My limbs have been quite sore to-day.</p><p class="p10">Mr. Tate returned yesterday from the Fair.  The Misses Graham are

In town Fillmore's majority, as reported late in the afternoon, was

staying longer than is desired, and do not wish to be charged with

suggest to Tate to invite the Misses Graham to take charge of the

publish a political paper under such circumstances.  My spirits have

particulars see the "Spectator" for Dec. 17<sup>th</sup> +

of the rumored negro insurrection to take place to-
night.  Several negroes about Greenville have been arrested + 
brought to jail.  I place no reliance in the reports, and fear that 
some poor negroes will suffer unjustly</p><p class="p10">My childish feelings always return in a great degree with every 
return of Christmas.  Oh!  how I did enjoy it once!  I had few 
Christmas gifts, but we had ginger cakes cut into horses, deer, hogs, 
birds +c, and all the hog bladders we could collect to burst before 
day-light.  Phil, old aunt Fanny's son, was the ring-leader in our 
sports, and then all the young negroes came home, each one of whom was 
an addition to our enjoyment.  People do not keep Christmas as they did 
then.  &#8212;  Now we hear very few guns, which played so important a part 
in former times.  One Christmas morning I well remember.  I was 
probably 10 or 12 years of age.  I rose before day, as I always did on 
Christmas mornings.  Phil had built a fire in the dining room, with a 
big Christmas log behind, and then to my great grief he had gone off.  
His <u>mammy</u>, who was always calling him, 
whether she really wanted him or not, we thought, started to bring him 
home.  I followed him through the dark to "Hill's pump," and from there 
we could see the flashes of the guns fired near the Wayne tavern as it 
was then.  Between every valley, we could hear Phil's voice, singing 
the greatest glee.  The old woman  &#8212;  not very old then  &#8212; went on 
down, shouting at every few steps  &#8212;  "You Phil!  you Phil!" 
notwithstanding I begged her not to go, as she might be shot!  I 
returned home, and retain no further recollection of the day; but the 
impression of this much is as distinct on my memory as if it occurred 
yesterday, instead of some twenty years ago, or now.</p><p class="p10">Va has been busy to-
day preparing for a dining to-morrow

lantern for Jimmy and gave it to him to-

Va has found in the water bucket just 
from the spring a number of small fish.  They doubtless run into the 
spring because the water there is at a higher temperature than in the 
creek.  Last night there was a little fellow, about an inch long, in 
the bucket, and I caught him and put him in a glass jar of water.  He 
has seemed very lively ever since.  This evening Jimmy + I went down

sick in my childhood, some member of the family placed one or more 
small fishes in a glass bowl for my amusement.  Perhaps it was owing to 
this circumstance that for long afterwards I felt a great fondness for 
the same kind of <u>pets</u>, and made frequent 
unsuccessful efforts to catch the minnows which were so abundant in 
"the creek," as we used to call it.  Once I succeeded in grasping what 
I thought a fish, and hastened home in a high state of excitement with 
my prize.  I rushed into the kitchen, calling loudly for water, that I 
had a fish!  &#8212;  but alas, it proved to be a lizard or tad pole.</p></p>

up the business so.  To-night about supper 
time, but in a clear moon-light, I took a cullender and tin bucket and went fishing.  The 
first souse brought up seven, and that was all I could catch; for the 
rest, (I presume there were more) instantly dived out of my reach.  For 
convenience I placed the cullender on my 
head, and as it froze tight to my hat, I had no trouble in bringing it 
home, I wonder the little fish did not perish on the way, it was so 
very cold.  They are now sprightly enough in the jar above the fire-
place.</p><p class="p10">Yesterday afternoon N. Brooks + I took 
a ride in the wagon to see Legh.  It was real winter, but the trip was 
quite pleasant to me.  Legh was to all appearance, happy as a Lord with 
his pigs +c +c.  He has a room with a stove, bed, two tables, two 
chairs, old bureau, a case for papers, a few books, a carpet.  Joshua + 
John Hill were threshing rye at the barn with flails  &#8212;  John jr was hauling wood to town.</p></p>

in others the ground is nearly bare.  It has entered the house at every 
crack, even coming into our chamber through, or rather under, two 
doors.  We have all been house-bound      I went out soon after

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yesterday morning I rose pretty early, for <u>me</u>, and soon after breakfast started to the 
office.  I had to break a path through the field, and in some places 
the snow was very deep, and walking very tiresome.  Such as storm as we had the day before was probably never 
known hereabouts before  &#8212;  at least everybody said so.  Mr. Stuart, 
(A. H. H.) told me that his thermometer was at <u>zero</u> nearly all day Sunday, + Todd Gilkeson, of 
Christians Creek, made a similar report.  Ours after night, in a 
sheltered Southern exposure, was at -3<sup>o</sup>.  The morning 
yesterday passed off at the office very quietly.  I found Lyt and Legh there when I got down, and the 
boys were just starting to breakfast.  There was no mail Sunday and 
none has come yet  &#8212;  since Saturday.  We had no difficulty, however, 
in making up the paper.  I called at the Hotel yesterday before dinner, 
and Miss Agnes gave me a pocket full of cakes.  She afterwards sent me 
by a servant a waiter full of pies, cakes +c, as I did not go to 
dinner, I had no appetite, and Lyt, 
William and the boys, disposed of the eatables.  In the afternoon, 
N. Brooks, B. 
Christian, Gilmer, Mauzsy, Mat Coulter + 
others came in and we had quite a merry time.  Legh was there a good 
part of the day.  Returning home at dusk I had to break the path again, 
the wind having filled up the tracks I made in the morning.  &#8212;&#8212;  This 
morning we got through our usual Tuesday's work with more than usual 
ease.  I dined at the Hotel.  In the afternoon, A. H. Stuart, Jno. Baldwin, Mr. Campbell and others came in to 
get the paper, and remained some time to talk.  N. Brooks was there nearly all morning.  There 
were many sleighs running during the day.  Before I got to the style, 
on my return home this evening, I observed Va and the children on the knoll, near the 
road, Mr. Tate and Thornton having opened a path from the house.  I 
caught Nanny + Mattie + laid them in the snow.  &#8212;  Jimmy ran away.  
There is a snow bank before the house, in which I laid Va, while Mattie looked on not knowing whether 
to laugh or cry.  &#8212;&#8212;  Last night I finished reading "The Ocean," by 
Gope, and to-night I read aloud to Va, nearly a hundred pages of Reed's Lectures 
on English Literature</p></p>

my fish are was frozen when I left my bed, but not when Va arose.  &#8212;  No cars yet!  &#8212;  none since 
Saturday evening, so that we are in total ignorance what is going on in 
the great world.  An engine came up yesterday, and reported that the 
track was clear, from Greenwood.  It went on to the Western terminus 
(Millboro') and returned last night.  It is said that there was 
comparatively little snow in the mountains west.  Feeling quite unwell 
this morning, I came home to dinner, and did not return to the office 
in the afternoon.  Two cups of tea at dinner, however, restored me to a 
comfortable state of health.  Legh paid me a visit to-night  &#8212;  coming in while we were at supper  -

the water cooler, and from thence passed into the jar when the water 
was changed.  Thornton says he brought up a number yesterday in the

They were arrested at Louisa Court house, and detained there till

from Richmond) they spent the night in the cars, arrived at 
Charlottesville, and reached Staunton the next day.  Bob Napper baked

amused the children by relating various reminiscences of him.  He was 
an old <u>native</u> African, and belonged to 
uncle Lyttelton.  If I ever was acquainted with his early history, I 
have forgotten it.  His breast was <u>tattooed</u>.  He pretended to speak his native 
language, and also French.  Before the law prohibited it he officiated 
to his colored bretheren as a Baptist 
preacher, and I remember to have heard him hold forth to a congregation 
in "Kennedy's barn."  They got around the law in some way.  It was a 
sermon preached on occasion of the death of "Kennedy's Mat."  The old 
man used to count in his native tongue for the amusement of children.  
From 1 to 10 ran in this way, as near as I can reduce the words to

year, I feel that it has been the happiest of my life, and I would 
praise God for his lovingkindness.  
He has disappointed many of my fears and delivered me from some sore 
troubles.  I am gratified to be able to record, which I do with 
diffidence, however,  &#8212;  and I hope in no boastful spirit  &#8212;  that so 
far as I can judge I have made some progress in religion.  It seems to 
me that I am more decidedly on the Lord's side, and that I desire more 
earnestly and constantly to love and serve Him.  Yet I am daily 
conscious of indwelling sin.  Oh to be delivered!  Jesus Christ is 
indeed "the chief among ten thousand and altogether lovely."  Perfect 
freedom from sin constitutes one of the chief attractions of heaven.  
The interest in the subject of religion, which is now manifested more 
or less in every part of the country, is exhibited to some extent in 
this place.  &#8212;  A number of persons have professed conversion in the 
Baptist, Lutheran and Methodist churches.  No unusual meetings have 
been held in our church, but I hope the members are somewhat 
aroused.</p><p class="p10">Kate expects to go to Waynesboro in the morning, where Presbytery is

Scriptures and praying.  Mr. Baker called at the office before hand to 
obtain my consent to lead in prayer if called upon, but I declined.  I 
do not know how for the feeling which influenced me was a proper one.  
I think it was not that I was ashamed of Christ  &#8212;  No, Divine 
Redeemer!  I am willing for all the world to know that I revere + love 
thee.  But a general indisposition to be forward in public enterprises, 
arising from a fastidiousness which is often excessive, and sometimes a 
great hindrance to me, seems to have been the chief cause of my 
disinclination.</p><p class="p10">Mr. John Baker preached last night in our Lecture room, and also

After she succeeded in getting a correct sentence, he called for a

Miss Goodwin.  We were up be-times, getting them off.  Va went into the cellar to get some pickle for 
Kate, and slipping on the wet floor got a fall.  She came up and told 
me of the accident, but complained of no pain.  As she was very muddy 
she went up stairs to wash, and I sent Drusy to 
bring water for her.  After a few minutes I went up myself, and found 
her sitting in a chair, very pale and with the countenance of a corpse.  
She said to me that she was very sick, and I proposed to help her to 
the bed; but she objected on account of the mud.  I then placed a 
pillow on the floor and laid her down.  She said she was unconscious 
for a short time and recovered just as I entered.  I sent for Kate to

part of a discourse only for Hebron, intending to extemporise at the close.  He professed to 
feel greatly embarrassed, and I was as much so.  In one place he he began to remark  &#8212;  "As Job says"  &#8212;  and then 
hesitated as if he had forgotten, but finally concluded  &#8212;  "As Job 
says, 'Lord; thy hand is heavy upon me.'"  Riding home he told me that 
Job had said nothing of the kind so far as he knew, but he had to say 
something or take his seat (!) I comforted him by the assurance that I,

to inform me that John had visited him when he undertook to chastise 
him for some impudence  &#8212;  that he indulged in threats against him and 
the family, kept a pistol, went to bed with two hickory sticks +c +c.  
He said John must leave his place  &#8212;  that their lives were in danger.  
I promised to go out if possible in the afternoon, but failing to 
procure a horse, wrote to Legh asking him to ride up this morning.  
About noon to-day I received a note from Legh.  
He had been up  &#8212;  found Wright quite excited  &#8212;  had made 
arrangements to have John tied and brought to town for trial.  He 
thought W. had been too exacting, requiring 
too much work, and that the fears of the family had been unnecessarily 
aroused by the idle tales of the female servants about John's talk and 
conduct.  I went up on a horse which Legh sent in for me, and he 
accompanied to Wrights.  The family seemed rather nervous and John more 
alarmed, apparently, than anybody else!  As they were afraid to keep 
him and wished to send him off, I brought him down to Legh's and left 
him there.  Wright had heard John make no threats, but the negroes had 
told him; he had seen no pistol and could fine none, but the negroes 
had seen it.  He, however, produced a stout cudgel which had  found in John's bed, and kept hid under the porch, 
as proof positive of the boy's "mischievous" intention.  John denied 
that he had made any threat, or ever had a pistol.  He acknowledged 
that he had cut the stick  &#8212;  he was going to a corn husking in the 
neighborhood, and having heard so much about bears, he wanted some 
means of defence.  &#8212;  Some one else, he 
said, had put it in his bed.  The whole affair became extremely 
ludicrous.  The Harper's Ferry affair has certainly bewildered the

Junction had been renewed, and this morning there is intelligence of a 
great battle, lasting from 8 A. M. till 6 P. M.  The victory is 
attributed to our side.  The enemy were said to be retreating, pursued 
by our cavalry.  Total loss (on both sides, it is presumed), ten 
thousand to twelve thousand.  Most of the volunteers from this county 
were on the field, and we know that at least a part of General 
Johnston's command was in the engagement.  The utmost desire, not 
without apprehension, is felt to obtain full particulars.</p><p class="p10">At night the telegraph announced that one member of the Staunton 
Artillery and two of the Guards, (William H. Woodward and Joab Seely), 
had been killed, and that seven men in both companies were wounded.</p></p>

the Staunton Artillery.]  He began the letter Sunday morning (21st), 
and in the first part gives an account of the march from Winchester and 
the arrival at Manassas.  In the midst of a sentence he breaks off to 
say that he heard the report of cannon and must go to his post.  At 5 
o'clock P. M. he resumed and told about the battle; but at the close of 
the letter could not say definitely what was the result.  On a separate 
piece of paper he states that General Johnston had come along and 
announced a victory!  More troops arrived last night, and a second 
North Carolina regiment this morning.  Others are still here.</p></p>

immense.  The Federalists seem to have anticipated an easy march to 
Richmond, and were provided with all sorts of conveniences and

manner, but generally well-behaved.  The Rockbridge militia, some eight 
hundred strong, arrived day before yesterday.  They have arranged to 
furnish their quota of volunteers, and the remainder will return home.  
The militia of Augusta, outside of Staunton, have also raised their

and sometimes make ludicrous mistakes.  A party of them called at Mr.

officer afterwards made his appearance, called for a room and dinner, 
and announced that he would be back to supper, leaving directions as to 
what he would have prepared.  On taking his departure at night, when 
pay was refused for his entertainment, he discovered that he was not in

the trees or walked about, while the soldiers and others stood, or sat, 
or lay at full length in the grove.  *  *  The ladies are bent upon 
nursing at the hospital.  Perhaps they agree with the <i>Spectator</i>, (No. 193), "that there is in military 
men something graceful in exposing themselves naked."  I hear some 
ludicrous stories of their performances.  Mrs. &#8212;&#8212;- was very anxious 
to "do something," and went fussing round till she found one of the 
doctors.  He gave her two prescriptions, which she hastened to 
administer, but was alarmed afterwards upon discovering that she had 
given a dose of calomel to a typhoid fever patient.  It is said these

better than none.  *  *  We had an illustration yesterday evening of 
the difficulty of getting true accounts of military operations.  On the 
arrival of the western train the baggage master told A. F. Kinney that 
Wise's troops had recently killed four hundred of the enemy, with only 
a small loss on our side.  I did not believe that, but on my way home I 
encountered Richardson, who came down on the train, and he informed me 
that John H. McCue, just from the region where Wise is, had come in 
with him and told him that Wise had a fight in which fifty of the enemy 
were killed, with no loss on our side, and that the sixteen prisoners 
brought down were taken in that affair.  I have learned this morning 
that there is no truth in either story, yet neither of the persons

The government, however, owned a large number of horses and wagons, and 
for these drivers only were hired.  On September 24th, thirty-two

The ranks, however, are not as much reduced as I would have expected.  
From the matter in which the men ran over the town to procure bread, I 
presume they were suffering from hunger.  They carried their bread, 
cakes, etc., in very dirty hands.  They came down by railroad, and went 
on after a delay of two or three hours.  Other regiments from the west

of skirmishing in that region.  &#8212;  One or two Regiments passed 
yesterday evening by Railroad, for the Greenbrier region, from which 
our troops were lately withdrawn.  &#8212;  The weather has been more

skirmishing in that quarter, but we have no authority or detailed 
account of it.  My old friend James D. Armstrong, of Romney, who came 
up with me to supper, discredits the report as to Loring's whereabouts.  
He gives a sad account of the depredations and oppressions practiced by 
the Yankees in Hampshire county, but says the outrages are having a 
good effect upon the people, in ridding them of all remains of sympathy 
for the Yankee Government.  A letter from Lewisburg says the people of 
that region are in arms against the invaders, and intend to resist them 
to the last.  The militia was out, waiting for the arrival of the 
22<sup>nd</sup> Regiment when they contemplated a movement against the 
Federal troops in an adjoining county.  The Southern rights men of 
Braxton Co. have rallied + burnt Sulton, the county seat, where the Federalists had 
located themselves.  &#8212;  After Armstrong left to-
night, Arch Alexander came up, and is spending the night here.  
He is on his way to Richmond.  I saw a beautiful pair of gloves to-day knit from the wool of rabbits!  They were as

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">During the year just past I kept an account of my cash expenditures.  
The amount was $874.13.  Of this sum, $139.30 was costs of the new 
office which I built during the year  &#8212;  leaving $734.83 as costs of 
living +c.  Part of the above, viz $129.45, was expended by Va.  I purchased tobacco during the year, 
amounting to $3.81.  Am surprised to find how little I contributed to 
religious and benevolent objects.  I should add to the above $20 loaned 
to Legh in the summer.  No news to-day.  The 
Northern papers are again publishing reports of widespread disaffection 
in the South  &#8212;  multitudes anxious to return to the Union, and 
waiting opportunity  &#8212;  great suffering at Richmond.  Not one word 
true  &#8212;  With such stories the feelings of their people were inflamed 
and kept up to a war heat.  The rumor of our occupation of Romney is 
not confirmed.  Mores made a second payment to-
day on the lot.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Little or no news to-day.  The Yankees have 
another great expedition on hand, known as "the Burnside expedition," 
which is about to make a descent upon some part of the Southern coast.  
The papers of to-day intimate that it is 
destined for the Rappahannock, and intend to outflank our army near 
Centreville.  The New York Herald crows lustily over the forlorn 
condition of the "Rebels"  &#8212;  The government of Jeff. Davis is on its last legs, there is 
great suffering in the South, and thousands anxiously awaiting the 
approach of a Union Army.  So says the Herald.  The last two assertions 
are positively false, and I am aware of nothing to justify the first.  
Is the Herald crowing to keep up the courage of the North?  It admits 
to a great want of funds by the U. 
S. Government, and the danger of a general financial crash.  I 
do not keep posted as to the state of affairs in Missouri and Kentucky, 
nor indeed anywhere.  But things do not look particularly encouraging.  
&#8212;  I had a visit Saturday night from Tucker who lay sick at the 
Academy so long last summer.  He has fattened so that I should not have 
known him.  I am kept very busy in the Q. 
M. office.  Peyton, who has the Commission, knows little or 
nothing about the business, and looks to me for nearly everything.  
Legh sent my sow + pigs in on Saturday afternoon  &#8212;  Pigs were that 
day a month old.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Notwithstanding the blockade, and all the efforts to prevent 
communication with the South, Northern papers are still received every 
few days by the Norfolk + Richmond editors.  From the Washington 
correspondence of these papers, as copied by the Richmond Dispatch, it 
seems that a general movement is about to be made against us with more 
than 400,000 men, along the whole line, from the Potomac to the 
Mississippi.  The Burnside expedition is to have an important part in 
the programme, but its destination is still 
involved in mystery to us.  The vessels were in Hampton Roads at last 
accounts.  &#8212;  The U. S. papers 
report that 22,000 of their soldiers had died of disease from the 
beginning of the war to the 22<sup>nd</sup> Dec., the number killed 
11,000, wounded 17,000, and taken prisoners and <u>deserted</u> 6,000.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, Jan. 18/62</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The destination of the Burnside expedition, which sailed from 
Hampton Roads several days ago, is not yet known.  I am inclined to 
think, however, that it is the mouth of the Mississippi or to some 
point from which it can co-operate with the Federal army preparing to 
move from Cairo and thereabouts.  &#8212;  It is probably a part of the 
scheme to open the navigation of the Mississippi to the North West, a 
matter of almost vital interest to that section.  The Federalists have 
undoubtedly made formidable preparations for this enterprise.  How far 
we are ready to meet them, I do not know.  Cameron, Lincoln's Secretary 
of War, and, it is reported, other members of the Washington Cabinet, 
have resigned.  I am kept very busy in the Q. M. Office, and enjoy the occupation 
highly.  Lyt is there and Blackley, as 
Clerks, the former having a good many spare minutes, which he generally 
employs in relating the incidents of his life in camp, on the march and 
at the battle of Manassas.  The Capt 
(Quartermaster) knows little about his business and leaves matters 
pretty much to Blackley and me.  B is a 
competent clerk, but very slow.  Little Mary, Alick's child, is very 
sick with qunizy.<a href="#n43">43</a>  
Kate is staying there to-night.  It is 
extremely painful to see the little thing suffering.  Some days ago we 
heard that the Federalists had abandoned Romney, upon the approach of 
our troops, who now occupy the town.  Gen. 
Jackson's recent expedition to the Potomac from Winchester has <u>used up</u> his army, from all accounts.  The 
soldiers are said to have suffered terribly, having been out without 
tents, or blankets, in the snow, and even without food for two days, if 
I remember aright.  Joe Ryan, who was at home on furlough, came up to 
see his company.  There was a rumor to-day 
that the Yankees had burnt Lewisburg  &#8212;  not believed.  From the vigor 
and extent of their preparations it seemthat 
the North really hopes to conquer the South.  The teachings of history 
are all lost upon the infatuated people of the former section.  Philip 
II of Spain endeavored for long years to subjugate the little republic 
of the Netherlands.  Spain being then at the zenith of her power.  The 
Netherlands became a flourishing State, while Spain soon afterwards 
began to decline, and finally sank into a decrepitude, from which she 
has only of late years been emerging.</p></p>

Received a letter from Davy Strasburg to-
night.  He is near Romney, with his company.  Gives a fearful 
account of their sufferings, while on the expedition to the Potomac, 
opposite Hancock, Md.  They were two days and nights without food.  No 
shelter except their blankets.  One night they were exposed thus in a 
snow storm.  He and Ed. Waddell spread a blanket on some rails, next a 
fence, and slept under it.  The Burnside expedition is reported to be 
at Cape Hatteras, N. C.  No other

Mary, are very sick, to all appearance they are suffering from that 
terrible scourge dyptheria.  Alick has 
almost entirely given them up, and seems crushed to the earth.  Mary 
looks very ill to-night.  In addition to 
this affliction, they have had "old uncle Bob," a free black man, 
there, dying by inches from gangrene.  Alick took him in as an act of 
charity, but his room being in the basement, a most offensive odour was diffused through the house, which became 
intolerable.  He was therefore removed to the army hospital to-night.  I feel so greatly depressed that I can 
hardly allude to other matters.  It would seem that the Federalists 
were about to move from all points, with overwhelming numbers, with the 
expectation of crushing out "the rebellion" in a short time.  Nothing 
definite in reference to the Burnside expedition.  It's object is 
probably to get possession of the Weldon + Wilmington Railroad, N. C.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, Jan. 24, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Bad news!  Yesterday we received a report that our General 
Zollicoffer had been killed and his army defeated, in Southern Kentucky 
near the Tennessee line; but as the news came through a Philadelphia 
paper received at Norfolk, and we had no such intelligence through 
channels open to us, it was not credited.  This evening, however, we 
have a full confirmation from Richmond.  The battle was fought near 
Somerset, Pulaski Co., Ky., Maj. 
Gen. Crittenden commanding on our side.  He made the attack, and 
the battle lasted till Brig. 
Gen. Zollicoffer fell, when our army became demoralized and left 
the field.  It is said we lost five hundred (500) in killed and 
wounded, cannon; army stores, +c, +c.  In a word, that it was a 
complete rout, and that Crittenden was in full retreat to Knoxville.  
The news has had a very depressing effect, particularly as it was 
believed that, without some such signal success, the Northern people 
would soon give up the war.  There is still reason to believe that the 
Federalists are about to make a general assault at all points.</p><p class="p10">Little Mary has seemed better to-day, and 
Addy is at least no worse.  His father has been somewhat relieved from 
his depression of yesterday and last night.  Addy is a wonderfully 
smart boy, but very bad and unmanageable.  He wished to know last night 
where he would go, if he died.  He is between four + five years old.  
We have had a terribly stormy day  &#8212;  snow, sleet and wind.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Va. at Alick's again to-night  &#8212;  The cheerfulness with which she 
undergoes such labors is admirable.  I would not have consented for her 
to sit up anywhere else.  The children seem in about the same 
condition.  The war news is not encouraging for us, the enemy's forces 
outnumbering ours vastly, and pressing in on every side.  The last 
report in relation to our defeat in Ky. 
is that we lost 300 men  &#8212;  that Crittenden with 6000 attacked the 
Federalists, supposing them to be 1500 in number, but they turned out 
to be 14,000, strongly posted and fortified at that.  There was a 
report to-day that a large body of Federalists 
(15 regiments) were approaching Lewisburg.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, Jan. 27, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Little Mary is again very ill, with every probability that she will 
not survive.  I cannot think of her without experiencing very painful 
feelings.  But "doth God care for sparrows?" and does <u>He</u> not order whatever concerns this child?</p><p class="p10">H. W. Sheffey came up from Richmond 
yesterday, and reported that nine vessels of the Burnside expedition 
had been lost, and that the whole fleet was probably destroyed by the 
fierce storm which prevailed, for several days last week.  There is no 
confirmation, but rather a denial, to-day, of 
the report Mason has arrived from Romney.  He reports the ravages of 
the Federalists in that region as shocking to the civilization of the 
age.  A party of them were killing the cows or pigs of an old man, who 
came to his door and remonstrated with them.  They charged him with 
aiding the "rebels," and upon his replying that he was a poor man and 
had to work for whoever paid him, they shot him down and set fire to 
his house.  Mason saw a part of his body, not consumed, and it was 
riddled by bullets.  He seemed to be about 80 years of age.  The 
Federalists killed hogs, and piling them together left them to rot.  
Surely the name of Yankee will be execrated for generations in the 
Southern country.  The spirit of enormous malignity which possesses 
them is utterly fiendish.  Simon De Montfort and his crusaders were not 
more bloodthirsty and remorseless than many of the Northern people seem 
to be.  The U. S. Government is now 
endeavoring to destroy the part of Charleston by sinking old hulls off 
the mouth of the harbour!  A Northern journal 
complacently says that the contemplated advance of 
M<sup>c</sup>Clelland's army, "will spread weeping and wailing through 
many a Southern household."</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, Jan. 31, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">When I left Alick's this evening, at supper time, little Mary was 
sitting up, feeding herself with a spoon!  It was delightful to see the 
little thing with a placid countenance and free from suffering.  She 
appeared to get better yesterday morning or the previous night, 
although she may not now be out of danger.  Cloths soaked in hot water 
were applied to her throat + chest during the night and on yesterday, 
and to-day they discovered that she was 
severely blistered.  There was also a discharge from her ear, which has 
probably contributed to her relief.  Addy is thought to be doing well  
&#8212;  very bad and unmanageable  &#8212;  He could be a very interesting child 
if he were not so impracticable.  Kitty is laid up with some thing, but 
not much sick, apparently.  She imprudently sat in her room with a 
window hoisted, day before yesterday, when the weather was mild and the 
sun shining.  During the whole of January, with the exception of that 
day only, I believe, we have had rain, sleet, snow or at least clouds.  
The bad weather, and consequently impassable roads, has probably 
prevented the long anticipated advance of the enemy at various points 
of invasion.  There was a rumor both yesterday and the day before, that 
the Federalists had received a great overthrow at Bowling Green, Ky.  It came from Washington to Norfolk.  No 
confirmation of it.  We have at last something authentic from the 
Burnside expedition.  Gen. Burnside has 
reported to Washington that thirty or forty of his vessels are missing, 
and he fears they are lost, or several of them certainly and the 
remainder, a large fleet, were on the coast of North Carolina.  I have 
finished the reports of our office, for the last quarter, and have some 
expectation of going to Richmond with them next week.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Distressing intelligence to-day.  The 
Federalists (Burnside expedition) have taken Roanoke island, N. C. capturing about 3000 of our men, 
after two days' fighting, on Friday and Saturday.  We have no detailed 
account.  It could not have been expected that 3000 men could hold an 
<u>island</u>, assailed by a vastly superior 
military and <u>naval</u> force  &#8212;  Following 
closely after further bad news from the West, the disaster has had a 
very depressing effect.  While I was in Richmond, on Friday, news came 
that the enemy had taken Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, our small 
force there being compelled to abandon the place, leaving their 
artillery behind.  There is a universal feeling of discouragement and 
depression.  Some men say that we may as well give up, but, of course, 
we are not yet prepared for that.  The military bills pending in the 
Legislature cause much anxiety as they contemplate a draughting, to raise a force of 65,800 men.  The 
bills were probably passed to-day.  I went to 
Richmond on Thursday, and returned on Saturday.  Had an unpleasant trip  
&#8212;  the city full of people, principally soldiers.  Staid at the 
American Hotel, and had a room with an elderly merchant from Norfolk 
and a young man from Georgia who belongs to the army of the Potomac.  
The Hotel crowded.  I could not induce the clerks at the 
Quartermaster's Department to look into my papers.  They would probably 
not reach them for six months.  Crowds of people connected with the 
army at or near Centreville, going and coming on the Railroad between 
Gordonsville and Richmond.  On my return I found Va suffering from very sore eyes.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Another dreary day!  The intelligence of yesterday is fully 
confirmed, with the addition that the Federalists have certainly 
ascended the Tennessee river as far as Florence, Alabama.  Just before 
the cars arrived the news flew through town that a dispatch had come, 
stating that only 100 of our men were <u>captured</u> at Roanoke Island, and the cars 
immediately brought word that England and France had acknowledged our 
independence.  But alas!  the dispatch was soon corrected at Richmond, 
only 100 had <u>escaped</u>.  The other item is 
not sufficiently authenticated to be fully credited.  Several young men 
from Staunton were with Wise's Legion at Roanoke, and their friends are 
suffering great solicitude on their account.  The military bill passed 
the Legislature yesterday.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The batch of news by to-day's train was 
not more cheering than that received yesterday.  After the arrival of 
the cars, there was, or seemed to be, a general feeling of 
discouragement as to the issue of the contest, but no disposition was 
manifested to submit to Northern domination.  There was a report that 
an immediate attack at Centreville was expected, and another that 
75,000 of the enemy were marching upon Winchester.  The latter is not 
credited.  It is now said that we lost 1700 men at Roanoke Island, and 
that 400 escaped.  Capt. Wise is said to 
have been <u>murdered</u> by the Federalists 
after he was taken prisoner.  This is doubtful.  The Richmond Dispatch 
of to-day does not give a flattering account 
of things generally.  Every man subject to military duty is 
anticipating the draught and many persons, 
especially those having families dependent upon them, are full of 
anxiety.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Intelligence this afternoon of fighting at Fort Donelson, on the 
Cumberland River.  It had been going on for two days, and so far the 
enemy had been repulsed.  Shall we hear to-
morrow that the Fort has fallen, or that the final success is 
ours?  Oh God, let not our enemies triumph over us!  There are other 
reports from that region, but not sufficiently reliable to be 
mentioned.  The Federalists have taken several of the towns in the 
vicinity of Roanoke Island.  They seem to have full success now in that 
quarter.  There is a report that the Emperor of France declines to 
interfere in American affairs.  This is discouraging.  The price of 
cotton in England has gone up, which indicates that the expectation of 
getting supplies, by raising the blockade of our ports, has diminished.  
I have felt somewhat relieved this evening of the depression which has 
afflicted me, in common with others, for several days  &#8212;  perhaps 
going to prayer meeting helped me.  A constant purpose of business in 
the office had prevented my going since last August.  The militia are 
to be enrolled immediately, and a portion of them draughted, unless a sufficient number of

we went down street.  I went to Mrs. M<sup>c</sup>Clung's room to wait 
for the opening of the mail.<a href="#n44">44</a>  Learned there 
that Frank Wilson had come up from Harrisonburg and reported that 
apprehension was felt that the enemy might make a sudden inroad with 
cavalry from Moorfield, Hardy Co.  There 
was no powder in the town, but two of our cavalry companies were 
expected to-night.  The enemy are said to be 
30,000 strong at Romney.  They have pushed forward a force to 
Moorfield.  Very few of our men killed at Roanoke Island, and I 
suspect, not a great many of the enemy  &#8212;  the last report says about 
200.  A few nights ago, as Kate and I were sitting in the dining room, 
we heard what seemed to be the shouting of a crowd in the lower part of 
the town.  We rushed to the front porch, both of us supposing that some 
good news had come by telegraph.  To our great disappointment, the 
noise was not repeated.  Kitty heard the same sound, and went to window 
to listen, telling Kate as she entered the chamber, that maybe some 
good news had come.  Alas!  there has been nothing yet to cause a

<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, Feb. 16, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Every face is bright and cheerful to-
night.  Passengers from Richmond repeat that Gen. Sidney Johnson telegraphed last night that 
our troops at and near Fort Donelson had achieved the most decisive 
victory of the war.  At Charlottesville, the cars met rumors, said to 
have been received by telegraph, giving extravagant accounts of the 
victory.  &#8212;  that the enemy were 50,000, and we 20,000 in number, that 
we took 10,000 prisoners and captured 100 cannon!  These stories are 
not credited, but there seems to be no reason to doubt the report as to 
Gen. Johnson's dispatch.  Gen's Floyd and 
Buckner are said to have been in the fight which lasted for three days.  
They were at Russellville when heard of before.  The cars arrived this 
afternoon at a quarter past 4 o'clock, while I was walking in the yard 
in the snow.  Va was at the colored 
Sunday School and I hoped she would bring some news when she returned.  
She entered the dining room, where Kate + I were, about 5 o'clock, 
looking gloomy, I thought, from which I infered that the news was bad.  But she had heard 
nothing!  I then went out to see if any were passing could tell me 
anything.  A young man, whom I hastened to intercept at our stable, had 
been at the American Hotel, after the arrival of the cars, but had 
heard no news!  Surely, I thought, the man is stupid not to have 
inquired.  Albert Garber and Col. Lilly 
passed along the M<sup>c</sup>Adamized street  &#8212;  too far off for me 
to speak to them.  They looked gloomy too!  At last Tom Bledsoe 
appeared in view, coming towards his house  &#8212;  the Academy.  I ran to 
ask what he had heard, and from him received the intelligence brought 
by the Railroad passengers.  At church, to-
night, before preaching, we had it in full.  To God the praise

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Our rejoicing was soon over.  This morning it was rumored that the 
telegraph operator at Gordonsville had sent word that the enemy had 
defeated us at Fort Donelson and taken Nashville!  Although not 
credited, it set us to thinking that the Federalists had greatly the 
advantage in numbers in the neighborhood of the battle field; and in 
the means of bringing up reinforcements; and therefore that the battle 
of Saturday was probably not decisive and final.  The cars brought us 
precisely this intelligence.  The Federalists were reinforced Saturday 
night, and our army also, it is said.  Gen. Johnson had abandoned Bowling Green, and it 
is evident that, notwithstanding the fighting on Thursday, Friday and 
Saturday, the great battle in that region had not taken place.  
Dispatches received at Richmond yesterday by the authorities were not 
made public in time for the cars, and we can hear nothing by telegraph.  
&#8212;  So we are in a state of anxious suspense.  The course of the enemy 
down the Valley is threatening.  Dont know 
what they propose.  Kate contemplated going to Richmond, to the 
inauguration, which is to take place next Saturday, but the sombre views of last week caused her to discontinue 
her preparations.  &#8212;  This morning she began again, feeling cheerful 
on account of yesterday's intelligence; it depends upon circumstances

The enemy were expected at that place very soon.  There is a report 
from Augusta, Ga., that Gen. A. S. Johnson had offered to surrender the 
city if the Federalists would agree to respect private property.  Kate 
has given up her trip to Richmond.  It is impossible for me to describe 
the state of feeling in the community  &#8212;  the depression and feverish 
anxiety.  Union with the North, however, on any terms, is not thought 
of.  The Richmond papers give us no news directly from Nashville or

Mr. Phillips from Lynchburg, saying that our total loss was 1000  &#8212;  
that Floyd, Pillow and Johnson (not A. S. it presumed) were at 
Nashville.  It was feared, however, that as the number was reported in 
figures, it might be 10,000 instead of 1000.  Upon the arrival of the 
cars, we received the Richmond reports, stating our loss as 1500  &#8212;  
Thus the Northern account of yesterday was a <u>0</u> too many.  A rumor came with the cars, also, 
that Gen. A. S. Johnson had re-taken Fort 
Donelson.  This is not credited.  The latter General was reported by 
the papers to be at Nashville, entertaining no thought of giving up the 
city.  Kate goes to Richmond to-morrow.  &#8212;

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The cars did not arrive last night till near 8 o'clock, and Va + I walked down to the Post Office to get 
the paper, the children having gone to a Sunday School exhibition at 
the Baptist Church.  The terror of the news was discouraging.  Great 
uncertainty as to the truth of reports received the day before.  No 
communication with Nashville.  Why or wherefore, no body could tell.  
There is a mystery about the disaster at Fort Donelson, and the state 
of our affairs in that region, which is inexplicable.  &#8212;  Yesterday we 
were all cheerful  &#8212;  to-day things look 
gloomy.  It is rumored that four or five French vessels of war are in 
Hampton Roads, and that President Davis had received a communication 
from the Emperor, not to be opened till to-day  
&#8212;  inauguration day.  Not very probable.  Kate went to Richmond 
yesterday.  Kitty + I accompanied her to the cars.  A young woman was 
pointed out to me in the ladies' car, who, it is said, came to Western 
Virginia from Ohio or Michigan, with the Federal troops  &#8212;  some said 
in command of a company.  She deserted to our side.  Was a hard-
looking, Indian-like person.  A good many persons have hired 
substitutes for the war, in anticipation of the draught.  Great anxiety felt by many who, from one 
cause or another, do not wish to enter the army.  The last foreign news 
is discouraging.  Salt very scarce and high-priced  &#8212;  None in town 
for sale.  Persons going round to borrow a little for table use.  I 
have none  &#8212;  about a spoon full on the table at dinner.  Legh is out 
and his stock are suffering.  A supply for sale is expected soon.  Cars 
just came in  &#8212;  have not heard the news.  &#8212;&#8212;  The report is, no 
news.  Sheffey has arrived, and says Richmond is as much in the dark as 
we.  What does it mean that  can get no tidings!  
Possibly the Union men in East Tennessee have possession of the 
Railroads + Telegraphs.  Possibly the Government is suppressing the 
intelligence.  &#8212;  These are specimens of the surmises indulged in.  
But, if the Unionists have <u>risen</u> as 
supposed, there are still avenues of communication to Augusta, Ga., and other points South; and, moreover, we 
should hear of it from Bristol, Tennessee.  And the Government is not 
suppressing intelligence  &#8212;  1<sup>st</sup> because they could not, 
and 2<sup>nd</sup> one of the Richmond papers states that the War 
Department knows no more than the public.  Rumors that Gen. Price has gained an important advantage 
over the enemy in Arkansas.  The Federalists had a report on the 
17<sup>th</sup> that Savannah had been taken by their troops.  No so, of course.  The general impression is that they 
can come up James River and take Richmond, whenever they choose.</p></p>

thinks I ought not; but I am doubtful as to my duty.  It is very 
unpleasant to me to reflect that others are encountering dangers and 
hardships, while I am safe at home.  I earnestly pray that God will

encouraged many Northern sympathizers in Richmond + Norfolk to show 
themselves.  Martial law has been declared at Norfolk + Portsmouth, and 
will be at Richmond soon, perhaps.  There seems to be no doubt that our 
military stores have been brought from Winchester to Strasburg.  It was 
reported yesterday that our troops were evacuating Centreville + 
Manassas.  This is denied, but there is probably some ground for the 
rumor.  The papers of yesterday stated that our loss in prisoners at 
Donelson was about 7000.  There is a general feeling of distrust in the

Manassas, ready to start at a moments warning, and it is presumed that 
some important movement is on foot.  The train which should have 
arrived here yesterday has no doubt been employed for the same purpose.  
For a week or two past we have had rumors that our army stores were to 
be removed from Manassas, Centreville +c., to Gordonsville, where, we 
learn, extensive store houses have been erected.  Many wagons, 
moreover, have been impressed in Albemarle and other Eastern counties, 
to go to Manassas.  This morning forty 4-horse government wagons 
started from here for the same place, in pursuance of orders received 
on Monday.  What does it all mean?  There was a rumor this morning that 
Winchester could be evacuated in a day or two by our troops, but stage

the engine was detached from the train to go to Manassas, and the 
passengers were left to get on as they could.  They came to 
Charlottesville in the Lynchburg train, and had to remain there till 
yesterday.  Kate started yesterday morning, but the engine being very 
indifferent the train did not get in till 2 o'clock this morning.  
Instead of coming home upon her arrival she went to D<sup>r</sup>

had invented!  Kate has had a great deal to tell about her visit.  She

can be called preaching.  It was an account of the ravages of the enemy 
in Hampshire county, and an appeal for volunteers.  The congregation 
was large.  News came last night by telegraph that the Merrimac, 
ironclad +c, and now called the Virginia, made an assault yesterday 
upon the Federal shipping at Newport News, and did considerable 
excavation.  The intelligence is confirmed by the 
Railroad passengers this evening.  One Federal steamer was sunk, with 
all on board, and several others captured  &#8212;  we presume from the 
account.  It is said also that Gen Magruder was shelling Newport News.  
The dispatch of last night stated that Gen. Price had gained a victory at Boston 
Mountain, in Missouri or Arkansas, killing two thousand of the 
Federalists and taking four thousand prisoners.  No confirmation of the

to Winchester.  Report a few days ago of a victory near Leesburg

particulars.  The Richmond papers bring a Proclamation from the 
Governor calling upon the militia to go at once to various points named 
and report to our Generals.  The forces of this country to report at 
Winchester.  The Confederate authorities have called for 40,000 men 
from Virginia, and cannot wait the operation of the law lately passed 
by the Legislature.  All around the horizon our affairs look gloomy.  
Immense numbers of the army are threatening us at every point.  The 
Winchester stage brought word this evening that things were quiet at 
that place on Saturday afternoon, but three large bodies of the enemy

His near-sightedness would probably exempt him, but he expects to start 
with the others on Friday.  The Richmond train have not arrived yet, 
not being able to pass a large number of cars on the track at or near 
Gordonsville.  It is stated that they extend ten miles  &#8212;  probably an 
exaggeration.  The telegraph reported to-day 
further triumphs of the "Virginia" near Norfolk.  Four steamers of 
large size and three gunboats destroyed, and three gunboats captured  -
-  this is the report.  The last intelligence from Winchester is that 
when the enemy were advancing on Saturday (?) Jackson had his force 
drawn up and Ashby attacked them with his cavalry.  They ran, or at 
least retired, and according to one report have gone beyond 
Charlestown.  Our army are reported as in fine spirits.  &#8212;  Northern

more than 4500 effective men.  He will probably continue to fall back

retired to the Rappahannock, and the Federalists now have the Manassas 
Gap Railroad.  Two engines from that Road are coming up the turnpike to 
this place.  It is reported from Richmond that the Va. Central Railroad is to be our line of defence.  &#8212;  Before our troops left Winchester, 
they arrested several of the citizens suspected of sympathizing with 
the enemy.  Soon after going down street this morning, I perceived that 
there was <u>bad news</u>, before I heard a word 
on the subject.  The various groups of persons on the streets indicated 
by their appearance that something untoward had happened.  There 
appeared, also, to be an unreasonably large number of business hours 
closed.  I am at a loss to know what has become of all the soldiers we 
were supposed to have in the field.  Joe M<sup>c</sup>Clung says that

The whole day has been one of suspense and anxiety to us.  Our 
community begins to anticipate the appearance of the enemy here in the 
course of a few weeks, and it is a matter of frequent conversation as 
to whether the women and children shall stay or fly, 
and if the latter where they shall go.  Jackson's army, when last heard 
from, was at Woodstock.  A portion of the rolling-
stock of the Manassas Railroad arrived yesterday and last night, over 
the turnpike.  Our militia did not get off yesterday, but <u>expect</u> to start to-

great pleasure, as he said they would be caught by a division of our

been so many reports about our leaving a force in that region, that I 
begin to think it <u>possible</u>.  Commissary 
supplies forwarded a few days ago to Camp Alleghany, have been brought

going to break up them?  I see that the quota of troops to be furnished 
by South Carolina is something over 12,000, and part of them have to be 
raised by conscription!  Yet South Carolina was willing, apparently, at

me this evening that the Federalists had not yet come this side of 
Winchester, except their pickets; that they would not, probably, at

come, as our army is so located as to catch them if they do.  The 
Appomattox company of the 44<sup>th</sup> Va. Reg. came in 
from Highland to-day, on their way to

Cralle, whom I scarcely recognized.  I called to see 
Judge Thompson to-night  &#8212;  found him very 
hopeless as to the prospect before us.  Tried to <u>comfort him</u>  &#8212;  told him about the sufferings 
and defeats of our people in the Revolution of '76.  He would admit no

my table by a noise in the street, and upon going to the door 
discovered a man bending over the gutter on the opposite side, and 
another on the pavement with several persons struggling over him.  A 
voice said "He killed him"  &#8212;  Some cried, "Take the knife from him!"  
The prostrate man was "Alf Shiflet," of a notorious family, and the 
other man, said to have been killed, was named Patterson.  Fisher, 
Provost Marshal, secured Shiflet and let him off  &#8212;  Patterson was 
struck by a stone thrown by Shiflet.  Presently the cry arose that 
Shiflet had broken loose and was escaping.  He ran down the Railroad  -
-  I joined in the hue-and-cry, but soon gave it up.  Taking refuge 
under Art's slaughter-house, he was soon captured and brought up to

were captured by our cavalry scouts in Pendleton or Hardy, while 
endeavoring to escape from militia service or the draught.  Ten or 
eleven of them are from this county, and the remainder from Rockingham.  
They were endeavoring to make their way, in small parties, to Ohio.  
Some, if not all of them, are simple-hearted, inoffensive people 
belonging to the Drunkard Church.  They will be sent to Richmond to-morrow, and are confined to-night in the Court house, every door and window 
being guarded by a sentinel.  It is reported that altogether they had 
several thousands of dollars in specie.  Thirty-one houses, 28 saddles 
and 29 bridles belonging to them were turned over to the Quartermaster 
here.  I will take a descriptive list and appraisement of the property 
to-morrow.  It was, of course, necessary to 
arrest and bring back the deserters, but there is something pitiful in 
their fleeing in this manner and being taken like partridges on the 
mountains.  The whole crowd had a pocket pistol between them, and one 
soldier arrested twenty of them.  I believe that most of them, and 
perhaps all, had no hostile intentions towards us.  Two of them are

I met Sam Baskin, just returned from Jackson's army.  He said the enemy 
had been 70 000 strong at Winchester, but had gone off, leaving only 
8,000 behind, after laying a double-track Railroad to Strasburg [18 
miles this side of Winchester.]  Soon afterwards I encountered Sandy 
Garber, just arrived also.  He said the enemy had seventeen regiments 
at Winchester, and has never been out of the town, in this direction,

in force at Woodstock!  I did not believe it, but still the report was 
repeated.  Finally Peyton told me that it was actually so, official 
information having come.  Afterwards Alick came by the office + 
informed me that an army surgeon, just from Jackson's camp told him the 
Federalists were really at Woodstock and that a battle would certainly 
soon come off.  Jackson had 7000 men.  The sick, commissary supplies

that she would stay at home.  Kate was at a loss to know what to do.  
The children appeared very hilarious.  After dinner I rode up to 
Legh's, to communicate what I had heard, to save them from fright 
should they hear the report.  Bell and her mother were very calm and 
contented apparently.  They are to come to our house upon the first 
alarm.  Legh wrote to Bell from New Market, in good-spirits.  He said 
he suspects militia numbered six hundred.  It is said the number will 
be increased to 800 to 1000.  Some 8 or 10 stage loads of sick soldiers 
arrived this evening.  A large number of wagons with supplies from the 
army, also arrived to-day.  The wagon on which 
a large cannon was drawn, broke down opposite the Valley Hotel, and the 
piece was lying there at 3 o'clock this afternoon.  A train of wagons 
went down the Valley this morning to aid in bringing up the stores, + a 
large party of volunteers from Roanoke went along.  The ten stages take

reinforcement; but none as to the other.  There has been a rumor for 
several days that an outbreak had occurred in Maryland, which had 
caused a backward movement of Federal troops  &#8212;  not credited.  It is 
asserted also that a Maryland regiment in the Federal army had refused 
to cross the Potomac, till they were forced over.  No news of interest 
in the Richmond papers.  Our magnificent victory in Arkansas has been 
whittled down to a point.  Frank Preston returned last night with John 
Alexander, and they spent the night with us.  Va gave them an early breakfast this morning.  
A petition was circulating to-day, asking for 
martial law in Staunton.  I oppose it.</p><p class="p10">While at Legh's yesterday, and on the road, I could but observe the 
<u>quiet</u> aspect of the country.  The cattle 
in the barn-yard and the sheep in the field and all nature seemed 
perfectly composed.  Oh if the rage of man could be lulled to rest!  
Returning home I met a man and asked him the latest news  &#8212;  "Nothing 
special," he replied, "not many getting off, but I did."  The ruling 
thought with him was in reference to the Board of exemption from 
military duty.  The upper regiment from Rockbridge passed through to-day, John Graham, John Barclay +c with them.  I 
had a talk with Moses to-day about the state 
of affairs.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Legh walked in this evening, to our great astonishment.  As soon as 
we could recover sufficiently to enquire how 
he happened to come, he told us that when the men were inspected to be 
"mustered in," he was rejected, on account of his defective vision.  He 
gave us a glowing account of his <u>adventures</u> on the way and with the army.  The 
trip was very exciting and pleasant to him, and he would have been glad 
to stay for a short time, but was of course gratified that he was not 
taken in for three years.  The army, he says, seemed to be in a high 
state of enjoyment, but glad to receive the reinforcement from this 
county.  The volunteers were dressed in every imaginable style  &#8212;  
some wore slouched hats, some caps of their own manufacture, and others 
the old-fashioned high-crowned beavers; the only thing <u>uniform</u> about them was the <u>dirt</u>.  When he arrived at New Market a large 
number of wagons were engaged in bringing the stores from Mt. Jackson.  
The loads were emptied in great haste and the teams hurried back for 
more, as the enemy were approaching.  The people of the neighborhood 
were flying with what property they could carry off  &#8212;  some 
apparently poor persons having their chickens tied on the wagons.  The 
men, however, old and young, were coming into the army with their guns.  
The hurry + tumult were kept up nearly all night.  The next day the 
Augusta troops were marched down near Mt. Jackson, meeting the army 
coming this way, and were quartered on the Wren 
farm.  The cavalry were between them and the enemy at Woodstock, and a 
battle was regarded as certain.  &#8212;  The next morning the army suddenly 
put in rapid motion towards Woodstock, and it turned out that they were 
pursuing the retreating enemy:  The people Lyt encountered appeared greatly relieved when 
they learned that the Yankees had gone back.  He brings no certain 
intelligence as to affairs  &#8212;  only the rumors we had heard before  &#8212;  
Jackson, however, had received no reinforcements from Johnson's army.  
A Lieutenant of Legh's regiment was engaged to do the washing for some 
of his men!</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Various rumors to-day, scarcely worth 
mentioning  &#8212;  One said that 40,000 troops raised by Lincoln in 
Maryland had rebelled, and then that the whole Federal army East and 
West of the Blue Ridge, had retired across the Potomac  &#8212;  probably on 
account of the Maryland "rebellion."  No news from the papers.  For 
several days past the cars have come in quite early in the afternoon.  
Brown sugar is now retailing at 33 1/3 cents per pound  &#8212;  two 
shillings.  I bought a barrel in Richmond when there, at 13 1/2 
<sup>c</sup>, I believe it was, I cannot enjoy the possession of it, 
for thinking of other persons who must do without any.  Salt is not to 
be had at any price  &#8212;  Wood is extremely difficult to get.  After 
burning up all his bean poles, Mr. Baker had to cut down a shade tree 
to-day, for fuel.  We were fortunate enough to 
get three loads last week, one of them very small.  Supplies are again 
going out to the army on Allegheny mountain.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Soon after I got to the office this morning, Ally came in and told 
me that he had met a Captain at the breakfast table, who gave him an 
account of the "rising in Maryland."  Part of Baltimore and other towns 
had been burnt by the Federalists, while the people had destroyed 
Railroad bridges +c +c to retard the progress of Federal troops.  A 
woman from Frederick City had brought the news to Jackson's army, from 
which the Captain had just come.  I did not believe three reports, but 
still could not help being somewhat elated by them.  Shortly afterwards 
I encountered Judge Thompson, who informed me that news had just come 
by Express, that Jackson had received a serious repulse near 
Winchester, nothy but the approach of 
night saving his army from total rout.  I insisted that it would not be 
so, but soon found that such intelligence had really come by letter, 
and was probably true.  Our loss in killed and wounded was said to be 
200.  During the day, other reports were put out  &#8212;  one that Jackson 
claimed to have come off best in the fight  &#8212;  another that both 
parties withdrew  &#8212;  but it is useless to relate all the rumors which 
are constantly circulating.  A tremendous battle will take place before 
long near Memphis  &#8212;  For the first time for many months, I worked a 
little in the yard to-day  &#8212;  cleaning the

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, March 26, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The first intelligence this morning, communicated to me by Blackley, 
was that a young man wounded in the battle near Winchester, had arrived 
during the night or early in the morning.  His account was that we had 
lost 350 killed, wounded and missing, and that the enemy's loss must 
have been much heavier, as they presented dense masses to our guns.  It 
was rumored afterwards that Stafford, of this place, a Lieut. in the 
5<sup>th</sup> Regiment, was among the killed.  We heard nothing more 
till late in the afternoon, when a large number of wounded (160 it was 
said) arrived in stages and ambulances.  The surgeon in attendance 
reported our loss as about 400  &#8212;  others said 500  &#8212;  but all 
concurred in the statement that the enemy's loss was probably as great 
as the number of troops we had in the fight  &#8212;  variously reported 
from 2500 to 4000.  Jackson had fallen back to Mt. Jackson, and the 
enemy were cautiously pursuing.  Several statements are made in 
reference to the treachery of the enemy, hoisting white flags and 
taking them down again, but I am not certain that the stories are true.  
Va went to the Hospital to assist in 
providing for the wounded  &#8212;  She said it was a painful sight, but the 
patients were remarkably cheerful.  Several of them remarked that the 
greatest trial they endured was leaving their wounded comrades in the 
hands of the enemy.  The Federal force is estimated at 18,000.  A 
considerable portion of Jackson's army was not in the fight, not having 
come up.  A party of horsemen from Rockbridge  &#8212;  some twenty  &#8212;  
passed through town this afternoon, going down the Valley  &#8212;  One 
little fellow, being very tipsy, fell off his horse, and there was much 
delay in getting him on again.  As he finally rode off he tried to 
raise a shout, but was too drunk.  And this youth is going to encounter 
danger  &#8212;  perhaps death!</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">To-day I set out a damson tree on the east 
side of the wood-house.  After dinner I planted, a rose bush, jasmine 
and honeysuckle and stuck two grape cuttings at my 
office, back of the stone house.  Late in the afternoon I walked with 
Va, to the Institution (Military 
Hospital) to see the wounded soldiers.  Young Sherrer, of Appomattox, 
and another one to come here to stay, to-
morrow.  Returning, I called at Davis Kayser's to see Col. Echols, who had just arrived, badly wounded 
in the arm.  An Asst. Surgeon, just from the Army, came to the Hospital 
while I was there.  He said that another battle was about to take 
place.  Jackson having collected some 4000 men.  In reply to a 
question, he said the lowest estimate of the Federal force was 20,000.  
Jackson was certainly moving down the Valley again at last accounts.  
Many reports are current  &#8212;  One, that Jackson had received orders to 
fight the enemy as often as possible, to detain him in the Valley; 
Another, that Johnson was to have been at Winchester with an Army on 
Sunday, but was unable to cross the Shenandoah river.  It is said to-day that Stafford was not killed.  What a change 
has come over the feelings of the people since the early months of this 
war!  We hear of the wounded and slain, almost without emotion.</p></p>

calling to me that Wm. Waddell had come to 
tell me that Lyt's little Alick was 
dead!  I was greatly shocked, not having heard of the child's illness.  
Indeed he was not really ill for more than an hour before he died.  He 
was unwell yesterday, and supposed to be threatened with scarlet fever, 
but no apprehension was felt for his safety till past mid-night.  Lyt was at Buffalo Gap, and aunt Sally's Tom 
was sent for him.  I went to meet him out of town.  It was most painful 
to me.</p><p class="p10">Many rumors in town to-day.  At 10 o'clock 
last night there had been no more fighting down the Valley.  One or 
more letters have come from persons in Winchester.  They give the 
Federal loss in the late battle as 1500 to 2000  &#8212;  doubtful  &#8212;  the 
number of their slain 800, doubtful.  Our total loss killed, wounded 
(many slightly) and missing is put at 465, of which 170 are prisoners 
and 40 to 100 killed.  Our troops composing Jackson's army are all 
Virginians  &#8212;  that is Virginia Regiments, viz: 2<sup>nd</sup>,

averaged 400 men, probably.  The artillery is in strong force,

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, April 3, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">On Saturday morning last, as soon as I got to the office, I met 
Capt. Mason to aid in the removal of the 
army stores from that point, Hoge having come in on account of the 
illness of his wife (Mason's daughter).  I did not wish to go, but 
could not refuse under the circumstances, and started, on horseback, 
about 10 o'clock.  From town to Mason's Shanties (22 miles) I rode 
rapidly, a hard-trotting horse.  Changed horses, and travelled the remainder of the journey to 
M<sup>c</sup>Dowell more leisurely, but in heavy rain most of the time.  
As the rain froze upon my umbrella, covering it with ice which I could 
not knock or get off, I had a heavy load to carry.  
At dark I arrived at M<sup>c</sup>Dowell, and as there is no tavern in 
the village, I solicited and obtained shelter at Hull's, sleeping with 
the Rev. Mr. Price.  A few days over 
seventeen years before, I had spent a night at old 
Maj. Hull's, there being no village there.  On 
Sunday morning, before breakfast, I rode on to Monterey  &#8212;  arrived 
sore + weary.  Met with many acquaintances, and found all hands 
cheerful and cordial.  The Quartermaster's office was small, crowded 
and dirty  &#8212;  the chamber where I slept, very dirty.  I had to get to 
work immediately.  &#8212;  Wagons from Camp Alleghany unloading, others to 
Mason's Shanties + Ryans loading up.  Till quite late at night I was 
busy packing up +c.  I got very little rest when I lay down to sleep 
upon a hard mattress with dirty sheets, spread upon the dirty floor of 
a room formerly used as a hall for the "Sons of Temperance."  &#8212;  The 
Churchville + Rockbridge Cavalry were at Monterey, Capt. M<sup>c</sup>Nutt, of the latter, being 
commander of the Post.  Monday was, of course, a busy day  &#8212;  wagons 
going and coming  &#8212;  At eleven o'clock I went up to bed, weary and 
sleepy, hoping to get some rest even in the dirty chamber.  I had an 
attack of dyspepsia, possibly  &#8212;  which effectually aroused me.  I 
went to the office of D<sup>r</sup>. Davis, an As. Surg., and got a prescription which relieved me.  
The next day, feeling still unwell, I started home, in company with 
Wm. Wilson, who had gone out in charge of 
a train of wagons.  We came along leisurely, going off the road several 
times to enquire for maple sugar.  Staid at 
Wilson's that night  &#8212;  several sick soldiers there, who had been 
brought on in an ambulance  &#8212;  the little house was full.  Rode on the 
next day to the shanties, and came to town with Mason in his buggy.  
Still feel tired and <u>invalidish</u>.</p><p class="p10">The withdrawal of our army has caused a great panic in Highland and 
Bath + Pendleton counties.  &#8212;  Many of the people came flying to get 
off from the Yankees.  It was really painful to me to witness the 
anxiety of the women.  The army, it was supposed, would stop at the 
Shenandoah mountain, but I doubt if it stops there long.  I suspect 
that it will move on to Jackson's aid.  Last night it was at 
M<sup>c</sup>Dowell.  From Jackson's army, the last news is that both 
sides were advancing for a fight, near Edinburg.  Recruits + returning 
furloughed soldiers are going down every day in large numbers  &#8212;  130 
to-day.  On Monday night there were 900 in 
town.  A large number came up on the cars this evening and will go on 
to-morrow, I presume.  We have a young man 
named Sherrer, from Appomattox, who was slightly wounded in the recent 
battle, staying with us.  His brother came on from home to join his 
company Tuesday night, and staid here till this morning.  &#8212;  Very

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A report to-day was that the enemy had been 
repulsed at Yorktown, but were mounting siege guns.  The same dispatch 
stated that we had gained a battle at Corinth, Miss., capturing eight batteries.  &#8212;  This 
afternoon another dispatch (from Mr. Boteler, member of Congress at 
Richmond,<a href="#n46">46</a> to Gen. Jackson, at or near New Market) was 
received, about as follows:  "Beauregard achieved a complete and 
glorious victory at Corinth.  But Sidney Johnson was killed.  News from 
the Peninsula (Yorktown) favorable."  The cars brought nothing later, 
of course.  This morning A. H. H. Stuart had a letter from R. L. Doyle, 
who expressed the belief that Gen. Jackson 
contemplated retiring to Waynesborough.  
The army, he said, were in too large force for Jackson to contend with.  
Various reports as to the destination of Gen. E. Johnson's army, lately at Alleghany 
Mountain.  I feel sure that the larger part of it will go to reinforce 
Jackson.  Davy Strasburg came up Saturday.  He looks well.  Has been in 
three fights, since he left home on the 17<sup>th</sup> of April '61.  
&#8212;  Hainesville, Manassas, and Kernstown or Winchester.  One young man, 
Sherrer, is very good-natured and talkative.  The London Times says 
truly that conquest of the South by the North is impossible, that 
success on either side is impossible, that peace is impossible, that a 
continuance of the war as at present, and a restoration of the Union 
are both impossible, and the only possibility is that we shall have a 
military dictation before many years.</p><p class="p10">A man named Weller was arrested near Mt. Sidney, on Saturday, and

Department was sent up here this morning by telegraph.  He claims a 
great victory at Corinth, on Sunday, but confirms the report of Gen. Johnson's death.  No cars have arrived yet 
from Richmond (nearly 11 o'clock), since last evening.  Blackly 
returned this afternoon from Mason's Shanty  &#8212;  He says the 
12<sup>th</sup> Georgia Regiment have gone back to Monterey, a party of 
the enemy having appeared there on Sunday.  Most of our army are on the 
Shenandoah mountain.  Many persons from Highland are in or about town, 
having left their homes and families for fear of being captured and 
taken to Ohio.  Yesterday I met a Kinkead, of Crab Bottom.<a href="#n48">48</a>  Three <sup>(3)</sup> of his negroes had run off.  
&#8212;  Young Gallaher, of Charlestown, a member of the 4<sup>th</sup> 
Va. Regiment, now an invalid in the Army 
Hospital, tells me that the Yankees are using the negroes very hardly 
down the Valley  &#8212;  working them severely during the day and hand 
cuffing them at night to prevent their escaping.  The late battle near 
Winchester seems to grow in importance.  The moral effect is as good as 
a victory.  The North thought our men were fleeing before theirs like 
frightened sheep, when suddenly a mere handful turned and dealt a blow 
to the overwhelming force opposed to them which has exacted surprise if 
not consternation.  Last week we had reports of several hundred Union 
men from Rockingham and other counties being on the Blue Ridge  &#8212;  
Nothing since.  Another wintry day  &#8212;  rain, snow, sleet.  Four 
hundred recruits for Jackson's army, arrived to-

out again from Norfolk, and was playing havoc amongst the Yankee 
rebels.  Next Legh came in, with a glowing face, and told me that a

The dispatch was from A. R. 
Boteler, M. C. to Gen. Jackson, as 
follows:  "Gen. Beauregard has obtained 
another glorious victory near Corinth.  The Yankee army completely 
routed, and Gen. Buell killed."  Every 
body was in a good humor.  But in the evening a dispatch came which 
indicates that a two days' truce, to bury the dead, was agreed to and 
of course neither party had undisputed possession of the field.  To-night we received the mails for the last four 
days.  The newspaper accounts of the first battle near Corinth are not 
as favorable to us as first represented.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Legh was with us at dinner to-day, and as 
he was about to return down town, I saw him, from the yard, in the 
porch with some one.  He called to me that a young soldier was applying 
for quarters.  I was getting some shrubbery to set out at my office, 
but came in, and was surprised to find Addy Stuart.  He had arrived 
with a large party of recruits and re-enlisted soldiers from Montgomery 
and neighboring counties.  His parents agreed to let him come this far, 
hoping to cool his ardent desire to join the army.  He is sixteen years 
old, and of delicate constitution.  No news to-
day  &#8212;  no mail nor dispatch from Richmond.  Twelve Yankee 
prisoners were brought up from Jackson's army this afternoon, and 
placed in the room over the County Court Clerk's Office.  A drunken

&#8212;  commanded by Fremont, were at M<sup>c</sup>Dowell; another that a 
Yankee army of 20,000 was crossing the mountain from Culpeper to get in 
the rear of Gen. Jackson at New Market; a 
third that we had captured the whole Federal army near Corinth, Miss.  The last was brought by the Richmond 
RR train, which got in about 12 o'clock 
last night.  There is nothing further on the subject this evening.  The 
cars arrived sometime before dark.  Circumstances go to show that Gen. Jackson is coming back further this way.  
Whether the enemy is pressing him or not, we do not know; but there is 
a general expectation that a Yankee army will be at Staunton before 
long.  Waynesboro' is getting to be an important depot for army stores.  
Yesterday I brought Chas. Estill, of 
Lexington, from church to drive with us.  To-
night, Jim Skinner called, after 
supper.  Betty Lyle is spending the night here.  A number of children 
have died, as Lyt's little boy did, 
after a very brief illness.  Addy Stuart amuses us a good deal.  He is 
totally unlike his mother's kin in his disposition and manners.  He is 
not forward, nor pert, but perfectly self-complacent, and good-humored  
&#8212;  just the character to be <u>popular</u>.  
Soldiering is the ruling idea with him.  He really seems to be very 
anxious to join the army,  &#8212;  we hope his visits to the Hospital will 
cause him to change his mind.  &#8212;  At present, however, his imagination 
is completely fired.  A large number of soldiers on the train this

early day.  We have expected to hear of it every day for a week or 
more.  The enemy <u>are said</u> to have 100,000 
men there, and we 75,000.  Upon the result depends the fortunes of the 
State.  It is evident also that Gen. 
Jackson is about to make some important movement.  He sent up last 
night for ambulances, and the sick at Harrisonburg are to be rumored.  
The general belief is that Jackson, if worsted in another battle, or 
pressed by overwhelming numbers, will retire to Waynesborough which can be defended  &#8212;  
Staunton cannot.  Then, upon the further advance of the enemy up the 
Valley, Johnson must come back from the Shenandoah mountain, and unite 
with Jackson at Waynesboro.  These events may occur in the next week.  
I have had another talk with Va as to 
what we shall do.  She will not have her mother, but wants me to go.  I 
am at a loss, as is almost every one else  &#8212;  Only a small portion of

Agnes, it is now understood, are to come to our house.  I called to see 
them this morning on the subject.  Probably Legh's family will come in 
also.  The Richmond train arrived at half past 4 o'clock this afternoon  
&#8212;  the first time for many months that it has come so early.  The 
North claims the victory in the South West  &#8212;  they lost 20,000 men 
and we 35,000 to 40,000.  This is the statement of their papers.  No 
news in regard to the war.  Arch Alexander came in to-night, while we were at supper, and afterwards 
Jimmy and Emma Frazier  &#8212;  so we have a house full.  Arch says 
Jackson's army is quiet.  The Yankees <u>were 
said</u> to have 10 to 20,000 men facing Jackson, and 14,000 more 
coming up.  Arch informs us that forty Federal prisoners, lately 
confined in the Harrisonburg jail, have been taken down to Jackson's

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Just a year ago to-day, the two companies 
left this place for Harper's Ferry.  There the war began, so far as our 
community was concerned.  What events have taken place since then!  How 
many battles  &#8212;  in Virginia, Bethel, Hainesville, Manassas, 
Drainsville, Laurel Hill, Cheat River, Camifax Ferry, Greenbrier River, 
Alleghany Mountain, and innumerable skirmishes; out of the State, 
Springfield, Lexington, Boston Mountain, Fishing Creek, Fort Henry, 
Donnelson, Shiloh, Pittsburg, +c +c.  &#8212;  how many lives lost in battle 
and from sickness!  At this time there are nearly a million of men in 
the field, on both sides; the enemy are coming nearer and nearer to us 
at Staunton; large portions of the State are devastated.  I learn this 
morning that three wagon loads of intrenching tools were sent to Jackson last 
night  &#8212;  he probably intends to put the Harrisonburg prisoners to 
work  &#8212;  Most of them are citizens of Virginia who have been arrested 
as suspected persons.  After a protracted season of cloud and rain, we 
have a warm, clear day.</p><p class="p10"><i>[deleted: Thursday]</i> Night, <i>[deleted: Ap. 
17/62]</i></p><p class="p10">After 10 o'clock, the door bell rang, which startled us.  It was 
Alick who came up to tell that Jackson was attacked this morning by 
35,000 men with 100 cannon, and was in full retreat towards Staunton.  
We were prepared for the intelligence, as since 3 o'clock, when the 
Express rider came in, all the rumors tended to show that retreat or 
defeat for Jackson was inevitable.  Kate + Kitty start to Christianburg 
to-morrow, Addy Stuart going with them.  
Ten thousand Federalists reported at Monterey.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, April 18, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Another day of excitement and suspense.  I have not time to relate 
all the rumors.  Kate + Kitty and Addy Stuart got off this morning.  
Met D<sup>r</sup>. L. Waddell of Waynesboro at the Depot, just in from 
Camp (on Parkersburg Road) Shenandoah.  Various rumors afloat, received 
during the night.  Jackson's army stopped last night at the Big Spring, 
nine miles below Harrisonburg.  Ewell's brigade, it was said, was 
coming over from Orange to Jackson's assistance.  This report came from 
Jackson's army, and also from Gordonsville yesterday.  Several persons  
&#8212;  bearers of dispatches + others  &#8212;  arrived during the night.  
About 12 o'clock, it was said that the Federal army was going back from 
New Market, and Jackson after them!  The next report was, that Jackson 
was this side of Harrisonburg.  Then we heard that his army was 
certainly at Harrisonburg, and the enemy advancing by three parallel 
roads in three columns of 10,000 each.  In the mean time people were 
wondering why no orders had been sent for the removal of army stores at 
this place.  There is clothing for 10 or 12000 men here, ammunition, 
cannon + other arms, Commissary + Quartermasters stores.  It was 
generally supposed that Jackson would retire to Waynesboro'; and thence 
across the mountain, perhaps.  The last report, before I came home for 
the night was, that the Federal army had started to cross the Blue 
Ridge from New Market, and that Jackson had taken the same direction 
from Harrisonburg!  This afternoon wagons with sick and wounded men, 
stores +c came in.  At dark a Railroad freight car, drawn by a large 
number of horses, passed along the M<sup>c</sup>Adamized (Augusta) 
street.  A train with Commissary supplies (5 days' Rations) was sent to 
Harrisonburg this morning.  If the Federalists should arrive here as 
soon as we anticipate, Johnson's army, at Camp Shenandoah, will be left 
in the lurch.  After a good deal of hesitation, vibrating one way and 
another as different reports came in, Va. 
sent Emma Frazier home with Jinny in the freight train.  This afternoon 
Edward Waddell arrived from Jackson's army.  Having left yesterday 
evening, he brought nothy very new.  He 
came up with me to supper, and goes home, to Waynesboro, in the moring.  Fighting at York 
Town on Wednesday, vehicles still passing along the street below 
us.  I attended the funeral of D<sup>r</sup> J. M. Baldwin this 
afternoon.  The showers and warmer sunshine of the last two days cause 
the country to look beautiful  &#8212;  but how this fair earth is 
devastated by man!  Every body considering what he or she shall do in 
regard to leaving home or staying, when the Federal army approaches.  
Of course, few comparatively can leave, but many seem to be perplexed.  
Judge Thompson has decided to stay, and advises me to remain.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday, April 22, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">About 5 o'clock, on Saturday morning last, I was aroused from sleep 
by the ringing of our door bell.  Anticipating news of the advance of 
the Federal army.  Before I could get to the door, the messenger came 
through the side gate and rapped at my chamber window, telling me that 
Capt. Peyton wished me to come down 
immediately.  I asked, "What's the matter?" and the 
reply was, "A great deal is the matter."  At the Academy, I met Wm. M. Tate going to my home, who said Glendy 
had sent for him to see after their cattle business, orders having come 
during the night to remove everything from Staunton.  downstreet, I found that many persons had been up all 
night, that many of the sick at the army Hospital had been taken off by 
Railroad, and that a part of the army stores had been sent to 
Charlottesville.  There was a general bustle, but very little 
indication of alarm.  I did not enquireparticularly as to the orders received 
during the night, but it was understood that they came from Gen. Jackson, and that the enemy would be on us 
very soon.  &#8212;  Jackson, it was said, had withdrawn from the Turnpike 
at Harrisonburg, toward the Blue Ridge, and would try to detain the 
enemy so as to give time for the evacuation of Staunton.  Va urged me to go, as I might be arrested, and 
Peyton was solicitous that I should be with him; so, very reluctantly, 
I concluded to start.  In the mean time, many persons, principally 
refugees from other places, had left in stages and all sorts of 
vehicles.  Mrs. M<sup>c</sup>Clung and Miss Agnes moved up to our home.  
At 12 o'clock Peyton and I started in a buggy to Charlottesville.  The 
road was in wretched condition and full of army wagons.  The day was 
inclement  &#8212;  the county beautiful.  We reached Brooksville long 
before night, and while looking out for Tate who was coming on 
horseback, I was oppressed with sadness at the condition of affairs.  
Tate arrived and we spent the night together.  The home full  &#8212;  
soldiers, ladies +c.  The next day still raining  &#8212;  stopped at 
Timberlake's  &#8212;  found nearly a hundred horses missing  &#8212;  lost in 
the road.  &#8212;  Wondering why the Railroad trains  &#8212;  six or seven came 
up to Staunton Saturday afternoon, did not return.  Could only hear of 
one or two having gone down.  Arrived at Charlottesville about 12 
Sunday.  A dispatch there for Peyton telling him to send back wagons to 
Staunton  &#8212;  curious  &#8212;  Another dispatch to Woods to send back 
office furniture and papers.  Then, after dinner, met persons just 
arrived from Staunton, by R. R., who 
stated that things had quieted here + there was no immediate 
expectation of the enemy's approach  &#8212;  that Jackson had been 
reinforced, +c. +c.  Then I enquired of 
Peyton where the orders for removal came from, and was surprised to 
find that they did not come immediately from Gen. Jackson.  Everybody in Charlottesville was 
at a loss what to do.  P + I concluded to 
come back the next morning.  &#8212;  Rain, rain all night and all Monday 
till evening.  The road between C 
and S. was full of wagons, Quartermasters 
+c, all anxiously seeking information, instructions where to go + what 
to do  &#8212;  Some teams abandoned on the road side.  Everything and every 
body dripping wet, and the road almost impossible for loaded wagons.  
Turned in at Mountain Top to spend the night  &#8212;  could not get 
accommodation.  Came down to the little town near the river  &#8212;  full 
there.  The river full  &#8212;  afraid to ford.  P paid a negro $2.50 to drive the buggy across  -
-  I walked over on the Railroad bridge.  Bruer's 
tavern at Waynesboro' too full to receive us.  D<sup>r</sup> L. Waddell 
took us to his house.  About dark heard the RR whistle, and leaving in a hurry came home.  
Things still unsettled here.  Johnson's army left Camp Shenandoah in a 
hurry, upon information received from Staunton, in Gen. J's absence 
and came to bully Mills, destroying stores which could not be brought 
away.  Johnson was with Jackson, and, it is said, was engaged at the 
removal of his command, which cannot get back, on account of the bad 
roads.  Nothy definite as to the position 
of Jackson  &#8212;  rumored that he has been re-
inforced from East of the Blue Ridge  &#8212;  Supposed that the 
Federal army intends to go East.  Staunton not thought to be entirely 
safe yet.  Va was <u>not</u> surprised to see me last night.</p><p class="p10"><u>Later</u>  &#8212;  I learn that Johnson has no 
desire to return to the Shenandoah Mountain, and will remain for the 
present at Valley Mills.  The Federal pickets, it is reported, are this 
side of the Shenandoah Mt.</p><p class="p10">The money +c of our town Banks are in Lynchburg.  The records of all 
of our Courts were in Charlottesville on Sunday, and also the books + 
papers of the Post Office.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, April 24, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yesterday morning, upon going down street, I found another 
excitement in town.  During the night, an order had come from Gen. Johnson to remove the sick remaining in the 
Hospital, +c. +c.  Some 200 sick soldiers were accordingly sent off in 
the morning train  &#8212;  ladies who wished to go could not get aboard, or 
had to leave the car after taking their seats.  I went after Legh to 
see him about bringing his family to Alick's  &#8212;  met him coming to 
town, but he returned home and in the afternoon Bell +c +c arrived.  
Alick wrote to Gen. Johnson for 
instructions as to a few sick men who could not be moved  &#8212;  whether 
it was <u>his</u> duty to remain with them +c 
+c.  He received a verbal reply to send off no more sick till further 
orders.  A similar order was given to the Quartermasters in town.  
Blackley was at Johnson's camp, at West View, and told me when he 
returned, that upon receiving a message from Jackson, Johnson issued a 
circular to stop all preparations for departure.  What it all meant was 
a profound mystery.  The Richmond train arrived about dark, and the 
passengers reported that Ewell's division had gone from Gordonsville to 
re-inforce Jackson.  Judge Thompson first 
communicated it to me as "good news."  I doubt its truth and Mr. 
Farich, who came from Charlottesville, insisted that the greater part 
of Ewell's command had been ordered to the Junction in Hanover Co.  &#8212;  where it was thought <u>the</u> great battle would be fought.  The enemy, 
it is thought, have abandoned their intention to attack us at Yorktown, 
and are concentrating at Fredericksburg.  Other persons gave the same 
account to-day of Ewell's movement as first 
reported last night.  This morning I began to hesitate about leaving 
home, and have pretty well decided now not to go.  The day passed off 
slowly, every body feeling much solicitude and suspense.  Many rumors 
were current as to the movements of the enemy quite near town.  
Yesterday it was reported that fighting was going on at Buffalo Gap, 
firing having been heard  &#8212;  our men were merely discharging their 
guns.  The enemy, however, have come as far as the top of North 
Mountain, and captured one or two of our pickets or videtts.<a href="#n50">50</a> They have 
appeared also at Jenning's Gap, and caught two of our cavalry, one of 
whom escaped afterwards with the loss of his horse.  Rumors of their 
appearance at Mt. Crawford and Bridgewater in considerable force, are 
not credited.  The bridges across North River, at those places, have 
been burnt.  &#8212;  This evening John M<sup>c</sup>D. Alexander arrived from Jackson's camp, (at 
Swift Run Gap, Rockingham) <u>via</u> 
Gordonsville.  He confirms the report of Ewell's having gone in the 
direction of Jackson's position.  He is is staying 
with us to night.  Bell, Mrs. Hill and the 
children with us also  &#8212;  came up yesterday evening.  John Graham, of 
Lexington, was here night before last.  I received a letter from Tate 
at Richmond, this evening.  He reports that the feeling in Richmond is 
hopeful.  Things have appeared <u>blue</u> to us 
here.  Kate writes that when she arrived at Christiansburg, Sister was 
suffering great anxiety, having just heard that the enemy were nine 
miles from Staunton.  Raining + snowing nearly all day.  Raining 
still.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, April 26, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Our community has been much more depressed to-
day than on yesterday, although there was no intelligence 
specially calculated to have that effect.  Perhaps the absence of 
encouraging news was sufficient to excite apprehensions.  Since the 
apparently reliable statement of Ewell's movement to re-inforce Jackson, we have expected to hear 
that the Federal troops were retiring down the Valley; but this morning 
the first news was that a body of their cavalry was at Mt. Crawford, 
unable to cross the river, and anxiously enquiring for the whereabouts of Jackson and 
Ashby.  Josiah Roler conversed with them across the river, and they 
pronounced the people of the neighborhood particularly dull because 
they could not give them the desired information.  Next we heard that 
one or two of our cavalry had been killed near Deerfield.  There it was 
rumored that Gen. Johnson's private 
baggage had gone to Afton Depot, and army stores were going in the same 
direction.  In a word everything was in suspense.  To-night the cars bring a report that the 
Federalists have taken New Orleans.  I received a 
nother letter from Tate to-day.  He 
wished me to telegraph to him at Lynchburg, the condition of affairs 
here.  He was in Richmond, and still <u>rather</u> hopeful.  Mrs. Hill, Bell + the children 
with us still, waiting to go to Alick's where they find it necessary to 
locate permanently.  Johnson's army may move at any moment.  Oh, 
miserable times!  The country ruined in any event.  May God in mercy 
interpose for our help.  One of the Settington's reports that the 
Federalists in Highland are suffering for supplies.  Many negroes have 
joined them, and some having stolen food to relieve their hunger were 
shot recently at Monterey  &#8212;  six of them, he said</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, April 27, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A calm and beautiful Sabbath  &#8212;  almost as quiet as those we used 
to have.  I attended Sunday School in the morning, and felt remarkably 
free from the excitement which has been habitual with me since this 
miserable war began.  Quite late in the afternoon the Rev. John Miller, Capt. of Artillery in Johnson's army, came up to 
see Mrs. M<sup>c</sup>Clung.  He confirmed a report, which we had heard 
before, of the capture by our cavalry, in Bath Co., of twenty-five of the enemy's wagons + a 
hundred horses sent out on a foraging excursion and prevented by high 
waters from returning.  Six men were captured also, and six killed.  
The wagons were burnt, as they could not be brought across the swollen 
streams.  Passengers by the evening's train report that there is 
nothing further in regard to New Orleans.  A rumor that Jackson 
expected to be attacked to-day, and had called 
Ewell across the Blue Ridge to assist him.  Another report of fighting 
at Yorktown.  If it be true that New Orleans has fallen, we have 
suffered the greatest disaster of the war.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, April 28, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Another bright and beautiful spring day, but the community very much 
depressed again.  This morning we heard that New Orleans had certainly 
been taken by the enemy.  The last report, by telegraph, is, that the 
fate of the city is undecided or uncertain.  Woodson, of Harrisonburg, 
came up this evening.  He reports that 5000 or more Federal troops are 
at that place, helping themselves to whatever they want  &#8212;  horses, 
provisions +c.  Conflicting reports as to Jackson's and Ewell's 
movements.  Nothing new as to Johnson's command.  Seven prisoners taken 
near Williamsville, (as I mentioned last night) were brought in the 
evening, and put in jail.  The officer in charge of them addressed them 
with more sternness than I should have done.  I could not treat a 
fallen foe with harshness.  Two more prisoners were left at the 
Rockbridge Alum, wounded.  Those I saw looked rather sickly and 
forlorn, and excited a feeling of pity, enemies as they are.  William 
M<sup>c</sup>Clung, of Highland, was arrested to-
day, because he came through with a pass from a Federal Officer, 
which stated that he had taken the oath of allegiance.  His business 
was to take back cattle which belong to him.  He did not take the oath 
of allegiance.<a href="#n51">51</a></p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, April 29, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The feeling to-day has been more hopeful.  
New Orleans not occupied by the enemy at last dates, Gen. Lowell suspected of treachery, Johnson in 
town nearly all day.  It is said that our scouts went to  foot of Shenandoah Mt. yesterday, and found no enemy.  
Jackson has sent here for battle flags, ambulances +c.  The last 
arrival from his camp reports a reinforcement of 12000 men.  Sam 
Robinson of Richmond came up to-day  &#8212;  Says 
troops are pouring through the South towards Fredericksburg.  He + 
Mason are going to Roaring Run Iron Works to see about a lease of that 
place by the Government.  It occurred to me that I would like to be 
connected with the enterprise.  Went to see Mason  &#8212;  found him in bed  
&#8212;  Said he had been thinking about it, and wanted to propose it to me 
this evening when we were interrupted.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>May 1862 </b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, May 1, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Nothing of interest yesterday.  Legh's folks returned home.  Lucy 
and Kitty are sweet children, and both of them, especially the latter, 
"take to" me very much.  The intelligence from New Orleans was that the 
Federal fleet was at the city.  Not a word from there to-day, but it is conceded that the Federalists now 
almost have command of the Mississippi river.  The first rumor this 
morning was that Jackson's army was on the way to Winchester; the next, 
and apparently more reliable, that Jackson was marching into the Valley 
to meet the enemy at M<sup>c</sup>Gaheysville, while Ewell was moving 
to meet a Federal force in Page county; the third, that Jackson was at 
Port Republic last night, and Ewell in the camp at Swift Run Gap; and 
the last, that Jackson was at Harrisonburg.  Coming home before night, 
I met the Express boy who was said to have brought the <u>third</u> report.  He contradicted it entirely, 
said Jackson was at Swift Run, when he left this morning, and nothing 
indicated an intention to move.  We have had no tidings for several 
days of the enemy in the West.  Northern papers report that their 
troops occupying Staunton!  Another rainy, melancholy day.  A number of 
stores closed doors, because the stock of goods does not justify the 
payment of license tax.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, May 2, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Positively asserted to-day that Jackson is 
at Port Republic, or this side, and Ewell at the Swift Run Camp.  I 
have no reason to doubt the truth of the statement.  Johnson's command 
had orders to-day to be ready to march at a 
moment's notice  &#8212;  where no body knows, but it is presumed down the 
Valley.  The Cadets from Lexington will be here to-morrow morning, nearly 200,  &#8212;  where bound 
and what for, I know not.  The enemy's scouts have frequently been at 
Mt. Crawford.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, May 3, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A rumor about noon to-day that Jackson was 
crossing the Blue Ridge at Brown's Gap, going East, having Ewell at 
Swift Run Gap.  I thought the report too ridiculous to be credited; but 
passengers by the cars bring word that he was expected at Mecham's 
River  &#8212;  to which point the road from Brown's Gap leads  &#8212;  and the 
Express rider asserts that the army began to cross the mountain last 
night.  These persons are under the impression that Jackson will enter 
the Valley again by way of Rockfish Gap, and that the movement is a 
piece of stratege.  It seems to me absurd; 
but I can scarcely believe the reports. The enemy have the Federal flag 
flying at New Orleans!  A rumor that the enemy are concentrating at 
M<sup>c</sup>Dowell and Monterey.  The Cadets arrived from Lexington 
this morning, and are quartered in the large brick building, adjoining 
the Central Bank.  &#8212;  A half dozen Ambulances were sent down to 
Jackson to-day, which is strange if there is 
any authentic information that he is moving across the Blue Ridge.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, May 4, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Another bright Spring day, but full of rumors and anxiety.  This 
morning at Sunday School I was informed that Johnson was threatened 
with attack by a large force of the enemy  &#8212;  that he was spending the 
night in town, and was sent for at 12 o'clock  &#8212;  that at 2 o'clock, 
A. M., two trains of cars, empty, were sent down the road to bring up 
reinforcements.  The number of the enemy was set down at 10,000  &#8212;  
there it was said that 8000 men at Ryans, in the Pastins, that our 
pickets had been driven in, and that skirmishing was going on at North 
Mountain.  A large force was reported at Millboro', but this was soon 
contradicted.  Returning from Church I encountered Judge Thompson at 
his gate.  He had not heard the rumors, but seemed fully persuaded that 
the Valley was to be given up to the enemy.  Soon after dinner I heard 
an engine whistle, and hurried down to see if reinforcements had come  
&#8212;  Only the freight train due yesterday.  The Ambulances, started 
yesterday, had just come in, having been sent after to return.  A 
little after 3 o'clock there was another whistle, and I went to Judge 
T's gate to see the train.  It was a 
long train, drawn by two engines, and was full of soldiers!  A number 
of ladies were on the hill, to see what was to be seen.  &#8212;  After 
coming home to tell the news, I went to Alick's, and he and I went to 
the Depot.  He told me that he was informed that Jackson's movement was 
intended to deceive the enemy.  A large number of soldiers had arrived 
on the train, principally such as were more or less broken down by 
their march of yesterday.  Many of them are badly clothed and almost 
destitute of shoes.  Altogether their appearance was rather tattered.  
I met old Mr. Jimmy Lessley, of North Mountain, at the Depot.<a href="#n52">52</a>  He said everything was quiet in that region, and 
there was no expectation of an advance of the enemy.  &#8212;  that one of 
our scouts was at M<sup>c</sup>Dowell yesterday, and found some pickets 
but no enemy this side!  A few minutes afterwards the previous report 
as to an immediate attack upon Johnson was asserted again, and was 
repeated at Church to-night, with the 
additional information that cannon and ammunition were sent out to-day.  I know not what to believe, but inclined to 
the opinion that no enemy is pressing from the West.  Pickets have been 
posted on all the roads leading from town towards Rockingham, to 
prevent information getting to the enemy.  Gen. Jackson + Staff have arrived in town, on 
horseback.  One or two more trains with soldiers have also come.  The 
main body are coming afoot.  I fear that most of them will be utterly 
broken down.  They have made a marvelous march of it.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, May 5, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Train after train has arrived to-day, being 
various regiments  &#8212;  23<sup>rd</sup>, 42<sup>nd</sup>, 
48<sup>th</sup>, 21<sup>st</sup>, Irish battalion, 37<sup>th</sup>, all 
of which have been through this place once or twice before.  But how 
different their appearance since last summer?  Many of the men are 
ragged, and quite a number entirely without shoes.  They also look 
dirty, and sickly  &#8212;  I mean a large proportion.  The regiments and 
battalion I have mentioned, and perhaps others, <sup>(the 10th)</sup> 
marched out two or three miles from town, on the West View road, to 
camp.  Jackson's old brigade  &#8212;  composed of the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 
4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 27<sup>th</sup> +c regiments  &#8212;  are 
encamped two miles East of town.  The town was full of country people 
this evening, who were permitted to come in but not go out.  Pickets 
are posted on all the roads.</p><p class="p10">Reported that Yorktown has been abandoned by our troops and that 
Norfolk  &#8212;  in fact the only place approachable by water  &#8212;  will be.  
In all probability there was another great fight at Corinth 
yesterday.</p><p class="p10">The brigade (Jackson's) is composed of Valley men, and the 
5<sup>th</sup> regiment is (except one company) from this county.  It 
is said that when they found that the army was really leaving the

faces were turned towards Rockfish Gap, every face brightened.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, May 6, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">News to-day that the Federal army at 
Harrisonburg broke up yesterday in a hurry and started down the Valley.  
According to report, the people have suffered greatly in the loss of 
grain, flour, meat, horses, negroes +c taken by the enemy.  
Intelligence of Jackson's movement was no doubt communicated to 
Harrisonburg.  The 5<sup>th</sup> Regiment marched through town this 
morning, and encamped near the Cemetery.  Johnson's army moved West 
to-day  &#8212;  where to, we do not know.  
Jackson's army had marching orders to-day, and 
will start in the morning.  His destination is unknown, but presumed to 
be down the Valley.  I was kept busy to-day  -
-  the whole army seemed to require new outfits.  Got home after dark  
&#8212;  found young Lacy here.  Before we had left the table, there came a 
rap at the door  &#8212;  three soldiers were there applying for supper, 
asked them in  &#8212;  members of a cavalry company bivouacked in the lot 
beyond us, near the forks of the road.  We gave them supper, and 
invited them to come to breakfast.  They are from Rappahannock + 
Fauquier, two of them apparently gentlemen.  Norfolk said to be 
abandoned; and the Navy Yard burnt  &#8212;  cant 
resist an attack from gun boats!  We gave up the lower Valley, to draw 
the enemy into the interior  &#8212;  they came, took what supplies they 
wanted, ramassed the people, and have gone off 
safely!  A letter from Kate says that great excitement and apprehension 
prevailed in Christiansburg on Saturday and Sunday caused by a report 
that Gen. Heath, in command of a body of 
our troops in Greenbrier, had come to join Jackson, and that 
consequently 25,000 Yankees were advancing through Mercer county!</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, May 7, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Jackson's army started to-day, all of the 
1<sup>st</sup> Brigade, except the 5<sup>th</sup> Regiment, (which 
encamped near the Cemetery last night) and the artillery passing 
through town and marching towards Buffalo Gap.  I rode out to get a 
view of the army, but there was no point at which the whole column 
could be seen.  &#8212;  We are at a loss to know the destination of the 
army, but presume that it will soon turn and move down the Valley.  The 
force which has passed through since Sunday numbers at least 10,000.  -
-  exclusive of Johnson's Brigade which is from 4000 + 5000 strong.  
The next excitement, was the arrival of a Yankee officer, captured in a 
skirmish yesterday, below Harrisonburg.  While we were at dinner, Lucy 
came in and told us that a company of cavalry was coming down the 
street.  We went out  to the porch, and found that a large body of 
mounted men was passing.  They were a portion of Ashby's command, about 
800.  Twelve hundred more are still in Rockingham.  The 800 encamped on 
the Buffalo Gap road, near town, but expected to move on.  Soldiers 
engaged in actual war present a very different appearance from those on 
holiday parades.  There is no such thing as "uniform"  &#8212;  all sorts of 
coats, pants hats and caps,  &#8212;  but they are alike in dustiness, 
dirtiness and general <u>shabbiness</u>.  
Several dispatches from Richmond this evening state that a fight had 
occurred near Williamsburg, in which we captured 900 men and 12 cannon.  
Reported that Johnson was at Shaw's Fork, Highland, last night  &#8212;  
hardly probable.  The distance is 23 miles from Johnson's camp at West 
View  &#8212;  too far to march in part of a day.  And I am not satisfied 
yet that Jackson is going to cross the Shenandoah mountain.  The Judge 
thinks he is striking for the Baltimore + Ohio Railroad, at Grafton 
perhaps.  It is generally supposed that we are sending a large force 
towards Winchester from East of the Blue Ridge.  Ewell has 20,000 men 
now, it is said.  Our authorities seem at last to have commenced an 
aggressive policy.  Having withdrawn our forces from points where they 
have awaited an assault for many months, they may have concentrated and 
pushed forward into Pennsylvania, to let the Northern people feel some 
of the effects of invasion.  Report says that Jackson has in his 
command 5000 cavalry.  Young Lacy returned to-
night, bringing his friend, a Mr. Brown.  They are going to join 
Jackson's army.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The Yankee officer was sent off to Richmond this morning.  He wore a 
plate of metal over his breast, and exhibited a bullet which struck him 
and was flattened like a button.  Gen. 
Johnson did not reach Shaw's Fork Tuesday night, as was reported.  
Yesterday, he surprised the Federal scouts  &#8212;  some 200 cavalry  &#8212;  
near Ryan's, killing six to ten (so reported variously) and capturing 
two.  They left their tents behind them.  Cannonading heard to-day from early morning till 4 o'clock P.M. in the 
direction of Shenandoah mountain.  Legh first told me of it  &#8212;  then 
Frank Young, and then other persons; Finally I heard it myself while 
walking out to Marquiss's to see a bee hive 
he proposed to sell me.  Came back over Abrey's hill  
&#8212;  was transported with the lovely landscape, although it is so 
familiar to me.  Heavy fighting in the Peninsula yesterday.  Up to 12 
o'clock, M., the enemy had been repulsed three times  &#8212;  heavy loss on 
both sides.  Between 600 + 700 (instead of 900) prisoners taken at the 
fight on Monday.  The result of yesterday's affair not know.  J. D. Imboden has arrived  &#8212;  authorized to raise

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Jimmy Tate came back this morning, after starting to school to tell 
us that a fight occurred yesterday, near M<sup>c</sup>Dowell, Highland 
county.  The enemy were very strongly posted, but were driven off by 
Gen. Johnson, the fight commenced at 5 PM 
and terminated at 9  &#8212;  the firing during the day, which was heard 
here, was the enemy's throwing shells +c through the woods.  The number 
of the enemy is reported as 8000; <sup>(reinforcements having been sent 
from Romney)</sup> ours, in the fight, much smaller.  Our loss 40 
killed and 200 wounded, among the latter Gen. Johnson, who has arrived in town.  At last 
accounts the enemy were retreating precipitously, + Jackson was in hot 
pursuit.  A train of cars has gone up to Buffalo Gap for the wounded.  
The Richmond train, due at 4 o'clock, or thereabouts, not come yet  &#8212;  
past 10.  Peyton and other Quartermaster's go out of office, "by order 
of the Secretary of War."  I amused myself to-
day in converting my dog kennel into a bee house.  Ladies busy

<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, May 10, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A number of the wounded in the late battle near M<sup>c</sup>Dowell, 
arrived this morning.  Also the corpses of eight of the slain, which 
lay at the Depot, boxed up, scarcely more noticed than bales of goods, 
so accustomed to such scenes have people become.  It was reported this 
morning that the Federalists, in their hasty retreat from 
M<sup>c</sup>Dowell, left a part of their artillery and every thing 
else they had.  To-night I heard that they 
had taken the road to Franklin, Pendleton Co., had burnt their wagons, and, retaining <u>their artillery</u> only, were flying before 
Jackson as fast as they could go.  A Federal Colonel (named Constable) 
was brought in to-day, a prisoner  &#8212;  taken 
in Highland.  The report of a fight in the Peninsula on Wednesday is 
contradicted  &#8212;  no such battle took place.  The papers of to-day state that Gen. 
Beauregard assailed the enemy, near Corinth, yesterday.  &#8212;  result not 
known.  The "Richmond Dispatch," of yesterday, which we got this 
morning, was in a flurry about Yankee gun boats coming up James River  
&#8212;  cooled down to-day.  I went out to Marquiss's after supper, with Jimmy Tate + 
Wright, and brought the bee hive in on a wheel barrow.  Had a hard time  
&#8212;  bees very much stirred up  &#8212;  many of them out side  &#8212;  stinging 
Jimmy +c.  Delightful spring day.  Roads quite dusty.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, May 11, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">More of the wounded at M<sup>c</sup>Dowell were brought in to-day  &#8212;  morning and evening.  Many were lying in 
a field at Wilson's, Highland co.  The last report of our loss is 75 
killed and 250 wounded.  It is said that 82 of the enemy have been 
found dead  &#8212;  30 of them covered in a heap.  The enemy in their 
flight <u>proceeded</u> beyond Monterey, towards 
Cheat Mountain, but learning that our guerilla's from the other side (called "Dixie 
Boys") had occupied the mountain and obstructed the road, they retraced 
their steps to Monterey and went down the Franklin road  &#8212;  throwing 
out 16 dead bodies they were carrying off and burning wagons + caisons.<a href="#n53">53</a>  Afterwards 
they threw their ammunition into a stream.  Thirty (30) wagon loads of 
their plunder, picked up at various places, arrived to-day.  The number of the enemy is reported as 
9000, and if they were so strong, their flight was caused by a panic, 
as we could not bring a much larger force to bear upon them.  It is 
said they had stopped at Franklin, whether to make a stand [which they 
could not do unless reinforcements were coming to them from some 
quarter] or from exhaustion, we do not know.  They must have suffered 
severely for want of food.  Jackson was to move upon them this morning.  
&#8212;  Jackson's recent movements, which seemed so incomprehensible to us, 
are now all explained.  Last Sunday we heard that 8000 or 10 000 of the 
enemy were threatening Johnson at West View.  It was true that the 
enemy, largely reinforced from Romney, were preparing to advance this 
way; but they were still in Highland co, or beyond.  Jackson was 
advised of their movements, and therefore took the route he did to meet 
them.  It was, of course, arranged that the guerillas should obstruct the road.  Yankee 
"shinplasters"  &#8212;  or Sutter's tickets  &#8212;  are very abundant in 
Staunton.  A bright and delightful day.  Bees doing well apparently, 
notwithstanding the jolting they got.  A young Nelson, of Ohio, cousin 
of our Nelsons, is among the Federal wounded, and at Monterey.  A young 
man from Wheeling, on our side, is guarding his cousin, from Clarkesburg, a prisoner taken from the 
enemy.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">No news of special interest to-day, except 
that Norfolk has been evacuated by our troops and occupied by the 
enemy.  This event, however, has been anticipated for a week or two 
days.  Various rumors from Jackson's army, but not traceable to any 
reliable source.  A letter from Kate this evening  &#8212;  great panic in 
Christiansburg, caused by an expected inroad of the enemy, by way of 
Giles county.  Later intelligence in the Richmond papers of to-day, stated that the enemy had been dispersed at 
Giles C.H. by our General Heth.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A report from Jackson's army states that the enemy had met 
reinforcements at Franklin and were making a stand  &#8212;  that they had 
set the woods on fire all around, which caused the smoky atmosphere 
observed here.  The smoke, however, (if it be smoke) prevailed several 
days before the enemy raised their conflagration.  Some body started a 
report to-day that Jackson's army had been 
captured.  From Richmond we hear of the destruction of the famous 
steamer "Virginia," by our authorities, and the complete evacuation of 
Norfolk + Portsmouth.  &#8212;  Va has been at 
the Hospital again to-day.  Yesterday she and 
all hands were busy making pillow cases to be filled with straw.  Nanny 
+ Matty have been scraping.  Phil Trout, who went out to Wilson's after 
the battle, relates an incident of striking interest.  He found a 
wounded man from this county, and told him he would bring him to 
Staunton in an ambulance, if he desired to come.  The man replied that 
he wished very much to come, but he could sit up, and that some one who 
would have to lie down had better be brought.  This had never heard of 
the saying and act of Sir Philip Sidney, when mortally wounded on the 
field of Zutphen, which have immortalized his name.  It was the same 
spirit  &#8212;  "Thy necessity is yet greater than mine."<a href="#n54">54</a>  Finding two boxes of proper size at Evans' for 
bee hives, I bought them this evening.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, May 14, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The first intelligence of to-day was that 
Gen. Jackson was marching back from 
Franklin, by order of Gen. Lee.  The enemy 
was strongly re-inforced at that point.  
This evening we heard that the Federal gun-boats were only twelve miles 
from Richmond, at the obstructions placed in the river, and assailing 
our batteries on the banks.  Much murmuring on account of the 
inefficient means of defence provided by the 
government.  For months the Richmond papers have been calling attention 
to the defencelessness of Richmond, 
and yet it is even now believed that there is nothing to prevent gun 
boats coming up to the city.  Richmond, with all its stores, foundries, 
work shops +c will probably fall into the enemy's hands in a few days.  
Indignation mingles with the despondency which prevails in anticipation 
of such a catastrophe.  Kate writes that Addy Stuart has returned from 
the expedition, with a company from Montgomery Co, to Giles C. H.   They did not arrive in time for the 
affair Gen. Heth had with the enemy.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A report from Richmond this evening, by telegraph, that two of the 
Federal gunboats had been sunk in James River, and the rest driven off.  
The enemy are said to be at Lewisburg, and the people in the 
surrounding country are gathering to repel them from the terminus of 
the Central Railroad, supposing that to be their destination.  Gen. Jackson at M<sup>c</sup>Dowell last night,

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Day of Prayer appointed by President Davis, before going down street 
this morning, I was disappointed at finding no confirmation of the news 
said to have been telegraphed from Richmond last evening, and brought 
up to us by Jimmy Tate.  During the day, however, I learned that one or 
more dispatches had come, stating that, after several hours' firing the 
gunboats and withdrawn down the river, one or 
two of them being disabled.  The Richmond papers <sup>of to-day</sup> confirm this intelligence in the main.  
The Legislature had taken upon itself the responsibility of defending 
the city to the last, till it destroyed.  The President responded to a 
committee of the two houses that the State would in no event be 
abandoned.  The Governor of the State and Mayor or Richmond declare they will not surrender the place.  
At a public meeting last night Gov. 
Letcher was guilty of the indecency of uttering some profanity  &#8212;  he 
would tell the enemy "to shell and be &#8212;&#8212;."  The crowd applauded  &#8212;  
Can they expect the blessing of the Almighty?  And this occurred on the 
eve of a day set apart for special prayer to God for his assistance.  
Mr. Baker and Mr. Campbell conducted the services at Church this

Last night Col. Reid of Lexington was here 
at supper, and this afternoon Frazier came up and is spending the 
night.  Both are returning from the Legislature.  &#8212;  Col. R. brought up a 
report (having come up street after I left) that the "Yankees" were at 
Jackson's River, the Western terminus of the Central Railroad.  Mr. 
Wayt told me at Sunday School, this morning, that their force amounted 
to <u>four</u> hundred cavalry.  Next I heard 
that it was <u>five</u> hundred.  Then Frazier 
brought a report that was <u>eight</u> hundred 
cavalry and a <u>thousand</u> infantry.  H. J. 
Crawford told me at church that it was <u>two 
thousand</u>.  And, finally, Wm. Kayser 
asserted positively that it was <u>three</u> 
hundred.  A portion of our cavalry was ordered to Jackson's River, but 
mistook the order and went to Lexington!  It is rumored that Gen. Winder, one of Jackson's Brigadiers, 
mistook directions given to him at M<sup>c</sup>Dowell, and thus the 
enemy escaped capture in the recent affair.  A series of mistakes.  
Mrs. Sowers died this afternoon.  Reported that Mr. John

the enemy at Narrow Pass on the Valley turnpike, where they are 
fortifying.  He has been reinforced by a Louisiana Brigade  &#8212;  Ewell's 
division (or a part of it) moving back towards Richmond.  These are the 
reports  &#8212;  dont know how much is true.  The 
enemy have appeared at or very near Hanover C.H.  They are evidently trying to surround 
Richmond and cut off supplies, avoiding a battle whenever possible.  A 
letter from Frazier, written this morning, says he hurried home 
(Rockbridge Alum Springs) on Monday to get his family off to Lexington 
as a place of safety  &#8212;  but he heard the enemy were in Buchanan and 
threatening Lexington.  Consequently he was looking to Staunton as a 
place of refuge.  The rumor of a small body of the enemy being at 
Buchanan, had reached here by other channels  &#8212;  not fully credited.  
Reports of further operations in Giles co. highly advantageous to us.

Intelligence this morning that Jackson had turned off the Valley 
Turnpike, at New Market, as some supposed to abandon the Valley; but 
the more probable supposition is that he has gone down the road to 
Front Royal, where, it is reported, a portion of the Federal army under 
Gen. Shields is.  Their main force is at 
Strasburg.  Gen. Heth's dispatch to 
Richmond claims a signal success in Giles Co. at the recent fight there.  Tremendous 
battles near Richmond and Corinth (Miss) are pending.  A man from Highland was 
in town a few days ago offering for sale a very elegant pistol.  In 
answer to a question, he said he had taken it from a Yankee.  "Did you 
secure the Yankee?"  "Yes," said the man.  &#8212;  "Where is he now?"  "I 
dont know."  He proceeded then to relate that he had often seen the 
Yankee passing through the country as a bearer of dispatches, but was 
afraid to interfere with him while the Federal army had control of the 
country.  As soon, however, as he heard of their reverse near 
M<sup>c</sup>Dowell, he and another man went to look out for the 
expressman or any other game that might come along.  When he came 
along, they shot him and secured his horse, equipments and dispatches.  
The latter were from Gen. Milroy to a 
Federal officer commanding cavalry in the West, giving instructions as 
to his proceedings, that he might escape capture or give assistance to 
his routed friends.</p></p>

there would be a train up this evening.  The train that went down this 
morning returned late in the evening from Gordonsville  &#8212;  I have no 
information as to the state of affairs.  Several Federal soldiers, 
captured down the Valley this morning, arrived this evening by stage

All quiet at Richmond.  Our leaders seem determined that the enemy 
shall fight, if at all, on this side of the Chickahominy, Each appears 
to be endeavoring to draw the other into a battle with the river and 
swamp at his back.  From the lower Valley we hear nothing new.  Large 
amount of stores captured at Martinsburg.  The enemy succeeded in 
destroying supplies at Winchester and Charlestown.  Some 4000 prisoners 
taken  &#8212;  carried to Charlottesville without coming through Staunton.  
Jackson had possession of Harper's Ferry.  Soon 35 or 40 wagons started 
to Winchester to-day    Reported that the 
Federalists had gone back from Franklin.  Alick has resigned his post 
as Surgeon of the Hospital here.  Great mortality among the sick and 
wounded soldiers  &#8212;  as many as 15 a day have died.  Tents in the 
grove above the R.R. Depot are used for 
the accommodation of a part of the wounded.  About 1300 in the 
Hospital.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, June 1, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This morning, at Sunday School, Legh told of a reported that Jackson had been routed by a large 
force of the enemy  &#8212;  no one, he said, believed it.  He also stated 
that there was a considerable battle near Richmond, yesterday, in which 
the enemy were repulsed.  Just before preaching, he told me there was 
further intelligence from the lower Valley, brought by Sherrer, the 
German baker.  The substance of it was, that the enemy had re-taken 
Front Royal, a number of our wagons with stores +c, and had probably 
captured the 12<sup>th</sup> Georgia Regiment.  As I was going to Mrs. 
Gilkeson's funeral, at 5 o'clock, I overtook Sherrer  &#8212;  He was not at 
Front Royal, but on the Valley Turnpike, perhaps at Strasburg.  His 
story was that we had one Regiment (12<sup>th</sup> Ga) and a company of Cavalry at Front Royal  &#8212;  
that on the approach of the enemy the Georgians started towards 
Winchester and the cavalry to Strasburg, and that our teamsters brought 
off their horses, leaving 12 or more loaded wagons.  W. B. Kayser 
afterwards gave me another version of the story  &#8212;  A party of our 
cavalry came dashing into Front Royal, stating that the enemy were 
approaching, whereupon our troops + teamsters left, but that the wagon 
master (Joe Whitmer) had gone back for his wagons.  At church to-night I encountered Ryron 
Hoge, who left here for Winchester on Friday last.  He went as far as 
New Market, where he heard that Shields, with a large Federal force, 
occupied Front Royal (our men, before they left, having destroyed 
coffee +c captured by them from the enemy), and that Millroy was 
entering the Valley from the West <sup> that Johnson was calling in his 
troops at Winchester</sup>.  While we were talking Lyt. came up and said that stage passengers 
who arrived late in the afternoon [Hoge came this morning] contradicted 
the reports almost entirely  &#8212;  that a small body of Federal cavalry 
came to or near Front Royal, and were driven back.</p><p class="p10">The news by the cars this evening confirms the reports we heard from 
Richmond this morning.  Some 25,000 were engaged on each side.  The 
battle not decisive, but the result in our favor.  Mrs. Gilkeson, 
mother-in-law of J. K. Woods, was buried this evening.  Returning from 
the cemetery, I came over the hill, to enjoy again, on a peaceful 
Sunday evening, the grand prospect from the summit.  But a gathering 
storm caused me to hurry home.  Ground north of the cemetery, just 
outside of the enclosure, is now used for burying soldiers in.  At 
first they were interred in the Cemetery, but more space became 
necessary.  &#8212;  I counted 89 graves outside, and there are many others 
dug + ready to receive the remains of the poor fellows who are dying in 
our hospitals.  Communion in our church to-day  
&#8212;  three new members  &#8212;  A young man named Vass, of Fredericksburg, 
originally, preaching</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, June 2, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Intelligence of the renewal of the battle at Richmond on yesterday.  
Seventy-five thousand men on each side engaged.  Our army led by 
President Davis and Generals Lee and Jos. 
E. Johnston.  The last named slightly wounded in the face.  The whole 
Federal army on the Richmond side of the Chickahominy.  Five hundred of 
our army drowned  &#8212;  some persons say or suppose they were Federal 
soldiers that were drowned.  The loss very heavy on both sides.  The 
result of the fighting favorable to us  &#8212;  the enemy driven back five 
miles  &#8212;  18 cannon captured yesterday + 23 on Saturday.  Such are the 
reports brought from Lynchburg, where they were received by telegraph 
from Richmond.  Many persons have returned from Winchester.  No doubt 
that the enemy are crowding in upon Jackson  &#8212;  Shields through Front 
Royal, and Rosencrantz through Hardy Co.  -
-  the latter with 15,000 men, and the former with 20,000, according to 
report.  Geary at Berry's Ferry with 4000 more, + Dix across the 
Potomac with the remains of Banks' army.  It was thought that Jackson 
would make a dash at one or the other before they could unite.  Two 
hundred + seventy-five wagons expected to-
morrow with the store captured at Martinsburg.  Immense amount 
of medical stores taken there  &#8212;  500 pounds of opium, several 
thousand dollars worth of quinine +c +c.  Some of the stores have 
already arrived.  Kate writes that she will return with Mr. Tate who 
went up to the Salt Works last week, and will get back to-morrow or next day.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, June 3, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The Richmond Dispatch of yesterday, received this evening <u>via</u> Lynchburg, gives some account of the 
fighting on Saturday and Sunday.  On Sunday the affair was not so 
protracted and important as on Saturday; it would seem, however, that 
the reports received here yesterday were exaggerated.  Jackson has 
fallen back this side of Winchester    No definite intelligence from 
his army.  Great preparations at the North in consequence of the 
disaster to Banks' army.  A beautiful white mule belonging to Banks, 
captured at Winchester, has been brought to town.  It is really a 
beautiful animal.  There is a match to it, somewhere on the road.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, June 4, 1862.  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We can get no definite intelligence of movements down the Valley.  
It seems to be true that Jackson has retired pretty far up towards 
Harrisonburg, before a large force of the enemy.  There has been 
skirmishing at several points, and quite a heavy affair at Strasburg, 
where the Federalists were reported as we heard on yesterday.  Many 
stragglers from our army, who were worn out with marching, have fallen 
into the hands of the enemy.  It turns out also that our company of the 
12<sup>th</sup> Georgia Regiment was captured at Front Royal.  A 
Lieutenant of this company, who was not there, however, informed me 
to-day that a large number of the Federal 
cavalry were killed at Front Royal, in a fight which occurred there, in 
spite of the wishes and orders of the Col. 
+ Lt. Col. of the 
12<sup>th</sup> Ga. who finally went off 
leaving the Regiment behind them.  Both were arrested by order of Gen. Jackson.  A large number of wagons, which 
went down to bring up the captured stores, returned to-day, many of them empty.  The enemy pressed too 
closely for us to bring off all the stores.  It is said that upwards of 
3000 Federal prisoners were at Mt. Crawford to-
day, waiting till a bridge could be constructed, to cross the 
river.  Very heavy rain last night and to-day, 
causing a great rise in all the water courses.  Not a word of news from 
Richmond, except a report that Gen. 
Johnston (Jos. E.) was severely wounded.  A 
slide on the CentralR.R., at or near the 
Blue Ridge, has prevented trains going down or coming up.  Kate and 
Kitty are probably on the road somewhere.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, June 5, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A day of rumors.  We heard that the Federal prisoners at North River 
(Mt. Crawford) had refused to come across.  Then it was said they were 
not at the river, but at Harrisonburg.  The first report was next 
repeated.  Imboden started down about 2 o'clock, with men, his three 
small cannon, and two larger pieces.  Many hands, white and black, went 
also in wagons to aid in building the bridge.  Late in the afternoon we 
heard that Shields (Federal) was at or near Port Republic, that our men 
had burnt the bridge there, across the Shenandoah, + that Shields would 
probably come by Mt. Meridian, in this county.  Next it was circulated 
that Jackson had come through Harrisonburg and gone towards Port 
Republic, to attack Shields, and that large reinforcements had come 
over for Jackson from Gordonsville.  Returning home in the evening, I 
met Col. J. T. L. 
Preston, of Lexington, entering the town.  He came up to supper and sat 
till 10 o'clock.  He left Harrisonburg this morning + crossed the river 
at Mt. Crawford in a boat.  Jackson had turned off towards Port 
Republic, and the Federal prisoners had been taken in the same 
direction; from Harrisonburg, without coming to Mt. Crawford.  There 
was a report at Harrisonburg that "Gen Smith" was coming to reinforce 
Jackson  &#8212;  what Smith and what troops he had no body could tell and 
therefore the report was discredited.  Just before dark a Capt. Rippetoe arrived from Port Republic and 
reported that we heard the noise of a battle in the direction of Swift 
Run Gap, and that afterwards couriers passed him, who stated that "Gen 
Smith" had suddenly met and defeated Shields.  Rippetoe is a truthful 
man, but nevertheless the report is not believed.  Other persons who 
came from Port Republic have no such news.  Refugees from the lower 
Valley, who returned home last week, are back again.  To-morrow we shall probably have <u>news</u>.  From Richmond the report is "all quiet."  
I fear that things are not specially favorable to us in that quarter.  
The delay is, I fear, advantageous to the enemy.  Beauregard is said to 
have fallen back from Corinth.  &#8212;  The enemy have left Lewisburg and 
gone West, somewhere.  The war is fierce enough now, and the prospect 
for a protracted struggle is good.  The Southern people will never 
submit to Northern domination.  Some Federal officers, prisoners, came 
this evening in the Harrisonburg stage  &#8212;  crossed the river in the 
boat.  The cars came this evening.  A letter from Kate, saying that 
Tate was detained at Christiansburg by sickness.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, June 6, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Jackson's army at Port Republic.  The enemy (Fremont) said to be 
near Harrisonburg, with a force variously estimated from 17,000 to 
40,000.  Shields on the East side of the Shenandoah with from 10,000 to 
18,000 men.  The probability of Jackson's having to leave the Valley is 
talked about.  Staunton will be occupied by the enemy, of course, in 
that event.  The Federal prisoners arrived at Waynesboro this morning.  
The officers captured are here on parol, 
walking about the streets and looking very much at their ease.  It 
seems impudent for captured <u>invaders</u> to 
appear so much at home.  A number of our own sick, wounded and broken 
down men have also arrived  &#8212;  a miserable, wobegone dirty-looking set.  I met 
D<sup>r</sup>. Smith, a Winchester Physician, now connected with the 
army, down street, and as the Hotels are crowded to overflowing I 
brought him home with me  &#8212;  He is a very pleasant gentleman.  Have 
been thinking of telegraphing to Kate not to come home, as the enemy 
may be here soon.  Could not get a dispatch off to-
night.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday evening, June 8, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Exciting reports this afternoon, causing the most serious fears for 
the safety of Jackson's army.  A number of cavalrymen have come in, 
stating that Shields' (Fed) army came down 
on the East side of the Shenandoah river this morning.  Jackson's army 
being at <u>c</u> and his headquarters at <u>b</u>.  That a Regiment of the enemy's cavalry 
forded South River at Port Republic (a) and captured our ordnance train 
at <u>b</u>  &#8212;  that Jackson crossed North 
River and got to his army, and, according to our report, shelled the 
enemy out of Port Republic.  It would appear, however, that Jackson is 
now <u>between</u> Shields and Fremont, who is 
doubtless pressing from Harrisonburg.  His escape seems almost 
impossible, especially as his ordnance stores are lost.  The Federal 
prisoners, at Waynesboro' still this morning, may be recaptured.  Some 
persons (Alick + Legh included) went down to North River, on the 
M<sup>c</sup>Adamized road, this morning, to reinforce Imboden, who is 
guarding the ford there with several pieces of cannon.  Yesterday we 
heard the sad news that Ashby had been killed near Harrisonburg.  I was 
very sick all day yesterday, and not well yet.  Rumors that large 
reinforcements are coming to Jackson  &#8212;  too late :  Cannonading heard 
all morning, up to 2 o'clock P.M.  The cavalry men were arrested upon 
their arrival here, and put in the guard house, for running off from 
the battle.</p><p class="p10"><a href="images/waddell18620608.jpg"><br><br><center><img src="images/waddell18620608.gif"></center></a><br><p class="p11"><b></b></p></p><p class="p10"><u>Later</u>.  &#8212;  Several persons have come 
up from the army.  They say there was a brilliant skirmish, that our 
cavalry pickets ran off, that a portion of the enemy made a bold 
attempt to flank Jackson, but were easily repulsed, and that we lost 
nothing whatever.  Passengers by the cars, from Waynesboro', report 
that the portion of the enemy who made the attempt were captured with 
their cannon.  This is doubted.  It is stated that Jackson and his 
staff crossed the bridge, to get to the army, under fire of the enemy.  
In the skirmish near Harrisonburg, day before yesterday, it is said we 
lost 40 in killed and wounded, but did great ex<i>[illeg.]</i> tion upon 
the enemy and captured from 20 to 75, according to the various rumors.  
As I was going down street to hear the news, after I had heard the 
first reports, I stopped Dr. Hamilton and Sam Baskin near Judge 
Thompson's gate, to inquire what the former had learned  &#8212;  he was 
just coming up.  He had heard only what I had.  While we were taking Miss Nancy Clark came up the ally by the Catholic Church, and called to them that 
John was not going, that Jackson had whipped them and taken cannon and 
ever so many prisoners.  Mr. Craig and others had told her so, as they 
passed her house.  It seemed that John Baskin, who is a soldier in the 
5<sup>th</sup> Regiment, and at home on the sick list, was about hung 
with other sick soldiers, to escape from the enemy, and his friends 
were in the act of assisting him off.</p><p class="p10"><u>Sunday night</u>  &#8212;  Going to church this 
evening Va + I went to see Aunt Sally, 
who is not well.  As the street near the Railroad, was full of wagons I 
went down to get the news.  &#8212;  The wagons were bringing the sick and 
wounded from the Hospital to the Depot  &#8212;  a train was filling up for 
Greenwood and Charlottesville.  A courier had arrived from Jackson's 
army, having left at 4 o'clock, P.M.  Ewell's division had been 
fighting with Fremont, at Cross Keys, all day.  So far the enemy had 
been repulsed.  A prisoner was brought in this evening by a negro man.  
The negro delivered the man, a little German unable to speak English, 
to one of our officers here, saying, "Miss Mason told me to bring him 
here dead or alive, and here he is."  Mason caught the fellow near Mt. 
Crawford.  After church Kate + I walked up to Mrs. Skinner's with Betty 
Lyle.  Thought we heard cannonading, and saw several persons going out 
to listen  &#8212;  they said they had heard it.  Jimmy Tate is down street 
to get the last news (past 10 o'clock)  &#8212;  he has just come in.  Says 
another cousin has arrived  &#8212;  Jackson whipped the Yankees under 
Fremont and is pursuing them!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, June 9, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The first news had this morning was by Mr. Tate, who had arrived 
from the North River ford opposite Mt. Crawford, at 3 o'clock A.M., and 
came up to our house before I had left home.  He repeated the report 
Jimmy brought up last night, and seemed to think matters were going on 
finely for us  &#8212;  that Fremont was routed yesterday, and Jackson was 
this morning assailing Shields, the cannonading being distinctly heard 
from town.  Upon going down street, I was disappointed to find that 
there was little or no feeling of elation, but on the contrary some 
apprehension that Jackson might be overwhelmed by superior numbers, 
there being rumors that Fremont was receiving large reinforcements.  
Tate brought word that Imboden's party had been ordered to Port 
Republic during the night, and Alick + Legh had gone along.  The 
cannonading was heard till half past 9 o'clock, when it ceased.  About 
10 a courier arrived with the report that Fremont was hastily 
retreating towards Harrisonburg, blockading the road behind him, + that 
Shields was in a fair way to be caught.  Of course there was universal 
rejoicing.  In the afternoon, however, it was ascertained that Fremont 
had not retreated, but was on the field again with (according to one 
report) 60,000 men.  It was stated at the same time that Jackson had 
defeated Shields this morning quite severly.  &#8212;  Late in the evening different 
persons (citizens) and one or two wounded soldiers arrived from the 
army, and after dark Alick + Legh came.  They had witnessed the battle 
this morning, and were all aglow with excitement.  Shields was driven 
back with the reported loss of 500 of his men + 5 cannon captured, 
while Fremont's army was drawn up on the West Side of the Shenandoah, 
unable to give any assistance.  Jackson's army crossed the river this 
morning to assail Shields, destroying the bridge behind them.  It is 
impossible for me to mention the incidents A 
+ L related, or to describe the scenes in 
town.  Alick was employed in attending to the wounded.  Both the 
Regiments from this county suffered severely, in the number wounded  &#8212;  
not a single acquaintance is mentioned as among the killed.  I infer 
that comparatively few were killed on either day.  Capt. Robt. Lilly is 
reported mortally wounded.  We hear that two Regiments are coming to 
reinforce Jackson.  Kate + Kitty, with Mary Stuart, arrived Saturday 
afternoon.  They left Christiansburg, in ignorance of the state of 
affairs in this region.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The town very quiet to-day  &#8212;  very few 
rumors + nothing of importance.  Nothing doing, apparently, by the 
armies near Port Republic.  Jackson pursued Shields for 10 or 12 miles 
down the river, yesterday evening  &#8212;  It is now said that only 300 or 
400 prisoners were taken.  Our loss in killed seems to have been small.  
Two regiments had arrived at Charlottesville, coming to reinforce 
Jackson.</p></p>

wounded.  A rumor this afternoon that the Yankees were coming this way, 
crossing North River at Mt. Crawford; and another that Fremont was 
retreating.  From 9000 to 11000 reinforcements are on the way to 
Jackson.  Two Federal soldiers caught near Dayton, were brought in this

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, June 12, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A report this morning that Fremont was marching up North River, with 
a view towards this region.  &#8212;  At the same time a statement that he 
had 40,000 men, while Jackson's effective force amounted to only 
15,000.  All through the day there were vague rumors that the whole 
Federal army had passed through Harrisonburg, down the Valley.  Late in 
the afternoon these rumors were confirmed by persons from Harrisonburg.  
The Yankees went off last night, in haste, burning their baggage, and 
committing many depredations.  They even destroyed the gardens, as far 
as possible.  It is reported that their whole number was 15,000  &#8212;  
that is Fremont's column.  It is stated that Jackson received 
reinforcements this evening to the amount of 13,000.  &#8212;  We have 
nothing as to his movements, if he has made any, except a report that 
Ewell's division was coming up North River.  A Federal soldier came in 
to-day, accompanied by two of our citizens 
from Hardy or Pendleton.  The man said he was a Texan, but had been 
living in Ohio for two years, and was drawn into the Federal army 
without his consent; + that he deserted when the army was passing 
through Hardy.  The two men testified that the deserter had come 
voluntarily, even paying his way to get on part of the journey.  As he 
may be a spy, he was put in the guard house, and has been, or will be, 
sent to Gen. Jackson.  Some 25 or 30 
prisoners captured in Hardy arrived to day  &#8212;  
also a number of our soldiers, who fell out of the ranks, from 
exhaustion, on the retreat from Winchester, and were supposed to have 
fallen into the hands of the enemy.  They came through Hardy + 
Pendleton.  I procured a pack of envelopes, captured at Winchester on 
the <u>recent</u> occasion, amongst other 
things, and file one of them in this book, as a specimen of the <u>sort of things</u> the war has brought out.  x<a href="#n57">57</a>  It is quite evident that dissatisfaction exists 
in the Federal ranks, + that falsehood has been resorted to in order to 
pacify the men.  A prisoner taken in the battle of Monday last stated 
that it had been read out to them that Richmond had fallen, and if they 
only whipped out Jackson they would be discharged to go home.  A 
similar report comes from Norfolk  &#8212;  the soldiers had been informed 
so often of the capture of Norfolk that they began to inquire how many 
Richmonds there were.  It is alleged that 2000 men deserted from 
Fremont's army while it was at Franklin, Pendleton, and that five of 
the soldiers died of <u>starvation</u>.  The 
enemy have abandoned Norfolk and Portsmouth, taking the troops to the 
vicinity of Richmond.  A few evenings ago, I brought up five or six 
letters picked up down the Valley    They were written to Yankee 
soldiers by friends at home.  &#8212;  They are all decent  &#8212;  Some of the 
letters captured are filthy to the last degree.</p></p>

that a large number of our troops left the Railroad at Waynesboro', on

heard from the enemy since they left Harrisonburg.  There is a report 
that Federal troops are being withdrawn from Richmond.  For several

Governor of Tennessee, was assassinated at Nashville.  Also that 
Butler, the Federal General at New Orleans, was killed.  Mrs.

battle of Seven Pines near Richmond:  on the 31st ult.,  &#8212;  the 11<sup>th</sup> Mississippi lost 134 men.  
The 4<sup>th</sup> Alabama suffered severely at Manassas.  They all 
seemed glad to get up to this country.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, June 17, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Many troops arrived yesterday, and others to-
day.  I have no idea how many are now in this vicinity.  
Whiting's Brigade and others are encamped at Poage's, on the 
Harrisonburg road, there are large encampments on the hills to the left 
of the Middlebrook road, near the Railroad, and a small one on the hill 
in front of Frazier's house (Oakenwold)  There is a Texas Brigade here 
to which the Staunton Artillery is now attached.  This company is 
located in the flat near the site of the old Freight Depot.  Soldiers 
are constantly going from house to house, applying for something to eat  
&#8212;  they threaten us with famine, and to-
night I was obliged to refuse a request for supper, lodging and 
breakfast for five!  The commissary is well enough supplied, but the 
men like something better than camp fare, when they can get it.  The 
more respectable soldiers, being less forward than others, fare worse, 
I presume.  Arthur Spitzer, who is in the Staunton Artillery, has been 
up to see us several times.  He applied to me to lend him $18, and I 
gave him an order to Blackley for the amount.  The enemy are said to be 
about Mt. Jackson, Shenandoah Co.  It was 
reported to-day that they had driven our 
pickets back to Harrisonburg.  For two days past I have been quite 
unwell  &#8212;  was too sick last night to write a line  &#8212;  this morning 
we received a Richmond mail  &#8212;  the first since Wednesday or Thursday.  
The enemy have Memphis.  Stuart performed a daring exploit near 
Richmond last week.  The whole country is ringing with the name of 
Jackson, or "Stonewall," as he is called.  I cannot tell how our cause 
comes on.  No indications of a close of the war.  Our people, however, 
seem determined to hold on.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, June 18, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">To the surprise of every body, the troops near town began to move 
off in the direction of Waynesboro'; this morning.  The Texas Brigade 
(Gen. Hood's) started at 5 o'clock.  
Whiting's Brigade retraced their steps through town, and marched down 
the Waynesboro' road, between 8 and 9 o'clock.  Several Artillery 
companies went in the same direction.  A Georgia Brigade (Lanton's), 
several other Regiments and two or three Artillery and two or three 
cavalry companies remained late in the afternoon, but as I came home 
after 6 o'clock, two trains full of soldiers, were getting ready to 
start.  All will no doubt go to-morrow,  We 
learn that Jackson's whole command was to-day 
moving to Waynesboro', with a view of crossing the Blue Ridge.  Gen. Jackson was in town nearly all day; but no 
one found out the purpose or cause of these movements.  There was, of 
course, a large number of wagons in connection with the various 
Brigades.  &#8212;  Many of our Regiments are very much reduced in numbers  
&#8212;  the 31<sup>st</sup> and 44<sup>th</sup> Va, have not much over 100 men each.  Our 
company of the 44<sup>th</sup> has, or had a few days ago, five 
officers and six men  &#8212;  the "Richmond Zouaves," never a very 
respectable company; a large number of desertions from it; as from some 
other companies, belonging to different Regiments.  Two men from each 
company in the 5<sup>th</sup> Va. have 
been detailed to collect and take to camp the stragglers from that 
Regiment.  A member of the 31<sup>st</sup> Va, from Wellsburg, Brooks Co, came into our 
office this evening, and meeting an acquaintance from the same place  -
-  D<sup>r</sup>. White, surgeon of the 27<sup>th</sup> Reg.  &#8212;  told with great glee that, in the 
Monday's fight near Port Republic, he had shot the Major of the 
1<sup>st</sup> Va Regiment (so called  &#8212;  
although most of the men are not Virginians) in the Federal service.  
The Major was from Wellsburg also and was recognized by the 
31<sup>st</sup> man, who called the attention of his comrades to him.  
Two of them took aim at him, saw him fall and carried off, and heard 
afterwards that he was mortally wounded.  The same man told that he had 
two brothers in the 1<sup>st</sup> Va 
(Yankee) Regiment, who ran off, throwing away their guns.  He 
manifested a savage joyousness in relating the fall by his hand of one 
of his own townsman.  D<sup>r</sup>. White informed me that the man, 
although rough-looking, was a very superior clerk.  James 
M<sup>c</sup>Clung, who is Quartermaster of the 58<sup>th</sup> Va., has been in town for several days  &#8212;  he 
took dinner with us to-day.  Davy Strasburg 
called to tell us good-bye, + got a saucer of strawberries.  I saw 
Arthur Spitzer off this morning.  Edward Waddell and Archy Graham 
called after dinner.  Brown sugar is selling by the barrel at 45 cents 
per pound  &#8212;  bacon 30<sup>c</sup></p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, June 19, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Every body wondering to-day the cause of 
Jackson's movement across the mountain.  Some suggest that he is going 
to Richmond; intending to fall upon M<sup>c</sup>Clelland's rear.  
Others that he crossed over to meet Fremont's army, which, it is 
rumored, has left the Valley and gone East.  A party of Yankee 
soldiers, captured by our cavalry near Mt. Jackson, Shenandoah, was 
brought in to-day.  Two of the guard called 
here to get something to eat, and Va, as 
susual, did what she could for them.  &#8212;  
Several persons arrived to-day from 
Buckhannon, Upshur county, having come through without interruption.  
This rout has not been open to travelers for 
more than a year.  No Railroad train from the East to-day.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, June 20, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The town very quiet to-day.  A report that 
the Federal army has crossed the Blue Ridge from Front Royal.  Jackson 
said to be at, or on the way to, Gordonsville.  On Sunday last, the 
Sacrament was administered in the army, near Port Republic, after the 
old Scotch custom, in the open air.  I moved from the Quartermaster's 
Office into my private office to-day, to have 
a more quiet place for making off the quarterly returns.  Having been 
in a bustle for so many months, the quietness was rather oppressive to 
me.  John Hendren came in and spent an hour or two with me.  Legh 
called in the evening.  A great many of the soldiers, principally 
Marylanders, were at his house while the troops were here, to get milk, 
butter, eggs +c.  Some of them brought coffee, which had been issued to 
them, as a present, in return for articles they had received.  There 
has been no mail from Richmond for several days.  Banks reports to his 
government that he lost only 911 men, of whom 200 were killed and 
wounded and the remainder taken prisoners, in his late "retreat" from 
the Valley  &#8212;  We took to Lynchburg about 3000 of his men who were 
captured.  Our army captured none of his wagons, he says  &#8212;  Legh saw 
at least 50 of them with our army at Port Republic, + and Yankee wagons 
and ambulances have been very familiar sights in Staunton since the 
famous "retreat."  Fremont falsifies, almost to the same extent, in his 
report of the battles near Port Republic.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, June 21, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Still no intelligence from any quarter.  Several persons, amongst 
them Alick, report having heard distant cannonading this morning.  
Twenty-five or thirty "Yankee" prisoners were in the Court house yard 
this evening, brought up from Harrisonburg  &#8212;  all but three wounded, 
and all but three <u>Dutch</u>.  With a house 
full before, Frazier is here to-night, on a

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The town perfectly quiet yesterday and to-
day  &#8212;  We have been cut off from intelligence, and there has 
scarcely been a rumor  &#8212;  nothing in the least exciting.  According to 
report, Jackson's army was, when last heard from, at Beaver Dam Depot, 
Hanover Co.  If so, the object must be to 
spoil M<sup>c</sup>Clelland in the rear.  The Railroad cars are 
undoubtedly used for army transportation, or we should have had a train 
up.  Mails from Lexington and Harrisonburg, only:  &#8212;  It is rumored 
that Fremont's army is guarding the passes of the Blue Ridge, near 
Front Royal and other fronts, anticipating Jackson's advance in that 
quarter.  Frazier remained till yesterday afternoon.  &#8212;  John Barclay 
of Lexington came up and remained till church time  &#8212;  Also James 
M<sup>c</sup>Clung.  For some days past I have employed my spare 
moments in working around my grape vines.  This evening I removed the 
hard and poor soil from a young vine (next the row of raspberry vines) 
and put in manure.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A report to-day that Halleck, the Federal 
General who has been confronting Beauregard at Corinth, Miss., is on his way with his army to 
Washington.  Also that Beauregard is in Richmond  &#8212;  presumed that his 
army is coming.  A report from Charlottesville that France has 
acknowledged our independence.  No cars yet, and all the news we have 
had for about a week has been brought by persons traveling on 
horseback.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday evening, June 26, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The cars came in Tuesday evening last, and yesterday and to-day, bringing Richmond mails by way of Lynchburg.  
No news of special interest from any quarter.  Jacksons army said to be at Beaver Dam or the 
Junction, at the last advices.  Staunton has been perfectly quiet.  We 
have several thousand cavalry down the Valley, under Brig. Gen. Robertson (or Robinson), 
who has taken Asby's place.  No other 
troops.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday, June 27, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I was informed last night that Jackson's army was at Ashland, in 
Hanover Co., Legh came in this morning  &#8212;  
says he heard heavy cannonading last evening.  Many other persons speak 
of having heard it yesterday and this morning.  (Jimmy Tate went home 
Wednesday + Nannie + Mattie yesterday.)</p><p class="p10"><u>Friday afternoon</u>.  &#8212;  Dispatches 
received by the telegraph operator here say that a battle began yester 
about noon at Richmond, and continued til 
dark.  At first the enemy obtained some success, but at the close we 
had the advantage.  The battle was renewed this morning, and was raging 
all along the line at the last account.  At least one hundred thousand 
men are arrayed on each side  &#8212;  what multitudes are now passing into 
eternity, and how many more are this moment writhing in pain on the 
bloody ground!  I have acquaintances, friends and relatives there, and 
yet I do not feel the awful solicitude which in former times I would 
have anticipated.  May God in mercy spare the shedding of blood, and 
give us the victory!</p><p class="p10"><u>6 o'clock P.M.</u>  &#8212;  Four or five 
dispatches have just come from Richmond, &#8212; all concur in stating that 
the enemy have been driven back at all points, and our reports that 
they are in flight.  Our loss very heavy.  God grant to make the 
victory decisive, and give our people grace to praise him for it.  The 
cannonading was certainly heard in this neighborhood.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday, June 28, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Several dispatches at 10 o'clock last night, stating that the enemy 
had been driven back seven miles, and our troops still pursuing.  A 
dispatch to-day says the battle is still going 
on, that we have captured a large number of prisoners and many small 
arms.  Cannonading heard again this morning.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday afternoon, June 30, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The battle near Richmond was continued on yesterday.  Cannonading 
distinctly heard in this region.  We have no details of the fight since 
Friday, but telegraphic dispatches received to-
day state that the Federal army was retreating towards James 
River.  The reports are encouraging for our side.  Eight members of the 
Guard (from Staunton) wounded, besides the Captain Burke.  Three of the 
Staunton Artillery reported killed  &#8212;  all strangers to me.  I sat up 
with D<sup>r</sup>. Edmondson last night, who died between 1 + 2 
o'clock this morning.  His family overwhelmed with grief.  At the same 
time battles of his horrible war are filling thousands of households 
with lamentation.  I had another swarm of bees yesterday, and one to-day, making three from the same hive this season.  
When I contrast my circumstances with those of many other people, how 
much have I to thank God for.  Yet how do I repay Him for his goodness!  
I do desire to draw near to the Lord Jesus, confessing all my quiet, 
that I may find pardon and <u>deliverance</u> 
from Sin.  The bees have been a source of much entertainment to me, and 
have, in part, suggested these reflections.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday evening, July 1, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The great battle below Richmond, still going on.  Many reports, &#8212;  
some very exaggerated &#8212;  We have been generally successful, and the 
enemy are retreating  &#8212;  this is about the state of the case so far.  
There has been no general rout.  Cannonading heard again to-day.  Several persons wounded in Friday's fight 
were brought up in the R.R. train this 
evening.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday morning, July 2, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Very heavy and rapid cannonading was kept up yesterday afternoon 
till long after dark.  We heard it distinctly at our house.  A dispatch 
between 9 + 10 o'clock last night stated that the enemy were defeated 
again on Monday, and that there was every prospect of capturing or 
routing the whole army.  But the newspaper accounts never come up to 
the telegraphic reports.  The battle will probably be suspended to-day by the rain  &#8212;  It has been raging for a 
week to-day.  The cars came through from 
Richmond yesterday.  A dispatch from Charlottesville, last night, 
mentions a report that M<sup>c</sup>Clelland had been mortally wounded 
and that his army was demoralized; but it speaks of the enemy's 
receiving reinforcements which is not encouraging.  We have no report 
yet in reference to the heavy firing of yesterday and last night.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday morning, July 4, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">There is little to say in reference to the great battle below 
Richmond.  The papers disagree as to the result Tuesday night.  It 
seems that the telegraphic reports greatly exaggerated the number of 
prisoners taken, and probably our successes generally.  I cannot 
receive as true any reports coming in that way.  A dispatch last 
evening stated that the enemy had made "<u>a final 
stand</u>" at Turkey Island, when they were defeated with great 
slaughter and the loss of all their artillery.  This needs 
confirmation.  I am only certain of this, that the enemy have been 
repulsed, losing several thousand men in killed, wounded and prisoners, 
and some cannon +c; and that our loss is also heavy.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday morning, July 7, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A great variety of reports from Richmond since Friday, but no 
reliable intelligence as to the state of affairs.  At one time we heard 
that the greater part of the Federal army is surrounded and will 
certainly be captured [there was a rumor yesterday that 50,000 had been 
taken], and immediately afterwards it is asserted that they have 
effected their escape.  The latter I believe to be true.  
M<sup>c</sup>Clelland has at last, no doubt, got to a position on James 
River, where his transports and gunboats are, his columns a good deal 
shattered, but not seriously reduced in numbers.  We have about 5000 
prisoners (besides the wounded) including one Major General and four or 
five Brigadiers.  No estimates have yet been made of the numbers slain.  
Although we have not routed the Federal army, we have gained a great 
success.  The North had no expectation of a repulse.  The following 
extract from "Harpers Weekly," published early last week, shows the 
confident feeling of the people in that region.<a href="#n58">58</a></p><p class="p10">John Seddon, of Stafford, Maj. commanding 
the Irish Battalion, went home with me to dinner yesterday, and 
remained till seven o'clock.  D<sup>r</sup>. Arch. Graham came up after 
supper.  Mrs. McC. and Miss A. remained with him, while the rest of us went to 
church.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday, July 8, 1862</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The last intelligence confirms the rumor that M<sup>c</sup>Clelland, 
with the main body of his army, had made good his retreat to James 
River, when he had made a stand.  He had received reinforcements and 
was doubtless preparing for another battle if not for another advance 
upon Richmond.  Our town very quiet.  Most of the Federal soldiers down 
the Valley have gone to reinforce M<sup>c</sup>Clelland.  Cannonading 
has been heard, yesterday and to-day.  As I 
sit in my office (about 4 o'clock P.M.)  I hear a low dull thumping 
which may be the sound of distant cannon.  If so the fight has been 
protracted and furious.  Yesterday a poor woman who lives in town not 
far from our house, heard that her husband, a member of the 
52<sup>nd</sup> Regiment, had been killed by a cannon ball.  Her 
wailings were heard at our house for an hour or two.  Alick was called 
in to see her  &#8212;  I met him to-day, and he 
seemed filled with disgust at war  &#8212;  horrified that rational beings 
should thus slaughter one another, and fill the world with lamentation 
and wo.  But we have no alternative.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">No more fighting below Richmond that we know of.  The cannonading 
heard on Monday and Tuesday was probably from the Federal gunboats, as 
they were firing pretty much at random.  It is rumored that Jackson's 
command is coming to the Valley again.  Transportation has been ordered 
for Loving's command (now in Monroe) and for Robertson's cavalry 
Brigade in the lower Valley.  It seems probable therefore that Jackson 
is to lead a force towards Maryland.  M<sup>c</sup>Clelland is on James 
River, under shelter of his gunboats.  I received a letter from Arthur

of the Assembly on the state of the country, takes the most ultra

prosecution of the war, and with the most arrogant, if not blasphemous, 
assurance assumes to speak in the name of Jesus Christ.  The utter 
madness and folly of the men is astounding.  The vote upon the 
resolutions was 199 yeas and 20 nays.  Brown sugar is selling in 
Staunton at seventy-five (75) cents per pound.  No coffee here, but

to be amputated.  The operation was performed just before Jackson was 
compelled to retreat, and as he could not be moved he was left behind 
in the hands of the enemy.  A private family took care of him, and he 
was treated with great kindness by the Yankee surgeons.  Burgess had 
been wounded in the leg, and was left in the Hospital.  Being paroled, 
he staid with Frank to dress his arm.  Frank, however, was not 
discharged from custody.  One day last week a party of our cavalry had 
a skirmish with the enemy near Winchester, capturing twelve or fourteen 
of them, and the Federalists in the town, thinking that Jackson was 
upon them, hastily withdrew.  A lady who lives on this side of the 
place, taking advantage of the occurrence, went in and brought Frank + 
Burgess off in her carriage, and so they escaped.  The former started 
to Lexington this morning by stage, and the latter went down the 
Railroad in search of his regiment.  Burgess had been captured before 
at Huntsville, Ala.  He and the other 
prisoners were confined in a large building, and the ladies of the town 
coming to bring food to them (the Yankees not furnishing supplies), he 
asked one of them to allow him to pass out with her.  She consented, 
and taking off his military clothing, he went by the sentinels, 
unsuspected.  Clem. Fishburn was with us most of the day yesterday.  
Jimmy Tate was in also.  Kate gave up her room to Frank + Burgess.  
News came by the cars yesterday that a party of the enemy from 
Fredericksburg had made a dash upon the Central Railroad at Beaver Dam 
Depot, and burnt the buildings, tearing up the track +c.  Some 
skirmishing on Saturday between Gordonsville + Culpeper C.H.  &#8212;  nothing authentic in reference to 
the cannonading heard here that day.</p><p class="p10"><u>Afternoon</u>.  &#8212;  A dispatch from

have retaken Nashville, Tennessee.</p></p>

been sent here from Richmond  &#8212;  talk of taking the Augusta Female 
Seminary and Wesleyan Institute for Hospitals.  At last accounts 
Jackson was moving towards Madison C.H.  The enemy in that region are said to 
be from 30,000 to 40,000.  Yesterday evening Blackley and I walked up 
to Legh's, going up the Railroad to Shumate's, and thence along the Old 
Middlebrook road, across the fields.  I felt a desire to go that way, 
as I had not been along there since the road was closed, years ago.  
During my childhood and youth every foot of the way was familiar to me.  
I took a basket to get some <u>huckleberries</u>  
&#8212;  found very few, got some blackberries, in Jefferson Kinney's fields 
as we came back.  Joe Ryan was in to see me this morning  &#8212;  he is at

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yesterday evening three wagon loads of Yankee prisoners were brought 
up from Harrisonburg, where they had been since the battles at Port 
Republic.  They were left in the Hospital.  One or two wore bandages 
and I observed a pair of crutches in one of the wagons.  They were 
generally hale-looking fellows, and I experienced a stronger feeling of 
resentment towards them than usual.  They were guarded by three of our 
cavalrymen.  &#8212;  a small guard for probably thirty or forty men.  &#8212;  
We have no news from our armies.  Enlistments seem to be going on 
briskly in the Federal States of the North, and the 300,000 men will no 
doubt be raised very soon.  Towns and individuals are subscribing 
liberally to increase the pay of the soldiers, and encourage 
enlistments.  It is evident that the feeling at the North is more 
vindictive than ever, and the war will be waged more ruthlessly.  The 
Federal General Pope, commanding the army of Northern Virginia, has 
issued several savage orders recently, which indicate the present 
temper of the Yankee nation.  Whenever the Federal troops penetrate the 
Southern country, the citizens are to be arrested and sent off who 
refuse to take the oath of allegiance, the army is to subsist off the 
country, property is to be taken as far as necessary, the negroes 
employed for our subjugation (they do not <u>say</u> as soldiers), people living in their lines 
are to be held responsible for the acts of our guerillas, +c. +c.  Whenever the Yankees go, 
therefore, the men will fly from their homes, thousands will take arms 
who otherwise would have remained quiet, and Gen. Pope will find the number of his enemies 
increased at every step.</p><p class="p10">Va had a visit yesterday, from one of 
the poor serving women of town.  She gave a lively description of the 
sufferings of that class of the community, occasioned by the war.  Her 
dresses, she said, usually cost her $1.25 each, being made of calico.  
Owing to the high prices of goods at this time, she would have to work 
several weeks to make enough money to purchase one dress.  But the 
serving cannot be obtained, as people even in good circumstances cannot 
get the materials to work up.  The woman wished to know if she could 
get an old dress and pay for it in work.  She said the women of her 
class generally were suffering greatly, both for want of the means of 
living and from mental anxiety in regard to the war.  &#8212;  They read no 
papers and are without correct information, and are therefore exposed 
to all the thousand reports which fly through the community.  Next 
winter is dreaded by many besides the very poor.</p></p>

resigned, and that Ohio and Connecticut have refused to furnish more 
troops.  There are rumors as to the causes of both, but we have no

true, we hope the <u>occurrences</u> alluded to 
will tend to bring the war to an end.  The sick soldiers are to be 
removed from the Hospital here, to Lovingston, it is said.  The

destroyed.  It is reported that a citizen of Frederickshall who 
expressed his feelings freely, was severely whipped by the Yankees and 
carried off to Fredericksburg.  But we hear many such reports which

Rucker who was captured by our troops at Summersville, did not escape 
as was reported, but was taken out privately and killed by some of our

off several citizens as hostages for Rucker's safely.  It is thought 
that a battle will soon take place near Gordonsville.  A large number

The enemy, it was said, were driven near Culpeper C.H. leaving their dead and wounded behind 
them.  Our force engaged was reported as only 5000.  The number of 
prisoners taken by our army was variously reported from 150 to 600, 
among them Gen. Prince.  Our General 
Winder was killed by a cannon ball.  The telegraph operator here 
reports, upon information received by him this morning from the 
operations at Gordonsville, that the fighting was successful to our

yesterday evening.  Passing the Court 
house yard a while ago, I observed a number of persons standing 
before several <u>blue jackets</u> who were 
lying on the grass.  The latter turned out to be deserters from the 
Yankee army down the Valley.  A dozen of them arrived here last 
evening, ten Western Virginians, one from Pennsylvania and one from New 
York.  I talked with two of them, one from Kanawha and the other from 
Jackson county.  They said there was great dissatisfaction in the 
Yankee army, many of the soldiers having deserted and many more 
intending to do so the first opportunity.  These men were in camp near 
the Blue Ridge and took to the mountain to escape a pursuit by cavalry.

that Jackson had to destroy an immense amount of stores captured from 
the enemy, about the middle of last week, not being able to remove 
them.  It was when he first got in their rear, before anything decisive

received in one of the recent battles.  &#8212;  Gen. Ewell also died yesterday, a mistake.  A 
report comes from Harrisonburg that the Federalists have abandoned 
Winchester, burning a third of the town, and that Gen. M<sup>c</sup>Clelland was killed.  
Intelligence from the army is very meagre and 
unreliable.  Letters state that the enemy was at Fairfax C.H. + that another battle would take place 
yesterday.  Among the rumors are that our cavalry was on the other side 
of them, and that they (the enemy) had burnt or blown up the Long 
Bridge across the Potomac at Washington.  The inspecting surgeon 
pronounced Legh unfit to bear arms, but recommended him for service in 
some other department.  Upon the arrival of the cars this evening, the 
town was all alive.  Many persons leaving for Winchester.  Peyton was 
starting to buy supplies, and I engaged him to get me a pound of tea,

the intelligence that Gen. Kirby Smith had 
routed a Yankee army at Richmond, Ky.  It 
was reported on Saturday that he had taken Lexington, Ky.  A lady has arrived here from 
Fredericksburg.  The enemy abandoned the place last week, destroying 
their stores.  The lady asserts that they took off a large number of 
negroes, <u>and shot them</u> at Aquia Creek.  
Upon finding that they had not transportation for them!  This is hardly 
credible.  For several days we have had reports that a part of our army 
was in Maryland.  This morning it is rumored that Jackson was at the

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The Harrisonburg stage brought word this afternoon that Jackson was 
at Frederick, Md., having captured 2600 
Federal soldiers at Poolsville &#8212;  all lately in the Valley.  The 
telegraph afterwards repeated the same report.  Next the rumor ran 
through town, from the telegraph office, that Kirby Smith had taken 
Cincinnati!  Passengers by the cars, subsequently stated, as a report, 
in addition to former, that Stuart's cavalry was at Baltimore, and that 
6000 Marylanders had joined Jackson.  There is no reason to doubt now 
that a portion of our forces are in Maryland  &#8212;  the remainder is 
probably mere conjecture.  &#8212;  The reported capture of Cincinnati has 
possibly risen out of the dispatches from that place copied from 
Northern papers by our papers yesterday, which represented a portion of 
our forces as within ten or twelve miles of the city.  As usual the 
Yankees claimed the victory in the recent fights near Manassas as long 
as they could.  Gen. Pope sent a dispatch 
to Washington stating that he had defeated us on Thursday, the

soon terminate.  There are certainly some hopeful signs.  The tone of 
the Northern papers, so far as we have heard from there, is depressed.  
The Federal army retired before ours to their entrenchments, and then 
Lee slipped a part of his force into Maryland.  What is to be done 
there is a mystery.  The new <i>[illeg.]</i> at the North must feel 
discouraged.  In one neighborhood in Pennsylvania the people have 
forcibly resisted the enrolment of the 
militia, preparatory to a draft, driving off the officer.  What a 
change since six months ago or less!  Then the enemy had many of our 
towns and cities and seemed irresistible.  Now our army is in Maryland, 
Cincinnati threatened, if not taken, and the Yankees beaten at every

of the enemy at Harper's Ferry.  It was contradicted yesterday, by 
stage passengers, who stated that cannonading was going on in the 
direction of the Ferry, and it was supposed a battle was in progress.  
There is a dispatch this morning stating that a battle had occurred at 
Boonsborough, Md., and that we 
had taken 8,000 prisoners.  I found the Rev. (Capt) John 
Miller at our house last night, when I went home  &#8212;  he has been

Virginia.<a href="#n62">62</a>  The <u>annexed</u> shows the scarcity of salt!  and the

Peyton brought me a pound of tea from Winchester, for which I paid him 
$6.00.  A very indifferent article.  A number of letters have been

Addy was to leave for the army yesterday, and Mr. Stuart next week.  
Synod meets here on the 1<sup>st</sup> October, and the ladies are 
interested in making arrangements for it.  The Northern people are 
evidently bewildered at their recent reverses.  Gen. Pope has been sent off to Minnesota, to 
take command in that quarter, where an Indian war is raging.  He 
virtually accuses most of his leading officers of cowardice in the late 
battles.  M<sup>c</sup>Dowell has been <u>relieved</u> of his command.  There is a general 
outcry at the North against their two Generals  &#8212;  Pope is accused of 
incompetency and M<sup>c</sup>Dowell of treachery.  What a fall for 
Pope!  Upon taking command in Va. he 
issued a braggadocio proclamation  &#8212;  that he had been used to seeing 
the rebels' backs, his policy was to push forward and let his rear take 
care of itself +c +c  &#8212;  In a few weeks he was forced to run, his army 
beaten, and now he is banished to the N. 
W.  The following is the dispatch alluded to above, sent from 
Winchester by courier to Harrisonburg, and thence by Telegraph:  
"Harper's Ferry surrendered yesterday, 8,000 prisoners.  D. H. Hill 
fought at <u>Brownsville</u>, Md., Saturday.  Victorious.  Our loss heavy.  
Gen. R. B. Garland reported among the 
killed."  [Boonsborough is no doubt 
meant.]</p><p class="p10"><u>Afternoon</u>.  &#8212;  A dispatch from 
Harrisonburg.  Since dinner is rather unfavorable.  It says:</p><p class="p10">"Maj Yost has just arrived from Harper's 
Ferry.  &#8212;  He says that Gen. Hill was 
attacked by eighty [thousand] Federals under M<sup>c</sup>Clelland and 
Burnside, near Boonsboro, Md., and repulsed three times with heavy loss 
and driven back some distance, when Gen's 
Lee and Longstreet came to his assistance and drove them three miles 
beyond Boonsboro.  Their loss was tremendous, as well as our own.  
Gen's Lee, Longstreet and Hill <u>retreated in the direction of the Potomac</u>.  
Gen. Jackson in the mean time had captured 
at Harper's Ferry 11,000 prisoners and 1500 negroes, 50 pieces of 
artillery, all their ammunition, commissary and Quartermaster's stores.  
He opened fire on them at 5 o'clock and shelled them until 10, when 
they surrendered.  Gen. Jackson then 
crossed the river and formed a junction with Gen. Lee."  The idea of our army <u>retreating</u> towards the Potomac is unpleasant, 
and diminishes the gratification of the grand result at Harper's 
Ferry.</p></p>

recent victories.  The people are taking holiday, but I have been at 
work since breakfast.  A letter from A. R. Boteler, received last night, puts a rather 
different face upon the news from Maryland.  The dates are important.  
He says Hill was attacked at Boonsboro on <u>Sunday</u>, and held his ground till Longstreet 
came up, when the enemy retired.  It is supposed that the Federalists 
were moving to relieve their army at Harper's Ferry.  Lee fell back, 
probably to support Jackson, who took Harper's Ferry on <u>Monday</u>.  Thus the plans of the enemy were 
defeated, and ours were successful.  Gen. 
Loring's last dispatch is dated at Charleston, Kanawha Co.  He had driven the Federalists before him at 
all points.  &#8212;  A large number of conscripts from North Carolina 
arrived this morning <u>on route</u> for

that on Sunday the enemy in force attacked D. H. Hill's division, which 
after fighting all day was retiring in good order, when Longstreet came 
up at sundown and drove the Federalists back several miles.  On Monday 
Jackson captured Harper's Ferry, with 11,000 prisoners, 14,000 guns, 80 
cannon, stores of immense value, +c.  On Tuesday there was another 
fight (rumor says we took from 5000 to 8000 prisoners  &#8212;  but this is 
doubtful).  On Wednesday a terrific battle came off.  The enemy broke 
our centre at one time, but Jackson coming up 
in some way, the tide was turned and the enemy defeated.  It is stated 
that our army was pursuing them, and that they made no reply to the 
assaults upon their rear.  Reports represent that the loss on both 
sides amounts to from 50,000 to 60,000!  It is asserted by some, but 
not generally credited, that the Federal General Burnside was

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">There seems to be a turn in the tide of our affairs.  Things are 
discouraging this morning.  After the battle of Wednesday last in which 
it is reported the enemy were badly defeated, our army was so much 
exhausted that Gen. Lee crossed the 
Potomac into Virginia.  It is reported that the enemy have also crossed 
but there is some doubt about that.  Rumor says we have only 80,000 men 
left  &#8212;  or 50,000 effective.  Reports also that a large force of the 
enemy is at Clarkesburg, Harrison Co.  Legh started to Winchester yesterday, in 
charge of a wagon train, accompanying troops.</p><p class="p10"><u>Later</u>.  &#8212;  Every arrival confirms the 
impression that we have been worsted in Maryland, on the whole.  
Rumored that our army was reduced by 20,000 men, in one way and 
another.  Three or four of our Generals have been killed, and eight or 
nine wounded.  One of Gen. Starke's staff, 
who arrived with his (Starke's) body, says the enemy were repulsed on 
Wednesday, but it was far from a victory for us.  The American Hotel is 
to be used as a Military Hospital.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday, Sept. 23, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A letter from Winchester this morning states that ten thousand of 
the enemy crossed the Potomac and were ambushed by Jackson and driven 
back with great loss of men and arms; that our army had recrossed into 
Maryland +c.  This intelligence has relieved to some extent the painful 
apprehension felt on yesterday.  If we were not so used to it, the 
sight of the multitudes of wounded and suffering soldiers constantly 
arriving, would be shocking.  A large number of troops arrived on the 
train last night  &#8212;  part from Georgia and the remainder Marylanders.  
The former moved down the Valley this morning; the latter are still in 
town, and some of them, having obtained liquor, have been very 
disorderly.  Several were arrested by the Provost Marshal's guard, 
after a fracas.  Many of the soldiers are walking about bare-footed  &#8212;  
feet sore and unable to wear shoes.  Winchester is said to be overrun 
with <u>vermin</u>.  I have just paid $1.50 for 
not quite 3/4 pounds of table salt.</p><p class="p10"><u>Afternoon</u>.  &#8212;  Persons arrived since 
dinner state that another portion of the enemy crossed the Potomac 
lower down than Shepherdstown, and falling into a trap set for them by 
Gen. Hill, were nearby all killed and 
drowned.</p><p class="p10">Jim M<sup>c</sup>Clung has come, from Winchester, sick and very much 
rednosed.  He says our army suffered severely in Maryland, and will 
have to fall back to Winchester,  &#8212;  for want of subsistence in their 
present position.  His account of the affairs mentioned above is, that 
Jackson, hearing that the enemy had crossed at Williamsport, went up to 
that place, leaving A. P. Hill with a part of his force at 
Shepherdstown.  Jackson's encounter with the enemy and Hill's are so 
mixed up, that it is impossible to distinguish between them  &#8212;  the 
intelligence is confused  &#8212;  but all accounts agree in representing 
that the Yankees were signally repulsed.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">No news this morning.  All late intelligence represents our army as 
concentrating at or near Winchester, and the enemy as advancing.  
Lincoln has issued a proclamation declaring slaves in the "rebel" 
states free after the 1<sup>st</sup> of January next.  In consequence 
of this proceeding, it has been proposed in our Congress to wage a war 
of extermination of the Yankee invaders, to take no prisoners, and ask 
and give no quarter.  The war must come to this.  There is no prospect 
of an end.  Civil liberty is nearly gone in this faction, as well as 
among the Yankee states, and a military despotism will finally prevail.  
Wearied out as they are, the people will soon be ready to accept any 
authority which may restore peace.  The drought continues, and a 
scarcity of subsistence is threatened.  The yellow fever is prevailing 
at Wilmington, N. C.  None at 
Norfolk and New Orleans where the Yankees have possession.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">An ambulance train laden with wounded soldiers has come in from 
Winchester.  From this number of Yankee vehicles (captured from the 
enemy) one might suppose that the Federal army was passing along.  One 
four-wheeled ambulance is marked "39<sup>th</sup> Regiment  &#8212;  Col. d'Assey  &#8212; N. Y. S. V." (New York State 
Volunteers); Another vehicle, <u>two-
storied</u>, has the letters "U. 
S." pained on it; and a third, "N. Y. S. V."  Legh got back 
yesterday.  Well-informed persons from Winchester state that our army 
has filled up rapidly, being now twice the size it was upon the return 
from Maryland.  The number a few days ago is however only put down at 
80,000.  Lincoln's proclamation in regard to slaves, seems calculated 
and intended to excite servile insurrections in the South  &#8212;  to such 
a pitch of ferocity have our enemies arrived.</p><p class="p10">Synod met last night  &#8212;  comparatively few here.  Our guests are 
Rev. Mr. Dudley, Henry C. Alexander, Mr. 
Phlegar, of Christiansburg, and Mr. Dinwiddie, of Greenwood, Albemarle.  
Besides these we have Ann Eliza Wilson, Mary Tate Graham (her husband 
till this morning); Mrs. M<sup>c</sup>Clung, Miss Agnes, and Mary 
Stuart.  D<sup>r</sup>. White and Foote + Wm. M. Tate were at dinner.  Sister thinks of coming down 
on a visit during the month.  Mr. Stuart and Addy have gone to join the

sent to Winchester in 48 hours, was received this morning.  Just now a

used to see, before the war.  Many wounded soldiers going home on 
furlough or discharged  &#8212;  some on two crutches, others on one, and 
several supported by two men, one on each side.  A poor fellow came 
leaping along, using a rough staff in place of one of his legs which 
was hurt, making his way to the Quartermaster's office to obtain a 
transportation ticket.  One leg of his pants was cut off at the knee, 
and the other was slit open so as to expose his bare limb.  What 
clothing he had on was dirty, as usual with most soldiers returning 
from the army.  &#8212;  I made him sit down on the platform and taking his

made a cavalry excursion into Pennsylvania, capturing Chambersburg and 
other places, taking many horses, +c. cutting his way through a

that Bragg had a victory in Kentucky, although we are without positive

made a bold speech for these times.  Elections take place in a number 
of the States this month.  Civil liberty is crushed out at the North  -
-  not very much better here  &#8212;  but the case is different between the 
two sections  &#8212;  We are resisting invasion and subjugation  &#8212;  it is

<p class="p11"><b>Saturday, Oct. 18, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Indications of popular feeling at the North, are somewhat 
encouraging.  A great meeting held in New York City, a few days ago, 
was, in some degree, a peace meeting.  Fillmore + Washington  Hunt were 
among the Vice Presidents, and John Van Buren and others spoke.  The 
latter denounced the Administration and <u>indirectly</u> the war; the resolutions took the 
same ground.  The meeting was held to influence the pending elections.  
Other indications also are encouraging.  M<sup>c</sup>Clelland has 
issued an order prohibiting political discussions in his army, which is 
a good sign  &#8212;  There must be some necessity for it  &#8212;  the army is 
criticising the government.</p><p class="p10">I annex a slip giving the last news from Kentucky.  We are still

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A rumor this morning that Bragg has been defeated in Kentucky, and 
has fallen back to Cumberland Gap  &#8212;  very different from previous 
intelligence.  &#8212;  Reported yesterday that the enemy, 200,000 strong, 
had crossed the Potomac  &#8212;  nothing of it to-
day.  Loring is said to be on the way to join Lee.  Troops still 
going down the Valley.  We see in the Richmond Dispatch a letter giving 
an account of recent <u>murders</u> in Missouri 
by the Federalists.  Among the persons said to have been killed is a 
brother of Mr. Stuart (S. D.), Robert Stuart of Saline county.  The 
last unfavorable account from Kentucky have come here in this way:  
Richardson came up from Richmond last night and says a clerk in one of 
the offices informed him Saturday night that the intelligence alluded 
to had been received by the Department, and the Telegraph operator here 
says he has received similar news.  It is probable that in a second 
fight which was anticipated after our first successes, we were defeated 
and had to retreat.<a href="#n63">63</a></p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday, Oct. 22, 1862.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Gen. Bragg has sure enough fallen back, 
being within forty miles of Cumberland Gap at last accounts.  The 
explanation from our side is, that he was obliged to fall back for 
supplies.  The results is that we lose Kentucky.  Our accounts state 
that all the fighting was favorable to Bragg.  It seems, however, that 
we did not take many prisoners, and our successes, as reported on a 
previous page, are greatly exaggerated.  We hear that the battalion 
with which Mr. Stuart and Addy were traveling, had joined Gen. Marshall and they are therefore with the 
main army in Kentucky.  (Sister and her children went to James 
Calhoun's yesterday, to spend a few days).  The last reports from the 
lower Valley are, that Gen. Lee was 
advancing upon the enemy.  The latter came across the Potomac in large 
force, occupying Charlestown, but after some skirmishing retired.  The 
elections in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana have gone for the 
Democrats, but as all parties advocate the war, the result will not do 
us any good, probably.  Draughting (or drafting) has been going on in 
several of the Northern States.  Even Maryland had nearly furnished her 
quota of men, only lacking 6000.  But we have more to fear from the 
scarcity of bread stuffs and clothing than from the Yankee armies.  The 
drought continues unabated  &#8212;  the fields are perfectly barren  &#8212;  
the wheat must perish soon.  Farmers are unwilling to sell the produce 
they have on hand.  Flour $14  &#8212;  Butter 75<sup>c</sup>  <sup>Corn $2 
per bushel</sup>  Pork will probably be $20 to $25 per hundred lbs.  
Many persons who have money can scarcely procure necessary food, even 
at this early in the Fall, usually the most abundant period of the 
year.  Clothing is sold at extravagant prices.  Tate got dresses for 
Nanny + Matty in Richmond a few days ago, and paid $60 for the two, a 
common article.  I have heard of an infant's dress costing $18.  Felt 
hats sell from $10 to $15.  Shoemakers in town demand from $5.50 to $6 
for <u>making</u> a pair of shoes, leather, 
lining and thread furnished to them.  The small pox has spread from the 
Hospital into the town.  Yellow fever raging in Wilmington.  War, 
pestilence and famine!  Oh for the faith of Habakkuk!  Alas!  we never 
know how little faith we had till the day of trial comes.  Twenty-three 
artillery companies have been dismantled by Gen. Lee, and the cannon +c sent here.  &#8212;  the 
men put into other service.  A few days ago thirteen thousand recruits 
for Gen. Lee's army had passed through 
Staunton since the battles in Maryland.  The news of the apparent 
Yankee successes in Maryland had reached England, and the British press 
were complimenting Gen. 
M<sup>c</sup>Clelland.  They seem not to have heard of the capture of 
Harper's Ferry by our army, and to be in a great degree ignorant of the 
course of events.  As usual when the Confederacy has sustained a 
reverse, there is again talk in Europe of acknowledging our 
independence.  Whenever we are successful foreign powers seem 
determined to take no such step.  It is apparent that they wish the war 
to go on till the sections are hopelessly broken down, but would 
interfere to prevent a reunion.  They desire the ultimate success of 
the "rebels" in <u>dissolving</u> the Old Union, 
but want to see the country ruined first.  Hence they encourage which 
ever side is at the moment suffering from reverses.</p></p>

<p class="p12"><i><p class="p12"><i><b>THE BATTLE OF PERRYVILLE&#8212;GENERAL BRAGG'S OFFICIAL 
REPORT</b></i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>The following is a copy of Major General Bragg's official report of 
the battle of Perryville, Ky:</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>SIR&#8212;Finding the enemy pressing heavily in his rear, near 
Perryville, Major General Hardee, of Polk's command, was obliged to 
halt and check him at that point.  Having arrived at Harrodsburg from 
Frankfort, I determined to give him battle there, and accordingly 
concentrated three divisions of my old command&#8212;the army of the 
Mississippi, now under Major General Polk&#8212;Cheatham's, Buckner's, and 
Anderson's&#8212;and directed Gen. Polk to take 
the command on the 7th, and attack the enemy next morning.  Wither's 
division had gone the day before to support Smith.  Hearing, on the 
night of the 7th, that the force in front of Smith had rapidly 
retreated, I moved early next morning, to be present at the operations 
of Polk's forces.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>The two armies were formed confronting each other, on opposite sides 
of the town of Perryville.  After consulting the General, and 
reconnoitering the ground and examining his dispositions, I declined to 
assume the command, but suggested some changes and modifications of his 
arrangements, which he promptly adopted.  The action opened at 12 P. 
M., between the skirmishers and artillery on both sides.  Finding the 
enemy indisposed to advance upon us, and knowing he was receiving heavy 
reinforcements, I deemed it best to assail him vigorously, and so 
directed.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>The engagement became general soon thereafter, and was continued 
furiously from that time to dark, our troops never faltering and never 
falling in their efforts.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>For some time engaged it was the severest and most desperately 
contested engagement within my knowledge.  Fearfully outnumbered, our 
troops did not hesitate to engage at any odds, and though checked at 
times, they eventually carried every position, and drove the enemy 
about two miles.  But for the intervention of night, we should have 
completed the work.  We had captured fifteen pieces of artillery by the 
most daring charges, killed one and wounded two Brigadier Generals, and 
a very large number of inferior officers and men, estimated at no less 
than 4,000, and captured 400 prisoners, including three Staff officers, 
with servants, carriage, and baggage of Major General McCook.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>The ground was literally covered with his dead and wounded.  In such 
a contest our own loss was necessarily severe, probably not less than 
2,500 killed, wounded, and missing.  Included in the wounded are 
Brigadier Generals Wood, Cleburn and Brown&#8212;gallant and noble soldiers-
-whose loss will be severely felt by their commands.  To Major General 
Polk, commanding the forces, Major General Hardee, commanding the left 
wing, two divisions, and Major Generals Cheatham, Buckner, and 
Anderson, commanding divisions, is mainly due the brilliant 
achievements of this memorable field.  Nobler troops were never more 
gallantly led.  The country owes them a debt of gratitude, which I am 
sure will be acknowledged.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>Ascertaining that the enemy was heavily reinforced during the night, 
I withdrew my force early the next morning to Harrodsburg, and thence 
to this point.  Major General Smith arrived at Harrodsburg with most of 
his force and Wither's division the next day, 10th, and yesterday I 
withdrew the whole to this point&#8212;the enemy following slowly, but not 
pressing us.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>I am, sir, very respectfully,</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>Your obedient servant,</i></p>

<p class="p12"><i>To <i>Adjutant General</i>, Richmond, Va.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i><b>A NORTHERN MINISTER ON SOUTHERN SOCIETY</b></i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>Among the most stirring episodes in the proceedings of the Unitarian 
Autumnal Convention, which opened in sessions in Brooklyn, N. Y., Monday, was the peculiar feeling excited 
by the remarks of Rev. Dr. Bellows in eulogy of Southern social life 
and the influences proceeding from it.  We reproduce the appended 
extract from his remarkable discourse, which elicited much bitter 
comment among the members of the Convention:</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>No candid mind will deny the peculiar charm of Southern young men at 
college, or Southern young women in society.  How far race and climate, 
independent of servile institutions, may have produced the Southern 
chivalric spirit and manners, I will not here consider.  But one might 
as well deny the small feet and hands of that people as deny a certain 
inbred habit of command; a contempt of life in defence of honor or class; a talent for political 
life, and an easy control of inferiors.  Nor is this merely an external 
and flashy heroism.  It is real.  It showed itself in Congress early, 
and always by the courage, eloquence, skill and success with which it 
controlled majorities.  It showed itself in the social life of 
Washington by the grace, fascination and ease, the free and charming 
hospitality, by which it governed society.  It now shows itself in 
England and France, by the success with which it manages the courts and 
the circles of literature and fashion in both countries.  It shows 
itself in this war in the orders and proclamations of its Generals, in 
the messages of the Rebel Congress, and in the essential good breeding 
and humanity (contrary to a diligently encouraged public impression) 
with which it not seldom divides its medical stores, and gives our sick 
and wounded as favorable care as it is able to extend to its own.  It 
exceeds us at this moment in the possession of an ambulance corps.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>I think the war must have increased the <i>respect</i> felt by the North for the South.  Its 
miraculous resources, the bravery of its troops, their patience under 
hardships, their unthinking firmness in the desperate position they 
have assumed, the wonderful success with which they have extemporized 
manufactures and munitions of war, and kept themselves in relation with 
the world in spite of our magnificent blockade; the elasticity with 
which they have risen from defeat, and the courage they have shown in 
threatening again and again our capital, and even our interior, cannot 
fail to extort an unwilling admiration and respect.  Well is General 
McClellan reported to have said (privately) as, he watched their 
obstinate fighting at Antietam, and saw them retiring in perfect order 
in the midst of the most frightful carnage:  "What terrific neighbors 
they would be!  We must conquer them, or they will conquer us!"</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i><b>THE MARYLAND CAMPAIGN</b>.&#8212;We find the 
following in the Washington Correspondence of the New York Times:</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>The rebel conflict in Maryland is the engrossing topic of 
conversation here.  As it becomes clear that the rebel army has made 
good its escape, the tendency of public opinion is to deprecate the 
advantages secured by our triumph at Sharpsburg.  While every credit is 
given to our gallant soldiers for their admirable fighting in the 
field, yet the loss of Harpers Ferry is beginning to be felt as a 
disastrous as well as humiliating defeat.  The balance of advantage in 
the late expedition, evidently rests with the enemy, as they carry off 
all the plunder captured, including over 10,000 stand of arms, and over 
50 pieces of artillery.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>These losses, added to those sustained in the Peninsula and by 
General Pope's army, must make an aggregate in considerable over fifty 
thousand stand of arms, one hundred pieces of artillery, recently loss 
in operations in the east sufficient to thoroughly equip an army half 
as large as that now retreating into Virginia.  It is known that our 
losses of ordnance at Harper's Ferry was also very large, and that they 
were not destroyed previous to the surrender.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>These facts give point to a recent remark of General Ripley, Chief 
of Ordnance, who is said to have stated that he ought to be the ablest 
ordnance office in the world, as he was required to furnish arms enough 
to supply the enemy's army as well as his own.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i><b>LINCOLN'S EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION</b>.&#8212;The 
Memphis Bulletin, of the 30th ult, 
says:</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>We should be glad to hear Mr. Lincoln give a satisfactory answer to 
his own objection to his own proclamation, as stated a few days ago to 
the Chicago clergymen.  His objections were thus stated:</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>"What good," asked he, "would a proclamation of emancipation from me 
do, especially as we are now situated?  I do not want to issue a 
document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative, 
like the Pope's bull against the comet.  Would my word free the slaves 
when I cannot even enforce the Constitution in the rebel States?  Is 
there a single court or magistrate, or individual, that would be 
influenced by it there?  And what reason ss there 
to think it would have any greater effect upon the slaves than the late 
law of Congress, which I approved, and which offers protection and 
freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our lines.  Yet 
I cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come over to 
us.  And suppose they could be induced, by a proclamation of freedom 
from me, to throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them?  How 
can we feed and care for such a multitude?  Gen. Butler wrote me a few days since, that he 
was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than all 
the white troops under his command.  They eat and that is all.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>After the president answers these objections, we would like to have 
his explanation of the following resolution, passed unanimously by 
Congress the 11th day of February, 1861.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>Resolved, That neither Congress, nor the people, nor the Governments 
of the non-slave-holding States, have the right to legislation on or 
interfere with slavery in any of the slaveholding States of the 
Union.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>Finally, we would respectfully call his attention to his inaugural, 
delivered before the people's representatives at Washington, on the 4th 
of March, 1861:</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the 
institution of slavery in the States where it exists.  I believe I have 
no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so."</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>And then he goes on to say:</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>"Those who nominated and elected me did so with the full knowledge 
that I had made this and many similar declarations, and have never 
recanted them.  And more than this, they placed in the platform for my 
acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and 
emphatic resolution which I now read:</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>"Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the 
States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its 
own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is 
essential to the balance of power on which the perfection and endurance 
of our political fabric depends."</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>We regard the proclamation as unconstitutional and exceedingly ill 
timed.  It is calculated to do, we fear, immense mischief to Kentucky, 
Missouri, and Maryland, where important military events are on the 
taps.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>But our most serious objection to it is, that it destroys all we 
have ever said in defense of Mr. Lincoln's conservatism, and confirms 
the argument of that class of men South who have seceded from the Union 
on the ground that Mr. Lincoln was an abolitionist and would administer 
the government with a view to the overthrow of slavery.  There is to 
day, one universal shout in Dixie over the proclamation.  "I told you 
so," "I told you so," runs through the lines and the Union men in the 
slave States hang their heads in sorrow.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i><b>LINCOLN'S PROCLAMATION  &#8212;  A WARNING</b>.  &#8212;  
The Harrisburg (Pa.) "Union" says:  
We warn the revolutionists in time.  If they proceed in their purposes, 
let it be with their eyes open to all the consequences.  Before they 
succeed in abolishing slavery, in violation of the Constitution, and 
elevating the negro to their own level their revolution must meet and 
subdue a movement independent of, and different from the Southern 
rebellion&#8212;a movement whose object will be to maintain the Constitution 
inviolate and crush to the earth every rebel impious enough to raise 
his hand against it.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>There is little else talked of now amongst officers and soldiers, 
and at times their discussions become so heated that it requires the 
interference of friends to prevent a collision; in fact, hatred and 
bitterness are the necessary results of this unwarranted assumption of 
the President, and every day develops such dissatisfaction with a large 
portion of our army that fears are entertained as to the results.  
Already the soldiers are excited, and improve every opportunity to vent 
their indignation upon the hordes of negroes who are strutting the 
streets of Memphis, many of them wearing the uniforms of a soldier of 
the United States.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>War is a terrible revolutionizer of political sentiments, and among 
the soldiers, no matter what may have been their former political 
creeds, you can scarcely find one man who is an avowed abolitionist, or 
who does not look with alarm upon all emancipation schemes.  The test 
is now being applied, and the question comes directly home to everyone, 
and their future association and welfare are both in the issue.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>And further than this there is no use in disguising the fact, that 
the soldiers are getting tired of this war, and are becoming heartily 
sick of its management.</i></p></i></p>

noise."  He said it was very loud, not like the reports of cannon  &#8212;  
something like thunder, but there was no cloud.  Sister returned from

day.  We are called upon to thank God.  Yesterday evening a man came to 
our house to inquire if we would cook some rations for sick soldiers 
arrived from Winchester  &#8212;  he said that 2000 would be in town  &#8212;  
that they were occupying the Lecture rooms of the churches and the main 
buildings would probably be filled.  We, of course, agreed to have the 
provisions prepared, but the <u>flour</u> was 
not <u>sent</u>.  After supper I came down to 
the church to see the state of affairs.  Found the Lecture Room and 
church occupied  &#8212;  the carpet in a fair way to be ruined.  Went round 
through the storm to see if the other churches had been taken also  &#8212;  
only their Lecture Room in use.  Thus the building most liable to be 
irreparably injured (except the Episcopal Church) was taken.  Called 
upon all the officers here this morning.  &#8212;  they talk very fair.  
Troops still coming from Richmond, and going down the Valley.  Some 
movement must be anticipated in that quarter.  We find much 
entertainment in sister's children.  Nettie and Jinny very gentle  &#8212;

Winchester, or going into Eastern Virginia.  It is said that Jackson is 
to remain in the Valley.  Somewhere this side of Winchester.  Troops 
still going down.  Rumors of expeditions fitting out by the Yankees to 
attack Charleston, Mobile and Savannah.  &#8212;  These places will probably 
fall into the enemy's hands.  &#8212;  Frequent <u>squabbling</u> between the military officers here 
and citizens.  Mr. Baker prepared a paper to lay before the Secretary 
of War, in reference to the occupation of our church, complaining of 
the officers +c.  I signed the paper as a Trustee of the Church, not 
heartily, however, and subsequently induced Mr. Tinsley not to go to 
Richmond to present it.  Mr. Baker, however, had another for Gen. Jackson, and after a long discussion of the 
matter with him, I signed that, principally to please him.  I think the 
officers blamable, but the affair is rather too small a one to agitate 
while such issues are pending.</p></p>

French intervention.  They came from New York.  &#8212;  The two 
governments, it is said, will propose an armistice to the United 
States, with a view to negotiation, for peace; and if it is refused, 
the Southern Confederacy will be instantly recognised.  The governments named are 
apprehensive of servile insurrections, when Lincoln's emancipation 
proclamation takes effect, on the 1<sup>st</sup> of January next, and 
are solicitous for the safety of the subjects resident in the 
Confederacy.  Lord Lyons, the British Minister, was to sail on the

similar instructions to the representation of France.  These are the

of our church.  I regretted it exceedingly.  Last night J. H. Lacy, an 
aid of Gen. G. W. Smith, came up under 
orders to investigate the matter.  &#8212;  He came to see me this morning, 
and I explained my position and feelings.  Another letter from Mr. 
Stuart last night  &#8212;  he says Kentucky is joined to her idols.  I fear 
the State is really against us, and if so, how are we to agree upon a

capturing hogs, in Hardy, belonging to J. M. M<sup>c</sup>Cue  &#8212;  
captured him (M<sup>c</sup>C) but he escaped with loss of hat and wig.  
Some assert that a few Yankees are or have been, at Monterey, and there 
are none nearer.  Various small commands, at Warm Springs +c, have been 
notified by courier to try to intercept the enemy.  Much apprehension 
lest the Yankees get here.  Sister in a worry about getting home.  We 
know nothing definite as to the position of our army under Gen. Lee.  Jackson said to be about Winchester  
&#8212;  Lee in Culpeper.  Enemy pressing with large force towards Culpeper, 
from the Potomac.  Rumors of a fight in Culpeper a few days ago.  The 
late elections in the United States went against the Republicans, 
generally.  New York, New Jersey, Illinois + perhaps others, have gone 
with Pennsylvania, Ohio + Indiana for the opposition to Lincoln's 
administration.  Dont know what effect it will 
have upon the war.  All parties there seem to be in favor of 
prosecuting it.  In the mean time, the enemy are making vigorous 
efforts all around the board.  They have been operating in North 
Carolina, and an immediate attack upon Charleston, S. C., is expected.  A young man named Wade, from 
Montgomery, returning to the army, came to our house to see Sister last 
night.  We invited him to stay, and he slept in the parlour.</p><p class="p10">Afternoon.  &#8212;  The S.C. Cavalry

now to see after the enemy in the mountains.  They passed through town, 
and made a great display.  A report, brought from Winchester to-day, that an uprising has taken place in 
Maryland, and that Jackson has gone down that way.  The mountains west

from Shenandoah Mt. state that no Yankees have been there.  They are 
certainly coming into Pendleton, however, in considerable force.  It is 
now said that they did not get Glendy's hogs.  Extracts from Canada 
papers show that a belief prevails there that England and France are 
about to acknowledge our independence.  A Boston paper (the "Pilot") 
calls for peace.  Riots have occurred among the U. S. soldiers in Rhode Island and at Chicago.</p><p class="p10">Young Sherrer, who staid at our house last Spring, after the battle 
of Kernstown, called to see us last night and took dinner with us to-day.  He was wounded again at the battle of

that they have gone towards the Warm Springs.  The British Minister, 
Lord Lyons, has arrived at Washington, accompanied by Simon Cameron, 
late U. S. Minister to Russia.  The 
London Times says the British Secretary of War, in his speech against 
immediate intervention, spoke the sentiment of the Ministry; but report 
says that Cameron expresses the belief that England + France will 
interfere before long, and that the Confederates are fitting out 
vessels in British ports to attack New York city.  We have had various 
reports from the North of a Confederate navy brig under way in England  
&#8212;  of course our government does not divulge the pact, if the reports

had not been executed.  Many women and children left the place on

Fredericksburg.  Northern papers of last week claimed great credit for 
Burnside on account of his "change of base" from the Potomac to the 
Rappahannock  &#8212;  so expeditiously accomplished, they said, that Gen. Lee knew nothing about it till he was left 
far behind by their army, which was then probably at Hanover Junction!  
When they learned that Lee was at Fredericksburg, with a considerable 
part of his force, one of them or their cried out that there was 
treachery somewhere  &#8212;  that no sooner was the movement determined on 
at Washington, than Lee was in motion, before Burnside had struck a 
tent!  It is undoubtedly true that Gen. 
Lee anticipated the movement, but not likely that he received 
information from Washington.  Reported that the enemy are concentrating 
a large force at Suffolk, in Nansemond Co.

One of these captures, wearing red breeches and red cap has been

adds greatly to the hardship of the times.  As a consequence, theft and 
robbery are becoming common.  Port is selling at $20 per hundred.  I

that Gen. J. R. R. Cobb, of Georgia, was 
killed +c. +c.  Upon going to church to-
night, the crowd at the door was talking over the news brought 
by the Railroad passengers.  They stated that the enemy had been 
repulsed, as reported this morning, that Gen. Cobb had <u>not</u> 
been killed, but had lost a leg, and that a general engagement along a 
line of five or six miles was in progress to-
day.  As the Telegraph Office was opened again at 7 o'clock, 
P.M., I went down after church to enquire the news.  The operator 
informed me that he had not a word, except that the Richmond office had 
assured him since night that there was no fighting to-day.  Reported that Millroy is advancing with a 
large force from Moorfield, Hardy Co., 
towards Strasburg.</p></p>

at Fredericksburg, but a history will relate them in full, I need not 
mention them here.  We learned yesterday that the enemy had re-crossed 
the Rappahannock.  This movement is regarded as an acknowledgement of 
defeat.  The enemy are pressing in North Carolina, towards the 
Wilmington + Weldon Railroad, and Gen. 
Evans, with a small force, has been fighting them for several days.  A 
report yesterday that Gen. Jas. E. Johnston had recently had a 
successful battle with the enemy at Murfreesboro', Tennessee, (on

Md., bringing 35 prisoners, many horses

at Fredericksburg at 40,000  &#8212;  that the Washington Cabinet were 
quarreling amongst themselves  &#8212;  that Burnside had been rumored from 
the head of the Federal army and Fremont put in his place.  A rumor was 
current that a fight had occurred in New York, and 1500 people killed, 
in consequence of an attempt by Lincoln's officials to arrest John Van 
Buren.  A letter from Frederickburg states that Mrs. Lomax (Kitty's 
grandmother) returned to the town, after assurance was given that the 
place would not be fired into, and when the bombardment began, her 
brother, Mr. Presley Thornton, undertook to convey her to the basement 
of a neighbor's house, which was considered entirely safe  &#8212;  and the

&#8212;   were at Mt. Jackson, Shenandoah.  The papers received to-night give some interesting extracts from 
United States papers.  The latter are evidently very much discouraged 
by the result of the battle at Fredericksburg.  The New York "World" 
speaks right out and concedes the greatest defeat of the war.  It says:  
"Heaven help us!  There seems to be no help in man.  Our cause is 
perishing  &#8212;  hope after hope has vanished  &#8212;  and now the only 
prospect is the very blackness of despair."  A dispatch from 
Fredericksburg, dated 22<sup>nd</sup>, says that Seward has resigned, + 
the whole Yankee Cabinet will follow suit, that Halleck (commander-in-
chief) will be removed, and that Burnside will resign.  This is most 
too much of a good thing.</p><p class="p10">As an incident of the time I may mention that a milliner of this

published in the Richmond papers of yesterday.  There seems to be no 
doubt that Seward has tendered his resignation.  Wm. B. Reed, of Philadelphia, has written warmly 
advocating peace.  The last report from Millroy is; that he was moving

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I did some work this morning about one of my grape vines, and went 
down street about 10 o'clock.  Found sentinels, from the Provost 
Marshal's Guard, at the corners,  &#8212;  strange and sad change from the 
times we had only two years ago!  Upon joining a crowd near the 
Courthouse, I learned that the sentinels had, last night, assaulted 
citizens on the street, and ordered them not to pass unless they were 
going home.  We all agreed that it was a high-handed usurpation which 
should not be submitted to.  So John Baldwin wrote down Edwin 
Edmondson's statement of his aunt, shortly after 9 o'clock, and sent it 
with a note to Davidson, commander of the post, enquiring if the guard 
had acted in pursuance of orders, and if so whether the proceeding was 
to be continued to-night.  The note was 
signed in his reply that the Guard were inexperienced, and had 
misunderstood their instructions  &#8212;  notwithstanding the papers sent 
to him showed that the Provost Marshall was present at one of the 
public corners, and required the sentinel to use his gun when necessary 
to arrest passersby.</p><p class="p10">I feel a special jealously of the exercise of unnecessary military 
authority.  It is what we have most to fear at this time.  &#8212;  While 
fully sustaining the military in all lawful and necessary measures, 
every encroachment by them upon civil rights should be promptly 
resisted.</p><p class="p10">I brought Legh up to dinner.  We had Alick, Adeline, Sarah Warden, 
Mr + Mrs Baker, and Agnes + Augusta Tinsley.  Legh seemed rather low-
spirited, and left us abruptly just before dinner.  I have felt much 
troubled about the matter.  None of us knew he had left the house till 
we sat down to dinner.  Poor fellow, he has cause for depression.  The 
supply of rosin gave out at the Gas Works last night, and we have to 
get along with tallow candles.  I should have mentioned that Va's dinner was as good as she could have 
provided in peace times  &#8212;  Turkey, Old ham, spare-ribs, some cheese,

dispatch from Gen Bragg, saying:  "The enemy has <u>yielded his strong point</u>, and is falling back.  
We now occupy the whole field, and shall follow."  The "Dispatch" 
newspaper says:  "We learn from another source that the enemy is 
completely routed, and their communication with Nashville completely 
cut off."  It was reported this morning, by telegraph, that we had 
captured 5000 more prisoners.  There seems to be no reason to doubt 
that we have gained great advantages.  Gen Bragg says in his last 
dispatch, "God has granted us a happy New Year."  May He give us all 
hearts to praise and serve Him!  The movements down the Valley have 
attracted much attention  &#8212;  The public, of course, do not know the 
plan of operations.  All the soldiers that could be raised about here 
have gone down.  Some of the Post Officials, surgeons, +c, seem to 
regard the enterprise as a frolic.  I hope it may not prove a farce.  
The commander of the Post went down to-day in 
a buggy!  The remains of H. J. Crawford, who died in Petersburg on the

of entrenching tools +c.  Things do not look quite so favorable at 
Murfreesboro.  Gen. Bragg says on the 
2<sup>nd</sup>:  "The enemy retired last night but a short distance in 
rear of his former position."  A short and sharp contest occurred on 
the evening of the 2nd.  Gens. Wheeler 
and Wharton were again in the enemy's rear, on the 1<sup>st</sup>, and 
destroyed 200 loaded wagons.  The worst, however, is in a dispatch from 
Murfreesboro on the 3<sup>rd</sup> which says:  "The enemy, <u>in strong force, continue in position</u> about 
three miles of the town.  <u>Nashville has been 
reinforced</u>."  A majority of the heirs of Mr. Sowers' estate wish 
me to act as Administrator <u>de bonis non</u>

for us.  Was the enemy largely reinforced, or does Bragg run away from 
his victories?  That we had a great success is not doubted, but the 
causes of the last movement are entirely unknown.  New York papers 
state that their loss at Murfreesboro in killed and wounded was 30,000

should retreat, although it is said to have occurred after the battle 
of Perrysville, in Kentucky.  Gen. Bragg 
has a way of "falling back" after a victory.  The Yankee papers claim 
to have got the best of us at Murfreesboro; although they admit great 
losses.  The expedition down the Valley has come to nothing.  A 
skirmish took place at Moorfield, in Hardy county, and then our men 
"fell back."  I blame neither officers nor men  &#8212;  not wishing to sit 
by the fire and censure the operations of soldiers enduring the 
hardships of the field  &#8212;  but after the bright hopes entertained a 
few days ago there is a feeling of disappointment.  Rumors from the 
North of French interference again, to settle our troubles.  I see no 
prospect of our ever getting out of them until Europe does interfere.  
Lincoln's Proclamation, liberating the slaves, which has recently

<i>[deleted: cruel]</i> war has taken a victim from our family.  On Thursday, 
the 8<sup>th</sup>, I received a dispatch from Mr. Stuart, stating that 
Addy was dead, that his remains would be brought to Staunton, and 
requesting me to meet Sister in Lynchburg on Friday.  I felt that I had 
received a staggering blow, and oh! the overwhelming sympathy for his 
heart-broken mother  &#8212;  he her only son.  &#8212;  And such a son!  &#8212;  So 
obedient, affectionate, sympathizing  &#8212;  so upright, truthful and 
brave.  Before he was quite seventeen years of age he entered the army 
as an "orderly" to Col. Harry L. Edmundson 
of Roanoke Co.  The schools had been 
disbanded and he was left unemployed and without an associate, all the 
youths of Christiansburg about his age <i>[deleted: and older]</i>, being in 
the service.  He became so restless and unhappy, that when the 
comparatively safe and easy position alluded to was offered to him, his 
parents <i>[deleted: withdrew their]</i> allowed him to accept it.  He went 
through the Kentucky campaign, returned to Wytheville, Va., went thence with his regiment to Richmond, 
and soon afterwards to Petersburg.  From every point he wrote to his 
mother, cheering her up, and assuring her that he would be happy if he 
only knew she was not in trouble about him.  Again he wrote that the 
regiment was on the point of moving, he knew not whither  &#8212;  next, 
only four days afterwards, came a dispatch saying that he had died of 
pneumonia, after an illness of twenty-four hours, and his remains would 
be forwarded.  I met his mother at a hotel in Lynchburg.  Friday night, 
and returned with her to Staunton on Saturday  &#8212;  a most mournful 
journey.  Never can I forget that night as we sat in a dark room, she 
talking about her loved and loving boy, and I trying to comfort her.  
Mary, who came to Lynchburg with her mother, returned home next morning 
in the three o'clock train.  And there we sat in the dark, till she 
shivered with cold, and I persuaded her to lie down.  He was a son to 
love and be proud of.  He was cheerful, social, accommodating, 
conscientious and a universal favorite.  Long ago, he came forward, of 
his own accord; and made a profession of religion  &#8212;  recently, when 
about to march, he wrote to his mother, "I go cheerfully, trusting in 
God."  <i>[deleted: On one occasion, upon his mother, with tender solicitude 
inquiring as to his habit of prayer, he said, "Why Ma, I pray as I am 
going to school."]</i>  We have learned by telegraph to-day that in his last moments his mind was 
unclouded and hopeful.  He died at Franklin, N. C., on Blackwater River.  He was a universal 
favorite, for he was always ready to do a kind act, to whoever needed 
it.  His battalion was dismounted on a recent occasion and required to 
march on foot, owing to his position he was permitted to retain his 
horse, but he tendered it to a soldier who, he thought, was less able 
to walk than himself.  All his acquaintances, of every rank, have 
testified to his noble traits, and expressed affection for him.  But he 
is gone from us  &#8212;  God has ordered it so, and oh let us bow to His 
will.  His stricken mother broke forth into praise when she received 
the dispatch this morning, stating that in his last moments his mind 
was unclouded and hopeful.  Notwithstanding the arrangements I had made 
in Lynchburg, the remains passed through that place and went to 
Christiansburg.  They will arrive here to-
morrow evening.  It is painful to me to write these lines, but I 
want to have some tribute to the dear boy.  &#8212;  God grant that we all 
may have true faith in Christ and obedience to Him, so that we shall at 
last meet in heaven.  Mr. Stuart is at home, sick.</p></p>

from Mary, in which she told of Addy's last moments, as reported by 
young Maxwell, who accompanied the remains to Christiansburg.  Nothing 
troubled him but the thought of his mother's distress.  "It will kill 
Ma," he said, "but tell her that I trust in God, and am willing and not 
afraid to die."  To his father he sent word that he hoped to meet him 
in heaven.  Oh!  the grief and bereavement I feel at the loss of this

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A letter from Kate to Kitty to-night  &#8212;  
Says they arrived safely at Christiansburg, on Saturday.  The little 
children met them in the porch, with a very subdued look, not knowing 
whether it was proper to make any demonstration of joy.  Mary has 
fallen off, and is sad.  The house is still and sombre as if a corpse were in it.  Various things 
on the way reminded her of Addy, who was with her on the former trip to 
C.</p><p class="p10">I qualified to-day as Administrator <u>de bonis non</u> +c, of the late Mr. Sowers, 
executing a bond with penalty of $50,000.  My security are my two 
brothers and A. H. H. Stuart.  Alfred Sowers applied for 
administration, but as his sisters, who are a majority of the heirs, 
preferred me, and especially opposed him, the Court decided in my 
favor, after a wrangle at the bar.  I of course was not an applicant 
for the place, and I would have cheerfully declined it, if Alfred S. had proposed any one whom I could have 
recommended to his sisters.  I presume he has no opposition to me, but 
only wanted the office himself.</p><p class="p10">Some days ago we had a Northern report that 5000 of our men had been 
captured by Federalists at "Arkansas Post," in Arkansas.  It was 
disbelieved, as no one could tell anything about such a force at such a 
place.  But it now sees to have been true.  From the Northern news 
published in the Richmond papers of this morning, it seems that the 
Federal army was last week advancing again to cross the Rappahannock, 
near Fredericksburg.  Indeed, it is doubtful, as we hear nothing of it 
from our side.  Still some hopeful signs at the North.  The New Jersey 
Legislature has elected Wall to the U. 
S. Senate, who has recently been released from one of Lincoln's 
prisons.  The new Governor of that State, in his inaugural address, 
advocates peace  &#8212;  but, like all the others, does not give up the 
Union yet!!!  Reports from Europe, that the French Emperor is again 
moving for intervention.  &#8212;  England still holds back.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Horribly wintry day  &#8212;  another snow storm  &#8212;  began last night.  
No recent intelligence from the armies.  The bad weather has probably 
prevented another threatened attempt at Fredericksburg, unless, as is 
rumored or suspected, disaffection in the ranks of the enemy interferes 
with the movements against us.  A letter copied from the N. Y. Tribune, which denies that disaffection 
exists to any serious extent, furnishes the best proof I have of its 
existence.  It is said to be quite wide-spread among the Northwestern 
troops, particularly those from Illinois.  A great change has certainly 
taken place at the North  &#8212;  people are speaking out against 
Lincolnism and the war after a fashion which a few months ago would 
have promptly sent them to one of the military prisons.  Since the 
Governor of New York (Seymour) declared that there should be freedom of 
speech, and the new Governor of New Jersey (Parker) followed suit, 
tongues long tied have become glib again</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A general impression that the war will soon be over.  The signs from 
Illinois, Indiana, New York, New Jersey, certainly indicate a great 
reaction in those regions.  Many Yankee soldiers will go out of 
services in May (their terms of  enlistment expiring then), and it 
seems very doubtful if their places can be supplied.  Popular meetings 
in Illinois + Indiana have recently spoken out boldly for peace, 
denouncing Lincoln, and threatening themselves to cut loose from New 
England.  It was reported in Richmond yesterday that Commissioners from 
the Western States just named have arrived in that city  &#8212;  not so of 
course.  Reported to-day that the <u>Union</u> legislature of Ky. has ordered out 60,000 troops to resist 
Lincoln's proclamation.  How natural was poor Sister's feeling, that 
peace would make her grief more poignant!  Often does her account of 
Addy's leaving home the last time occur to me  &#8212;  "He looked so well," 
she said "and Oh, I kissed him over and over again."  May God comfort 
her.  We hear that Rev. Dr. Boyd was 
recently shot and instantly killed in Winchester, by a Yankee 
sentinel.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">L. P. Waller came up after dinner to-day, 
bringing a young man named Jones, from Kentucky, a Lieutenant in Gen. John H. Morgan's command.  He seems to be a 
very intelligent, and genteel youth.  I invited them to remain all the 
afternoon; they promised to return to supper, but sent a note excusing 
themselves.  Just before supper, J. H. Lacy came up, on his way from 
Richmond to Lexington.  He is one of Gen. 
G. W. Smith's Aids, and gave us some important 
intelligence.  Two of our gun boats at Charleston had gone out and 
attacked the blockading squadron, capturing one, sinking two and 
driving the others entirely off.  Thus the blockade of the harbor has 
been raised, and according to the law of nations, it is said, the port 
cannot be closed again for sixty days.  By order of Secretary Benjamin 
a steamer was immediately dispatched to Nassau, New Providence, to give 
notice that the port was open to neutral commerce.  A battle has 
occurred near Suffolk, in which we are said to have defeated the 
Yankees.  Gen. Wheeler has destroyed 
several more Federal steamers on the Cumberland.  The news altogether, 
especially that from Charleston, created quite an excitement, as was 
exhibited at Church.</p></p>

time, perhaps in a few days, at various points, particularly Vicksburg 
and Charleston; perhaps also at Savannah and Mobile.  The bad weather 
has prevented any movement opposite Fredericksburg.  &#8212;  The enemy has 
also a great army at Murfreesboro, Tenn., and smaller ones at various other 
points.  A crisis is evidently at hand.  &#8212;  No relaxation on the part 
of the North.  No signs of a termination of the war.</p><p class="p10">Mr. Stuart has determined to break up at Christiansburg, and bring 
his family to Staunton.  We have been much troubled as to how they are 
to be accommodated.  I have been under a cloud for some time past, and 
particularly to-day.  The affairs of the 
Sowers estate occupy much of my attention.  I am decidedly opposed to 
selling the real estate at this time, when the currency is so unsettled  
&#8212;  we may get larger prices, but what is the <u>money</u> worth?  This remains to be seen.  The

striking at intervals of four or five minutes.  <i>[deleted: I was sitting 
before the fire reading, and did not observe what Va was doing till the noise began, when she 
walked off, remarking that she left me "some music."  After enduring it 
till the nuisance became intolerable, I gave the hammer a twist, which 
prevented its striking the coil; but after I went to bed, I could still 
hear the wheels rapidly revolving, and all the machinery apparently 
doing its best to alarm the house as usual.  The occurrence was both 
amazing and ludicrous.]</i></p><p class="p10">No war news  &#8212;  the "Dispatch" decidedly dull.</p><p class="p10">Another snow storm to-day.  Tomorrow is the 
day appointed for the sale of Mr. Sowers' property, but if the weather 
continues bad, I shall postpone it till Monday.  Much talk for several 
days past about the supposed opposition to Lincolnism and the war, in 
the North and West.  Many indications go to show that there is a 
growing discontent in those regions; but a victory or two, especially 
the capture of Vicksburg by the Yankees, would bring the whole <u>nation</u> together again.  A letter from 
Christiansburg states that Sister and family expected to start to 
Staunton on Thursday next.  Va wrote 
immediately to tell them not to start till they heard of the arrival 
here of some few necessary articles of their furniture.  We have 
engaged rooms for them at the Academy, till they can get Alick's house, 
the 1<sup>st</sup> of May.  Another military enterprise against Midway, 
the Yankee General at Winchester, is on foot.  Gen Jones has moved from 
his quarters at, or near, New Market.  A forlorn regiment, or battalion 
came in to-day from Variety Springs, where 
they have been quartered for some time.  Some of the men had no 
overcoats, and some straw hats  &#8212;  decidedly out of season in a snow 
storm.  The horses are as woe-begone as 
their riders.  Lt. Col. Witcher

<p class="p12"><i><p class="p12"><i>FOR THE CENTRAL PRESBYTERIAN</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>Another Youthful Martyr.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>ADDISON WADDELL STUART, only son of the Rev. S. D. Stuart, of Christiansburg, died on 
Blackwater river, Southampton co., Va., 
on the 7th of January, 1863 of pneumonia, after an illness of twenty-
four hours.  He was seventeen years of age on the 21st day of December, 
1862.  In the month of September last, he entered the military service 
as Orderly to Col. Henry L. Edmondson, of 
Roanoke, and went through the Kentucky campaign under General Humphrey 
Marshall.  After the retreat to Virginia, he was stationed at 
Wytheville for a time; the battalion to which he belonged was then 
ordered to Richmond, and thence to Petersburg.  From the last named 
place, he wrote that the troops were on the point of moving, he knew 
not wither&#8212;the next intelligence concerning him, was a telegraphic 
dispatch announcing his death.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>The writer can hardly trust himself to speak of this dear boy, lest 
strangers suspect some exaggeration.  He was intelligent, cheerful 
social, universally popular, always ready to do a kind act to 
<i>[deleted: any]</i> <sup>every</sup> one, however humble.<a href="#n66">66</a>  While on the march, he would dismount and walk, 
that a soldier somewhat unwell might ride his horse.  Ever bright and 
happy, he was the light and joy of his home&#8212;the tender comforted of 
his oft-stricken mother&#8212;in the camp and on the march an example of 
cheerful endurance, shrinking from no hardship or danger.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>But the most consoling fact is, that he knew the God of his fathers, 
and was owned by Him as one of his children.  Early dedicated to God, 
as soon as he arrived at years of discretion, he publicly avowed his 
faith in Christ and united with the church.  His walk and conversation 
never belied his profession.  All men testify to his upright and 
conscientious life.  Not long before he was called hence, he wrote to 
his mother, when about to start on some expedition, "I go cheerfully, 
trusting in God."  Hiss illness was brief, but we have his dying 
testimony to the grace which alone can sustain in that trying hour.  
The thought of his mother's grief troubled him for a moment&#8212;"It will 
kill Ma," he said, "but tell her I trust in God and am willing and not 
afraid to die."  To his father he sent word that he hoped to meet him 
in Heaven.  Thus he peacefully fell asleep.  His short and happy life 
on earth is ended&#8212;he has passed from us like a beautiful vision&#8212;but 
he has entered upon a higher and happier service in Heaven.  For him 
there is nothing to regret.  On the evening of the 13th inst., his remains were laid in the cemetery at 
Staunton, near the grave of his grand-father (the late Dr. Addison 
Waddell) and by the side of a little sister who two years before 
departed in the triumphs of faith.  "Father, I will that they also, 
whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am."<a href="#n67">67</a></i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>This tribute to another young martyr is placed on record as a 
memorial of the devotion which characterises our whole people in the 
present cruel war, and especially as an humble testimonial to the 
faithfulness of God to those who trust in Him.  Thank God for such a 
life and such a death!  Blessed parents who have their most precious 
treasure&#8212;five lovely children&#8212;laid up in Heaven!</i></p></i></p>

division.  Our army seems to be coming away from Fredericksburg, as the 
Yankees on the other side of the river are leaving.  Things look rather 
dark.  Gen. Beauregard warns the non-
combatants to leave Charleston and Savannah, as he expects an attack 
upon one or both places.  The French Emperor has made a proposition to 
the United States for a consultation between the belligerents with a 
view to peace, to which Seward replies rather testily in the negative.  
The Rev. John Baker has just returned 
from New York city, where he went to send funds to his mother in 
Illinois.  He walked from New Market, Shenandoah co, to the Potomac, 
dodging Yankee camps; found wagons loaded with wheat crossing the river 
at a ferry, got into one of the wagons and went over unquestioned by 
soldiers.  Returning, had to cross the Potomac at a bridge, was 
arrested by the guard and taken before the Provost Marshall  &#8212;  
allowed to pass without search, bring sealed letters and $500 for the 
Fredericksburg people sent by one gentleman.  While in N. Y. and Brooklin saw a 
number of Southern people, but thinks the war will last for some time 
yet.  He bought three new shirts, and wore them all on his person.  
Mrs. Skinner's only woman servant has small pox, and the family is cut

Mr. Stuart's furniture has arrived by express.  Miserable weather for 
the family to move in.  To show the great increase in the price of all

soldiers' rations (for a day), formerly estimated at a little more than 
nine dollars, is now at market prices more than one hundred and twenty-

Vicksburg turned out untrue, unless the account we have to-night of some cannonading be a confirmation of 
it.  The Northern Congress has passed a conscript law and a finance 
bill, which together give Lincoln unlimited control of men and money in 
his dominions.  The Kentucky Legislature seems to have backed out from 
its movement for a peace Congress of the Western States.  The 
proposition was defeated in Illinois by the Republican (or Lincoln)

in fact the prices of all articles indicate either a time of famine, or 
an utterly ruinous depreciation of the currency.  Both causes are in 
operation.  A prospect for no wheat in this region next summer, and 
gold at a premium of $4 in Richmond  &#8212;  that is $5 Confederate 
currency are paid for $1 gold.  Fire wood is selling enormously high  -
-  whatever sellers choose to ask, and the necessities of buyers compel 
them to give.  Our man demands  &#8212;  and receives  &#8212;  $26 a wagon load.  
Hope I have made an arrangement for getting some wood tomorrow  &#8212;  
Borrowed a government wagon, and Legh is to send in two horses  &#8212;  Mr.

been very much urged by Mr. Wayt to become Administrator of T. C. 
Burnell's estate.  He said the widow and others interested desire it.  
I declined repeatedly, my time being fully overpaid; but finally agreed 
to undertake the business in connection with another person, and being 
requested to submit an appropriate, chose J. W. Hendren.  He agrees to 
serve.  So far as we have heard the Northern people are quietly 
submitting to Lincoln's domination  &#8212;  all the recent measures giving 
him entire control of their persons and property in the prosecution of 
the war.  A crisis in our affairs seems to have arrived.  We cannot 
submit to the Federalists without utter ruin  &#8212;  and how can we hold 
on much longer, as at present!</p><p class="p10">What a contrast between the condition of the country now and two

intelligence of the affair.  Reported that Gen. Jones' command is falling back to 
Harrisonburg  &#8212;  that the Yankees at Winchester have been largely

<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, April 17, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This day two years ago, the two military companies of Staunton left 
home for Harper's Ferry.  Then the war began.  Two long, eventful 
years.  Imboden started to the Northwest several days ago with his 
command, and got as far as M<sup>c</sup>Dowell, in Highland co., where 
an order from Gen. Jones overtook him, 
requiring him to return, as the enemy were believed to be coming up the 
Valley from towards Winchester.  It is thought to have been a false 
alarm, but Imboden is back at his old camp, and his enterprise, 
whatever it was is defeated for the present.  I met Lloyd Logan, of 
Winchester, this morning, and he gave me an account of the treatment of 
his wife and family by the Federal General Millroy.  Logan's house is 
said to be one of the most elegant in Winchester, and during his 
voluntary exile from home, on account of the presence of the enemy, his 
wife has had charge of the establishment.  Five Federal officers 
boarded with her during the Winter.  They were well-behaved gentlemen, 
and according to Logan, his wife succeeded in "demoralizing" them, 
converting them into good Southern men.  Two of the five resigned their 
commissions, and the remaining three declared their intention to quit 
the service.  In every case where officers boarded in respectable 
families, the same result followed.  Gen. 
Millroy, in consequence of this state of affairs, prohibited officers 
boarding in families and ordered them to their regiments.  Some days 
ago, a party of soldiers went to Logan's house and carried off a parcel 
of furniture, and one of his sons, a boy, offering some resistance, was 
sent to the guard house.  The next morning, before breakfast, an 
officer with a guard presented himself at the home, and notified Mrs. 
Logan to leave, as Gen. Millroy wished to 
use the place himself.  She remonstrated, refused to go, offered to 
give up part of the house; but the miserable tool of a petty tyrant 
informed her that she must go, by force, if necessary, not only out of 
the house but beyond the Federal lines.  She was closely watched during 
all her preparations for departure, not being alone for a moment.  In 
the mean while many citizens had gathered in the street, no one was 
permitted to enter the house.  &#8212;  Several gentlemen called on Millroy 
in behalf of the family, but he refused to revoke his order, assigning, 
as his only cause of complaint, that a prayer-meeting was held in the 
house on Fast Day.  This was not true, as the meeting was held in an 
adjoining house.  Mrs. Logan was allowed to bring with her some 
articles of female apparel and bed clothing  &#8212;  She <u>asked them</u> to bring a spoon for administering 
medicine to a sick child, and it was refused.  She asked permission to 
take a cup of sugar  &#8212;  it was denied  &#8212;  A small medicine box, and 
all private papers and money were taken from her.  An old servant 
woman, applied for the keys to get dinner for the family before they 
started, as they were prevented from eating breakfast  &#8212;  the officer 
refused the request, and the negro denounced him in terms more 
indignant than elegant.  One of the wretches dressed himself in a full 
suit of Logan's clothes, and asked his daughter how he looked in her 
father's attire.  She replied that he looked like a thief.  At 2 
o'clock, an old carriage and baggage wagon drove up to the door, the 
family were thrust in, including the boy brought from the guardhouse, 
and under escort of sixty soldiers brought out to Newtown.  Two of the 
officers who had boarded with Mrs. Logan, rode after her and wept like 
children on account of her treatment.  &#8212;  They told her to bear her 
trials patiently  &#8212;  that the North must soon give up the contest  &#8212;  
that they would not lift an arm again against the South  &#8212;  that they 
were determined the Northern people should know of Millroy's 
proceedings.  &#8212;  All the garden tools in Winchester have been 
collected by Yankee soldiers, to prevent the raising of vegetables.  
Farmers in the neighborhood are idle, having no horses and all the 
slaves being gone.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Our newspapers have been very hopeful for some days past, and the 
general feeling has been more buoyant than a week or two ago, although 
the intelligence which arrived Sunday evening, that five Federal 
gunboats had got past our batteries at Vicksburg, caused some 
depression.  The elevation of feeling has been produced by the failure 
of the Yankees at Charleston, and their general want of success; the 
negotiation of a Confederate loan in England, which is a pretty 
substantial acknowledgement of our independence by the capitalists of 
that country; and the revival of popular discontents in the Northern 
States, particularly with reference to the conscript law passed by the 
Washington Congress.  The latest reports from the North state that 
Lincoln has postponed indefinitely the execution of the law.  
Important, and, so far, encouraging movements have been in progress at

been taken for the transportation of troops.  Two companies stationed

yesterday's report of the affair in Hardy county, mentioned above, in 
the main.  Two companies of Yankee soldiers were captured, having 
surrendered only when the burning house was about to fall in upon them.  
Our loss was 5 or 6 killed, and 15 or 16 wounded.  Some of the Yankee 
wounded, as well as their dead, were consumed by the fire.  It was 
reported during the day that Gen. Jones 
had destroyed the tressle works on the 
Baltimore + Ohio Railroad at Cheat Mountain, and also captured 1000 
Yankees at New Creek.  Imboden writes again that he is prospering in 
the N. W.  But rations on the 
Rappahannock attract the chief attention.  It was communicated to me in 
profound confidence that a battle was raging, and we are getting the 
worst of it  &#8212;  this news was said to have come by Telegraph and was 
told as a secret by the operator to his friends.  The mail train 
arrived a little past the usual time, and a crowd of people rushed to 
the Depot.  I was first told by a man who had heard a passenger relate 
the news, that the enemy had taken the fords of the Rapidan, our forces 
having been worsted.  Next a passenger told me that Gen Stuart had 
repulsed the enemy at the Rapidan, that the Yankees had crossed below 
Fredericksburg, we had sustained some loss skirmishing; and that a 
great battle was expected to begin every hour.  A third person informed 
me that the Yankees had not approached the Rapidan, but were crossing 
the Rappahannock at Kelly's Fort, at Deep Run, and at Port Royal.  A 
great battle is at hand,  may God govern for us.</p></p>

Trevilian's Depot, nine miles below Gordonsville, and were destroying 
the Central Railroad.  The train which left Staunton this morning for 
Richmond, was stopped at Charlottesville.  Until the train returned 
late in the afternoon, we received no further intelligence.  Passengers 
then brought news that the Yankees, after doing what injury they could 
at Trevilian's, were proceeding towards Louisa C. H., when a party of our troops encountered 
and utterly annihilated them.  No intelligence whatever from 
Fredericksburg or thereabouts.  People in this neighborhood say they 
have heard great cannonading to-day.  Miss 
Agnes has felt much solicitude about Martha Wills, who lives near 
Trevilian's.  This evening, after the arrival of the cars, I 
encountered Mrs. Galt on the street and found her greatly disturbed by 
apprehensions for the safety of her three sons who are in the army, 
working +c.  I stood at the gate with her, trying to administer 
consolation.  This evening ninety-five Yankees captured at the church 
in Hardy, were brought in  &#8212;  an ill-looking set.  The weather has 
been delightful for several days past  &#8212;  Spring opening beautifully

arrived this evening, however, very different intelligence was 
received.  It is difficult to tell what was received, as there was a 
wild and confused map of rumors, suppositions, +c.  If any encounter 
took place between our troops and the enemy, it was a small affair.  
One report is that our cavalry were too much exhausted to pursue the 
enemy  &#8212;  another that Gen. Fitzhugh Lee 
is in pursuit.  The num- of the enemy was 
variously reported from one to eight thousand.  &#8212;  all cavalry.  They 
were said to be South of the Central Railroad at last accounts, but no 
body can tell where they were precisely.  Some persons are disposed to 
think that they are aiming for the James River Canal at Columbia, and 
the Southside Railroad at Farmville.  But at Charlottesville there was 
an expectation that they would come that way to destroy the Railroad 
bridge across the Rivanna; and the public stores were then removed to 
Lynchburg.  Some persons going off with their slaves +c, and the people

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">2 o'clock, P. M.  &#8212;  While we were enjoying the good news of last 
night, a dispatch came this morning, stating that 12,000 Yankees, 
cavalry and artillery, under Gen. Stoneham, were at Yanceyville, Louisa Co.  &#8212;  the same who made the raid upon the 
Railroad, and now returning from the James River Canal.  It is said 
that this division as they came on last week, took our cavalry entirely 
by surprise capturing 2000 of them and scattering the remainder.  &#8212;  
that Fitzhugh Lee with 500 men followed them, and fought them while 
they were breaking up the Railroad, but having such a superiority in 
numbers they were able to brush Lee off and go on with their work.  
Some apprehension that they may come this way.  The train did not come 
through from Richmond yesterday, and the information in regard to 
affairs on the Rappahannock, near Fredericksburg, is not direct enough 
to be satisfactory.</p><p class="p10"><u>Night</u>.  &#8212;  The cars arrived between 5 
+ 6 o'clock.  The first reports I heard were decidedly discouraging.  
As I came out of the office to inquire the news, I met S. H. Lushbaugh 
returning from the Railroad, and he informed me that the Yankees had 
the Richmond + Fredericksburg R. R. as 
well as the Central.  G. W. Booth, however, who came up from Lynchburg, 
gave a more favorable account of matters.  He stated that the enemy 
under Gen. Stoneham <sup>Stoneman</sup>  -
-  6000 strong  &#8212;  their headquarters at Louisa C. H., and that parties had been sent out to 
destroy Railroads +c.  One party went to the Canal, but did not succeed 
in their object; another was sent to the Richmond + Fredericksburg 
R. R., and captured one of our ambulance 
trains, approached within a short distance of Richmond +c +c.  But that 
these are the only Yankees on this side of the Rappahannock, and they 
are said to be surrounded by our troops.  Of course things looked 
bright again this evening.  Gen. Lee 
stated in his official dispatch that he gained a great victory, but 
says that Gen. Jackson was severely 
wounded.  Other accounts state that he was wounded in the arm, and did 
not leave the field.  Some members of the 5<sup>th</sup> Regiment, 
wounded in the recent battle, arrived this evening.  Beef sells at one 
dollar a pound, in market.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, May 6, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">My few additional particulars in regard to the recent great battle  
&#8212;  chiefly a repetition of the statement that we gained a decided 
victory.  But Gen. Jackson has lost his 
arm, the injury being so serious as to render amputation necessary.  
There is a report, not credited, that the Yankee commander in chief, 
"Fighting Joe Hooker," and all his staff have been captured.  No 
authentic information as to what has become of the Yankee cavalry on 
the Railroad  &#8212;  a report that they were making for Raccoon ford, in 
Culpeper.  We do not know certainly to what extent the Railroad has 
been injured.  Some of the party were captured quite near to Richmond.  
Reports from Jones' + Imboden's N. W. 
expedition, but the statements confused.  Northern accounts say that 
Jones had captured Clarksburg, and entered Pennsylvania  &#8212;  a part of 
his command has been in Morgantown.  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  A N. E. storm with heavy rains to-day which has suspended corn planting.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, May 7, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A man from Harrisonburg, told in the office this morning that the 
Yankees were coming up the Valley.  As the Telegraph has made no report 
of the fact, I thought it an idle rumor.  About 9 o'clock to-night, however, Jimmy Tate came in from the 
kitchen and told us that Wright said the Yankees were coming, a number 
of stages and many people having arrived in Harrisonburg.  I went down 
street immediately to ascertain the facts of the case.  Found Dr. L. 
Waddell at the American Hotel Hospital  &#8212;  he had come up with the 
sick soldiers from the Harrisonburg Hospital.  He said there were many 
rumors of the advance of the enemy, but he had no reliable information  
&#8212;  the road however was full of people with their cattle +c, flying 
before them.  We have a force of 800 men below Harrisonburg.  
Afterwards I learned that a dispatch had come stating that 2100 of the 
enemy (presumed to be cavalry) were nine miles blow Harrisonburg.  Passengers by the train this 
evening and the papers received repeat former reports as to our victory 
on the Rappahannock.  &#8212;  I go down street again to inquire the 
news.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday, May 8, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">2 o'clock, P. M.  &#8212;  Upon my second trip down street last night, I 
heard still more exciting reports.  The Yankees in large force,  &#8212;  
infantry, artillery and cavalry  &#8212;  were said to be advancing, and 
would probably reach Staunton by to-morrow.  
One of our clerks (C. N. K.) whom I met at the Telegraph Office, told 
me that the Yankees were recrossing the Rappahannock, and that another 
great battle would take place in a few days.  From his intimacy with 
the Operator, I thought it <u>possible</u> that 
some such official intelligence had been communicated to him.  Came 
home at near 12 o'clock, feeling rather anxious.  This morning there is 
no intelligence from the Rappahannock, and it is not probable that a 
routed army could rally so soon.  From the Valley we learn that the 
Yankees are going back towards Winchester.  The expedition may have 
been a reconnaisance to ascertain 
what force we had.  Forty-seven prisoners taken in the Northwest were 
brought in to-day.  It is reported that a 
large number of captured horses and cattle are at hand, having reached 
this county.  Reports + impressions of persons from army in that 
section are conflicting as to our operations.  We are said to have a 
large force there, now under command of Gen. Saml. Jones.  
(The other Jones is Wm).  but there is no 
very recent tidings as to movements.  Joe Ryan lost a leg at the 
Rappahannock, and Thomas or Charles Calhoun was badly wounded.  Oh may 
God arrest this carnage!</p><p class="p10"><u>Night</u>.  &#8212;  An army chaplain who left 
Richmond yesterday, I presume, reports that an 
other battle was anticipated on the Rappahannock  &#8212;  that one 
wing of the enemy was still on this side of the river, and that 
reinforcements had been received.  C. R. Mason, however, who arrived 
this evening, probably from Gordonsville, says that a portion of the 
enemy <u>were</u> on this side (or South) of the 
river, that a fight occurred on Wednesday, since when the enemy have 
been crossing over and going off.  It is said that Hood's division has 
joined Lee.  Charles Calhoun's leg and Joe Ryan's were <u>shot off</u>.  The horrors of the war!  For two 
long years blood has flowed, and hearts have been wrung with anguish.  
James Calhoun goes down tomorrow to see after his son.  At the first 
news of a battle for the last two years he has been promptly in town, 
and has generally gone immediately to the army.  The Central Railroad 
has been repaired, and the cars will go through to-morrow.  I fear that some of our soldiers have 
been pillaging in the N. W.  &#8212;  
committing downright robbery.  A set of silver has been sent to the 
wife of a Col. from town.  He doubtless 
<u>captured</u> it!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday, May 11, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A report of Gen. Jackson's death was 
current this morning, but most persons hoped that it was untrue.  
Between 1 + 2 o'clock, however, the Telegraph Operator stepped into the 
room where I was writing, and handed me a dispatch from the War 
Department at Richmond, to be sent to Lexington, announcing the fact.  
&#8212;  I could scarcely control my hand so as to write my name.  Universal 
lamentation.  Jackson was to us like Elijah to his people  &#8212;  "the 
chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof."<a href="#n68">68</a>  
News, also, of the death of James Calhoun.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, May 13, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">There seems to be no doubt, as at first reported, that Jackson 
received the wounds which caused his death, from our own men.  He had 
gone out reconnoitering after dark, and he and his staff were mistaken 
for a party of the enemy.  Never was there a more universal lamentation 
among any people than this event has caused.  He was a man of 
remarkable singleness of purpose, fearing God and naught else.  Yet 
before the war he was almost a <u>butt</u> in 
the society at Lexington  &#8212;  a good deal laughed at for some 
peculiarities  &#8212;  although, at the same time, respected as a sincere, 
good man.  For some years he was unable to keep awake during preaching, 
but slept in his pew, sitting, perfectly erect, which was a subject of 
much merrimaking.  But behind it all 
there was a feeling of respect for the man.  &#8212;  James Calhoun arrived 
this evening with the remains of Charles, rejoicing in the midst of his 
grief that his son died in the faith of the Gospel.  One or more other 
corpses were brought on the same train  &#8212;  the slain have been coming 
ever since the battle, as well as the wounded.  How the heart sickens 
at this carnage  &#8212;  yet we are hardened to it, and do not feel it as I 
would have anticipated.  Persons from Shenandoah give some particulars 
of the recent advance of the enemy through that county.  They were 
about 2000 in number, and came only a mile this side of New Market.  
All accounts state that they were very <u>timid</u>, and suddenly hurried back, upon 
receiving intelligence by couriers from Winchester, the officers not 
waiting to eat the dinner that was preparing.  Some of the Yankees 
slept in a building formerly used as a Hospital, at New Market, and 
during the night the citizens were alarmed by wild shrieks which came 
from the building.  Next morning some of the Yankees told that they had 
seen ghosts!  This is related by a Lutheran minister from the vicinity.  
A rumor to-day that Imboden has met with some 
disaster.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, May 14, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The Northern papers of the 11th report that their Gen. Keyes has captured Richmond!  Further 
rumors from N. W. Va, but nothing reliable of recent date.  It is 
said that a portion of our troops behaved outrageously, robbing the 
people indiscriminately, or rather that our own friends were the 
principal sufferers, as the Federalists ran away with all their movable 
property.  At the late battle of the Wilderness, on the Rappahannock, a 
South Carolina Brigade, which was lying down, was ordered to charge a 
battery or breastwork of the enemy, but refused to move.  The General 
in command asked what Brigade was just behind them, and being told it 
was the "Stonewall," said:  That's the one I want.  It was ordered 
forward, and rushed over the prostrate Carolinians, carried the day 
after a desperate struggle.  In this affair Chas. Calhoun, Joe Ryan and so many others 
fell.</p><p class="p10"><i>[deleted: (I am not certain that the above story is entirely 
true.)]</i></p><p class="p10">Joe says it is true, but he was not wounded there</p><p class="p10">The following account of the recent great battle on the Rappahannock 
is considered the best that has yet appeared.  &#8212;  The tribute to the 
conduct of our men, coming from an enemy while the war is still raging, 
is remarkable.  &#8212;</p><p class="p10"><a href="images/waddell18630514a.jpg"><br><br><center><img src="images/waddell18630514a.gif"></center></a><br><p class="p11"><b>"Latest News from the North.

<p class="p11"><b>Monday morning, May 18, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Northern reports received yesterday evening, state that Vallandigham 
has been sentenced by Court Marshal in Ohio, to confinement at Tortugas 
as for two years.<a href="#n69">69</a>  He is Democratic 
candidate for Governor, and his offence is 
opposition to the war policy of the Administration.  For words uttered 
in a public speech, he was arrested by a company of soldiers, and tried 
for his life, I believe.  There was some popular disturbance in the 
town and county where he resided  &#8212;  a riot +c  &#8212;  but so far as now 
appears the people <u>submit</u> to any tyranny.  
Every vestige of civil liberty seems to be gone in most of the Northern 
States.  New York and New Jersey claim to be the only free States left  
&#8212;  they have opposition Governors.  Much anxiety is felt in regard to 
affairs in Mississippi.  Some days ago the newspapers reported that the 
enemy had possession of Raymond, having advanced from Grand Sulphur, 
and a more recent rumor says they have captured Jackson, the capital of 
the State.  If this be so Vicksburg must fall, so far as we can see.  
Jas. N. Skinner writes to his mother that in 
the late battle on the Rappahannock, disparity was so great.  A rumor 
this morning that Gen. Hood has crossed to 
the North bank of the Rappahannock.<a href="#n70">70</a></p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, May 20, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Bad news from Mississippi!  Gen. 
Johnston telegraphs to Richmond that Gen. 
Pemberton, after a fight of nine hours, had to retreat across the Big 
Black, towards Vicksburg.  &#8212;  That town is therefore in a state of 
siege by land and water, and unless Johnston has a force this side to 
prevent it, the fall of the place is inevitable.  Alas!  alas!  The 
enemy under Grant have been to Jackson and done as they pleased.  
Edward Waddell came up to supper this evening.  He returns to the army 
next week.  Poor fellow, he is sadly disappointed.  He has been in the 
army since the very beginning of the war, was at last first Sergeant of 
his company  &#8212;  West Augusta Guard (Co. 
L. 5<sup>th</sup> Reg), and was hoping for a Lieutenancy, but learned 
that an election had taken place when many members were absent, and 
another man had been chosen.  Promotion does not run our way.  From all 
accounts he is a good soldier.  Joe Ryan arrived yesterday  &#8212;  
complains of great pain at times in the sole of his amputated foot  &#8212;  
as if some one were cutting it with a knife.  &#8212;  Gen. Jenkins' Brigade of cavalry is collecting 
here, and an inspection takes place to-
morrow, near town.  Jenkins is to command in the Valley, Jones, 
and perhaps Imboden having been ordered to join Gen. Lee.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday, May 23, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The news from Mississippi is very unintelligible  &#8212;  I cannot 
understand whether there has been one or two battles.  Perhaps there 
has been a series of fights.  The Richmond papers speak encouragingly 
as to the result, and Col. Preston, of 
Lexington, who was at our house last night, just from Richmond, says a 
gentleman who had come from an interview with the President and several 
members of the Cabinet, informed him that our authorities felt 
confidant  &#8212;  that they did not expect to hold Jackson longer than the 
1<sup>st</sup> of January last, and that Vicksburg being prepared for a 
six months' siege, it would be able to hold out till the Federalists 
would be compelled to suspend operations by the coming on of the Sickly 
Season  &#8212;  that as Grant did not occupy Jackson till the middle of 
May, he would have the less time for the reduction of Vicksburg.  
Preston is generally more hopeful as to the termination of the war, 
than most people about here have been.  Thousands of Yankee soldiers 
are going home, their terms of enlistment having expired, and no troops 
(new <i>[illeg.]</i>) are ready to take their places.  Lincoln is however 
carrying it with a high hand in the North, and so far he meets with 
slight resistance from the people.  A great meeting was held in New 
York city a few days ago to denounce the proceedings against 
Vallandigham.  Reported yesterday that he (Vallandigham) had been 
sentenced to confinement in Fort Lafayette during the war.  We hear of 
no popular commotions in Ohio in consequence of the sentence.  Matters 
are getting rather worse with us in regard to the means of living.  A 
few days ago I purchased a fore-quarter of veal for $13.50; which makes 
the whole calf, a little over four weeks old, come to about $70.  For a 
pair of common cotton pantaloons, formerly costing $1.50 to $2.00, I 
have paid $12.  At these rates my money will be exhausted very soon.  
Can get no pasture for my cow, and as we now have a dry <u>spell</u>, she can pick up very little on the 
common.  Had a cup of genuine coffee recently.  Va, had saved a little, and brought it out for 
company.  Tate was in town day before yesterday.  He seems rather 
disgusted with N. W. Virginia.  He gives 
a ludicrous account of some scenes he witnessed  &#8212;  a council of war 
+c.  About 3000 cattle were brought off  &#8212;  the country affords 
nothing else.  Gen. Jones has come back to 
the Valley.  Imboden was reported to be at the Warm Springs a day or 
two ago.</p><p class="p10">Night.  &#8212;  Very gloomy news from Mississippi.  &#8212;  No heart for

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, May 27, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The reports from Vicksburg, received this evening, are still more 
encouraging than the above.  According to rumor we have captured 17,000 
Federalists there, and killed 10,000.  These figures are doubtless too 
high.  Reports from the South West are generally confused and 
unreliable.  If the Yankees are compelled to abandon their attempt upon 
Vicksburg, we may hope for a termination of the war before very many 
months.  It is rumored that Gen. Stuart 
has started upon another raid.  Imboden's Brigade is at Stribling's 
Springs to-night.  Jenkin's, which has been 
collecting in this vicinity for some days past, leaves to-morrow  &#8212;  moving down the Valley.  A large 
number of women and children from N. W. 
Va arrived in town last night  &#8212;  about 
sixty.  They were sent off by the Yankee authorities for sympathizing 
with the South, and were allowed to bring only necessary wearing 
apparel and a hundred dollars each.  Some of our soldiers from the 
N. W.  Now, I hear, that they will 
never taken another Yankee <u>prisoner</u>.  A 
small batch of prisoners captured in the N. 
W. were brought in to-day.  A dispatch 
from Tullahoma, Tenn., published in 
to-day's papers, says that Vallandigham has 
been brought under guard to a point between the two armies and turned 
loose.  Northern papers had reported previously that the sentence of 
the military court had been changed by Lincoln to banishment South.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, May 29, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Bloody fighting around Vicksburg still reported.  Gen. Johnston sends word that we are holding our 
own, and all the reports from our side are encouraging; but we have not 
seen the end yet, and there is room for anxiety.  The effluria from the 
Yankee dead, has filled the atmosphere, so that tar has been burned in 
Vicksburg, so said.  Northern accounts, on the other hand  &#8212;  not so 
late as ours  &#8212;  represent affairs as highly favorable for Yankees.  
The peace men in New York seem to be putting forth more vigorous 
efforts.  Our papers are discussing the question as to how Vallandigham 
shall be treated.  Doubtless we should regard him as a citizen of a 
country at war with us, and therefore as an alien enemy; but being here 
under such circumstances, the rights of humanity should be extended to 
him.  He should neither be detained as a prisoner, nor honored as a 
guest, but allowed to pass through the county to any neutral ground he 
may select.  The accounts of refugees from N. 
W. Va of the barbarities practiced 
upon our friends in that region, are shocking.  I could begin to 
recount them.  It is generally thought that Gen. Lee is on the point of some important 
movement.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, June 2, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The fate of Vicksburg still undecided.  No news from there for 
several days  &#8212;  indeed any intelligence at all reliable is generally 
about a week behind hand.  Our last reports stated that the Yankees had 
been repulsed, and a dispatch <u>via</u> Mobile, 
received here on Sunday, said that Grant had fallen back and was 
entrenching.  Since then we have not received a word more.  Reports 
from the North, which came by the Richmond papers this evening, admit 
the repulses of Grant's army with heavy loss, on Friday, 22nd of April, 
and there is a rumor said to have come from a Federal officer on James 
River, that Grant has been killed.  Northern papers had it a few days 
ago that Vicksburg was captured  &#8212;  now they say it will require a 
week to reduce the place.  A dispatch from Fredericksburg says that the 
Yankee officer who came across in the flag of truce boat, refused to 
exchange papers with our men, from which it is inferred there is 
something in their papers they do not wish us to see.  Betty Lyle 
writes from Wetumpka to Virginia that Oscola Kyle, now Lt. Col. of the 46<sup>th</sup> 
Alabama Regiment, was taken prisoner at Grand Gulf.  It was a great 
relief to Va and her mother + sister to 
hear he was not killed.  Weather very dry, and very windy yesterday and 
day before.  Prices still going up.  A calf eight or ten weeks old will 
bring from $80 to $100.  A cow + calf bring from $250 to $500.  The

in his Northwestern excursion, returned to-day

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, June 3, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The papers of this morning have a dispatch dated Jackson, Miss., on the 1<sup>st</sup> inst.  It states that on Thursday last Grant sent a 
demand for the surrender of Vicksburg in three days, which was refused.  
(We had supposed that he was hardly in condition to make such a 
demand); that one corps of the Federal army was demoralized and refused 
to renew the assault on Saturday (one of the papers has it the whole 
Federal army); that the Federal loss is from 25,000 to 30,000, 
including five Generals killed.  It is also stated that Port Hudson has 
been invested.  I feel little doubt that 
the enemy will ultimately take both places.  We have not the means of 
resisting the hordes they are able to bring against us in that quarter.  
Reported, however; that Gen. Johnston, who 
is on or near the outskirts of Grant's army, is receiving 
reinforcements from Charleston.  A reported 
to-day that Stuart with 40,000 cavalry had 
started on a raid in Pennsylvania  &#8212;  It is hardly possible that he 
can muster 20,000.  A more authentic report is, that a cavalry review 
will come off to-morrow in Culpeper.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">No Railroad train from Richmond this evening,  &#8212;  Reason not given, 
but it is presumed that Gen. Lee's army is 
moving.  This is indicated by various other facts.  It is believed that 
Lee is advancing North of the Rappahannock by way of Culpeper.  For 
some time past our cavalry have been assembling at Culpeper C. H. and a grand review was to have taken 
place yesterday.  Yesterday and day before persons in different and 
remote parts of this county heard cannonading.  A rumor to-day that it was the shelling out of a party of 
deserters who for some time past have occupied "Shiflet's Hollow," in 
Rockingham.  Gen. Trimble is coming to the 
Valley to take command.  News from Vicksburg very unsatisfactory  &#8212;  
often unintelligible as given by Telegraph, but there is now a general 
feeling of security in reference to affairs at that point.  I, however, 
never feel that all is safe till we have heard the end of the matter.  
Religion seems to be prospering in our army of the Rappahannock  &#8212;  
quite a revival.  At prayer meeting this evening Mr. Baker read 
extracts from letters received from Chaplains and from two young men of 
this place who have lately professed conversion.  I have felt this 
evening that if God would grant to us a universal awakening and 
revival, it would be better than the peace we desire so much.  Five of 
our town youths belonging to the army have lately united with the 
church  &#8212;  several of them heretofore decidedly unpromising.  To-morrow is communion day  &#8212;  D<sup>r</sup>. 
M<sup>c</sup>Farland preached this morning.  Gardens and fields 
(particularly oats and grass) beginning to suffer for want of rain.  A 
heavy shower yesterday South of town.  Locusts have been very numerous 
and noisy for a week past.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Passengers by the freight train yesterday morning brought a report 
that the Yankees had been signally repulsed at Port Hudson.  The mail 
train arrived in the evening, bringing the same report.  There is 
nothing more definite or authentic to-day.  
The rumors, by way of Mobile, and none later than the 1<sup>st</sup>, 
are numerous and conflicting.  One States that Gen. Banks (Federal) lost an arm, another that 
Gen. Sherman (Fed) was killed.  One that all of Banks' army 
(40,000) were destroyed except 3000; another that 3000 men were killed 
+c.  The Yankees, it is said, placed their negro troops in front when 
the attack was made, and vast numbers of them were slain.  Most of 
these reports purport to have been brought from New Orleans by 
Confederate Officers lately discharged on parole.  From Vicksburg, we 
hear of further fighting, but all accounts of recent transactions are 
confused and brief.  It seems probable that Grant has set down to a 
regular siege.</p><p class="p10">It appears to be settled at last that Gen. Lee is advancing by way of Culpeper.  Rumor 
says a portion of his army was moving to-day 
from Culpeper C. H. towards Sperryville, 
in Rappahannock Co.  A considerable force 
of Yankees came across the Rappahannock near Fredericksburg a few days 
ago.  But were frightened back.  Weather still dry + very cool  &#8212;  
threatening frost.</p></p>

yesterday, in Culpeper Co, very 
unexpectedly to us here.  We have <sup>not</sup> received a full 
account of the affair, but, from the reports, we got rather the worst 
of it, losing 600 men taken prisoners, although capturing 300 of the 
enemy.  &#8212;  The Federalists seem to have been advancing, as the reports 
state that they were driven back.  Our troops under Gen. Jones, late of the Valley, were 
surprised!</p></p>

received from our side.  The Yankees say that Vicksburg is in extremity 
and must soon surrender, while the Richmond papers state that our 
soldiers in the besieged town a confident of 
success.  Rumored this evening that Gen. 
Ewell's corps was near Winchester, en route for Pennsylvania.  Steps 
have been taken to call our 8000 militia by the 1st of August next.  
Further accounts of the fight in Culpeper on Tuesday, show that we had 
the advantage in the end, although suffering heavy loss.  &#8212;  It would 
seem that Jones' Brigade was not more surprised than our other

Yankees at that place  &#8212;  the entire force, except the cavalry  &#8212;  
and also a Brigade coming up to reinforce them.  The number is stated 
at seven thousand.  Milroy, according to rumor, had not been captured, 
but was supposed to be lurking in the town.  All this is received with 
many grains of allowance.  It is evident from the large amounts of 
ordnance and other stores to be brought to Staunton, that the Valley 
will be the scene of protracted operations.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Passengers from Winchester state that our army had crossed the 
Potomac into Maryland, at three points.  &#8212;  All of the Yankees at 
Winchester, except Millroy and his body-guard were captured.  The 
number is given as 5000.  A rumor has it, however, that Milroy had been 
captured, and is confined in Charleston jail, while his wife is in 
Martinsburg jail!  A stuttering soldier at the stage office asserted, 
on the other hand, that he knew positively that the wife had gone to 
Ohio six weeks ago.  Gen. Lee, with 
another portion of our army, has disappeared somewhere, and it is not 
known when or where he will turn up.  Longstreet and his corps are 
cooperating with Ewell across the Potomac.  These movements are 
wonderful  &#8212;  so rapid and secret.  &#8212;  The Richmond train has not

the enemy attacked a wagon train belonging to Longstreet's Corps (it is 
presumed), but we happened to have a guard of three Brigades, and the 
Yankees were handled rather roughly.  We took 400 prisoners  &#8212;  So 
said.  The prisoners captured in the lower Valley are footing it up the

went down the Valley to-day.  A great hubbub 
has lately been going on in the Northwestern States, on account of the

<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, June 22, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">About 10 o'clock upwards of sixteen hundred Yankees taken at 
Winchester, arrived.  They were guarded by the 58<sup>th</sup> Va Regiment, of which Jim M<sup>c</sup>Clung is 
Quartermaster.  The Yankees seemed to be very cheerful  &#8212;  several of 
them, upon being taunted with their getting to Richmond at last, said 
they were going just as they wanted to go.  They seemed to have none of 
the feelings of captured robbers as they are.  Some of them sold their 
overcoats, blankets +c, which were bought by our people for their 
servants.  The prisoners were much better clad then their captors who 
guarded them.  They were immediately put aboard the cars, and started 
for Richmond in the evening.  Extracts from Northern papers, published 
in the Richmond journals, show a wild excitement in Yankee land on 
account of Lee's anticipated invasion.  Lincoln has called for 100,000 
six months men.  New York, Philadelphia +c are in a blaze.  Large 
numbers of men hastily off to Harrisburg, which is presumed to be the 
point aimed at by "the rebels."  Alarm bells were rung at midnight in 
Brooklyn.  Some of our cavalry have certainly been at Chambersburg, Pa.  
Oh that the Yankee advocates of this war may <i>[deleted: feel]</i> experience 
at their own firesides and in their own persons some of the horrors 
they have inflicted upon us!  Perhaps they will then be more disposed 
to desist from their attempt to subjugate or devastate our country.  
They say that our cavalry at Chambersburg respect private property  &#8212;  
Mrs. Milroy went off from Winchester several weeks ago, with trunks 
filled with the spoils of our citizens.  They have destroyed crops, and 
even burnt agricultural implements, in order to produce starvation.  
The Yankees who arrived to-day belonged to 
five or six different Regiments, from Maryland, N. W. Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio and 
Connecticut.  Large numbers of our soldiers have been passing through 
town for several days past  &#8212;  coming up by Railroad, and going down 
the Valley a foot.  Most of them are from the various hospitals.  I was 
engaged the greater part of to-day in issuing 
clothing to such of them as needed it.  They were from every State in 
the Confederacy  &#8212;  Va., North Carolina, 
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas and 
Arkansas  &#8212;  I was struck with the depressed appearance of most of 
them, and upon mentioning it to one of the officers in charge of a 
squad, he said they were just recovering from sickness.  But they 
seemed <u>cowed</u>  &#8212;  like men who had been 
disciplined into complete subjection.  Such is the effect of military 
authority.  It hurts my feelings to see some of the poor fellows enter 
the office and approach any of us whom they imagine to be superior to 
them in rank, with all the deference of a slave to his master.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Nineteen hundred (1900) more Yankee prisoners were brought up to the 
vicinity of town to-day, and a part of them 
sent off to Richmond by Railroad this evening.  The remainder will 
leave to-morrow morning.  They certainly 
will think from the eagerness of some of our people to purchase their 
overcoats and blankets that we are very destitute of such articles.  &#8212;  
Many boys were selling bread and cakes to them, <sup>at high 
prices</sup>  I have never spoken to one of them, feeling too much 
detestation of the vandals.  These are the wretches who would have come 
to invade our homes, if it had been possible.  The Richmond papers Say 
that Gen. Kirby Smith has taken Millikin's 
Bend, 25 miles above Vicksburg, which cuts off Grant's supplies, and 
that he must therefore give up before long.  &#8212;  Jim M<sup>c</sup>Clung 
came up to-night with a dispatch just 
received from Richmond, stating that the Yankees made another assault 
upon Vicksburg on Saturday, and were repulsed with great slaughter, and 
that it was reported they were leaving.  As usual we are entirely 
ignorant as to the movements of Gen. Lee's 
army.</p><p class="p10">While the Yankees occupied Stafford county, a little girl four years

who were brought in to-day were better looking

Still they  invaders of our homes.  The Richmond 
papers of to-day publish the reports we heard 
last night of the great slaughter of Yankees at Vicksburg on Saturday.  
An order has been received here for the mustering of all

(16) and fifty five (55), not in Confederate service.  <sup>A</sup> 
Similar order has been sent to all the larger <u>towns</u> in the State.  I saw, this morning four 
young men who were among the "registered enemies of the United States," 
sent from their homes in New Orleans.  They say that from 15000 to 
20000 persons, including women and children, left the city in pursuance 
of the order of Banks, and the number was so great that the order was 
recalled to prevent the depopulation of the place.  These young men are 
going to join <i>[deleted: the]</i> our army.  No intelligence from Gen. Lee.  &#8212;  As the Yankee prisoners were 
passing down the street yesterday, one of them, probably seeing some of 
our crippled soldiers, asked if there was a wooden-leg factory here  &#8212;  
A person on the street replied:  "You met one wooden-leg man down the 
Valley"  &#8212;  Gen Ewell.  Selena and our other servants hurried down to 
the lower street yesterday to see the prisoners, when one of them 
called to her  &#8212;  "Well, what do you think of the Yankees?  &#8212;  Did'nt you think they had horns?"  The guard of the 
prisoners, a North Carolina Regiment, although generally dirty and in 
some instances ragged, looked stouter + more hardy than the Yankees.  
Several of our poor fellows were bare-footed.  One strapping youth 
marched in alone, away behind the crowd, without shoes or stockings, 
the tops of his feet being black as if scorched.  He lagged behind in 
the same manner, as the guard retired, walking very 
tenderly.  I understand that Judge Thompson now declares the war is 
virtually over!</p></p>

Richmond.  These were captured in a recent fight near Aldie, Loudoun 
Co.  The whole number was upwards of 600, 
but only 500 arrived, the remainder having been allowed by a very 
negligent guard to escape.  &#8212;  Most of them belonged to a cavalry 
regiment from Rhode Island, and were very small, ill-looking men.  A 
number of <u>female</u> Yankee camp followers 
have been brought up from Winchester and sent to Richmond to pass 
beyond our lines.  &#8212;  Reports to-day of an 
affair in Loudoun, in which three of our cavalry regiments suffered 
very severely.  Wade Heiskell arrived last night from Philadelphia.  He

as our troops were entering on the other side.  The Provost Marshall 
(Confederate) gave him a pass to come on.  He is a sanguine man, and

arrived this week, is 4321, including 45 women and children!  <sup>1000 
to 1100 sick and wounded in the Hospital at Winchester</sup>  Some 4 or 
six negroes were in the crowd this morning  &#8212;  one of them a women  &#8212;  
and several wore Yankee uniforms.  Sundry rumors to-
day  &#8212;  First that a <u>rising</u> had 
taken place in Baltimore, and the Mayor killed  &#8212;  I do not remember 
how often we have had similar reports.  &#8212;  Second that a portion of 
our army was in Harrisburg, Pa., and had burnt the public buildings  &#8212;  
this brought by a traveler from Winchester  &#8212;  Rather long in coming 
considering we have telegraphic communication with W.  Third that the Yankees were at Hanover 
Junction, near Richmond.  This is the most probable report, as the 
Richmond papers of this morning state that several thousand Yankees had 
landed on the Pamunky or in that region.  A 
number of persons from this region, who followed the army into Maryland 
to procure goods, have returned.  They say that our soldiers have taken 
large numbers of very superior horses, cattle +c in Pennsylvania.  
Plenty of goods in Maryland and prices very low  &#8212;  as it seems to us.  
Our cavalry would meet men riding along the road in Pa, and take their horses, leaving their 
own if they were worn out.  A young man named Maxwell, who was with 
Addy Stuart in his last illness spent last night at Mr. Stuart's.  
Sister was highly gratified to see him, but his account of the dear boy 
proved the flood-gate of her feelings again.  Maxwell has been 
transferred to Gen. Lee's army, and was in 
town on his way down.  While loitering about the town, not dreaming 
that Mr. S's family now lived here, he was attracted by the sight of 
Mr. S. on his porch, having seen him in Christiansburg when he took the 
remains home.  Sister being here at the time, did not see him.  Among 
other things he told of Addy was the manner of his becoming acquainted 
with him, which shows the generous spirit which always characterised him.  When their command was 
encamped in S.W.Va, Maxwell and an 
associate started off on an excursion, without leave of absence.  Addy 
had gone somewhere in company with the Colonel, and while separated 
from him, perceiving these young men in the road, rode after them, and 
when he got near enough called to warn them that the Col. was coming.  As they did not know him and 
thought it was some one who was drunk, they went on, when he pushed 
forward till he overtook them, and then gave them such information as 
saved them from punishment.  Maxwell says he was so impressed with the 
kindness of the act that he sought his acquaintance immediately.  He 
(M) is from Missouri, and says his mother 
does not know what has become of him.  &#8212;  He is something of an

regiments of cavalry, came up to the Central RR. yesterday, between the Junction and Hanover 
C.H., and burnt the bridge across the 
South Anna river.  The Eastern train arrived late this evening, and it 
is said that passengers came through from Richmond, coming to the 
Junction on the Fredericksburg R.R.  A 
fight is reported on yesterday, in which we lost 60 killed and wounded, 
but the Yankees were driven back.  A large force of Yankees was 
reported at the White Horse York River.  "They say" 
Gen. D. P. Hill's troops have arrived in

in Pennsylvania.  We really know nothing as to the position and recent 
movements of our army, nor of Hooker's.  The main body of our cavalry, 
under Stuart, has been fighting constantly on the Va side of the Potomac.  More than 200 Yankee 
prisoners (presumed to be cavalry) were brought in this evening.  Many 
of them seemed quite merry.  The enemy still threaten Richmond.  A 
large force of citizens is organized for the defence of the city.  Wagon trains going to 
Winchester are now required to be guarded.  A train is waiting till a 
guard of 500 men can be formed of convalescent soldiers, passing 
through town from the Hospitals to their commands.  The enemy still 
persevering at Vicksburg and Port Hudson, which causes new solicitude.  
A momentous crisis is at hand.  Gen. Lee 
will achieve some signal success, or his army may be annihilated.  
Grant must retire, or Vicksburg must fall soon.  A concert at the

Pennsylvania, but no authentic information.  Doubtful whether Gen. Lee himself has crossed the Potomac.  Some 
Northern papers seem to think that Ewell was sent into Pennsylvania as 
an inducement for Hooker to move in that direction, and then that Lee 
(with Longstreet's + A.P. Hill's corps, I presume) would fall upon 
Washington.  We do not know how it is.  &#8212;  When Jim M<sup>c</sup>Clung 
was here his mother referred to some intelligence about the army she 
had got from the newspapers  &#8212;  Jim told her she need not believe 
anything of the sort she read in the papers, and the good old lady 
exclaimed with great earnestness:  "But it's the only way we have of 
knowing what's going on."  We told her Gen. Lee did not consider it necessary to 
communicate intelligence to us.  As Jim was leaving on Sunday, she told 
him if he went to Princeton he must go and see Janetta (Alexander)!

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">From Northern newspapers it appears that a portion of our army 
occupied York, Pa.  But all of that region, including Western Maryland, 
is in our possession.  At Harrisburg, on the 25<sup>th</sup>, the men 
were flying from the city.  &#8212;  The country people arriving there 
seemed to have no idea of fighting, but were loud in their 
denunciations of Lincoln for not sending troops to protect them.  In 
Carlisle, on Thursday last, the inhabitants were horrified by hearing 
the rebel drum corps, a few miles distant, <u>beat 
the "assembly" at 8 o'clock in</u> the morning, and immediately took 
to their heels.  The "contrabands" as the Yankees call runaway or 
stolen negroes, won the race to Harrisburg, but arrived there with feet 
swollen and bleeding  &#8212;  They say the scene was "enough to touch the 
most obdurate heart."  &#8212;  it has been all right and humane, however, 
to drive Southern women and children from their homes!  The unanimous 
testimony of Northern papers so far is, that our soldiers now in 
Maryland and Pennsylvania, offer no ill treatment to any one  &#8212;  What 
a contrast to Yankee depredations on this side of the Potomac!  A 
correspondent of the New York Herald, writing from Baltimore on the 
23<sup>rd</sup> ult., is astounded at 
the transfer of the seat of war from the South to the North.  He asks  
&#8212;  "Are Maryland and Pennsylvania to witness and to suffer <u>the horrors and the devastation that have desolated 
Virginia</u>?  Is Baltimore to be bombarded like Fredericksburg?  Is 
Harrisburg to be pillaged like Jacksonville, in Florida?"  Well may the 
North anticipate and dread retribution; but our troops are restrained 
by rigid orders, as license to pillage would soon demoralise the army.  Horses and beef cattle 
and whatever else is needed by the army are taken, and paid for as far 
as possible.  Apple butter is so abundant in Pa, that as one of our 
Staunton boys writes, they called their camp "Applebutter Spread!"  &#8212;  Northern papers (received at Richmond by flag of 
truce boat, which comes to City Point to exchange prisoners,) are full 
of accounts of our rebel division marching upon one town and another 
division upon another town.  We are still ignorant as to Gen. Lee's intentions, and a good deal 
apprehensive, considering the vast odds against us in a war of invasion  
&#8212;  On the 27<sup>th</sup> Our cavalry under Stuart occupied Fairfax 
C.H. (Va) 
and the main body of Hooker's army had gone towards Leesburg, Loudoun 
Co.  Gen. 
Lee's ordnance supplies all go from this place.  Nothing new from 
Vicksburg, or that region.  Fine showers to-
day.  Wheat said to be of superior quality.  All men up to 55 
years called out  &#8212;  a general stir.  8000 between 40 + 45 to be

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The Yankees have approached quite near Richmond, and a tight 
skirmish took place yesterday.  All of the citizens were under arms.  A 
cavalry force of Yankees was said to be moving from Hanover C.H. towards a bridge on the Fredericksburg 
Railroad.  Gen. Lee's movement still 
involved in mystery.  A man passed through town to-
day, who professed to have left Harrisburg, Pa., on Sunday last.  
He said our troops had possession of the place, and after burning the 
capitol were moving towards Baltimore.  &#8212;  Not very credible, as the 
Richmond Enquirer of this morning publishes a telegraphic dispatch, 
taken from a Northern paper, and dated on Sunday.  It said the "rebels" 
were fifteen miles off.  Some Northern papers are contrasting the 
conduct of our soldiers in Pennsylvania with that of their troops in 
the South,  &#8212;  in a way highly complimentary to the former.  Not a 
word concerning Vicksburg or Port Hudson.  Excessively warm to-day.</p></p>

Chambersburg, Pa., arrived to-day.  The 
benighted Yankees have been excluded by the blockade, from Southern

prices.  &#8212;  For example, hand-saw files which sell here at three 
dollars each, they sold to our Quartermaster at twenty cents.  Among 
the articles brought on were about 500 reams of military paper, and a 
quantity of sole leather, &#8212; the latter, however, was not paid for.  A 
youth arrived in town to-night with reports 
from Gen. Lee's army.  He belongs to the

that Ewell had captured Harrisburg, with 1200 U.S. soldiers, and burnt 
the public buildings  &#8212;  and that Hooker was at or near Washington.  -

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">An Extra from the office of the Richmond Sentinel, dated yesterday 
evening, which got here by some means this evening, is full of news 
from the North.  Gen. Lee's army seems to 
be doing pretty much as he choose in Pa + Md.  Gen. Early had levied a heavy contribution upon 
York, Pa., of money, clothing + provisions.  Bridges had been destroyed 
far and near.  Some of the "rebels" had been within five miles of 
Washington, at Silver Spring.  Harrisburg had not been taken at the 
latest dates, but a battle was expected there.  A report from the South 
represents Gen's M<sup>c</sup>Gruder and 
Dick Taylor as having crossed the Mississippi, and being near New 
Orleans, which was defended by only 1500 Yankee troops.  I met Judge 
Thompson this morning, and he was in a state of great elevation  &#8212;  
thought the war would soon be over  &#8212;  I am not so sanguine.  Two 
young men from Ga. staying with us to-night, sleeping on a mattress in the parlor.  
One a Capt. Hunter, the other named

Gentlemanly and intelligent  &#8212;  Presbyterians.  The R. R. train came from Gordonsville, and we have 
no information as to affairs at Richmond.  A rumor that a fight 
occurred in the vicinity yesterday evening.  Strange that the

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The atmosphere seemed full of exciting rumors yesterday morning, but 
I was too sick last night to record any of them.  Great battles at or 
near Gettysburg, Pa., were reported, with results favorable to our 
side, although with a heavy loss of life.  Up to this time we have 
received no satisfactory intelligence.  Some three or four of our 
Generals are reported killed.  The telegraph has been working badly, 
owing to the state of the weather.  Northern accounts are, on the 
whole, favorable to our side  &#8212;  that is brief dispatches copied from 
Northern papers into the Richmond papers of to-
day.  Northern papers are received in Richmond by various means, 
principally now by the flag of truce boat which comes up James River to 
return exchanged prisoners.  Among the rumors was one that Johnson had 
routed Grant at Vicksburg  &#8212;  not confirmed.  Reported this evening 
that our Gen. Taylor has captured 
Brashear City, above New Orleans, without stores, 
and that Banks has returned to New Orleans with 5000 men  &#8212;  having 
abandoned the siege of Port Hudson, it is presumed.  The R. R. train came through from Richmond to-day  &#8212;  the first since Friday.  The Yankees 
have left the vicinity of Richmond.  Miss Agnes started this morning 
for D<sup>r</sup>. Mills's  &#8212;  had heard that he was very ill.  Heard 
by telegraph this evening that he was better.</p><p class="p10">The vicissitudes of the war are very strange  &#8212;  Just two months 
ago (May 7<sup>th</sup>) we thought the Yankees were advancing upon 
Staunton  &#8212;  now the war is raging a way off in Pennsylvania.  Two 
months hence the Yankees may be around us again.  When I read of wars 
in my boyhood, I thought of them as belonging to the dark ages of the 

world, and never expected to witness horrors of the kind.  &#8212;  The 
thousands now lying slaughtered in Pennsylvania, and the thousands 
mangled by wounds, the thousands who are anticipating evil tiding!  
Such is war  &#8212;  to say nothing of the destruction of property, fields 
laid waste, and all the innumerable outrages and griefs which follow in 
its train.</p></p>

two hundred sheep and one hundred mules, together with a large number 
of contrabands, were brought back by the raiders."</i></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The first report this morning was dolorous  &#8212;  A Maj. White, belonging to the ordnance department, 
arrived last night by stage from Winchester, and stated that our army 
had been seriously worsted in a recent battle, that Ewell's corps had 
been ordered back to the Potomac, that his Commissary was in Winchester 
where a good deal of alarm existed, that a train of 80 Ambulances was 
captured by the Yankees, +c. +c.  It was told at the same time that 
passengers who came in the same train with White, gave an entirely 
different account of affairs.  Later in the day Towers came into my 
room, with a glowing face, to tell that Mr. Phillips told him that 
Judge Thompson told him that Stump (telegraph operator) told him, that 
in a battle on Sunday we had a glorious victory, from 40,000 to 60,000 
Yankees laying down their arms.  Price went to the Telegraph Office to 
enquire about the matter, and said on his return that Stump said the 
news must have come by some other line.  Next Wm. M. Tate came in  &#8212;  D. S. Young had just 
told him he did not tell Judge T. +c +c.  
Coming up to dinner I encountered Mr. Michie and J. B. Baldwin  &#8212;  
Michie had seen M<sup>c</sup>Guffin who told him that Judge T. Told him +c.  Baldwin said Judge had told 
him  &#8212;  the whole story.  Michie said he believed it, he was 
determined to believe it  &#8212;  that Stump had communicated to the Judge 
confidentially what he had no right to divulge, and was now endeavoring 
to <u>repair damages</u>, while the Judge was 
relating the news in strict confidence to every body he met.  I told 
Mr. Michie I would try to believe with him, and I have succeeded to 
some extent or I could not have the heart to give the narrative of 
morning's adventures in search of the news.  (I failed to mention 
several days ago that Hooker had been <u>relieved</u> of the command of the Yankee army, and 
is succeeded by Gen. Meade.</p><p class="p10">Wednesday night.  &#8212;  Passengers by the Richmond train this evening 
bring a report that Vicksburg with 19,000 men has surrendered to the 
Yankees!!  We were totally unprepared for any such intelligence.  Many 
persons profess to disbelieve it, while others fear that it is true.  
The Richmond papers contain dispatches from Martinsburg, Va., (which passed through this place), 
stating, as reports believed there, that Gen. Lee had captured 40,000 of the enemy.  I am 
not prepared to believe that he took half the number stated.  But what 
if he has?  It will not compensate for the loss of Vicksburg.  Better 
have sent a part of Lee's army to assist Johnston to raise the siege, 
keeping the other part to guard the line of the Rappahannock, instead 
of marching into Pennsylvania and capturing over 40,000 Yankees, but 
arousing the war spirit at the North and recruiting their ranks by 
means of the instinct which induces men to repel invasion.  Brig. Gen. Kemper was among the killed 
at Gettysburg.  We were boys together at Washington College, and 
belonged to the same society.</p></p>

capitulated on the 4<sup>th</sup>.  Johnston seems to have made not the 
slightest attempt to relieve the place or annoy the enemy.  &#8212;  Some 
persons are still incredulous as to the report, denying the genuineness 
of the Johnston dispatch +c +c.  Catching at straws!  Gen. Lee is certainly falling back, and our 
40,000 prisoners seem to have come down to 4000!  Thus terminated 
another attempt at an invasive war  &#8212;  impolitic from the first, as 
tending only to unite the Northern people and recruit their armies.</p><p class="p10">Harvest is much retarded by the continued wet weather.  The crop is

fearful accounts of the slaughter of our army.  Pickett's Division 
annihilated.  Many persons known to us killed  &#8212;  A disastrous affair.  
The news comes to us in very unintelligible forms.  So far as we now 
see the tide is running fearfully against us.  The road leading into 
town from Winchester is lined with wounded soldiers, coming up from the 
battle field.  They all say that after they left they heard that Lee 
had another fight and took a great many prisoners.  It is a sad sight 
to see so many poor fellows dragging themselves along to get nearer 
home.  Some come in vehicles, but most on foot.  They are, of course, 
those who are slightly wounded, comparatively.</p><p class="p10"><u>Friday night</u>.  No train from Richmond 
yet (near 10 o'clock) and no tidings of it when I came home.  No

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The report concerning Vicksburg fully confirmed  &#8212;  I have no heart 
for the details which have reached us.  Great solicitude felt in regard 
to Gen. Lee's army.  &#8212;  A fearful list of 
casualties among the soldiers from this county.  If there is the same 
proportion from other quarters, the army must be greatly reduced.  The 
fall of Vicksburg protracts the war indefinitely, and if Gen. Lee's army is crippled or the enemy not 
seriously injured, we shall be overrun again in a short time, and worse 
than ever.  Pontoon bridges going to the Potomac  &#8212;  came up from 
Richmond by R.R.</p><p class="p10"><u>Saturday night</u> 10 o'clock.  &#8212;  The

reduced by troops sent to reinforce the latter.  &#8212;  The crisis is a 
momentous one for us  &#8212;  intense anxiety prevails.  Nothing further 
from Hagerstown, Gen. Lee's head quarters 
at last dates  &#8212;  nothing given to the public, but I hear  &#8212;  by a 
telegraphic dispatch communicated to me, that the Yankees were 
advancing yesterday in two divisions, and a battle probably took place 
to-day.  Wounded soldiers have come into town 
to-day in a constant stream  &#8212;  some of them 
in vehicles and on horseback, but most on foot  &#8212;  most of them very 
dirty and many without shoes.  After hearing for several days that a 
great battle took place on Sunday last, <sup>5th</sup> at which Lee 
captured many thousands of prisoners, I am now inclined to think no 
such battle was fought.  A cavalry man, who said he left the army on 
Wednesday, asserts that up to that date no considerable battle had 
occurred since the previous Friday (3<sup>rd</sup>), and that all the 
prisoners taken amount to 12,000.  He gave, on the whole, a hopeful 
view of things.  Another man, well known to me, who came from the 
vicinity of Charlestown, said the great fight on Sunday was a matter of 
universal talk, and he had the fact of its occurrence from undoubted 
authority.  A third person (Quartermaster to a cavalry regiment part of 
whose wagon train was captured) knew of no fight on Sunday, but he 
<u>heard</u> heavy firing that day.  He seemed, 
however, to know nothing except that his wagons were lost.  A fourth, a 
young Lieut. wounded in the army, left the army before Sunday, but had 
heard a great deal about the fight and large number of prisoners.  What 
a contrast between this night and a week ago!  Then everything in our 
affairs looked prosperous.  &#8212;  Now every heart is filled with anxiety.  
Oh that we could look to God with a proper spirit!  May He deliver us!  
&#8212;  Called at the American Hotel Hospital, with Va, this evening to see two young men from 
Wetumpka, Ala. who wrote to Mrs.

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">An officer who arrived this afternoon from Lynchburg on a train with 
troops, states that there was a rumor of the fall of Charleston.  No 
such intelligence had been received here by telegraph when I came home 
after dark.  But our people are prepared to believe any bad news.  
Judge Thompson and Mr. Michie are as much depressed now as they were 
uplifted a few days ago.  Last Sunday the Judge told me he had no doubt 
that Lincoln and Seward were fugitives from Washington  &#8212;  this 
morning he said to me almost in a whisper, that "between us, we were in 
a very bad way."  The stream of wounded arriving has been uninterupted, and not a third part has 
arrived yet.  The wounds generally are not severe, and are doing well.  
It is stated that <u>comparatively</u> few were 
killed  &#8212;  not so many as at Sharpsburg, last year.  We continue to 
hear of skirmishes and heavier fights in Maryland, but can get no 
reliable information.  The pontoon bridges were sent off this morning, 
each one on a wagon drawn by four horses, making a heavy load.  &#8212;  the 
wagons constructed for the purpose.  Many of the wounded have been sent 
off by Railroad.  Yesterday evening a Lt. Col. rode up to the Q.M.'s office to get transportation by 
R.R. home  &#8212;  upon his going away, a 
young fellow sitting with others by the house remarked:  "Col. W. has a hole in him that's good for a 
sixty days' furlough  &#8212;  I'd like to have one myself."  &#8212;  He was on 
his way to join the army.  Such is the feeling of weariness, that even

Nothing has occurred at Jackson except some skirmishing.  Some reason 
to fear that the Yankees are at Winchester!  The telegraphist there 
reported last night that the enemy were within five miles of the town, 
and since then not a word of intelligence has been received, the 
telegraph not working.  It is presumed that the object of the enemy was 
to rescue some 4000 prisoners coming from Martinsburg.  Gen. Lee's line of communication is too 
extensive  &#8212;  he must fall back, followed by a horde such as we have 
not had upon us before.  Most persons express very gloomy feelings.  
The fall of Vicksburg has caused great rejoicing at the North.  Gen. Sam. Jones's Brigade is going to reinforce 
Gen. Lee  &#8212;  two regiments have arrived 
here, one yesterday and another to-day.  Heavy

able to finish on account of the wet weather.  The young men from 
Wetumpka, whom I went to see Saturday, were sent off to another

through New town to a camp in that direction.  Nearly all the prisoners 
were in good spirits, apparently, and many rather defiant.  They were a 
motley set  &#8212;  as a whole poor specimens of humanity, and many of them 
dressed no better than our own ragged boys.  As soon as the prisoners 
had left the street, a battalion, belonging to Gen. Sam. <u>Jones'</u> 
brigade marched through town towards Winchester, presenting a very 
soldierly appearance.  The men looked stout, carried their guns and 
marched well, and the ranks were full.  Their clothing was only <u>uniform</u>, however, in its <u>ashy</u> hue.  A regiment belonging to the same 
command started down the day before yesterday, the fullest and 
apparently most effective body we have seen for many a day.  On both 
occasions the men marched to the drum and fife.  Soon after the troops 
passed this morning, I heard a rumor of a great riot in New York city, 
caused by the attempt to enforce the conscription act, which was said 
to have been received by Telegraph.  &#8212;  Stuart (A. H.) received a 
dispatch from Richmond.  The papers which came in the evening give a 
good many particulars, taken from New York papers.  It was a serious 
affair, and was still progressing at the date of last accounts, 
although Lincoln had suspended the draft.  About 200 persons killed, 
principally negroes, and many houses destroyed.  Disturbances have also 
occurred in Connecticut and New Jersey.</p><p class="p10">No news to-day from Gen. Lee's army.  The enemy put Johnston at 
Jackson and Beauregard at Charleston.  Reason for apprehension in 
regard to both.  There is great diversity of opinion as to the policy 
of Gen. Lee's movement into Pennsylvania.  
I felt opposed to it, instinctively from the first.  The plan of the 
Constable Montmorency, when Charles V invaded France, seems to me 
undoubtedly the best for us.  See Robertson's Charles V.<a href="#n71">71</a></p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The town has been full of soldiers, ambulances and wagons all day.  
The soldiers are going down to join their commands in Lee's army, many 
of them just released from imprisonment in "Castle Thunder," Richmond, 
&#8212;  Ambulances and wagons going + coming to + from Winchester.  This 
evening a long train of the former came in, loaded with wounded or sick 
men.  The enemy, under Meade, are now thought to be making for Richmond 
again, and there is no doubt that Gen. Lee 
is about moving into Eastern Virginia.  Our losses in men + arms at 
Vicksburg, Port Hudson and in Pennsylvania are represented as enormous.  
<sup>x</sup>  The papers of to-day give 
nothing from the New York riot later than the 15<sup>th</sup>; we learn 
by Telegraph from Richmond that the riot was progressing on the 
16<sup>th</sup>.  As usual after all our reverses, the matter of our 
recognition by European powers is on foot, again.  Last night we had a

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Not even a rumor to-day.  No doubt, 
however, that Gen. Lee's army is moving 
East of the Blue Ridge.  Soldiers coming this way are now stopped at 
Gordonsville, and in a few days Staunton will be relieved of the great 
crowds which have thronged the streets for weeks past.  The wounded and 
sick are still coming in from Winchester.  The condition of many of 
them  &#8212;  weary, famishing and suffering in various ways  &#8212;  would be 
heart-rending, if we were not so accustomed to the spectacle.  The Otey 
battery goes down towards Winchester to-
morrow, and, it is said, will be left in the Valley.  Have not 
seen the Richmond papers of this morning, as the train arrived after 
dark.  Yesterday we had further particulars of the New York riot, which 
was still going on, and outbreaks had occurred at various places in the 
North.  Some hope of European intervention, as there generally is after 
we have met with a reverse.  Europe, it is thought, does not desire and 
will not permit a restoration of the Union, and will therefore prevent 
the subjugation of the South; but so long as we can maintain our 
ground, foreign powers will not interfere.  The French Emperor 
expressed a desire for our recognition, but at the same time he 
declared his determination to co-operate with England.  The policy of 
England is cold-blooded.  She seems to wish the total destruction of 
both sections.  Slavery cannot be the cause of prejudice against us, 
for she waged war against Russia in bhalf 
of Turkey, where slavery in its worst exists.  I hear that many young 
men have lately come out from counties in N. 
W. Va. to join our army, in 
consequence of Lincoln's call for troops from that section.</p></p>

said to have been taken prisoner in Maryland.  Things look tolerably 
discouraging for us all around  &#8212;  The late repulse of the enemy at 
Charleston was a bloody affair to them.  Riot in New York died out  &#8212;  
Ditto the prospect of foreign recognition, which lately brightened up.  
Our streets quite deserted to-day  &#8212;  but 
many ambulances and wagons on the road from Winchester.  That place 
abandoned by our army.  With a large force of the enemy East of the

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Crowds of sick and wounded soldiers have been arriving in 
ambulances, wagons and on foot, and many of the inhabitants of the 
lower Valley with all the property they could bring off.  All of that 
region is now, or will be soon, in the hands of the enemy again, and 
the people apprehend greater oppression than ever.  This is indeed a 
dark hour in our history.  The siege of Charleston continues, and most 
persons expect the place to fall.  The sight of our poor dirty, 
suffering sick and wounded soldiers is most distressing.  The President 
has appointed another Fast Day.</p><p class="p10"><u>Tuesday night</u>.  &#8212;  This morning, upon 
going down street, I found a good deal of commotion among the people.  
Officers had come to town to procure horses for artillery service, and 
posting sentinels at all the outlets presented every person with a 
horse from leaving.  During the day the mounted guard went to every 
stable and took off the horses.  Many of them were returned to the 
owners, however, some because the horses were unfit for the service, 
and others on account of some peculiarity in the circumstances.  The 
officers were gentlemanly in their deportment, but said that no one out 
of the Department could know the extreme need of horses for the army.  
The same thing has been done at Richmond and other towns.  Farm horses 
are to be spared as far as possible.  The maximum price paid to owner 
is $350, which in many cases would be very inadequate.  These 
proceedings and the calling into service of all men up to 45 years of 
age, discourage me more than any military reverses we have sustained, 
of which, however, they are the consequences.  Our affairs must be 
reduced to an extremity, when such means have to be resorted to.  
Wounded + sick soldiers and refugees still coming in to-day.  We hear that the country below us is filled 
also with stragglers, principally cavalry.  Crops have been ruthlessly 
destroyed by teamsters and others turning horses in fields to graize.  &#8212;  Another great freshet this afternoon  -
-  water much higher than the last flood.  Morgan on a great "raid" in 
Indiana and Ohio.  It will do not good  &#8212;  far better for us to fight 
on our own soil.  Cannonading heard yesterday and to-
day.  Supposed that a fight was under way in Culpeper  &#8212;  Oh, 
the devastation, slaughter and mourning caused by this war!</p></p>

kind" in the Congressional district, has applied to me repeatedly to 
take charge of the business in Augusta county, but I have refused to 
leave my present position.  It has been almost ludicrous ever since the 
beginning of the war to see the inferiority of the chiefs to their 
subordinates and assistants, in some of the departments.  Most of the 
Q.M.'s of my acquaintance are 
perfectly dependent upon their clerks.  Why the clerks are not the 
Q.M.'s, I cannot find out.  No news 
to-day from any quarter  &#8212;  An untraceable 
rumor that Gen. Lee had resigned.  Not 
believed.  As Mrs. M<sup>c</sup>Clung was going into church Sunday 
morning just after quitting hold of my arm on the portico, her foot 
tripped in an old carpet and she fell at full length on the floor.  Her 
forehead was severely bruised and her right wrist sprained.  We carried 
her in a chair to the carriage, and from the latter to her room at 
home.  The sight of the dear old lady thus used (hardly used as it 
seemed for a moment) was most affecting to me, but her cheerfulness has 
been admirable, as usual.  It might have been much worse, she says; and 
although her wrist and head were painful, it was not more than she 
might expect.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Oppressively hot to-day.  Mr. Stuart 
preached this morning and the Rev. John 
Miller (late Capt.) in the afternoon.  The 
latter a discourse upon the war, from the text "The rod of the wicked 
shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous."<a href="#n72">72</a>  Both Mr. M. + Mr. 
S. took supper with us.  We hear of a 
cavalry fight at Brandy Station, in Culpeper, on yesterday, the enemy 
being driven back several miles, with a loss on our side of 200 killed 
and wounded.  Morgan's capture in Ohio is a fit termination of an 
enterprise which was foolish from the first.  Such raids are justified 
on the ground that they show to the enemy that they are not safe from 
invasion so long as the war lasts.  But the reasons against them are 
more convincing to my mind.  It is bad policy to imitate an enemy 
without inflicting a serious injury; better lull him into security till 
an opportunity offers for giving an effective blow.  Morgan could only 
scratch the elephant's hide with a pin.  He tore up some miles of 
railroad, burnt depots +c, and seized horses along his route; but 
inflicted no injury which could not be repaired in a few days, and left 
the people aroused, vindictive and more <i>[illeg.]</i> upon war than ever.  
Gen. Lee's expedition into Pennsylvania 
and Morgan's into Indiana and Ohio have helped Lincoln to recruit the 
ranks of his army.  I thought Mr. Miller's <u>sermon</u> (I call it so by courtesy) rather 
calculated to depress.  He took a discouraging view of our affairs at 
this time, so far as we can judge by <u>sight</u>; but having <u>faith</u> in God we have a right to feel hopeful.  
Almost too "spiritual" for the mass of his audience.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, Aug. 5, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We have no news from the army.  A universal feeling of depression.  
No body seems to have any hope of saving Charleston  &#8212;  its ultimate 
fall is regarded as almost a matter of course, and the fall of Richmond 
even is alluded as probable event.  There is a rumor of a victory for 
our side at Donaldsonville, La., (enemy's loss 6000, including 4000 
prisoners), but so many flattering reports which proved untrue have 
come from that quarter, that little credit is given to this one.  Gen. "Dick Taylor" has performed many exploits 
which are never heard of except by telegraph.  About 800 of the Yankee 
prisoners from Pennsylvania +c were shipped to Richmond.  &#8212;  all 
except those who escaped within the last week.  &#8212;  No body could tell 
how many prisoners were actually here (!) and therefore it is not known 
how many escaped.  Ten certainly went off, but five of them were 
recaptured in Highland, and brought back this morning.  The army is now 
taking in all the men fit for service up to forty-five years of age.  
Necessaries of life going up, up in price.  &#8212;  Flour promises to reach

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Still no news of special interest.  The feeling at the North is 
evidently one of great confidence.  Federal currency is at 
comparatively slight discount, while ours is going down, down.  As for 
example, $1.75 and $2 cash are demanded for spring chickens.  Yet when 
we look at our military resources, our affairs do not appear desperate, 
or even worse than they did some weeks ago  &#8212;  our armies are at least 
as large and as efficient, while the Yankee armies are not more so, 
than they were then.  A victory for us now would put a very different 
face upon affairs both North and South.  But it is impossible to keep 
the courage up by whistling, and I am considerably depressed, like 
every body else.  Judge Parson, of N.

came rushing over with a report that "they were arming convalescent 
patients in the military hospital, as the Yankees were expected here 
tonight."  They came to enquire what we had heard about it, and seemed 
quite alarmed.  I paid little attention to the matter till we heard a 
crowd (we could not see in the darkness) passing up the 
M<sup>c</sup>Adamized Street, which the young ladies supposed to be the 
Yankees coming in but which I thought might be the citizens going to 
the armory at the old Valley Hotel, for guns.  Mrs. McC. + Miss A. urged 
me to go down and ascertain the cause of the excitement; but the Misses 
T., rather hysterically, entreated me not 
to leave them.  Finally I went off  &#8212;  Found a number of persons out 
of doors and on the pavements, heard rumors that the Yankees were at 
Brock's Gap, Rockingham +c. +c. went to the Quartermaster's Office, 
Telegraph Office, Provost Marshall's Office +c, and came home without 
any definite intelligence.  The convalescents were arming, but why or 
wherefore, no body could tell, except that there was a flying report 
that the Yankees were at Brock's Gap.  Imboden telegraphed to-day that the enemy, 4000 strong, were at 
Moorfield.</p></p>

gone back, and there is no present danger of a raid from that quarter.  
No military movements on foot, so far as we know.  It is said the 
soldiers of Gen. Lee's army put an 
unexpected interpretation upon a recent proclamation of the President, 
offering pardon to all deserters who return within twenty days.  &#8212;  
Many of them are going off to their homes without leave, expecting to 
get back within twenty days!  Imboden is very sick of the war  &#8212;  he

was an unusual feeling of solemnity, the people generally being 
depressed in spirits.  I remained at home all day, except when I went 
to church, morning and evening.  In the evening it was rumored that the 
enemy were advancing upon Staunton in two columns, of 12000 and 8000, 
from Greenbrier and Highland.  After night the number was reduced to 
800.  Col. Jackson, who has a small force 
in Highland sent in a courier to give notice.  The Bank officers were 
packing up to leave  &#8212;  otherwise there was no excitement, so far as I 
heard.  This morning, I was informed at the office that 7000 Yankees 
were coming into the county from Pendleton, by way of Mt. Solon.  The 
mail carrier, however, arrived at 12 o'clock, and stated that he heard 
nothing of this news till he got to Staunton!  Imboden has moved up 
within three miles of town, and to-night we 
have not heard a rumor.  A company (horse) organizing for home defense, 
had a first turn-out this afternoon  &#8212;  regarded as rather a 
burlesque.  I met Mrs. Effinger, of Harrisonburg, on the street late in 
the evening, and she came up with me and remained till quite late.  
Wm. L. Alexander came up after supper and 
is staying here.  The various armies are quiet at all points except 
Charleston.  The enemy is still assailing that city vigorously.  They 
have certainly made some impression upon Fort Sumter, and the fall of 
the city is generally anticipated.  In pursuance of the policy adopted 
by our authorities, to put disabled soldiers in the Departments, a 
shoemaker who lost his leg by an accidental shot in camp, has orders to 
report for duty here, in place of a clerk, who is ordered back to his

miles from town.  Was surprised upon going down street to find 
everything so quiet.  Was told, however, that a courier had arrived 
during the night with the intelligence.  No preparation was made for 
removing public stores, as further intelligence was awaited.  As the 
day advanced, the convalescent patients from the Army Hospitals were 
armed, the citizens formed companies, and Imboden's command (said to be 
1000 cavalry, artillery and infantry) came up from their camp three 
miles blow town.  Cannon were planted on the 
hill west of town (immediately opposite our house), other preparations 
made to repel the enemy.  Towards 10 o'clock most persons concluded 
there was no enemy near  &#8212;  persons from Buffalo Gap had heard nothing 
of the Yankees till they came to town, and a man from Highland reported 
that they had gone towards Pocahontas.  Afterwards scouts came in and 
reported that no Yankees were near the Gap.  Various accounts are given 
of the origin of the reports  &#8212;  one that the scouts were taking oats 
from a farm, and mistook the people who chased them off for Yankees.  
By evening the citizens had dispersed, the cannon were brought down 
from the hill, and Imboden's men returned to their camp.  There is not

to an order requiring me and others to report at the Camp of 
Instruction upon the expiration of thirty days.  <i>[deleted: heavily deleted 
and illegible text]</i>  I reported immediately, was enrolled and 
underwent the ordeal of inspection.  After a most disagreeable time of 
it,  on the second day I received a discharge, on account of "excessive 
myopia," as they call near-sightedness.  I was treated with great 
courtesy, but would not have stood the trial if I had been permitted to 
join the army.  As it is I am back in my old place.  Legh's case is up 
again  &#8212;  I have advised him to go again to the army, and join a 
company, although he is even more near-sighted than I.  Being 
physically much stouter, he is more likely to be accepted for service.  
I do not see, however, that he could render much service.  Glasses 
correct the defect in vision so perfectly that for all the ordinary 
purposes of life, "myopia" is not regarded as an infirmity, or 
affliction; but if they should be lost, or become coated with steam 
from the face, as they often are when the wearer is heated, total 
blindness ensues.  Even a drop of rain or perspiration on a glass will 
greatly obstruct the vision, so that frequent wiping is necessary.  &#8212;-
-  I put up at the Powhatan House in Richmond, which is probably more 
comfortable than any hotel in the city.  It was melancholy to observe 
everywhere the ravages made by the war  &#8212;  or rather how the war, by 
preventing repairs, gives a general appearance of decay and ruin.  Old

of Lincoln, who seemed rejoiced to see me, as his mother and mine were 
old friends.  He insisted that we should take a room together at the 
hotel, which of course I acquiesced in, although he is not very 
congenial.  Todd is in the Confederate service, and is now a paroled 
prisoner, having been taken at Vicksburg.  Traces of the war every

families.  A Union man was to be married there Wednesday night, and it 
was supposed he would have a Yankee escort.  As Mr. Bell was coming up 
the road this side of W. he met a party 
of our cavalry going down  &#8212;  he asked where they were going and they 
said "to the wedding."  Some 30 of our cavalry dashed upon the enemy at 
Bath, in Morgan county, last week, and captured 19 or 20 men and 50 
horses.  The prisoners arrived here on Friday night last.  Great 
disaffection in North Carolina.  General feeling of apprehension as to 
subsistence next winter.</p></p>

troops with all their equipments captured at Cumberland mountain, 
Tennessee.  The S. W. Va Salt Works threatened by the enemy.  The big 
gun at Charleston is said to have busted at the first fire.  Another 
remains to be tested.  Some 147 Yankees captured in Hardy county 
arrived in town yesterday evening, and were sent on to Richmond this

telegraphs from Richmond, that we gained a considerable victory.  
People generally are disposed to await further intelligence, before 
giving way to much joy, having been so often deceived by the first 
tidings of battles, from the South-West.  There are still rumors of 
fighting between Lee + Meade.  Va and I 
walked down to J. K. Woods' to-night to see 
Miss M. Gilkeson, who will start to Maryland to-
morrow, doubtful, however, of getting through the lines.  Va gave her a letter for Janetta Alexander, 
wrapped in a ball of cotton yarn.  We have an abundance of grapes, but 
they ripen slowly, and frost is upon us.  Some peaches which, it seems, 
will never get ripe.  A wonderful phenomenon has been seen in 
Greenbrier  &#8212;  a vast number of men dressed in white shirts and pants, 
marching in military order, up a mountain in a Northern direction.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Reported this morning that a general engagement was going on near 
Gordonsville.  As the telegraph line was not working, no intelligence 
could be received, but it was feared that our army was rather hard 
pressed.  In the evening we learned, however, by the R. R. train that a cavalry fight had taken 
place, and nothing more.  The papers of this morning have quite full 
telegraphic reports of the battle between Bragg and Rosecrans.  They 
speak of a "decisive" victory for us, but still we must wait a day or 
two longer.  The Federal army was not <u>routed</u> at the last dates.  A series of 
brilliant successes, won by large battles, would leave us exhausted.  
We should certainly avoid pitched battles as far as possible, and 
confine ourselves to worrying the enemy by petty assaults.  Hotel board 
in Staunton, for transient guests, is now ten dollars a day!  Miss 
Agnes and Mary J. Baldwin are at the Seminary to-

Georgia.  Rosecrans is said to be at Chattanooga and I fear that it is 
not in Bragg's power to drive him further.  The latter telegraphs that 
he took 7000 prisoners, 36 cannon, 15,000 small arms +c.  Our loss not 
reported yet.  Several frosts lately  &#8212;  a heavy one this morning.  
Prices of food +c getting higher + higher  &#8212;  flour $40 a barrel.  A 
great disposition on the part of producers to hoard up supplies  &#8212;  
Extremely difficult to procure anything, even with plenty of money to 
pay for it.  At present rates it requires a great deal to maintain even 
a small family, and many persons have limited means.  Mechanics and 
other laborers, as well as farmers, are able to get along much better 
than persons who have fixed incomes, however ample heretofore, because 
the prices of labor and produce of all kinds go up almost daily, to 
suit the times.  Indeed working men (or many of them) seem to have more 
surplus money now than ever before, which shows that their enhanced 
charges are not fully justified by their necessities.  It is surprising 
to see what large sums such people will lay out at auction sales, for 
furniture +c.  Miss Agnes, her mother +c are fully installed at the 
Seminary, and have had a constant run of visitors.  There seems to be a 
universal interest in their enterprise.  They have the prospect of a 
good school, and a full house of boarders; but no man would have 
undertaken the business at this time, nor could succeed at it.  It 
remains to be seen what measure of success these females will have  &#8212;  
women, however, receive assistance which men cannot get.  They have 
borrowed one article from one person, and one from another, and bought 
some things, thus furnishing the house.  Miss A. bought a sofa at auction for $155 in currency, 
but paid for it $15 in gold and $5 Confederate note.  I sold the same 
article last winter (at the sale of the Sowers property) for about 
$50.</p></p>

Senator Wigfall, of Texas, addressed the people of this county on their 
duties at this crisis of the war.  The latter is a polished speaker  &#8212;  
having heard the former frequently before, I did not listen to his 
address this time.  The people "resolved" that they would sell produce 
at the rates fixed by Government to all consumers.  &#8212;  Doubt if many 
of them ever have anything to sell  &#8212;  that will be the excuse.  
Reported that Meade's army considerably reduced by reinforcements sent 
to Rosecrants, is falling back from the 
Rapidan.  Nothing recent from Bragg  &#8212;  the last report represented 
that he had surrounded Rosecrans.  The session at the Seminary opens 
to-morrow  &#8212;  twenty boarders engaged.  
Great vexation expressed by many persons in town in consequences of the

calling at Mr. Stuart's ascertained that the Richmond train had not 
arrived.  Sat with Mr. S. and Sister till 
half past 8 o'clock, and as I was having to come home heard the 
rumbling of the train.  Did what is unusual for me  &#8212;  went to the 
Depot to enquire the news.  Met a number of persons who had just 
arrived, hurrying to the hotel.  &#8212;  At last fell in and returned with 
a man who seemed rather less flurried than the others, and in answer to 
my questions he said reports on the train stated that fighting was 
going on yesterday and to-day  &#8212;  that 
Ewell's corps would be at Manassas to-night, 
in the rear of the Yankees, and that 300 captured Yankees were at 
Gordonsville to-day.  He quickened his pace 
and left me, and I then addressed myself to an officer (apparently  &#8212;  
it was dark) who said he understood it was Hill's corps that had got in 
Meade's rear, that a severe cavalry fight took place yesterday at 
Culpeper C.H., that no body was now 
permitted to enter the lines of our army from Gordonsville  &#8212;  not 
even officers  &#8212;  and that a general battle would take place soon if 
Meade would stand.  Our Commissioner, Mr. Mason, has retired from

horse, were captured a few days ago near Warrenton.  Trouble among the 
officers in Bragg's army.  I have been engaged for several days past in 
the great work of having a suit of clothes made.  Va bought the cloth several weeks ago at the 
Factory near town.  It is gray jeans, and cost $10 a yard, but similar 
cloth sells now at $14.  The price will go up to whatever sum people 
are able to pay.  Va furnished as 
"trimmings" four yards of unbleached cotton cloth, (for pockets, sleeve 
linings +c) and a piece of black alpaca<a href="#n74">74</a> 
which her brother Jim had worn as a neck cloth, for coat lining.  I 
bought two yards of Osnaburg,<a href="#n75">75</a> at $2.50 a 
yard, (formerly cost 8 or 10 cents), and have ordered two dozen buttons 
from the manufacturer.  The Lushbaughs turn buttons out of maple wood  
&#8212;  one dozen I may use for the coat and vest, and the others I will 
probably swap for some suitable for pantaloons.  The suit will probably 
cost me from $130 to $140  &#8212;  formerly it would not have brought more 
than $12 or $15.  The great meeting on last court day has amounted to

Among them are two natives of Staunton  &#8212;  John Wise and William (or 
Gerald) Henderson!  The former had to pass immediately by the house in 
which his sisters lived, and was permitted to go in and see them.  I 
hear there was great lamentation over his being caught in such company.  
All of the prisoners are from Baltimore, and were enlisted for six 
months.  No exchanges of prisoners are taking place now, as Lincoln 
insists upon placing his negro soldiers on the same footing with the 
whites.  Upwards of (700) seven hundred Yankees were captured in 
Tennessee a few days ago.  We must have largely the advantage of the 
Yankees by this time.  Some of our men came off with rich spoils from 
Charlestown.  One had three or four overcoats, which are hard to get 
with us.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, October 27, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A number of persons on this county and Rockingham have been arrested 
for encouraging desertions from our army, among them a man named Yates, 
of Mt. Sidney, formerly a militia Major, whom I have known for a long 
time.  Several of Imboden's men went to him, pretending they were 
deserters.  He took them in, revealed to them his mode of operating, 
and gave them instructions in regard to stopping places, passwords +c.  
They then went on in pursuance of his directions, from place to place, 
over the mountains, till they got near the Yankee lines.  On their 
return they arrested all the men at whose houses they were harbored.  A 
notorious spy named Coffman was arrested a few days ago by a party of 
Imboden's men, in Pendleton.  He has a family in Rockingham, and has 
been making trips between that county and the enemy's post at New 
Creek, on the Balt. + Ohio Railroad.  
When Imboden moved down the Valley the last time he sent fifty men to 
Pendleton county in search of Coffman.  Not finding him, all of them 
returned except nine of the party, who secreted themselves and watched 
the roads at night, when, it was believed, Coffman did his traveling.  
On the fifth night a picket discovered a man going to a barn, and 
informing his associates, the building was surrounded and Coffman 
captured.  He had a large number of letters to persons in Rockingham 
and Augusta, which implicate several Dunkard preachers and others.  &#8212;  
He had also a passport from the Yankee officer commanding at New Creek, 
which he attempted to swallow but was made to disgorge by choking.  For 
the last year it has been evident that parties were conveying 
intelligence to the enemy of all movements in the Valley.  &#8212;&#8212;  I had 
a very severe attack of sickness last night.  Mrs. Lacey and her 
children left for Richmond yesterday morning.  The Yankee government 
has announced its determination not to exchange prisoners again during 
the war, as our army is recruited by the return of 
our men.  They hope to capture all our armies in the course of time, 
and also, perhaps, to starve us out by the aid of the prisoners in our 
hands.  It would be a curious state of affairs if they should capture 
most of our armies, and we most of theirs.</p></p>

that two of our Brigades, except 600 men who escaped without their

Division, Ewell's Corps.  One of them was on picket duty, in an intrenchment, and upon the approach of the 
enemy, the other was sent up as a reinforcement.  But the enemy proved 
too strong for them, and after a fierce resistance and slaying many of 
the Yankees, they were overpowered.  The Richmond papers received to-night, have no details of the affair, but 
regard it as a great disaster.  Passengers, however, state that the 
Brigades were not full ones.  There is a report also that we captured 
several thousands of the enemy at Culpeper C.H., on yesterday.  I fear 
this is not so.  A general engagement is expected.  More that 800 
Yankees were captured a few days ago at Rogersville, Tennessee.  
Imboden sends a dispatch that he had met the enemy's cavalry at

would try to reach the Shenandoah mountain last night, and the county

selling at about seventy dollars ($70) a barrel!  I hear that corn is

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I have not read a Richmond paper for several days, but I hear of no 
news.  I have made about 58 bushels of corn, besides what the horses 
have eaten during the last two months.  Flour sold a few days ago in 
town at $80 a barrel.  Young Armstrong, who belongs to a company in 
Imboden's command, relates some interesting army incidents.  When his 
command captured Charlestown recently and entered the Courthouse, one 
of the Yankees endeavored to hide in a closet and held the door from 
the inside.  One of our soldiers, with some difficulty forced the door 
open, and then, in a petulant mood, shot the Yankee and kicking his 
body down the steps into the cellar locked the closet door.  The other 
men were shocked at the cruelty of the act, but all of them are so 
weary of the war as to often to perpetrate such things without 
compunction.  On another occasion, a Yankee soldier was shot, and as he 
fell threw his hand upon his breast.  Some of our men went to him; and 
on turning him over discovered a youth of remarkable beauty.  He was 
shot in the head, and his hand covered the miniature of a lady supposed 
to be his mother.  The spectacle moved all of our men to tears.  Oh, 
miserable war!  This morning I got Mr. Tate's buggy and took Va out to old Mrs. Karre's, about a mile from 
town.  The old woman is to weave some linsey<a href="#n77">77</a> 
for us.  She lives by herself in a small room, which contains her loom, 
bed, stove, and, I suppose, all she possesses.  Her nose was covered 
with a cloth, as she has cancer.  What a comfortless state!  Many years 
ago her husband was a sort of overseer on our farm  &#8212;  He was at the 
battle of Waterloo  &#8212;  an "Irish Dragoon."  After him John Maybush 
lived in the same house, in the same capacity  &#8212;  He also was at

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">"No news" for several days  &#8212;  that is no important battle, and no 
immediate prospect of one.  The assault upon Charleston continues, but 
what progress, if any, the enemy has made in the capture of the city we 
do not know  &#8212;  we thought Vicksburg safe, till we heard of its fall, 
and the public was slow to believe the report.  Some skirmishing on the 
Rapidan, and now and then an affair "down the Valley."  In the mean 
while prices are going up, or the currency down.  Pork which used to 
sell for $5 or $10 per 100 pounds, now goes off at $150 to $200 per 
100.  (By the way, my sow had a litter of seven pigs last night  &#8212;  
three of which have <u>wens</u><a href="#n78">78</a> on their foreheads  &#8212;  what does it portend?)  A 
general feeling now that the war will be interminable.  All round the 
horizon there is not a glimmer of light or hope.  Yet the war does not 
weigh as heavily as it did for many months after it began.  The 
recollection of the security and abundance formerly enjoyed seems like 
a dream.  &#8212;  I picture to myself the scenes in our streets three years 
ago  &#8212;  piles of boxes before every store door, shelves and counters 
within filled and piled up with goods, merchants begging customers to 
buy; groceries running over with sugar, molasses, coffee, tea, cheese 
fish +c; confectioners making the most tempting display of fruits, 
cakes and candies; wagon loads of country produce calling at every 
house and farmers earnestly inquiring who wished to purchase flour, 
corn, potatoes, beef, pork, apples  &#8212;  Now, the stores (still so 
called by courtesy) will furnish you thread, buttons, pins, and other 
light articles which "run the blockage," cotton cloth of Southern 
manufacture (at $3.75 per yard!), vessels made of clay instead of glass 
or china ware, and occasionally a few yards of calico or linsey; the 
confectioner's saloons are like "banquet halls deserted"<a href="#n79">79</a>; and you will be lucky if, by dint of entreaty 
and as a special favour, an "independent 
farmer" will <u>sell</u> you at a high price a 
barrel of flour or a few bushels of corn.  In consequence of this state 
of affairs, each family manufactures and produces its own supplies as 
far as possible.  Alick, however, with an extensive practice as a 
physician, can scarcely procure forage for his horse, and had to notify 
his patrons that he could not answer their calls unless they furnished 
him with produce.  People are willing to pay any price (in "currency") 
for what they want  &#8212;  <u>money</u> is 
plentiful, but alas! it cannot be used as food or clothing.  But I 
discover no change in female attire  &#8212;  the ladies <u>seem</u> to dress quite as much as formerly  &#8212;  
How this happens I do not know; perhaps women's ingenuity "Gars auld 
claes look amaist as weel's the new" (see Burns)<a href="#n80">80</a>, but I presume, from the sensation caused by a 
new bonnet at church, the sex do feel the purpose of the times in this 
respect.  Men dress in home-spun, or in broad-cloth coats of antique 
cut.  As apropos to this subject see No. 277 of the "Spectator."  &#8212;  
French fashions were imported into England by means of dolls dressed in 
the latest styles, and the Spectator says that during the hottest 
period of the war between England and France the dolls continued to 
come.  (Va says she wishes one would 
arrive here now  &#8212;  she would like to make up her linsey by it)  Our 
ladies are just as eager as formerly for the "fashions" from 
Philadelphia and New York.  Every now and then some female comes 
through "the lines," and the patterns of her bonnet, cloak, dress and 
cape is spedily adopted by the whole 
sex.</p></p>

dispatches from Gen. Bragg announcing that

This is not credited.  A battle on the Rapidan is looked for.  Flour

The cars to-night bring word that a fight

in killed and wounded 400.  Our army in line of battle yesterday, but 
no fight occurred.  We are anxious to hear from Jimmy Tate.  I am sad 
to think of Gillock's family.  At last accounts Gen. Bragg was in line of battle at Chickamauga.  
He lost, it is said, 5000 men taken prisoners at Lookout Mountain.  
Longstreet was shelling Knoxville.  This is a dark period of the war  -
-  many persons think we are on the point of being overwhelmed.  Rumors 
of a large Yankee force coming in from Western Virginia.  Thefts +

price is from $150 to $200 per 100 lbs.  Flour up to $95 a barrel.  At 
this rate of depreciation we shall soon have no currency, as the money 
we have will buy nothing at all.  Many persons, however, have no more 
of the depreciated currency than they formerly had of good money, and 
upon them the purpose of the times is very severe.  But the slaughter

Johnston had united with Bragg, and defeated the Yankees, taking 20,000 
prisoners.  I have seen no one who attached any importance to this 
rumor.  It is doubtless only the wish or hope which is apt to be 
entertained after a disaster has occurred.  Reported that the loss of 
men from this county in killed and wounded in the late fight on the 
Rappahannock, was 150.  When, about three years ago, I began this

at last accounts.  At Ringgold he is said to have checked his pursuers 
severely, but they were still pressing upon him.  According to 
telegraphic reports he has lost more than fifty pieces of artillery, 
1000 men killed + wounded, and 5000 men captured by the enemy.  
Northern papers, however, claim only 2000 prisoners.  On the 
Rappahannock, the opposing armies have been skirmishing for several 
days past  &#8212;  a general engagement cannot be delayed long.  The crisis 
is momentous.  If Lee is driven back to Richmond, all this section of

<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, Dec. 4, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">To the surprise of every body, rumors came last night that the 
Yankee army was backing out of its position confronting Gen. Lee.  It was thought probable, however, 
that Meade was endeavoring to secure possession of Fredericksburg for 
winter quarters.  Intelligence came to night 
that the Yankees left Wednesday night, and went towards Culpeper C.H., 
Lee pursuing.  The advance and all the pompous array of this enemy 
certainly were indicative of a battle  &#8212;  why they have backed out in 
this manner we do not know, unless it was that Lee was too well 
prepared for them.  After their repulse at Ringgold the Yankees 
abandoned their pursuit of Bragg, and came back to Chickamauga, 
destroying bridges +c behind them.  Bragg telegraphs that their loss at 
Ringgold was very heavy  &#8212;  the New York Herald, it is said, estimates 
their loss at Lookout Mt. and subsequently at forty thousand.  It is 
reported again that Burnside has surrendered to Longstreet at 
Knoxville.  The cannonading ceased on Saturday, from which it was 
inferred by some that Burnside had surrendered; by others, that 
Longstreet had been compelled by Bragg's reverses to raise the siege 
and retire.  But if the latter be the correct supposition our army 
would have been heard of before this time, near the Virginia line.  
Moreover, information, apparently authentic, as late as Monday, states 
that the Yankee army at Knoxville were on very short rations.  Bragg 
has been relieved of his command at his own request.  There has been 
much clamor about him for some time past.  I am not prepared to unite 
in it.  After the battle of Cannae, which reduced Rome to the last 
extremity,  &#8212;  the Senate, after adopting means of defending the city, 
went out to meet Varro, their defeated General, and presented him a 
vote of thanks because he had not despaired of the Republic  &#8212;  The 
historian remarks:  "If he had been a Carthagenian, he would have been 
crucified."<a href="#n81">81</a>  On the whole things look much 
brighter for us than they did a few days ago.  The most discouraging 
feature is the difficulty of procuring supplies for the army.  Farmers 
are resorting to every expedient for secreting their produce, because 
the Government does not pay the present exorbitant prices.  &#8212;  I had 
my five hogs killed day before yesterday  &#8212;  turned out badly only 
averaging 117 lbs.  We got six hogs weighing 999 lbs from Mr. Tate  &#8212;  
or rather Maj. Tate.  The lots make 1584 
lbs, which at $1.50 per pound = $2376!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, Dec. 5, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Four reports to-night there seems to be 
no doubt that Longstreet has raised the siege of Knoxville and is 
retreating towards Virginia  &#8212;  Grant's burning of bridges was 
probably to prevent Bragg's (or whoever is in command now) following 
him, so that he might relieve Burnside at Knoxville without 
interference.  Gen. Morgan and his staff 
officers have certainly escaped from the Ohio Penitentiary to Canada.  
No prospect of a termination of the war  &#8212;  So far as present 
appearances go, it may last for twenty years  &#8212;  I see no way by which 
it can cease, except European intervention, or a separation of the 
Northwestern States from the East, which will doubtless occur some time 
or other.  South Carolina certainly made a great mistake in bolting 
from the Union as she did.  My views and feelings in regard to the 
impolicy of that step have not changed.  Zealous original secessionists 
were so fully persuaded that they had a <u>right</u> to secede, that they did not believe war 
would follow.  It seemed  them too absurd to wage 
war with a State for doing what it had an indubitable <u>right</u> to do.  Not believing in secession as a 
Constitutional measure, others did expect war to follow, and the 
present war is not worse than I anticipated.  Instead of quitting the 
Union on the election of Lincoln, Southern representatives ought to 
have held their seats in the Congress at Washington; with the aid of 
conservative Northern men, we would have had a majority against 
Lincoln, and by withholding supplies could have tied his hands 
completely.  &#8212;  if war arose it would have been civil, not sectional, 
and mainly at the North, where the people were divided in sentiment.  
Thus we should have had the cooperation of nearly one half of the 
Northern people.  But as things were managed, those who were disposed 
to stand by us, in the Northern States, were driven off at the first 
step.  They were left in a minority, and could not render us active 
assistance without incurring the perils of incident to treason.  To 
save themselves from suspicion, multitudes embarked in the war against 
us, and have been led on step by step to sustain all of Lincoln's 
usurpations.  The war with Mexico and conquest of a large portion of 
her territory, were the origin and cause of these troubles  &#8212;  
<i>[deleted: heavily deleted and illegible text]</i>  We may see the hand of 
retributive justice in what we now suffer.  I have always believed that 
the Mexican war was unnecessary and wicked.  The territory acquired by 
it, gave rise to the controversy about slavery, which has not ceased, 
and probably will not till the whole country is overwhelmed with 
ruin.</p></p>

draw Lee this side of the Blue Ridge, in order to clear the way for an

serious alarms of an advance of the enemy towards Staunton.  I do not

Salem, Roanoke Co., and destroyed the Va + Tennessee Railroad at that point.  The 
troops passing here must be intended to cut off the retreat of that 
party.  None of the officers whom I met had any knowledge of their 
destination or the objects of the expedition.  The weather was cloudy 
and cold to-day, and it was distressing to see 
many of our poor fellows who had just arrived, without blankets and 
overcoats.  As a mass they were dirty, ragged and badly clad, but 
lively as usual, extracting fun from everything.  I mentioned several 
weeks ago that a man named Coffman, who had long acted as a spy for the 
Yankees, had been captured.  He is now in our jail, sentenced by Court 
Martial to be hung on Friday next.  (The Stonewall Brigade is not among 
the troops that has come up)  There was no mail from Richmond last 
night.  The last papers I have seen contained Lincoln's message to his 
Congress and his Proclamation making known the terms upon which he is 
willing to receive individual "rebels" under his protection  &#8212;  all 
intended for effect in Europe.  The genuine Yankees (New Englanders) 
remind me strongly of the ancient Greeks.  The Greek was the Yankee of 
old times  &#8212;  ingenious, excelling in art +c +c, but utterly faithless 
and corrupt.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, Dec. 17, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">When I awoke this morning, it was raining hard, and the trees +c 
were coated with ice.  I wondered how it was possible for our poor 
soldiers to stand exposure to such weather, not only without tents, but 
many of them without blankets or overcoats.  The Home Guard are better 
provided, but not inured to exposure.  I ascertained, upon going to the 
office, that it was undoubtedly true that the Yankees had reached the 
Railroad at Salem  &#8212;  supposed to be Averell's command  &#8212;  It is a 
bold affair.  At one o'clock Lee's division of cavalry passed through 
town, and went up the Greenville road.  None of them know where they 
were going, and no body could tell there the enemy were to be found.  
The men were dripping wet, but seemed in fine spirits.  The horses, 
generally, are in good condition.  The Home Guard returned to-day, having been dismissed to assemble again at a 
moment's warning.  Alick appears to have enjoyed the excursion very 
much.  I have not seen Legh.  The troops which went west by Railroad, 
are all returning; even Imboden's command is coming in  &#8212;  These 
movements are involved in mystery to us.  Raining all day, and the 
trees + shrubs still covered with ice.  Billy Graham, of Lexington, 
captain of cavalry, called and took dinner with us to-day, bringing a friend with him.  We have 
frequently heard the engine whistle since dark, as if trains were 
arriving.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, Dec. 18, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">All the troops returned from Buffalo Gap last night, in the rain, 
and must have had a miserable time of it.  They were taken about 2 
miles from town, on the Greenville road, and spent the night without 
shelter from the cold rain which ceased, however, at 10 or 11 o'clock.  
Some, I hear, who applied for permission to warm and dry themselves 
were repulsed by citizens!  Legh told us of two who went to his house 
and asked for shelter, one of whom seemed nearly frozen  &#8212;  they had 
repeatedly been turned off.  He, of course, took them in and did the 
best he could for them.  During the morning, he learned that part of 
the troops were to go to Millboro, to intercept Averell on his return 
from Salem.  &#8212;  Accordingly at one o'clock, Thomas' Brigade marched 
from their camp to the Railroad.  A wood train was expected down the 
road at that hour, but from some accident it did not get in till after 
dark.  Consequently the departure of the Brigade was delayed.  After 
dinner, I took two loaves of bread and a paper of sausage meat (which 
we had sent to Legh and returned as he did not need supplies) and gave 
them to a young soldier I met in the street.  He seemed gratified  &#8212;  
said he was looking out for some place where he could buy food.  Poor 
fellows!  they have been kept moving so constantly, that they could not 
prepare the rations issued to them.  As soon as the men found they 
would not start immediately, they had blazing fires in the open space 
between the American Hotel and the RR 
Depot.  After supper I took more bread + meat + gave them to a crowd of 
five soldiers, who seemed highly gratified.  Large fires were kindled 
along the Railroad (too near the platform for safety) and crowds of 
dusky, clay soiled and smoke-begrimmed men 
were gathered around them.  I spent some time walking around and 
looking at the different groups.  Their behavior and the language of 
most of them, was unexceptionable.  I felt the strongest desire to do 
something for their comfort, but what could I do for so many?  Oh the 
hardships of this terrible war!  Many of these men were tenderly raised  
&#8212;  look at them now!  &#8212;  dirty, ragged, exposed night and day to the 
pityless storm, drenched to the skin, and 
without sufficient food.  &#8212;  But the cowed spirits of the men, their 
submissive manner to every one having a show of authority, is worse 
than the physical suffering.  Military discipline has subdued many a 
haughty temper.  When the wood train arrived, other trains full of 
soldiers started off to Millboro.  Gen. 
Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry went up to Lexington  &#8212;  Imboden's command was 
at Brownsburg last night or this morning.  It is reported that Averell 
was at Salem last night, high waters having prevented his getting off.  
New clothing was issued to many of the soldiers, some of whom took off 
their old boots and shoes in the street and left them there.  One man 
met me at the door of the Quartermaster's office, and asked quite 
humbly if there was any place where he could change his breeches.  I 
took him into my room.  The execution of Coffman did not take place 
to-day, a writ of <u>habeas corpus</u> having been sued out.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, December 19, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">No news to-day from any quarter  &#8212;  A 
rumor that the Yankees were coming up the Valley, and were near 
Harrisonburg.  A telegram was received about dinner time directing the 
Commissary to prepare rations for Roper's Brigade of cavalry; but it 
had not come when I returned home after dark.  Dont know from which quarters it is coming.  A few 
days ago the Brigade was foraging at Ivy Depot, Albemarle, but I hear 
it moved down the Eastern base of the Blue Ridge and entered the Valley 
in Rockingham.</p><p class="p10"><u>12 o'clock</u>.  &#8212;  Between 10 + 11 
o'clock, we were startled by the report of a cannon quite near us.  I 
started out immediately to ascertain the cause, Kate calling to me that 
she had heard cannon passing up the street by our house.  &#8212;  Coming to 
the open space this side of the Academy, I heard voices and could 
discern in the moon light objects on the hill, near Col. Lilly's house.  I went up and found a squad 
with a twelve pound gun giving the signal for the assembling of the 
Home Guard of the county.  They fired thirteen times.  I could get no 
information from them, except that it was reported the Yankees were at 
Harrisonburg, and they were ordered to give the signal.  After coming 
home to tell what I had heard, I went down street, leaving Kate, Kitty, 
Nannie and Mattie sitting around the fire with Va in our room, all in their night clothes.  On 
the street I met soldiers hurrying out (in the direction of 
Harrisonburg) several of whom asked me if the Yankees were near.  Found 
afterwards that a body of troops had passed on before.  Called at Mr. 
Stuart's, and was told by him that a dispatch was received at 7 o'clock 
from Harrisonburg, stating that the Yankees were near that place +, 
since then nothing more had been heard from there.  Went on to the 
Q M's office + office of Command 
of Post, but could get no further intelligence.  Met Alick, who had 
heard that the Yankees were 8 miles from town!  The streets were 
crowded with the remainder of the Brigade, brought in from their camp 
two miles from town, White's Battalion +c.  Several pieces of cannon 
have moved down the road, besides the infantry.  The signal guns seemed 
loud enough the arouse the country, but aunt Sally was undisturbed  &#8212;  
no lights in her house, and I did not arouse her.  All dark and quiet 
too at the Seminary.  Every body in the house except myself has now 
gone to bed, and I hear no noise in the street.  The soldiers seemed to 
be in high spirits, calling for the Home Guard and cracking jokes upon 
oneanother as they passed along.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, Dec. 20, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Much bustle during the former part of the day, but no definite 
intelligence was received in regard to the enemy.  In the afternoon the 
Home Guard moved down the M<sup>c</sup>Adamized road two miles to 
encamp for the night.  Weather cold, but dry and the atmosphere still.  
Trains began to come in from the West, bringing back the troops who 
went up to Millboro on Friday night.  These also moved down the Valley 
road, and will spend the night with or near the Home Guard.  They bring 
word that that Jackson captured one or two hundred 
of Averell's men at Clifton Forge, his cannon and more or less of his 
baggage, and that seven or eight hundred were separated from the main 
body.  The latter effected their escape.  The troops sent to Millboro  
&#8212;  could go no further on account of the high waters, and therefore 
accomplished nothing.  The news of Jackson's success was communicated 
by a cousin.  Young Gallagher of Charlestown, who belongs to the 
12<sup>th</sup> Cavalry, and has been waiting with a small party in the 
Valley, arrived about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  Says he spent last 
night within two miles of the Yankees  &#8212;  that they formed four 
Regiments (Massachusetts) and numbered only sixteen hundred men.  &#8212;  
Our troops, he thought, would not be able to overtake them.  &#8212;  They 
would undoubtedly hurry back as soon as they found we had a force in 
the Valley.  It is said that the Home Guard scouts sent from this place 
on Friday, had a skirmish with the Yankees, having got among them 
before they were aware of it.  Many of them are boys, entirely 
inexperienced.  Gallagher left the Yankees about two miles from 
Harrisonburg.  Many rumors, but no authentic intelligence as to what 
has become of Roper's Brigade.  Fitz Lee's Division, went to Fincastle, 
and, it is said, will be here again to-
morrow.  While we were at dinner to-
day, two soldiers from Tennessee came to the door and applied 
for something to eat  &#8212;  We gave them a meal of what we had, for which 
they seemed grateful.  They  following after 
their Brigade, which started down the Valley last night.  They were 
well clothed and well filled out every way.  I have been struck with 
the robust appearance of all the men  &#8212;  none of the poor delicate 
looking fellows we used to see in the army.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday, December 24, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I returned yesterday evening from an excursion with the Home Guard.  
They started Sunday evening  &#8212;  On Monday Alick and I started to 
overtake them.  Alick expected to go in an ambulance, but after waiting 
till the last moment, and not being able to get one, determined to go 
in his buggy, as he had medicines, surgical instruments +c to take.  I 
intended to join the artillery as soon as we should overtake the 
battery.  We fully expected to come up with the party about North River 
(Mt. Crawford).  On the road we learned that the Guard had gone on to 
Harrisonburg.  Further on we learned that the guard had passed through 
Harrisonburg that morning (Monday) at a rapid pace, in pursuit of the 
Yankees.  The road was full of straggling soldiers, following on after 
the two regular Brigades which had gone down.  Many members of the Home 
Guard also overtook us, or we overtook them.  The Mt. Solon company and 
another company were on the road.  At Mt. Crawford we met a man from 
Harrisonburg, who told us that the Yankees fled from Harrison about 11 
o'clock, just before the Guard entered the town, and there was no 
telling when we could overtake the latter.  We stopped at Mt. Crawford 
to feed the horse, + while we were there the sick +c from the 
Harrisonburg Hospital, who had been removed to Mt. Sidney, passed in 
stages, on their return.  We arrived at H. some time after dark, and spent the 
night at C. C. Strayer's, by invitation.  Mrs. S. gave us many particulars about the the occupation of the place by the enemy.  A party of 
them entered Saturday night, broke open the stores, and destroyed or 
carried off the goods.  On Sunday more of them came and camped by the 
town.  Many of them were very insolent.  Tuesday morning, at an early 
hour we started again  &#8212;  weather very cold and cloudy  &#8212;  passing 
soldiers and members of the Guard  &#8212;  One of the Brigades in camp near 
the Big Spring, the other four miles this side of New Market, and our 
artillery with them, but some distance from the road in a forest.  
Numerous fires along the road, kindled by the soldiers  &#8212;  at some 
points no fences to be seen.  We found the Guard (the mounted portion) 
bivouaed on a hill to the left of New 
Market.  Large fires, every body cheerful, and full of the chase down 
the Valley.  From Harrisonburg to New Market the pursuit was a hot one  
&#8212;  at the latter place our men gave it up, as they had gone as far as 
the character of their organization required.  Mrs. Stoyer (her husband 
was not at home during the occupation) insisted that the enemy numbered 
nearly five thousand  &#8212;  people along the road, who saw the whole 
force, estimated them from 1600 to two thousand.  Late in the afternoon 
we could see one of the regular infantry Brigades moving slowly down 
the road  &#8212;  it was said the Yankees had made a stand at Edinburg  &#8212;  
but no certainty of it.  Late in 
the afternoon Col. Baldwin returned from 
Gen. Early's Headquarters at New Market, 
with orders for the Home Guard to return home.  The bugle was sounded 
and immediately all was bustle.  Legh had gone off from the camp in 
search of corn, and was ignorant of the order to move.  As the Regiment 
moved off the large number of men in it surprised me very much.  Our 
company (the West View) was absent, <u>picketing</u> North Mountain, at Buffalo Gap.  I 
encountered several members of the Artillery, and supposing we would 
camp together that night, made an arrangement for <u>enabling</u> them to ride part of the way home, by 
taking my place in the buggy.  At New Market, we learned that Roper's 
cavalry had come across the Blue Ridge and was in our vicinity.  Eleven 
prisoners captured by them in Fairfax county, were handed over to the 
Guard at New Market, to be brought to Staunton.  We marched for an hour 
or two after dark, meeting the Second Brigade (Walker's) going down.  
The men were full of jokes at the Guard  &#8212;  grinning through their 
dirty faces in a comical manner.  About nine miles from Harrisonburg, 
near the Big Spring, we turned off the Turnpike to encamp in the woods.  
There was every prospect of a heavy snow, but the night was not dark.  
After passing through a stoney field, we 
halted at the woods to arrange the <i>[deleted: plans]</i> for the different 
companies.  &#8212;  Alick complained of cold feet, and proposed getting out 
of the buggy, still holding the reins.  He probably stepped on the 
wheel which turned at any rate from some cause he fell prostrate on the 
ground, and the horse moving off, I supposed that the buggy ran over 
him.  The reins were trailing on the ground and the horse moved so 
slowly at first that I could have safely jumped out.  My feet and legs, 
however, were entangled and before I succeeded in getting free, the 
horse was running at fearful speed.  As I was in the act of getting 
over the back of the buggy, I was dished out and felt as if I were 
thrown some distance.  My forehead against a tree or stone, and for a 
moment I did not know but that I had received a mortal injury.  I rose 
to my feet immediately and felt satisfied that the hurt was not 
dangerous.  My next solicitude was about Alick, which was quickly 
relieved by his calling to me and running up.  Then Legh, who had just 
arrived, came up, and Burdett, Wm H 
Peyton, William Waddell + others    Alick was very slightly hurt.  
Besides my head, my shoulder and legs were bruised, but the most 
painful injury was in my back, just above my left hip.  During the 
first night I could not move without suffering severely, and it is 
still painful when twisted in any degree.  The horse took a circuit 
through the woods, and came to a stand with very little injury to the 
buggy.  While the animal was running the 75 or 100 yards before I was 
thrown out, I realised fully the fearful 
peril I was in.  It was but for a minute.  The thought of God and 
eternity was uppermost in my mind.  I hope I duly acknowledge the mercy 
which spared me, and earnestly pray that the dispensation may be 
blessed to me.  I spent the night in the tent at Headquarters, with 
Col. Baldwin, Lt. Col. Harper, Alick, Mr Bowman (Chaplain), Marquess 
(Adjutant) and others.  Every body was very kind to me.  My feet 
suffered from cold, and I slept very little.  As I could not move about 
without pain, neither turn over or change my position in any way, I 
could not warm myself well by the fire.  Long before day I dragged 
myself out to the fire, and pretty soon our whole mess were up.  The 
Col ordered the bugler to arouse the camp, and by day light we were 
ready to march.  I was helped into an ambulance and came home very 
comfortably.  The artillery camped some miles from us, and did not get 
home till to-day.  Having one disabled man to 
bring home in an ambulance, and eleven prisoners, some of the Guard 
proposed to make a display in Harrisonburg.  We had a little rain and 
snow Tuesday night, and very cold weather all the time.  &#8212;  After the 
Guard (the mounted men) had dispersed, a dispatch came from Gen. Early for them to go to 
<u>Conrad's</u> Store, Rockingham, as a body of 
Yankees were coming up Page Valley in pursuit of Roper.  But as 
Conrad's is out of our bailiwick, the Col. 
declined to recall the men.  Kitty + Mary Stuart went to Richmond 
yesterday on a visit, and Nanny + Mattie to Jenning's Gap, to-day, to spend a week with their grandmother.  I 
omitted to state that I lost my spectacles, when I was thrown from the 
buggy which causes me much embarrassment, particularly as I cannot 
procure others these times.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, December 25, 1863.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Rather a poor Christmas  &#8212;  So most persons think.  But some of the 
children must have enjoyed it.  Addy (Alick's boy) was in a bad humor 
this evening because the day was almost gone.  He wished "there was 
only one day in the whole <u>world</u>, and that 
day was Christmas."  Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry passed through town to-day again, and went down the Valley turnpike.  
One of the men, I heard, call to two negroes and ask if they had had 
any Christmas (poor fellows!  there was none for them  &#8212;  the 
soldiers, I mean)  &#8212;  another was humming the song:  "When this cruel 
war is over."  Imboden's command is within a few miles from town, and 
young Armstrong came in this morning.  He gives a fearful account of 
the sufferings of the men, during the last two weeks  &#8212;  Two of them 
froze to death.  And after all they accomplished nothing, as Averell 
with most most of his command escaped.  Gen. Early has not added to his military 
reputation since he came into the Valley.  It seems to me I could have 
done better myself!  The House of Representatives has passed a bill for 

sending all persons who have employed substitutes, into the army.  I 
think it a piece of flagrant injustice which nothing can palliate.  It 
is bad faith, and miserably impolitic.  &#8212;  Why increase the number of 
soldiers in the field, when we cannot maintain those already there?  
Longstreet cannot follow up his next success in East Tennessee because 
a large part of his army is bare-footed.  But our politicians and 
editors seem to think the army self-sustaining, and wish to thrust 
every man, woman and child into it  &#8212;  except themselves.  &#8212;&#8212;  Mrs. 
Strayer, of Harrisonburg, told us that during the recent occupation of 
that place by the Yankees, they frequently came to her house and 
demanded food.  To one man who applied for something to eat, she said 
she had nothing  &#8212;  He replied, "I do think you d&#8212;n <u>secesh</u> women are the d&#8212;&#8212;st liars I ever saw."  
She said she had nothing cooked, and would not cook for him  &#8212;  he 
must do it himself.  Another came and asked her to leave him a cooking 
utensil.  She urged that she had none except those belonging to the 
store, and could not get others if they were lost.  He pledged his 
honor to return it to her.  Just then another Yankee stepped up and 
said, "What is it you want?  d&#8212;n her, I'll take it."  She remarked, 
"As this one (the first) is a gentlemen, I'll lend it to him," which 
threw the second into a rage which vented itself in curses and threats 
of revenge.  On Sunday night, she heard some one at her front door, and 
upon opening it she found a Yankee soldier, who manifested a desire to 
come in.  He asked, "Are you afraid?"  She replied, No.  He then said, 
"Take me where you stay," which caused her to make some demonstration, 
when he said, "I would not hurt you or yours for the world  &#8212;  I wish 
to make a communication to you."  She then took him to her chamber, 
where he asked if anyone was about.  She replied, no one but her 
children and two Yankees in the kitchen.  He said, "Dont betray me, or my life is lost."  He proceeded 
to tell her that he was a Southern man in the Northern army, that he 
lived in Pennsylvania and wished to go back to his parents, that he 
enlisted for six months to escape the draft, and his term of service 
was nearly up, that he had never fired at a Southern soldier, but 
availed himself of every opportunity to give useful information to our 
side, that the Yankee force at H. was nearly five thousand men and 
twenty-three pieces of cannon, that he was a cousin of Fitzhugh Lee, 
who would know him +c +c.  She give some food, 
and hurried him off, fully persuaded of the truth of his story.  I am 
as fully persuaded that his object was either to get some particularly 
good fare from her, or to entrap her into giving information in regard 
to the position +c of our troops  &#8212;  His information as to the number 
of Yankees in and near the town was positively false.  The Yankee to 
whom she loaned the vessel, took his departure with the others in a 
hurry, but left it with a neighbor, so that she got it back.  On one 
occasion she went into her kitchen and found there two Yankees snug and 
warm by the fire.  One of them yawned out  &#8212;  "Oh how I wish I was by 
my mother's fire!  I'll be there soon and they'll not get me away 
again.  I dont know why I'm fighting these 
people here  &#8212;  I have nothing <u>against</u> 
them  &#8212;  and I aint the only one that thinks

siege of Charleston still continued.  Our condition is certainly not as 
favorable, to all appearances, as a year ago.  It is with the utmost 
difficulty that our men now in the field can be maintained, on account 
of the scarcity of food + clothing; yet Congress is apparently bending 
all its energies to bringing more men into the ranks.  If the various 
measures proposed are carried out, there will be no body left in this 
section to cultivate the fields, and in other regions to manage the 
slaves.  Our Congressmen and editors (both of which classes are exempt 
by the way) seem to think it is only necessary for us to have every 
body in the army (themselves excepted), but exhibited no concern as to 
how they are to be fed and clothed.  Men who have employed substitutes 
have been watching the action of the Senate on the House bill in regard 
to them, with great solicitude.  While it still seems to me impossible 
for the Yankees to succeed in their scheme of subjugation, unless the 
Confederacy chooses to submit, I see nothing ahead but a long and 
dreary war, and incalculable miseries.  Neither party would have 
entered into the contest if the present state of affairs had been 
anticipated.  Neither can now quit.</p><p class="p10">We were at a large wedding party at D. A. Kayser's night before

devoured with a keen appetite.  Such feasts are not common these days.  
Agents have been sent down the Valley to purchase or impress all 
surplus supplies, and I infer that our force is keep them mainly for the purpose of bringing off 
whatever may be collected.

the top of the hill above our house.  Encountering Alick, who was 
riding in the same direction, he informed me that the Yankees were 
burning mills and other buildings, and the people were going on the 
hill to look at the fires.  I then went up, and could see smoke rising 
at several points.  A column would assend, and after a while spread 
away towards the Northwest and disappeared.  Another column <i>[deleted: of 
smoke]</i> would next <i>[illeg.]</i> from a point 
apparently a mile or two distant from the former, and seem to float 
near the ground, spreading over a considerable space.  With my 
spectacles I could see it quite distinctly.  There was various opinions 
as to which mills were burning, every one presuming that the smoke was 
caused by conflagrations of the kind.  Later in the day we heard that 
it was the smoke of the <u>Battle of 
Piedmont</u>!  It is strange that we heard no musketing, and reports 
of cannon only occasionally during the day, and then very indistinctly, 
also though the battle field is only twelve miles distant, we have 
often heard the cannonading below Richmond very distinctly.  No citizen 
of Staunton above the age of infancy, then living, will ever forget 
Sunday, the 5th of June, 1864.  For a week or more we had heard that a 
Yankee force under Gen. Hunter (the same 
force defeated by Breckinridge at New Market) was coming up the Valley, 
and that Crook and Averell were pushing in from the West with another 
large force.  Imboden, with his Skeleton cavalry regiments and a 
company of artillery, was in the Valley; while McCausland and Jackson, 
each with a small force, were between Staunton and Crook + Averell.  
The Reserves (men over 25 + boys of 17) were also with Imboden, and 
during the previous week all men in the county able to bear arms &#8212; 
detailed workmen, farmers +c &#8212; were hastily collected and formed into 
companies, and joined him at North River, near Mt. Crawford.  On 
Thursday and Friday troops arrived from the South West under Gen. W. E. Jones - probably 
2500.  Gen. Jones joined the army at North 
River Saturday morning and assumed command.  The army, finding our men 
very strongly posted and entrenched moved to Port Republic and arrived 
there before Jones knew or could believe they had gone from his front.  
During the night our army moved to a point between New Hope and Mt. 
Meridian, near a village called Piedmont.  Skirmishing commenced early 
Sunday morning.  From 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning till 3 in the 
afternoon citizens of the town were on the hills observing the smoke 
rising from the battle field.  The firing could not be heard, except 
occasionally the report of a cannon.  It was Sacrament Sunday in our 
church, but many of us could not attend.  In the meanwhile diligent 
preparations for departure in case of disaster were going on at the 
various Government Depots and offices - packing up goods + papers, 
loading wagons +c.  I had my trunk taken down to the Q.M.'s office, containing not only 
clothing but a tin box with every valuable paper I had in the world &#8212; 
public + private bonds, vouchers +c, $11.000 coupon bonds belonging to 
Mr. Stuart + similar papers belonging to other persons.  I still hoped, 
however, that the enemy would be repulsed and we could remain at home, 
especially as several persons told me that the smoke was 
receding, as if our army was driving the enemy back.  
Just before my trunk arrived, the wagon already fully loaded waiting 
for it, I heard some one say, "Gen Jones 
is killed and our army routed."  Such was the intelligence from the 
battle field.  I cannot depict the horror of the feelings.  The wagon 
train was ready to start and I was about to go with it, to be near my 
trunk, on foot, but a Government mule was provided to me.  I then rode 
back home to take another farewell, and about Six o'clock rode slowly 
out of town by the Greenville road.  I was inexpectedly sad and anxious, especially as I 
could learn nothing in regard to my brother Legh's fate.  I felt 
perfectly indifferent in regard to myself.  My sister Cornelia's 
anxious countenance as I last saw her on the porch, haunted me during 
the night.  We moved on without stopping, till we arrived between 12 + 
1 o'clock at Smith's tavern, three miles above Greenville.  There we 
rested till morning to feed horses +c.  The road was full of refugees, 
with wagons, horses, cattles, wagons and 
nearly all kinds of movable property.  Before day light several parties 
came to Smith's, and early in the morning we were joined by a large 
number of Government officials and employees from Staunton.  We turned 
to the left at Midway, to cross the Blue Ridge at Tye Run Gap.  Reached 
the top of the mountain at 12 or 1 o'clock.  Pitched our tents &#8212; Mrs. 
Jno. B. Baldwin + two sisters, of Staunton, 
came up + spent the night in one of our tents.  Many other persons from 
town, not of our party, were near us.  The remainder of our wagons, 
four of which left Staunton at one o'clock Mondy morning, caught up to us.  Mrs. B. the Bank 
officers +c went on Tuesday morning  &#8212;  we remained till Wednesday 
morning.  Several messengers were sent to Midway for intelligence.  We 
heard that Jackson was at that point, that 1500 of our cavalry had 
passed down the Valley to join Gen. Vaughn 
(who took command after Jones fell) at Waynesboro.  &#8212;  then that Crook 
was driving McCausland up the Brownsburg road, then that McCreary 
occupied Staunton on Monday.  Wednesday morning C. C. Francisco and 
others passed by with their trains and droves.  The soldiers from our 
hospitals, able to walk, also passed  &#8212;  some 300.  From Francisco I 
got the first intelligence of Legh.  &#8212;  he was at home Monday morning 
and was going to the army again, his company having been temporarily 
disbanded to take off their property.  I afterwards learned that he was 
in the fight of Sunday and was highly commended for his conduct.  His 
company was mounted and after skirmishing as cavalry, they were 
dismounted and taken in the fight as infantry.  Legh was one of the men 
detailed to take their horses to the rear, but a man next him begged to 
have the place, and surrendering it to him, he went into the fight with 
the company.  He did not lose his spectacles, otherwise he would have 
been almost blind.  &#8212;  John Opie commanded the company, and it, with 
Peck's, both composed of farmers hastily collected, is said to have 
saved our army from total rout.  On Wednesday we descended the 
Mountain, and after a painful ride to me, reached a comfortable place 
owned by a Mr. Hubbard, five miles from Arrington Depot, Orange + Alex RR, in 
Nelson Co.  Here I hoped to stay several 
days, but at dusk a courier arrived from Gen. Vaughn, with an order for the wagons to 
come on to him at Rockfish Gap.  I had orders to come on with the train 
next day (Thursday).  Bell, Price, Baily, +c came on early Thursday 
morning  &#8212;  I started later with the wagons, leaving Capt. Phillips, A. D. Wren, Blackley, Candler +c 
at Hubbards with our private property and a considerable amount of 
public stores.  I gave my tin box and another containing Va's and Kate's jewelry to Capt. P. as I could not bring a trunk with me, 
requesting him to leave them with Mrs. J. N. McCue, who lived in the 
neighborhood, if he thought they would be safer there.  I also left in 
my trunk with my clothing, a book containing my diary from January 
1<sup>st</sup> to June 15 1864.  From notes taken on slips of paper 
before my return home I extract the following:</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday evening, June 10th. 1864,</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We left our quarters yesterday morning after a late hour.  Nothing 
of interest occurred till we arrived in the evening at our camping 
ground.  Lushbaugh + Son, Short and Bunch went to a house near at hand 
to get cherries, where they heard a report that a party of Yankees had 
passed on to the Depot on the O + 
Alex RR.  They sent back to inform 
me, but when inquiring I ascertained that the party consisted of twelve 
men and several women, with carriages and two guns!  So we had a quiet 
night.  Slept in a tent, and boiled genuine coffee in a skillet.  
Kate's servant John being one of the teamsters, took charge of my 
horse.  During the day we passed through Livingston.</p><p class="p10">Started this morning (Friday 10<sup>th</sup>) at an early hour and 
have had quite a pleasant ride.  Soon one of the Maj's "couriers" met us with a "dispatch" a part 
of which, relating to the party <i>[illeg.]</i> <i>[illeg.]</i>, we could not 
understand; but Thomburg sent the courier on, directing him to order 
the party (Phillips') up.  As we rode along, heard the report of cannon 
in the direction of Rockfish Gap  &#8212;  five or six shots.  I met Wm. Taylor of Westview in the road, and he 
informed me that Legh's two negro boys were in a camp near the road a 
few miles ahead with a party of Augusta men.  We passed 
Garrett Martin's where Thomburg engaged some clover 
for the horses and mules.  I was sent for to go back + settle the 
account.  Arriving near dinner time, I accepted a hearty invitation to 
wait for dinner.  Those of our party who were on horseback moved very 
irregularly  &#8212;  up and down the road, often stopping.  Contradictory 
reports from Rockfish Gap  &#8212;  First that Breckinridge had 7000 or 8000 
reinforcements  &#8212;  then that the whole number was 4000.  Every body we 
met was talking about the burning of property + mills in Staunton, but 
we could get no particulars.  Found W. J. D. Bell, W. H. Peyton and J. 
D. Craig +c in quarters on the road side, with their negroes and stock.  
Miss J. S. Stover and Dr. Churchman, of Augusta, in the road.  They had 
heard that the Yankees made a first this morning against our men near 
Waynesboro, while their main body was moving towards Lexington; but 
that Imboden was about to start in pursuit with 4000 cavalry.  I called 
to see Legh's boys.  Met Price + Baily coming from Afton Depot, on the 
Mountain, to Bell + Peyton's quarters, to spend the night.  They 
repeated the rumor about the skirmish at Waynesboro and the movement of 
the many towards Lexington.  Said that the Yankees burned the 
Government work shops in Staunton, but got out our engine and hose and 
threw water on Lyttleton Waddell's house and saved it.  Here we are now 
at Hebron Church, five miles from Afton.  Have possession of the church 
for quarters.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday evening, June 11, 1864.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We were up early this morning, and had a miserable breakfast, as 
usual.  I rode back to Stover's camp to see Legh's boys, and got some 
very good corn bread.  &#8212;  put a large piece in my haversack.  Rode on 
and passing our wagon train to Afton.  The reports of last night were 
all encouraging, and I expected to ride straight through to Staunton.  
But on arriving at Afton my hopes were dashed.  We were told that we 
had no force competent to meet the Yankees, and if Breckinridge 
returned to Staunton he would be <u>gobbled 
up</u>.  I went on to Waynesboro.  Found the people there cheerful, 
got no information as to friends in Staunton.  Met Legh there  &#8212;  he 
had been scouting intensively through the country  &#8212;  was found with a 
few officers when the Yankees burnt Mt Torrey Furnace (that is he was 
in sight), he and Wash Patterson captured two Yanks 
having a horse and two mules.  All reports state that the main body of 
the enemy have gone towards Lexington, but it is supposed they have a 
strong force still at Staunton.  Parties of them have attempted to pass 
the Blue Ridge at various gaps.  John Opie went on a scout alone last 
night.  On the Greenville road he captured a Yankee who professed to be 
brother of Gen. Breckinridge's Chief of 
Staff.  Took him with him as he went round to the Middlebrook road down 
as far as Legh's place.  Every body took him for a Yankee, and he got 
no information from any one except Philip, Selena's husband.  Gen. Breckinridge, at Mt. Top, sends four scouts 
to Staunton to-night for information.  A 
portion of his infantry passed through Waynesboro while I was there and 
quartered just out of town on the Staunton road.  Imboden with cavalry 
is pursuing the enemy w/i the Valley.  Some of the Yankees are said to 
have crossed to this (Eastern) side of the Mt.  The destination of the 
whole army is said to be Lynchburg.  A larger supply train guarded by 
1500 men, is said to have reached Staunton today, from Winchester.  [It 
arrived Friday morning.]  Opie says the prospects of Staunton have not 
suffered at the hands of the Yankees, except owners of mills and 
factories.  He brought his prisoner through Waynesboro to 
Breckinridge's quarters.  Our army is on the Mt. and along the Western 
base  &#8212;  a motley set, too small in number to meet the Yankee force 
which is estimated at more than 20,000.  Some breast works have been 
thrown up over the Mt.  I returned to Afton, and coming back to our 
camp, 1 1/2 miles towards Lexington, met Tate (W. M.) who came with us.  We have a large party for 
one tent.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday, June 13, 1864</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yesterday morning we broke up our encampment taking things very 
leisurely as we had no advices from the Mt.  Tate and I came up to 
Afton, where we received the gratifying intelligence that the army was 
open to Staunton  &#8212;  the enemy all gone and Breckinridge in pursuit up 
the Valley.  The Mt was cleared of our men, except a few wagons (!) 
stragglers and the Provost's Guard.  We passed in Waynesboro an hour or 
two and then hurried on to Staunton.  Two horses died, killed in 
skirmishes lay along the turnpike.  From Fishersville to Staunton the 
Railroad track is torn up and bridges burnt.  Upon getting home found 
the RR Depots, Steam Mill, Woolen 
Factory, Government Grain Houses, Government Work Shops, <u>stage stables</u> +c burnt.  Much private property 
in the neighborhood  &#8212;  fences +c destroyed + on the mountain we heard 
that a party of Yankees had got to Arrivington Depot and burnt the 
buildings and twenty-odd RR cars.  Feel 
uneasy in regard to Phillips and his party.  Was gratified and I hope 
grateful to God at finding all friends safe and well.  Nearly all the 
houses had been searched for provisions and arms.  Nothing taken from 
ours.  A Yankee had stole a small coffee pot from the kitchen and some 
onions were taken from the garden.  Every body has a story to tell 
about the Yankee.  Mauzy's printing presses broken up, and the fixtures 
and machinery of the Shoe Factory destroyed.  Several negroes with 
Phillips have came in  &#8212;  they say the party was surprised and 
captured by the Yankees  &#8212;  my tin box + papers and trunk of course 
gone.  A. H. Taylor of Staunton with his stack +c were encamped within 
two miles of Phillips.  It is feard Taylor 
was killed his family are in a state of great suspense.  Kate has just 
come in  &#8212;  has heard that the Yankees while here turned over the 
tombs of my father + mother and Cornelia (Kitty's mother) in search of 
hidden treasure.  For the first time Kate shed tears.  Aunt Sally's Tom 
went off with the Yankees.  He rode round with them here, dressed in 
Yankee uniform, in high glee.  All of our other servants acted 
admirably.  Selena is laid up from the effects of her alarm +c   A 
report that the Yankee force sent against Lexington has been routed.  
The prisoners taken by them after Sunday's battle were brought to 
Staunton  &#8212;  among them our nearest neighbor, Jno. Price.  The prisoners were sent off under 
guard on the Parkersburg road.  Price and several others escaped and 
came home.  R. L. Doyle of Staunton + Harry Bear of Churchville were 
killed.  I append an account of things which Va wrote to sent to me:</p><p class="p10">"Monday, June 6<sup>th</sup>. 1864.  &#8212;  A memorable day in 
Staunton!  I had been very unwell and lying on the lounge all the 
morning.  Fanny Skinner came in, and we were discussing the mobility of 
the Yankees in getting Staunton, when the door was burst open and 
Selena, with horror stricken countenance rushed in, calling to me in 
the most terrified manner, 'They're coming!  They're coming!  Miss 
Virginia, they're coming!'  Jinney and little Mary followed her, both 
screaming with terror.  Kitty, Nanny + Matty were pale and trembling, 
and all gathered in my room, as if that were the only safe place to be 
found.  Before I could quiet them, Wright ran in screaming out, 'They 
shelling the town, and you must fly to the basement!'  Forthwith we all 
pitched to the cellar, and I took a moment to look around me.  The 
scene was so ludicrous that I burst into a hysterical fit of laughter.  
Added to the scene was Kate undressed, her clothes in her arms, and 
Fanny frantic because she was from home and her mother would be beside 
herself lest James should be dragged out of bed and carried off.  I 
undertook to <u>protect</u> her till she got 
within reach of home, but was so near fainting before we got to our 
stable that I had to turn back and send Selena with her, although she 
was as much frightened as Fanny.  Just as I got back to our gate a 
whole company of cavalry dashed by me, over the hill towards Mrs. 
Skinner's, but did not seem to notice me.  We got through the day and 
night without much feeling of alarm, and without being much annoyed, 
except by so many coming to the hydrant for water and to the kitchen 
for food.  Mr. Stuart and Alick came up in the afternoon_  Alick much 
excited, Mr. S. calm as usual.  Tuesday morning the burning commenced 
early  &#8212;  Depot, Steam Mill, Work Shops, Trotter's Shops and Stages, 
Garber's Mill +c. The wind was high and we expected to see the whole 
town in flames, but even Nanny's house (Lyt. Waddell's) was saved.  She remained in it 
all the while.  Aunt Betty was moved to Aunt Sally's in a bed.  I sent 
for Nanny to come up here, but she preferred to remain as long as she 
could.  A committee of gentlemen waited on Hunter to see if the work 
shops and shoe factory could not be pulled down and Mrs. Arthur went in 
person and laid her case before the General  &#8212;  besought him not to 
burn the Shoe Factory, as the other buildings could not be saved.  Mr. 
Campbell, Mayor Frank, Mr. Stuart, Alick and some others went down  &#8212;  
were received by Col. Strother ('Port 
Crayon'), who represented Gen. Hunter.  He 
agreed that the work shops should not be burnt, if the citizens would 
bind themselves to pull them down, which they did, but still the fire 
was applied without notice being given.  All the internal part of the 
Shoe Factory was destroyed, and it must have been ludicrous to see Mrs. 
A. N. Taylor flying across the street, axs in 
hand, to assist in the work.  She was so much afraid of fire that she 
went to expedite the destruction as much as possible.  After the houses 
were consumed the Yankees began to track up for a more, and we could 
hear them saying to one another, 'Bad news,' but could not quite hear 
what, until it leaked out they were short of provisions and had heard 
that their wagon train had been captured.  Before they began to track 
up some of the houses were searched, but a stop was put to it, and by 
dinner time not a Yankee was seen in town.  Our scouts were on the 
hills in a little time, and we felt too happy to think whether the 
enemy would return.  Kate and I went out after to dinner, and by 4 
o'clock the town was perfectly alive with Yankees again.  I learned 
from some of the men that they had gone to reinforce Averell, but met 
him coming in.  on Wednesday Crook and Averell came, and it seemed to 
me that the locusts of Egypt could not have been more numerous.  Our 
yard and kitchen were overrun all the while, and the streets were 
filled from end to end.  There was a camp on Mrs. Suly's lot just 
opposite our house, and one on the hill near Mrs. Skinner's.  The house 
searching commenced in good earnest on Wednesday.  I had heard so much 
about breaking locks that I unlocked every door about the house.  When 
the officer came I told him he could not take me at a better time  &#8212;  
I was out of everything.  He was very gentlemanly and went through it 
as a matter of form, but did not disturb a thing, nor did he open a 
door himself.  He found us so poverty stricken that he had not the 
heart to take the little we had.  Fortunately we had borrowed a barrel 
of flour on Monday.  They took two barrels from Mr. Stuart, two from 
Alick, and six from Sister Agnes [Augusta Female Seminary].  They got 
two tons of provisions from Ben Crawford, which our men ought to have 
had long ago.  Nick Trout and Frank Points were arrested and kept in 
guardhouse until this morning or last night [Points in jail]  They 
picked up Geo. Fuller coming up from 
Waynesboro.  Trout was accused of concealing arms, and Points of <u>showing pleasure</u> when they left town on 
Tuesday.  Fuller was thought to be a spy, as he had letters from 
soldiers to their families.  They cooped up our men held as prisoners 
in one old guard house.  We all made bread for them as soon as they 
drew rations.  Several drunken parties went to Mrs. Skinners  &#8212;  
demanded brandy and wine  &#8212;  went into Jim's room, as excited him very 
much  [He is severely wounded in the head]  Mrs. Skinner had an 
acquaintance among the Yankees, for whom she sent, and he put a guard 
at the house, which prevented further annoyance.</p><p class="p10">"Friday.  &#8212;  Most of the Yankees left this morning.  Since dinner a 
Regiment has passed, just arrived from Martinsburg.  I understand most 
of the troops took the Lexington road, and I feel so concerned about 
it.  Cant bear the idea of their getting to Lexington or Lynchburg.  As 
a family we have great reason for gratitude to God, for having so far 
protected us from injury.  Our servants were <u>such</u> a comfort to me &#8212; they could not have 
behaved better, and I really feel thankful to them.  Quite a number of 
negroes ran off.  Tom asked aunt Sally's consent to wait on an officer 
who would pay well.  Jim Brigham came up to show himself this morning -
- very thoughtful.  And now if I could only hear from you, how happy I 
would be!  I know you are suffering on our account much more than us 
here.  I cant even know where you are.  The Railroad is torn up, of 
course, and when we shall have another mail is more we can tell.  I am 
so glad you were away from home.  The little minutiae I will leave for 
Kate to relate, who will enjoy going over them more than <u>drinking tea</u>.  Wright has been a treasure, and 
so has Selena.</p><p class="p10">"I attach this certificate given to me by the Yankee who searched

<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, June 14, 1864.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This morning I walked up to Legh's to see Belle and the children.  
Legh left home again yesterday for the army.  Found Belle and her 
mother in a state of great anxiety and very unprotected.  The Yankees, 
who were at the house all the time they were about Staunton, had broken 
out the sashes of their windows, broken a door and some of the 
furniture, and had taken off six horses and colts, and some bacon +c.  
John Hill stood up to them manfully, showing remarkable fidelity.  On 
the way up the road I heard a report that the Yankees were returning by 
the Greenville road.  As I had left McNeill's company in town, and 
there was no such report here I regarded it as an idle story, and 
proceeded to nail up the windows and door.  Afterwards started home, 
but met Wright who had been sent by Va to 
tell me the Yankees were coming.  I went back to the house, and taking 
Legh's fine horse (the negro boys Jim + John returned home Sunday with 
this horse and another) I rode off into the woods with him, ordering 
the boys to follow with the other horse.  I tied the horse in a retired 
place and came down to the road in search of information &#8212; first to 
Peaco's, Henderson's and Harrison's &#8212; heard various rumors but got 
nothing satisfactory.  Returned to Legh's intending to leave the horses 
with the boys in the woods, and came to town myself along the old road 
through the fields.  Before I started, however, Wright came back to 
tell me it was a false alarm.  There had been great conversation in 
town.  Some persons have suffered much from the Yankees in loss of 
property &#8212; others escaped entirely.  Donaghe's, Opie's and A. H. 
Taylor's barns are laid waste.  Almost everybody lost horses, +c. +c.  
There seems to be no doubt that the Yankees have taken Lexington after 
a slight opposition from McCausland and the Cadets &#8212; the Institute +c 
burnt.  No news from Breckinridge or Imboden.  A party of Yankee 
raiders is said to have been defeated at Trevilian's, in Louisa Co.  A number of negroes who remained with Capt. Phillips at Hubbard's have come in.  A. D. 
Wren has also arrived, having made his escape.  Still some doubt as to 
the fate of A. H. Taylor.  All concur in stating that Phillips and most 
of his party were captured, and the property with them destroyed.  
Those of us who left Hubbard's on Thursday, were obliged to leave 
behind nearly all of our private baggage.  My trunk was in there, 
containing clothing and my diary from January, and my tin box with 
valuable papers &#8212; among them $5300 coupon bonds, more than $400 in 
money, Mr. Stuarts coupons ($11,000) and many others, Va's + Kate's jewelry +c +c.  My only hope is 
that Capt. P. took the horses, as I 
suggested to him, to Mrs. J. N. McCue's. &#8212; D. A. Kayson and others had 
large amounts of money + bonds with the same party.  They were 
surprised by the Yankees while preparing to move.  Alick's Nathan, who 
was with Mr. Taylor, was captured but escaped and has come home.  Says 
he saw Aunt Sally's Tom with the Yankees.  He (Nathan) tried to bring 
off Alick's horse, but could not.  Legh has a Yankee horse at home, he 
picked up on the road.  The cars move up to Fishersville.  The town 
desolate in appearance &#8212; no business.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Legh and Mrs. Nelson returned from Midway to-
day_  could not find our army.  They undertook to capture a 
party of Yankees near Midway, who escaped and afterwards proved to be 
some of our men &#8212; Rockbridge Reserves &#8212; each mistaking the other for 
Yankees.  L. reports many Yankee guns between Arbor Hill and 
Middlebrook, and puddles of blood in the road.  Jim Suthards, captured 
with Phillips and released near Lexington, got home this morning.  
Jacob Points, who escaped capture has also got back.  Taylor is said to 
be at Midway, wounded in the arm.  Various reports of a fight between 
Imboden and the Yankees in Amherst.  Rumors of a fight in Georgia, in 
which Gen (Bishop) Polk was killed.  We do 
not know where the Yankee army under Hunter is now. &#8212; supposed to be 
near Lynchburg.  No mail yet.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Heard this morning that Hunter was at Buchanan, in Botetourt, and 
Breckinridge in Amherst.  <u>10 o'clock at 
night</u>. &#8212; Still no mail and no reliable intelligence from any 
quarter.  It is said the Yankees shot one man and hung another in 
Lexington.  Reported that Crook or Averell brought off Dr. Creigh a 
prisoner from Lewisburg, and when they got to Rockbridge hung him and 
left his body suspended to a tree.  Since my return home the town has 
been as quiet every day as Sunday.  Stores and shops closed, a few men 
sitting about here and there talking over the events of the last two 
weeks, even the little children are less noisy than usual.  <i>[deleted: The 
country and people have]</i>  Every thing looks like a tornado had 
swept the country, and left the stillness of death in its track.  Many 
farmers having lost their horses, are unable to work their corn.  Alick 
is riding a Yankee mule borrowed from a person who picked him up.  I 
saw Jim Suthards this evening, and he gives no room to hope that 
Phillips took my box to Mrs. McCue's.  Selena is quite ill, threatened 
with an affection of the brain, brought on by excitement and alarm 
while the Yankees were here.  The poor negroes who went off are likely 
to suffer for it.  Price says he heard a Yankee Colonel advise them to 
come back.  An old woman of C. R. Mason's stole all the silver +c that 
had been hid and went to the Yankee camp.  They received the stolen 
goods, but left her on the hill when they departed.  She returned home 
yesterday or to-day, having no where else to 
go.  She has but one leg!  Va and I, 
Kitty + Nanny + Matty Tate walked to the top of the opposite hill this 
evening to see the desolation on Donaghe's + Opie's farms.  And what 
does it all amount to?  The country is further from subjugation to 
Yankee rule than before.  The last report about A. H. Taylor is that he 
was near Lynchburg, unhurt.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, June 17, 1864.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yankee!  Yankee!  Nothing but Yankees from morning till night, till 
the name is utterly loathsome.  The last report is that Hunter was at 
Liberty, Bedford Co.  Ewell corps. under 
Early, was moving to-day by Railroad from 
Charlottesville to Lynchburg.  Heavy cannonading was heard.  No train 
up to Fishersville, and the reports received came by one person on 
horseback and another who came on a hand-car.  To-
day as Sunday-like as yesterday.  Grant is said to be at 
Harrison's Landing, north side of James River.  Lincoln and Andrew 
Johnson have been nominated for President + Vice President at 
Baltimore, and Fremont for President at Cleveland.  Va has been enumerating the articles of jewelry 
in the box captured by Yankees  &#8212;  I did not know she had so much.  
Many of the Yankees who were here seem to have been gentlemanly 
persons, having no heart for this business  &#8212;  others were more 
plunderous.  &#8212;  They appeared to be scared all the time.  Made no 
distinction between black and white, but took two horses from Bob 
Miller, a free negro.  One day two officers handsomely dressed, rode up 
to our garden, where Wright was working and asked him if he thought his 
mistress could furnish dinner to them.  He said he reckoned not as they 
had searched the house and barely left us enough &#8212; (they had taken 
nothing)  They inquired my name and asked if I was at home.  Legh's 
man, John Hill, told them who were plundering the farm, that he had 
promised "Maj Legh" he would take care of 
things, and he would stay if they killed him.  Mr. Stuart and Sister 
gave me a graphic account to night of the 
entrance of the Yankees into town.  They heard they were coming and at 
the same time saw four or five of our solders passing.  Mr. S. warned 
them of their danger, and they ran back toward the Presbyterian Church 
but immediately every street seemed to be full of Yankee cavalry, 
dashing about + firing their pistols.  They caught several of our men.  
The prisoners taken by them on the battlefield and elsewhere, some of 
them our own citizens, were cooped up in the lot enclosed with a high 
fence for the use of our Provost's Guard, and crowded to the gate, 
beseeching persons who were having their rations of flour baked, to 
send them a little butter or meat.  Some would try to climb up on the 
fence, but were ordered down by the guard.  The Yankees boasted of 
having some of their men in town Sunday evening, while the stampede was 
going on, and even on the previous Friday.  The men were terribly 
profane &#8212; almost every word had a d&#8212;n to it  &#8212;  One of them killed 
by our scouts is buried near an oak tree on the Waynesboro road, 
opposite the Lunatic Asylum.  I saw an ambulance this evening going 
from the Hospital to the burying ground with the remains of four 
Soldiers  &#8212;  all the coffins were head foremost.  <i>[deleted: We hear that 
the Yankees burnt Col. Preston's house in

<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, June 18, 1864.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The telegraph is up again and working from Richmond to Staunton.  
Intelligence this evening that Grant has crossed to the South Side of 
James River.  He captured some entrenchments <i>[deleted: thrown up]</i> by 
Beauregard, but was driven out by Lee.  Fighting near Petersburg.  When 
Lee captured three hundred prisoners.  Breckinridge has passed through 
Lynchburg  &#8212;  Early somewhere about there.  It is said there was some 
fighting at Balcony Falls, on James River, between Lexington and 
Lynchburg, where M<sup>c</sup>Causland and the Cadets probably made a 
stand and drove the Yankees further up, so that they crossed the 
mountain into Bedford.  Accounts we have from Lexington, represent the 
treatment of that place by the Yankees as much more than Staunton 
suffered.  Shells were thrown into the town &#8212; the Institute was burnt 
&#8212; the College defaced_  Hunter made the house of Ex-Governor Letcher 
his head quarters, and rising from dinner one day remarked to Mrs. L. 
it was the last meal she would eat in the house.  It was immediately 
fired &#8212; clothing and bedding were thrown out the windows, but they 
were cast into flames by the soldiers.  Three men <sup>citizens</sup> 
accused of <u>bushwhacking</u> were taken out 
and shot.  A large number of negroes went off with the Yankees.  It is 
said the Yankee raiders under Sheridan received a signal defeat in 
Louisa &#8212; last all of their cannon and six hundred prisoners.  The 
Yankees while here threw a number of bomb shells into the creek.  &#8212;  
the boys have been fishing them up and opening them to get the powder.  
One exploded to-day while a negro man was 
opening it  &#8212;  killed the man, and the fragments flew to a great 
distance.  A. H. Taylor has at last got home, safe and sound &#8212; lost 
only his horses and hogs.  Capt. Phillips 
was still a prisoner, at last accounts, with Candler and Blackley, 
although the Yankees paroled and released Capt. O. Smith + others.  A. D. Wren says 
Phillips intended to go to Mrs. McCue's the day the Yankees came upon 
them  &#8212;  Saturday last 11<sup>t</sup>.  The last hope of my papers 
having been saved is gone.  Wren says they were waiting for dinner when 
the Yankees rode up and shouted "Surrender you d&#8212;n rebels!"  He ran to 
a wheat field + hid.  We are just finding out what abundant supplies 
some of our citizens had, even of delicacies, since the Yankee 
searches.  I doubt if there was ever so much flour in families at the 
same season of the year.  Many persons, however, were poorly 
supplied.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, June 19, 1864</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Reported this evening that Hunter got near enough to Lynchburg to 
throw two shells into the city, one of which killed a boy; that Early 
attacked him yesterday evening, and defeated him, capturing some 
prisoners and cannon; that he advanced upon him this morning, but found 
his army retreating in confusion, and was in pursuit.  Breckinridge is 
supposed not to have been present, but in a position to intercept the 
enemy.  There is talk of three of our citizens having given information 
to the enemy while here.  A Yankee officer gave their names to Hite 
Opie, who was a prisoner in their hands for a day or two.  The 
treachery of the Yankees while they were here was apparently without 
motive, although characteristic of the people.  They promised Mauzy 
<u>not</u> to injure his printing 
statt<i>[illeg.]</i>ment and even gave him a written "protection," but 
turned in and broke up the presses, threw out the types, and tore to 
pieces and soiled the paper.  An officer rode up to the sentinel and 
stationed at the work shops, handing him written orders from Gen. Hunter, as he said, told him to shoot down 
any man who should fire the buildings.  Mr. Stuart was present and 
heard it all.  In a few minutes the sentinel was withdrawn, and the 
buildings were in flames.  Yet from all accounts there were many 
persons among them whose hearts were not in the business, and who did 
not hesitate to express their detestation of the rapacious and 
destructive spirit which activate the army generally.  Averell's men 
were much worse than Hunter's.  The latter general punished two of his 
men in the public street for breaking into stores, one by tying a rail 
to his back, and the other by cowhiding.  At night the town was 
perfectly quiet, and the citizens felt safe.  During the day, however, 
there was a reign of terror.  Many Yankee soldiers dressed in 
Confederate uniform, called "Jesse Scouts," were traversing the 
country, and several persons, taking them for our own soldiers, told 
them all about their affairs, where they had property hid +c.  Dr. 
Davidson even took some of them into the woods to see a fine horse he 
had secluded here in charge of a negro boy  &#8212;  horse + boy were both 
taken off.  The first party who went to Legh's met little Lucy, and 
Said to her, "Sis, where is your father?"  She replied, "He was at home 
last night, but has gone back to the army."  Several Yankee spies were 
in town on Sunday, the 5<sup>th</sup>, the day of the battle.  While 
the army occupied the town, they told Mr. Dice of the Methodist Church, 
that they heard him preach, on Sunday, and repeated a portion of his 
prayers.  The officers were handsomely dressed.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, June 20, 1864</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Aunt Betsy died this morning.  Death is so familiar to us that we 
cannot feel as formerly.  Many reports to-day  
&#8212;  one that Hunter and Averell have been killed.  The Yankees have 
committed great depredations in Nelson.  Somebody came up to night with a Charlottesville paper.  &#8212;  I 
presume the mail came also.  The paper states that Early took 404 
prisoners at Lynchburg and 3 pieces of cannon, and that the Yankees 
were retreating  &#8212;  that Grant had got within a mile and a half of 
Petersburg  &#8212;  and that Morgan was in Kentucky, within 16 or 18 miles 
of Cincinnati, when, according to Northern reports, he had captured 
1500 Yankees, but had at last been defeated.  A lady has got through 
from Philadelphia and reports that the Russell ministry in England, so 
hostile to us, has been defeated in Parliament.  &#8212;  I have been unwell 
for several days past.  Very listless.  The whole community in a state 
of inertia.  Almost all the places of business still closed.  I have 
been trying to amuse myself with one of Scott's novels, but history and 
romance pale before the realities and excitements of these times.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, June 21, 1864</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Aunt Betsy's funeral took place this morning.  No news during the 
day.  The mail received last night was distributed this morning  &#8212;  
many newspapers  &#8212;  the latest dated on Friday, the 17<sup>th</sup>.  
I don't like the appearance of things about Petersburg.  The enemy 
pressing us there vigorously.  Strange that we cannot get a word from 
Lynchburg, or that quarter.  I rode up to Legh's this afternoon  &#8212;  
wheat and corn look well  &#8212;  the latter needing rain.  Coming back I 
met a report that the Yankees were at Middlebrook!  Not believed.  We 
hear of horrible devastations by the Yankees in Lexington.  Letcher's 
house was burnt because he issued circulars, urging the people to fire 
upon the enemy wherever they could.  In one house the Yankees emptied a 
barrel of flour on the parlor carpet, and poured a barrel of sorghum 
molasses upon it; they then walked in the mixture and tracked the house 
all over with it.  Such is the petty meanings of our foe.  Judge 
Thompson has returned from Amherst.  He was hiding in the woods several 
times.  Says he feels deeply humiliated.  The wretches violated three 
females in Amherst  &#8212;  a young girl who died, and two married women  -
-  Legh says that he did not know we were defeated in the battle of 
Piedmont, till he had retreated some distance.  He was on the right 
wing of the army, which was successful; our left was broken and fled.  
After retreating for some distance, under orders, he became suspicious 
and remarked to W. J. Nelson that he would not be surprised if the 
Yankees were there in Staunton.  This was regarded as absurd  &#8212;  the 
men generally thought the movement was for the purpose of heading the 
enemy.  Legh insists that it was a retreat, although conducted in good 
order, his company being in the rear.  Upon arriving at Armitage, it 
was announced that those of the company who were farmers had permission 
to go home to take off their stock.  The information as to the state of 
affairs, thus conveyed, was astounding to them.  The left wing was 
pretty much routed, and the men not killed or captured came pell-mell 
into Staunton after night.  Legh and several others came into town late 
at night, very cautiously, not knowing that the Yankees were here.  He 
came to town the next day, and went out the Hebron Church and as the 
Yankees entered from the opposite direction.  &#8212;  Jackson was there at 
Hebron Church, 5 miles west of town.  He had to take a circuitous route 
to Greenville, and from there joined our army at Waynesboro.  While in 
the country this evening I heard the sound of cannon at a great 
distance  &#8212;  twice, very distinctly.  It has been heard every day for 
about a week past.  It is singular that, I did not hear a single report 
of cannon or small arms fired at Piedmont, eleven or twelve miles 
distant, although I saw the smoke of battle from the hill, but have 
frequently heard the sound as far off as Richmond.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, June 22, 1864.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Many reports during the day.  Some of which came in a Lynchburg 
paper received this evening.  I give a list.  1<sup>st</sup> Our Gen. Ransom was fighting the enemy yesterday at 
Buchanan, 2<sup>nd</sup> That all the people of Rockbridge had been 
called out to blockade the roads, 3<sup>rd</sup> That Gen. Early had captured 2500 Yankees at Liberty, 
and, according to one version, taken all of their artillery, 
4<sup>th</sup> That Gen. Johnston had 
acquired a considerable success in Georgia, 5<sup>th</sup> That the 
enemy had been badly beaten at Petersburg, 6<sup>th</sup>that the 
Yankee Sheridan had been defeated again, this time at Harrison's 
Landing, with the loss of 800 men, 7<sup>th</sup> That our cavalry had 
destroyed all of the Yankee Landings on James River.  Too much good 
news for one day!  We now have a mail from Charlottesville three times 
a week.  One came this evening, but was not opened at half past nine 
to-night.  A stage meets the cars at 
Christian's Creek.  The report of Yankees being at Middlebrook 
yesterday, created quite a stampede in the North Mountain neighborhood 
last night  &#8212;  people driving off stock +c.  Some straggling Yankees 
who gave themselves up, were brought in to-
day.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, June 24, 1864.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We had most flattering reports this morning in regard to the capture 
of a good part of Hunter's army, and the dispersion of the remainder; 
but by evening, what seems to be more truthful accounts were received, 
from which it appears that nearly the whole concern will escape towards 
Kanawha.  Very heavy fighting near Petersburg on Wednesday.  
1<sup>st</sup> report that we captured 2000 men and 40 cannon  &#8212;  
2<sup>nd</sup> that we captured 1700 men and 4 cannon.  I had made 
preparations to start to Richmond to-
morrow, by way of Lynchburg, on business with Quartermaster's 
Department, but Tate arrived about dusk with news that Yankee raiders 
had tapped the South Side Road at Burksville, and there was no 
connection.  No indication of a disposition at the North to abandon the 
strife, and consequently no prospects of a termination of the war.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, June 26, 1864.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Gen. Early, with Ewell's corps, has 
arrived within a few miles of town, and the soldiers from this county 
have been permitted to visit their houses.  Many of them have come into 
town, among them Edward Waddell.  He says their impression is that they 
are going into Pennsylvania, and the men indignant at the destruction 
of property +c by the Yankees under Hunter, declare their purpose to 
take revenge on the border on the first opportunity.  Many of Hunter's 
inferior officers, from all accounts, were humane and kind in their 
deportment, but he was cruel and treacherous as a fiend, and many 

horrid outrages were perpetrated with impunity, if not by command.  It 
makes my blood boil when I hear them recited.  Edward says the Yankees 
systematically burnt the fences in the country near Lynchburg.  Mr. 
Creigh (not Dr.) of Greenbrier, was hung in the yard of the Rev. Mr. Morrison, near Brownsburg.  <i>[deleted: He 
begged for a brief conversation with Mr. M., who also interceded for 
it, but it was decried.]</i>  His body was left suspended, and there 
being no other man in the neighborhood, except Mr. M., it hung for a 
considerable time.  It seems that the Yankees had Mr. Creigh with them 
in Staunton, and had a mock trial over him.  His offense was defending 
his wife against a brutal soldier, who was killed, but, according to 
report, by a negro woman.  Gen. Stahl, it 
is rumored, was under the bann for refusing to burn the village of 
Newtown, in Frederick County, as ordered by Hunter, because a Yankee 
wagon train was attacked near that place by some of our men.  Report 
says Averell disapproved of the destruction of the Military Institute 
at Lexington, and had quite a quarrel with Hunter on the subject.  The 
College Library and Apparatus were destroyed, and a statue of 
Washington <u>carried off</u>.  When a party of 
Yankees went to search the house of Col. 
Harper of this county, they were accompanied by a negro man belonging 
to Isaac or John Parkins, but whose wife belonged to Harper.  His 
conduct was so insulting to the family that a Yankee remarked to them, 
"That negro out to be shot, but unfortunately he is a great favorite 
with Gen. Hunter."  Wm. Harper finally said to a Yankee, "Give me a 
gun and let me shoot him."  The man replied, "I cant do that, and I 
advise you not to shoot him now, but when you get a safe opportunity I 
would'nt blame you."  From Kate's account, 
Va. treated the creatures admirably when 
they forced themselves upon her notice.  Being helplessly in their 
power, she did not unnecessarily provoke their anger; but she made no 
concessions and did not fail to express her sympathies and opinions.  
An officer called in the afternoon and asked, very respectfully, if he 
could get supper at the house.  Va, not 
wishing to refuse, as his protection might be useful, replied that she 
had been in the habit of feeding "our own" soldiers, and would obey the 
Bible injunction, "If thine enemy hunger, feed <u>him</u>."  The man apologized  &#8212;  said he was 
looking for a boarding house, and did not come back to supper.  One day 
she encountered three or four of the Yankee soldiers in our yard, 
making towards the garden, and hailing them entered into conversation  
&#8212;  In answer to a question from her, one of them said he was born in 
Rockbridge county.  She expressed her surprise and mortification at 
finding a Rockbridge man in the Yankee army  &#8212;  "And you," she said, 
"are going to Rockbridge to plunder the people you were born among  &#8212;  
some of them your own relations!"  He hung his head and the whole party 
turned back and went off.  I hear that the officers said, the ladies of 
Staunton did not insult them, nor <sup>at the same time</sup> give them 
any countenance; that no where had they been treated with such cold 
politeness.  It would take a volume to record all the interesting 
incidents which are daily related.  During the <u>occupation</u>, several of our young men belonging 
to the cavalry in Gen Lee's army, who had 
come home for horses, called at John Hamilton's, on Christian's Creek.  
While they were at dinner, their horses tied before their home, a dozen 
Yankees came upon them.  They of course attempted to escape  &#8212;  one of 
them shot and killed a Yankee, and one, with the horses, was captured.  
The dead Yankee was taken by his comrades into Hamilton's house and 
laid upon a bed.  They ordered H. to bury him, which he refused to do, 
and after insulting and endeavoring to intimidate him to inter the man.  
The second party came and left, without burying the man, and Hamilton 
had to do it at last.  Two or three of our cavalry, at home on 
furlough, dashed upon the Yankee pickets near the Lunatic Asylum and 
killed one, and came near stampeding the whole army.  While here the 
Yankees seem to have been in a state of great trepidation.  I cannot 
learn where Breckinridge's command, including Imboden's, has gone.  
There has been a great disposition to decry Imboden and to attribute to 
him all the blame of recent disasters in this region.  While he was the 
superior officer no disaster occurred, but those who give him no credit 
for Breckinridge's victory at New Market, hold him responsible for 
Jones' defeat at Piedmont.  I am disgusted at such exhibition of human 
nature.  His two cavalry regiments (18 + 23<sup>rd</sup>) have an 
unenviable reputation.  I heard at Waynesboro that Dary Armstrong, of 
the 18<sup>th</sup>, declared himself ashamed of his regiment.  Legh 
says that when his company + Peck's were ordered up to support their 
regiments at Piedmont, they met most of the men dashing down the hill, 
in wild retreat, many of the horses and some of the men bleeding, and 
some of the men bare headed, while the guns of the enemy were roaring 
behind them.  The two companies, according to their orders, endeavored 
to rally the regulars, but it was in vain  &#8212;  they swept by 
exclaiming, "Yes, you go and try it!"  On the top of the hill they 
encountered the Lt. Col. of the 
23<sup>rd</sup>, who was abusing and swearing at his men, and asking 
them if they could'nt "stand as long as the 
&#8212;&#8212;- Home Guards?"  Further on, they found a portion of the two 
regiments in a wood, whom they reinforced, and finally the enemy 
retired.  Report says, however, that the 18<sup>th</sup> + 
23<sup>rd</sup> have nearly retrieved their reputation and received the 
commendation of Gen. Early.  RR trains now run from Richmond to Christian's 
Creek.  Reports that 500 Yankee raiders have been captured on the South 
Side R.R., and 2000 men on the Petersburg + Weldon.  Grant seems to be 
in a position, between the James and Appomattox Rivers, from which he 
cannot be dislodged.  By the way, I had no idea when I began, of 
spending so much time <u>Sunday</u> night in 
this manner.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday evening, June 28, 1864.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Early's army has been passing through town since day-light  &#8212;  
<u>off + on</u>.  The infantry have gone down 
the Valley Turnpike, the artillery down the New Hope road, and the 
cavalry around the western part of the county, without passing through 
town.  The impression is that their destination is Pennsylvania.  
Whether such a move will not do us more harm than good, by reviving the 
war spirit at the North and recruiting the Yankee armies, remains to be 
seen.  Moreover I have no very great confidence in Early.  It is almost 
as great a relief to get rid of our army as of the Yankees  &#8212;  in some 
respects they have done as much injury as the latter.  Two rascals 
among them went to Legh's this morning, in his absence, and took off 
the Yankee horse he had.  I felt this loss more than all the others.  
J. H. Blackley returned home yesterday, the Yankees having paroled him 
in Greenbrier Co.  They refused to release 
Phillips, Candler.  H. B. can give me no information in regard to my 
papers.  He was discharged because he was unable to travel.  I expect 
to go to Richmond to-morrow, on public 
business  &#8212;  <i>[deleted: the Central RR is now 
open from Christian's Creek]</i>  &#8212;  I would gladly be excused from 
the trip if I could, particularly as I have not been well for some time  
&#8212;  suffered very much yesterday + last night.  I was aroused early 
this morning by the music of the troops who were marching out <sup>of 
town</sup>.  They had plenty of it, such as it was, some very dolorous  
&#8212;  several bands.  One of them played "When the cruel war is over."  
It made me sad, Sad, but the soldiers generally seemed in good spirits.  
Many of those who went out this afternoon, looked really joyous.  Poor 
fellows, I do not know how they stand such a life.  As far as dress and 
cleanliness are concerned, they are a woebegone looking set.  As usual, 
multitudes of them have been calling at private houses for something to 
eat.  We thought the Yankees had left no supplies in the county, but it 
is hard to refuse a morsel to our men, notwithstanding the beggars are 
generally stragglers.  Quite an army of them were up the road about 
Legh's after cherries to-day.  Early is 
supposed to have from 20,000 to 25,000 men.  One third of them here at 
the right time, would have presented all these disasters + cut off 
Hunter's career.  <i>[deleted: The loss of the horse Legh had troubles me more

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">On Wednesday morning last, a week ago, I started to Richmond to see 
what could be done in reference to our Quartermaster's affairs which 
have been much deranged by the loss of the papers, +c.  Went to 
Christian's Creek by stage.  Our engine was very much out of order, and 
we did not arrive in Charlottesville till between 4 and 5 o'clock, P.M.  
Found that the train we were to proceed in from Gordonsville, had left 
and gone back to Richmond, or rather to the burnt bridge near the city.  
Consequently we had to remain <sup>in Charlottesville</sup> till next 
day.  Slept, or lay, on a miserable, filthy bed.  Did not get off till 
quite late in the afternoon Thursday, and then started with a very long 
and crowded train.  The burnt bridge was repaired by this time, and we 
went through to Richmond, arriving at one o'clock, A.M., Friday 
morning.  Took lodgings at the Ballard House, where we had delightfully 
clean and comfortable beds.  On Friday and Saturday I was full of 
business, and was treated with great courtesy by all the officials, but 
did not accomplish much.  Sought information at the same time in regard 
to our private papers captured by Yankees in Nelson, but got little 
comfort.  On Sunday, I went to preaching in the morning at Dr. Hage's 
Church, and to prayer meeting in the evening  &#8212;  There was a universal 
expectation in Richmond that Grant would make a desperate assault, and 
perhaps destroy Petersburg on Monday, the 4<sup>th</sup>, in 
celebration of his capture of Vicksburg last year.  It was attended to 
at church, at prayer meeting, and in the Monday morning papers.  A 
special prayer meeting was appointed for Monday morning on account of 
the condition of affairs.  It turned out, however, that Monday was a 
day of unusual quietness at Petersburg, between the two armies.  Our 
people are becoming excessively vindictive towards the Yankees.  It is 
very apparent in the prayers of the clergy.  At the meeting Sunday 
evening, Dr. <i>[deleted: Wm.]</i> Brown, after relating the circumstances of 
Mr. Creigh's execution, exclaimed, "Oh God to whom vengeance belongeth!  
Oh God to whom vengeance belongeth!"  Dr. Feyburn prayed in substance 
that God would change the hearts of our enemies, or if He did not see 
fit to do that, that He would utterly destroy them  &#8212;  We paid for 
lodgings only at the Hotel, eating our own bread and mush.  Paid of 
lodgings from $6 to $10 a day and night.  I started home on Monday 
morning.  At Trevilian's met Dr. Mills and Martha waiting for me, to 
take me to their house.  Sunday determined to go with them, and had a 
pleasant visit.  Many marks of the recent cavalry fight in that 
vicinity, and I heard of many particulars of the battle.  One of our 
soldiers buried in Dr. Wills' enclosure, another on the road, near at

from Early.  All our expectations in that quarter have been more or 
less disastrous, and I expect anything better for this one.  We are at 
last getting some authentic particulars in reference to the case of Mr. 
Creigh, of Greenbrier.  It was said by some that a negro woman shot the 
Yankee who was threatening outrage to Mrs. C. and her daughters; by 
others that Mrs. C's mother shot him, while Mr. C. was struggling with 
the ruffian on the floor; a recent letter from Lewisburg states, 
however, that he was killed by his body thrown in a well.  This 
occurred six months ago.  A negro informed upon Creigh, and he was 
arrested by the Yankees when they were lately in Greenbrier, and 
brought in to Staunton by them.  Averell and Crook were opposed to his 
execution, but it was ordered by Hunter, who is a cruel and treacherous 
wretch.  &#8212;  While the Yankees were encamping one night, after leaving 
Staunton, at the Rev. Mr. Morrison's, in 
Rockbridge, near New Providence, an elderly man went to Mr. M's door 
and asked for him, stating that a prisoner wished to see him.  The 
visitor proved to be a chaplain in the Yankee army, named Osbourne, 
from Pa.  Mr. M. being old and in feeble health, his wife + daughters 
declined to call him, as they did not understand that the prisoner was 
any one he knew.  Early next morning Mr. Creigh was placed in a small 
wagon and taken to a spring, a short distance off, and there hung.  
<i>[deleted: Upon returning to the house, the chaplain asked + spoke to the

there ever was one, and the soldiers said he did right in Killing the 
Yankee at his house.  It was four days before a coffin could be 
procured, and in the mean while one of <i>[deleted: his]</i> <sup>Mr.

possession of Railroads North of Baltimore, and were within three miles 
of Washington, throwing shells into the city.  Passengers say there was 
later intelligence that Breckinridge entered Baltimore on the 
12<sup>th</sup>, and a telegram from Winchester, dated yesterday, 
states that Early had routed Warren's or Burnside's corps 14 or 16 
miles from Washington.  All this news, if only a part of it is true, is 
strange enough to us, who have known of Early's movement towards 
Maryland, for more than two weeks  &#8212;  how must it astonish Yankeedom 
and the world!  A few weeks ago the speedy downfal of Richmond was looked for, while Yankee 
raiders were traversing the State, destroying and plundering at their 
pleasure  &#8212;  the next things the world hears is that the "rebels" are 
carrying everything before them in Maryland and cannonading Washington 
city.  The house of Gov. Bradford, of 
Md., has been burnt in retaliation for the burning of Letcher's house 
at Lexington.  We have it from pretty good authority that the primary 
object of Early's expedition was the release of our men held as 
prisoners at Point Lookout.  Several of our steamers were expected to 
come out from Wilmington, to co-operate; but this arrangement having 
failed of execution, it was said that Early had been recalled.  Weather 
still very dry.  The Government offers thirty dollars ($30) a bushel 
for wheat!  Surely it is not intended to pay the public debt.  No 
government can stand such prices.  Private consumers always have to pay 
largely in advance of the Government, and it is not improbable that 
flour will sell from $500 to $1000 per barrel before next harvest.  The

of the expedition.  Four thousand prisoners said to have been brought 
off have dwindled down to six or seven hundred.  There is no reason to 
doubt, however, that a considerable amount of <u>plunder</u> has been secured, I fear that our 
soldiers have too generally been imitating the example set them by the 
Yankee raiders in this region.  Some camp followers from this

and receive payment of the bonds.  <i>[deleted: He regards them as currency,

kinds of personal property.  Yet nobody calls horses "currency" or 
imagines that a lawful owner has not a right to regain such property 
wherever he may find it, let the holder be ignorant or not that it was 
stolen or lost.  In this case the question is not whether the

they pay them?  Her are the true owners (whether legally so or not),

very little by the burning of the car on the Danville Railroad, but the

is required to hold terms in every county in the District, and will 
receive ten dollars a day, while actually employed, while his expenses, 
away from home, will amount to at least twenty dollars ($20) a day!

He was pursued on his return from Pennsylvania by Averell.  One or two 
persons who were with him at Chambersburg have arrived at Staunton.  
They say that M<sup>c</sup>Causland, by order of Early, made a demand 
upon the town for a hundred thousand dollars to reimburse the owners of 
property destroyed by the Yankees in Virginia.  The people laughed at 
the demand, and it was publicly repeated three or four times, with 
intervals of an hour or two, accompanied with a threat to burn the 
place, if it was not complied with.  As the people persisted in 
disregarding the demand, the town was finally set on fire.  Our men say 
that the affair was extremely painful to them.  There is every reason 
to believe that H. K. Cochran was killed then, and probably fell a 
victim to the rage of the populace.  Beauregard has been 
counter-mining at Petersburg, and has blown up some 
of the Yankee works.  Some of our troops have been moved by Railroad 
from Richmond to Culpeper.  Rumors that Grant is moving large bodies 
from Petersburg.  A vigorous assault by water was in progress upon 
Mobile at last accounts.  John Dabney of Roanoke, an old acquaintance, 
called to see me this morning.  I have not seen him before since 1846.

has been surrendered to the enemy in a mysterious manner, looking very 
much like treachery.  Our losses at Moorfield is estimated from 300 to 
500 men, besides horses and guns.  &#8212;  It was a strange affair.  Grant

She took supper at Alick's, and I at the Seminary.  We are badly off

nearly all of Grant's army is now on the Potomac, and probably Grant 
himself.  <i>[deleted: The current belief is that a]</i>  Rumor has it that

that there was some emergency, requiring the guns to be repaired 
immediately, as it is not usual for the men to work on Sunday.  The

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A good rain this morning  &#8212;  a regular old-fashioned affair, 
continuing from breakfast till dinner time, such as I hardly expected 
ever to see again.  After dinner I took my seat in the porch opening on 
Kate's flower yard, to read a while before going back to the office  &#8212;  
Kitty and Nanny came out, and in a minute or two one of them exclaimed 
"There's a fight!"  &#8212;  "Soldiers fighting."  They ran to the front 
porch, and I followed them.  One of them then said, "It's a black man 
they are beating."  I discovered two soldiers beating a negro and upon 
getting near them found that the latter was Alick's Stephen.  He was on 
the ground, his head bleeding, both of the soldiers having large stones 
in their hands, and one or both of them <u>pounding</u> him.  It was the most brutal and 
murderous affair I ever intercepted.  I rushed up and called to them to 
desist, which caused them to pause.  One said the negro had struck him  
&#8212;  that he was a <u>white man</u> +c  &#8212;  All 
the disgusting slang indulged in by low whites to justify their 
maltreatment of negros.  He seemed disposed to renew the assault, and I 
threatened them with the Provost Marshal.  After some altercation, 
which they forced upon me  &#8212;  my great desire being to get Stephen out 
of their reach  &#8212;  the more drunker of the two:  a powerful man, 
seized me with his left hand, and threatened to lay me out with a stone 
which he continued to grasp in his right hand.  The other man stood by 
with a stone in each hand.  They were drunk enough for any outrage, and 
for several minutes I felt that my life was in peril.  The fellow at 
last released his hold, and I immediately proceeded to the Guard House, 
and, returning with a squad of the Provost's Guard, had them arrested.  
They are said to belong to a Georgia Battalion quartered a few miles 
from town.  Stephen says they accosted him as he was going to his 
dinner, but observing that they were drunk he did not reply, when they 
caught him and pulled him about.  He then no doubt defended himself, as 
he had a right to do.</p><p class="p10">Still no news from Atlanta or Mobile.  We lost two Generals in the

passed through Winchester in pursuit.  I determined to-day to apply for a transfer to the "Tax-in-Kind"

Friday, near Petersburg.  They suffered heavily, according to reports 
on this side of the James, and recrossed to the South Side, making at 
the same time a movement toward the Petersburg + Weldon Railroad.  
Notwithstanding our success on Friday, they continue to hold the R.R.  
It was reported last night that we captured 4000 men prisoners, on 
Sunday, but the papers received this evening, give no such information.  
On the contrary they say we were repulsed on Sunday.  I took supper at

lower Valley, said to be four hundred and fifty (450).  They are to be 
detained here till further orders from Gen. Early.  It is reported that when our army 
was recently retreating before the enemy, a wounded man and another to 
nurse him were left at Kernstown, this side of Winchester.  When Early 
returned a few days ago, in pursuit of the enemy, the people of 
Kernstown informed him that the Yankees had hung the two men.  Their 
bodies were dug up, and found with the ropes around their necks.  Early 
therefore hung seven Yankees.  The 450 are retained here till it is 
ascertained whether the enemy will go on with their hanging.  <i>[deleted: In 
order that the work of retaliation may proceed without delay.]</i>  
These Yankees are miserable Specimens of humanity.  I did not hear a 
word of news this evening from Petersburg, Atlanta or Mobile.  Kate, 
Kitty and Mary Stuart went to Mr. Walters' on Monday, and have not 
returned yet.</p><p class="p10">To-night, about 8 o'clock, I heard some 
one at the front door.  I went to the door, and a negro man handed me a 
straw hat having a piece of paper pin'd to 
it.  I expected to find some writing on the paper, + did not look at 
the man sufficiently to recognize him; but the paper contained only my 
name.  I then asked who sent the hat, but the bearer moved off without 
replying.  The hat is a very good one, such as the ladies make of wheat

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Since Monday the reports from Petersburg have not been particularly 
favorable.  The enemy continued to hold the Weldon Railroad and was 
strongly fortified only three miles from the city.  This afternoon, 
however, the following dispatch was received from Richmond:</p><p class="p10">"Gen. A. P. Hill attacked the enemy on 
the Weldon Railroad yesterday, near Reams' Station.  &#8212;  dislodged them

Brig. Gen.  Our loss small.  Got 
9 guns."  Reams' Station is 15 or 16 miles from Petersburg, and the 
mystery is how Hill got there.  He must be in rear of the enemy.  It is 
presumed they still hold their fortification on the Railroad, near the 
city.  We continue to have indications, from the tone of a large 
portion of the northern press, of a strong desire for peace in that 
quarter.  The Democratic Convention for the nomination of a Candidate

on Saturday, and routed the enemy.  Since then there has been no 
further intelligence in regard to the matter, and we conclude that 
nothing more than a skirmish occurred.  No news of special interest 
from other quarters.  A number of persons who ran off from this region 
to avoid military service, after the repeal of the law allowing 
substitutes in the army, and went to the northern States, have recently 
returned.  It is said they replenish the state of society in the places 
where they have been as utterly wretched.  &#8212;  War and peace men

and I now have no property I can readily sell to raise means.  A few 
days ago, I <i>[deleted: drew, or rather]</i> <u>receipts

former times I could have purchased a full suit <sup>coat, vest + 
pants</sup> of such materials for $20 to $25 <sup>made ready</sup>.  
Having got the cloth now, the difficulty with me is, about trimming + 
making.  Two yards of skirt lining will cost $30.  (Last year my jeans 
coat which was lost at Hubbards in June was lined with my old cravat.  
&#8212;  Alas everything of the kind is now used up.  The back of an old 
vest must do another tour of duty, to help out the new one.  I paid $8 

to a tailor for cutting the coat and vest  &#8212;  $7 less than his usual 
charge  &#8212;  and a woman will charge me $25 for making the coat and $8 
for making the vest  &#8212;  not too much considering what the money is 
worth to her.  I shall cut the buttons from an old and very shabby 
coat, which I expect to wear sometimes, however, and use them on the

acknowledging ourselves still a part of the United States, and of 
course agreeing to abide by decision of a majority, which we know at 
the start is against us.  We must be nearly used before such a

<p class="p12"><i><p class="p12"><i>INCIDENTS OF PICKET LIFE</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>A correspondent of the Danville (Virginia) <i>Appeal</i> in a 
sprightly letter to that paper, gives the following description of life 
on picket and in the trenches of General Lee's army: </i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>Some time ago an order was issued by our commanding general 
prohibiting deserters from the enemy entering out lines, and the 
pickets were instructed to waive them back, and if they did not go, to 
fire upon them.  For a week after the promulgation of that order, many 
attempts were made by deserters to enter our lines, and it was amusing 
to see their signals and signs, that they were "all right," while our 
boys would not understand them.  The consequences was, that in a little 
while the stream of deserters ceased to flow, and we thought ourselves 
rid of such troublesome customers forever.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>We held a line in close proximity to the enemy, the rifle-pits 
occupied by the pickets being in some places only fifty yards apart; 
but an arrangement existed preventing firing by either party upon the 
other.  During this "armistice, " frequent attempts were made by the 
Yanks to exchange papers and swap coffee for tobacco; but orders were 
strict, and officers alert, so that no opportunity was allowed, had the 
inclination prevailed, to trade with the enemy.  Among the tricks 
resorted to by the enemy to hold communication was this:  They would 
write anything they desired to communication upon a small piece of 
paper and roll it around a Minie or a grapeshot and throw it across the 
line.  One of these missiles brought over the following:</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>"Johnny Reb.&#8212;Is The Fifty-third Virginia still on this line?  I 
have two friends in that regiment&#8212;got acquainted with them while 
exchanging papers, and think they are nice fellows, from appearances.  
Toss your reply over as I do this." </i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>No notice was paid to these communications, and after the deserted 
were stopped for some time, our general became desirous to learn 
something of the enemy's motions, and issued an order offering a 
fifteen days' furlough for a captured Yankee.  Now, as soon as this 
order was made known along our picket lines, everybody wanted the 
furlough, and all sorts of tricks were practices to entrap a 
Yankee.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>Our boys commenced shaking papers and beckoning, but blue bel&#8212;beast 
"smelt a mice" at so much fondness expressed in a moment, and failed to 
come out of his hole.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>Some good stories are told upon some of the boys, two of which I 
remember just here.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>A reb starts out with a paper, and a pistol concealed, to meet a 
Yankee who showed himself in the woods fifty years from our pits.  
getting within five steps of Yank, he presents his pistol and cries 
out, "Surrender;" but just then another Yank, close at hand, pokes his 
gun around a tree and says "Swap papers, damn you, and get you gone."  
Which reb did in fast time.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>A good one is told on two young officers who wanted a furlough.  One 
goes out unarmed with a paper, and waived it 
for some time to entice Yank to come over, while the other stood ready 
to rush to his assistance.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>After a while a burly Irishman came up, and the captain at once 
grappled him and endeavored to lead him in.  But Irishman "caved in" 
and was brought over a prisoner; but General Pickett said he couldn't 
give a furlough upon any such capture as that, and sent the Irishman 
back, as he wasn't taken with arms in his hand.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>The Yanks tolled off one of our men, and Butler sent him back by 
flag of truce; but the outlaw was not recognized, and he carried the 
man back.  However, he afterwards turned the man loose, and he came 
walking in with papers, stating how he had been "gobbled up" and 
snatched off.</i></p>
<p class="p12"><i>Then came General Order No. 65, and we tossed them over the lines.  
In a day or two the order worked like a charm, and they came rolling in 
by the dozen.  We sometimes get fifteen deserters in one night; all 
claiming protection under General Order No. 65.</i></p></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, Sept.

Wills and his daughter Emma (who arrived last evening and return home 
to-morrow).  John H. McCue and Jim

Matty was there asleep and required no attention.  I remained behind, 
having been unwell for the last two days  &#8212;  did not go to the office 
this afternoon.  We have had no special war news for several days past.  
It turns out that the Yankees bring one (not two) of our soldiers at 
Middletown or Newtown (not Kernstown).  &#8212;  In Aug. 24<sup>th</sup>.  
He was from North Carolina, a mere boy, and rather half-witted.  He was 
waiting on a sick or wounded comrade, who got well and left him 
lingering in the village.  The citizens gave him some clothing, so that 
when a Yankee force came to the place he was not recognized as a 
soldier.  But by some means the Yankees learned that he belonged to the 
army, which he however denied, and they hung him as a spy, having first 
made him dig his own grave!  I heard these facts from a soldier last 
week, who said that Early had not then retaliated upon the enemy.  It 
was stated to-night, however, that he had 
hung four Yankees.  &#8212;  It is reported that some disagreement has 
occurred between Early and Anderson in regard to rank.  Legh told me 
to-day that John Hill came to his house this 
morning bringing the broken lock of his stable door, and stating that 
his valuable stud was gone.  The children began to cry and there was 
great lamentation.  He tracked the horse down the lane and up the 
public road, and finally was rejoiced to find him in the meadow above 
the house.  The animal had the halter still on, and had evidently 
broken loose from the thief and leaped the fence into the meadow.  Good 
locks cannot be procured now, and it is almost impossible to fasten any

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The United States government is bringing troops up the Mississippi 
in large numbers, even withdrawing a part of their force at Mobile.  
Everything indicates that they are concentrating against Richmond.  
Sheridan will be reinforced, which will enable him to drive Early up 
the Valley, or a column will be found at Washington or Fredericksburg, 
to advance upon Richmond from that quarter.  Being almost ready to 
yield to despondency this evening, I quite made up my mind that the 
Yankees would occupy Staunton again before many weeks have passed, and 
perhaps winter here.  Our authorities have ordered the immediate 
enrolment of all exempted and detailed men from sixteen to fifty years 
of age.  Already the whole male population between those ages is in the 
military service, except the comparatively few who are exempt by law as 
civil officers, preachers, physicians +c., and those pronounced unfit 
for service on account of physical disability.  Oh for rest!  rest!  Oh 
for faith to say and <u>feel</u>, "the

trouble.  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed and 
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea."  "<u>He</u> maketh wars to cease &#8212;"  I have felt 
depressed all day  &#8212;  not well "in body and cast down in spirits.  
Have been thinking of how Mr. Stuart's family is to get along.  &#8212;  Am

down to see them after supper  &#8212;  When we came home found some cake 
and custard (of the decidedly Confederate sort) which had been sent in 
from the kitchen.  Wright was to deliver another address to the Colored 
Ladies' Temperance Society, and as usual they had sent him a bountiful 
supper before hand, by way of preparation.  From Kate's account of the 
meal he was making I fear he was "too full for utterance."  It is 
apparent now, that the peace party at the North is in a woeful 
minority.  Bright moon-light and cool night  &#8212;  an owl in the 
neighborhood Keeps up a great hooting, which is rather a pleasant sound 
to me.  Matty does not improve as we could wish.  This evening I 
succeeded for the first time in getting all our chickens lodged under

<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, Sept. 17.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">There is a general conviction that the Yankees are concentrating all 
this available troops for a desperate attempt to take Richmond.  The 
movements of Yankee troops, as well as the obvious policy of Lincoln at 
this time, indicate such a course, and our authorities are evidently 
endeavoring to prepare for it.  We hear rumors of fighting down the 
Valley, but can get no definite information.  Reports that the 
remainder of the Stonewall Brigade has been captured while on picket.  
This morning over a hundred Yankee prisoners arrived from the lower

unexpectedly, led by Grant; that he repelled several assaults, but was 
finally compelled by overwhelming numbers, to retire; that our loss was 
heavy, but the enemy's greater [of course  &#8212;  we always hear that.]; 
that the Yankee General Averell was killed.  A deep feeling of gloom

very few particulars to-night, report that 
our loss was three thousand, killed and wounded  &#8212;  few, 
comparatively, killed; and that the enemy's loss was almost 
unprecedentedly large.  They say that the enemy was repulsed twice, and 
driven back two miles, but continued to bring up fresh troops, and 
finally one of our brigades (Vaughan's) gave way.  Early brought off 
his wagons and four hundred (400) prisoners were taken during the 
battle.  Our army was at Fisher's Hill, and there is a rumor of 
skirmishing there this morning.  The enemy's force is reported as very 
large, + a considerable portion of their infantry is mounted.  We heard 
Monday night that a body of Yankees  &#8212;  500 to 700 &#8212;  had burnt the 
bridge over the Rapid, on the Orange + Alexandria Railroad.  &#8212;  To-day we learn that a portion of Anderson's corps 
<u>in route</u> from Early to Lee, encountered 
the raiders before they had entirely destroyed the bridges, and put 
them to flight, capturing a number of them.  The truce at Atlanta 
terminated this evening.  We may look for hot work in that quarter.  
James Calhoun in town to-night, going again 
to see after his son; who is, <u>or was</u>, in

this war!  This morning there was a general expectation that the enemy 
would be in Staunton before many days.  Until the fall of Atlanta we 
were all hopeful of a speedy termination of the war.  Now, we see no 
prospect of peace for months to years to come  &#8212;  unless we are

news of no disaster would have surprised the community much.  The 
people were prepared for anything.  The wounded are beginning to come 
in.  Edward Waddell arrived this evening, badly wounded in the right 
hand.  I hear that young Jenkin, of Christiansburg, wounded in the leg, 
has stopped at Sister's to spend the night.  Rumored that Kershaw's

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A report got out about 2 o'clock that Early had been driven from 
Fisher's Hill, with the loss of twelve pieces of cannon.  It was said 
to have come from the Telegraph office, but the operator denied it.  
For an hour or more, opinion wavered as to the truth of the report, but 
finally settled down into the belief that it was substantially correct.  
Various circumstances tended to corroborate it.  I thought we had 
reached the lowest stage of despondency on yesterday, but there was a 
"lower deep" still.  Anxiety and gloom was depicted in every 
countenance.  For myself, I confess, I feel staggered and overcome.  
Some persons report that the enemy are (70,000) seventy thousand 
strong, while Early has only seventy-five hundred (7,500) infantry.  I 
cannot believe that their figures are correct.  Early is, however, 
undoubtedly retreating up the Valley before a large force.  Our cause 
seems to be desperate.  I have a tendency to look on the dark side of 
things  &#8212;  but this is the general feeling.</p><p class="p10"><u>Night</u>.  &#8212;  The public anxiety has 
rather increased than abated since night.  I went to the Post Office 
after dark, and met A. B. Arthur and his wife on the street.  She 
called to me after I had passed them, and on going back, I found her 
greatly agitated.  She said a letter had been received from a 
Quartermaster in the army, stating that our troops were completely 
routed  &#8212;  in a state of panic and that every man was taking care of 
himself.  On the street, near the Post Office, squads of people were 
standing and sitting, talking over the state of affairs while waiting 
the opening of the mail.  I have learned that a man had arrived by 
stage, having left the army after the abandonment of Fisher's Hill, and 
reported that our cavalry, on the left wing, had come dashing in in a 
state of the utmost confusion  &#8212;  Could not learn that there had been 
any fighting at Fisher's Hill.  It is said that thousands of our 
soldiers are without arms, having thrown their guns away.  Arms have 
been sent from Staunton, since the battle at Winchester.  We heard this 
evening that Roper's cavalry would be at Gordonsville to-night, on their way to the Valley, but on the 
street, I heard another report that two brigades of the enemy were in 
Culpeper.  If this is so, Roper will have enough to do East of the 
mountain.  I called in to see Sister, who has been suffering intensely 
from nervous apprehensions, dreading lest she and her children would be 
slaughtered, or at least starved to death.  I endeavored to suppress my 
feelings of anxiety that I might encourage her.  But it is not 
improbable that by to-morrow night I shall 
again be a fugitive.  <sup>not know how those dear to me are to 
subsist, or whether they will not be driven from home</sup>  And there 
are Christian people in the Northern States who are rejoicing over this

<p class="p11"><b>October 1864 </b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday, October 8, 1864.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Two eventful weeks have passed since my last entry in this journal.  
On Saturday afternoon, Sept. 24<sup>th</sup>, an order came from 
Richmond for all the wheat to be ground immediately, and the flour sent 
there as soon as possible.  I was employed till nearly dark in 
attending to the business, + when I got home found a young soldier 
there from Alabama, who had been wounded at Fisher's Hill.  He gave a 
gloomy account of the condition of Gen. 
Early's army.  After supper I came down to Mr. Stuart's  &#8212;  Sister was 
wonderfully hopeful as was Alick, who came in  &#8212;  I told the latter 
that the Yankees would certainly be in Staunton.  Went home feeling 
greatly depressed.  Young Sherrer, who staid with us in 1862, was there 
+ spent the night, the Alabama soldier having returned to the Military 
Hospital.  After 10 o'clock I was in the act of going to bed, when I 
heard some one call to me.  Capt. Smith 
was in the street on horseback  &#8212;  said Gen. Early had just sent an order to evacuate 
the town, that he was about to retire to Brown's Gap, in the Blue 
Ridge.  Tate + I came down street and remained till one o'clock, except 
that I went home once to have my clothes put up and make some necessary 
arrangements.  Finally we all left the office, and went to bed.  I was 
disturbed by hammering at the armory near our house, and felt like a 
man who was listening to the making of his own coffin.  At last I 
dropped sleep.  Was aroused by Tate's getting up to go to his farm, and 
long before day there came a thundering knocking at our front door.  
Moses had come up to tell us the Federal army was this side of 
Harrisonburg.  Upon coming down street, most persons were stirring.  
Sent Wright to notify Legh.  After Some hours of anxiety I finally 
started on the Wagons  &#8212;  borough road, riding Alick's young mare, and 
followed by the government wagon train belonging to our department.  
The separation from Va and others dear to 
me was most painful.  I believed fully that the Federal force would 
occupy the town permanently, and that I was an exile perhaps for ever.  
D. A. Kayser with his servant Jordan first overtook me, then Jno. K. Woods, and then Capt. Smith.  The country I was leaving never 
appeared more lowly.  Trains of cars were still coming up to Staunton 
to my surprise, as it was reported when I left that the army was only a 
few miles off.  At Waynesboro, I found a much bustle and anxiety among 
the citizens.  We paused there several hours.  A train arrived there, 
with prisoners captured at Winchester.  Every soldier and fugitive from 
the army gave a gloomy report of our affairs.  Many army wagons at 
Waynesboro and on the road.  We crossed the Blue Ridge, stopped at 
Brooksville till our wagons came up.  Rev. B. J. Lacy arrived from the army  &#8212;  gave 
me a more discouraging account of Early's condition than I had 
received.  We moved on, and spent part of the night in the road a mile 
from Brooksville.  W. H. Heiskell had previously joined us.  Before day 
light we started again.  &#8212;  Arrived early in the day at North Gordon 
Depot, on the Charlottesville + Lynchburg Railroad.  &#8212;  There H. H. 
Peck joined our party.  Waited at North Gordon many hours for the train 
from Charlottesville.  About 11 o'clock we began to hear cannonading in 
the direction of Brown's Gap.  &#8212;  Dept up till after dark.  Capt. Smith took the RR train for Lynchburg.  As the train was late 
in arriving, I started beforehand to catch up with the wagons  &#8212;  
feeling sick + tired.  Overtook the wagons at their camp, after dark, 
and lay down in one of them immediately.  During the night I suffered 
greatly.  Smith was to join us at Warren, and in the mean time, I had 
command of the train +c.  We moved on the next day (Tuesday), and after 
several hours arrived at Warren.  Rumors followed us, people in 
Albemarle were sending their property across James River, and I 
concluded to cross to the Buckingham side.  I wrote to Smith, advising 
him of our arrival.  Three or four hours were occupied in crossing the 
ferry.  Two mules became refractory and getting into the river one of 
them was drowned.  We found a wagon camp within a few yards of the 
river, in Buckingham.  The ferryman, Tapscote, was very accommodating, 
allowing us to occupy a vacant house and affording to us other 
comminas  We remained at this place a week.  During 
all of which time I heard nothing of Capt. 
Smith.  Almost every day soldiers came across the ferry, and we had a 
great variety of reports.  One wounded man came with news of the fight 
at Waynesboro on Wednesday evening. 28<sup>th</sup>Sept.  We heard that 
Federal cavalry had entered Staunton, but went off after two days, 
doing no injury to the citizens.  My spirits revived after the first 
two days of absence from home, and we all sought entertainment by going 
after chinquapins<a href="#n82">82</a>, grapes +c.  I came on to 
Warren on Thursday to inquire the news  &#8212;  met a man just from the 
army, and returned discouraged.  I could not stop at night.  The 
weather very inclement from Friday evening till Tuesday.  &#8212;  much 
rain.  Went to church, three miles from the Ferry, on Sunday, but the 
preacher did not come.  Was quite unwell all day, suffering for want of 
proper food + rest.  Sunday I sent Peaco to Scottsville for 
intelligence, and he returned with such a report as determined me to 
start back next day.  Sunday night, however, we heard that the enemy 
was between Charlottesville and Scottsville. +c. +c.  On Monday Kayser 
and I crossed to Warren and got an excellent dinner, which revived me 
much.  About dark we arrived at the river bank, on our return, and met 
Peaco coming to tell us that news had been received from Howardsville, 
of a very cheering character.  I immediately determined to start back 
the next day (Tuesday, Oct. 4<sup>th</sup>).  Mr. Heiskell + I moved 
slowly with the wagons  &#8212;  Peck, Woods + Kayser moved on ahead of us.  
Everything went on well <i>[deleted: with us]</i>, until we arrived near 
Batesville, when Kayser met me with discouraging reports and wished me 
to turn back.  I determined, however, to come on.  When the wagons came 
up, I learned from one of the news that Capt Smith had passed there at North Garden, 
coming on the RR to Charlottesville.  At 
Afton, on the Blue Ridge, I found Ch. Price, Wren + 
Jewell occupying a freight car, having 
Quartermaster's stores in charge.  I concluded to spend the night with 
them, as they had some good beds +c. of which I was much in need.  
Capt. Smith arrived on the RR train, and finding me there got off.  He 
rode my horse back to the wagon stand and slept there.  Kayser + Woods 
had gone on to Waynesboro; and Peck had already crossed the Mt.  
Thursday morning Smith came up to us, bringing my horse, and we came on 
to Waynesboro.  Everything seemed so insecure in Staunton, the enemy 
being then nearer than when we left, that Smith proposed to wait in 
Waynesboro for a day or two.  On Friday, however, we learned that the 
Federal army had retired beyond Harrisonburg, and that Early was 
pursuing down the Valley, and we came on to Staunton.  Our wagons had 
gone up South River, three miles from Waynesboro.  I was gratifying to 
find all at home undisturbed and I hope grateful to God  &#8212;  <i>[deleted: All 
were well and]</i>  Matty much better than I left her.  The Federal 
cavalry  &#8212;  some 3000  &#8212;  entered the town Monday evening (Sept 
26<sup>th</sup>) and passing through camped on the Waynesboro road.  A 
portion of them went to Waynesboro on Tuesday, during which day 
Staunton also was occupied by them.  They entered very few private 
houses and committed no depredations of any consequence.  On Wednesday, 
the 28<sup>th</sup>, the whole body moved to Waynesboro; and late that 
evening they were attacked by a small party of our troops who had come 
up from Brown's Gap, on the Eastern Side of the Blue Ridge.  It was 
certainly a gallant affair for our cavalry.  The enemy was driven off, 
leaving about 40 (forty) dead, + more than 80 men captured.  I heard 
many particulars of the affair while I tarried in Waynesboro.  Twelve 
or thirteen houses in the village were struck by shells, and bullets 
flew thick through the streets.  One of the Federal soldiers was killed 
within a few yards of Dr. L. Waddell's door, and he was <u>stripped</u> by our men of his clothing as soon as 
he fell, one taking his boots, another his pants +c.  Driven off from 
Waynesboro; the enemy returned through Staunton late Wednesday night, 
in great haste and some disorder.  They were heard to say, "Hurry up, 
the Rebels are after us!"  they returned as they came by the Iron Works 
or Spring Hill road on Thursday (29<sup>th</sup>) our cavalry entered 
the town.  Early afterwards moved his infantry from Waynesboro, towards 
Mt Sidney, and for several days the North River from Bridgewater to 
Port Republic, was the line between the two armies.  We heard rumors on 
Wednesday + Thursday last that the Federalists were moving off, but 
other rumors that they were stationary, and did not ascertain till 
Friday morning (yesterday) that they had really gone.  At last accounts 
Early was beyond Harrisonburg.  There is a rumor to-
day that the enemy has crossed the Mountain + is moving upon 
Gordonsville.  Some miles and many barns were burnt in this county, the 
Northern portion.  We hear of great destruction and much suffering in 
Rockingham and all the lower Valley.  Women were wringing their hands 
and crying while the men were carried off as prisoners and the barns 
and hay stacks were burning.  Gen. Lee is 
sorely pressed at Richmond and all details have been recalled.  Perhaps 
before many days I will land in the trenches before Richmond.  Capt. Smith goes down to-
morrow to see what he is to do.  Every man recommended for 
detail by Medical Boards, for physical disability for field service (of 
whom I am one) are ordered to report on the 18<sup>th</sup> next to go 
to Richmond.  While the Yankees were here an officer named Martindale 
offered for a sale a Confederate $1000 bond, but could find no 
purchaser.  He finally proposed to give it to Mr. Andrew Hunter, of 
Jefferson county, as partial compensation for the burning of his house, 
telling him it had been captured from a Quartermaster near Lynchburg 
last Summer.  Hunter took it with the understanding that he was to 
return it to the owner, if he could find him.  The bond proved to be 
one of Mr. Stuart's having his name written on it by me!</p><p class="p10">On the Tuesday the Yankees were in town, they impressed all the 
negro men into their service and took them down the Railroad to destroy 
the track and bridges.  They had Moses and Stephen, but Wright got wind 
of it in time, and sat all day in the spare room up stairs, reading 
Bancroft's History of the United States.  The impressed negroes were 
very indignant, and did much less damage to the Railroad than they 
could have done.  A considerable number of negroes went off from the 
town and vicinity with the Yankees.  None of ours.  When our soldiers 
came in they were very hungry, and were fed as far as possible by the 
citizens.  Selena, our cook, gave them her breakfast and dinner one 
day.  The Railroad has been repaired already.  Important intelligence 
from Georgia is looked for.  Va wrote to 
me on the 30<sup>th</sup> Sept. "All day yesterday [Thursday] they (the 
Yankees) were encamped near Middle River, and judging from the lights 
must have spent the <i>[deleted: night]</i> day and night in burning barns.  
The whole heavens were illuminated until late bed time  &#8212;  how much 
longer I cannot tell.  +  +  +  Our scouts brought in twelve (12) 
prisoners last night."  Thursday morning some straggling Yankees passed 
through town from Waynesboro, very much jaded, and one of them 
voluntarily surrendered to the citizens.  The general impression is 
that Early drinks too much liquor, and that many of our recent 
disasters are attributable to that cause.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, October 10, 1864.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yesterday evening there was intelligence of some success to our arms 
below Richmond.  Also that <u>Roper</u> had 
encountered the enemy successfully in the Valley, and that Mosby had 
done some damage to their wagon trains in the rear of their army.  This 
evening we hear that our cavalry was defeated somewhere near New Market 
on Saturday or Sunday.  The Richmond Dispatch of this morning says the 
New York Herald of the 5<sup>th</sup> publishes a letter from Grant to 
Sheridan ordering him to burn every house in the Valley; to destroy 
every mill, kill every horse, cow, sheep and hog; that he is determined 
to make the Valley a howling wilderness!!  When Sheridan was in the 
full tide of his success, the Philadelphia "Inquirer" said the Valley 
was then "under the feet of its <u>lawful 
owners</u>."  This morning John Hendren came to me to say that he 
had accepted the appointment of Treasurer of the Confederate States, 
and to inquire if I would take a place in the Department at Richmond.  
I agreed to go, and he is to write to me.  Afterwards, Capt Smith informed me that he had some prospect 
of getting a position on a Military Court Martial and in the event of 
his success, proposed to urge me as his successor as Post Quartermaster 
for the collection of the Tax-in-Kind in the 11<sup>th</sup> 
Congressional District.  I prefer this to the other, as it will allow

either for himself or me.  The Assistant Quartermaster General, 
however, told J. B. Baldwin some time ago that he had my name down for 
a commission.  It is said that a Yankee officer made an address to the 
negroes after they got through tearing up the Railroad track.  He was 
anxious for the young men to go off with them, but would not advise the 
old men to leave their houses; if, however, the latter chose to go, 
they would be taken to Washington city where arrangements would be made 
of which they could work for a living.  &#8212;  "Humph!" said an old negro,

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The first rumor of the day was that Roper had rallied his cavalry 
and finally defeated the enemy below New Market; the next, that he had 
met no reverse at all; and the third, which I suppose is correct, 
states that he planned an attack upon the enemy's cavalry, leaving his 
wagons and artillery some miles in the rear  &#8212;  that Yankees massed 
their cavalry to meet him, and at the same time sent a force of 
infantry to cut off the trains,  &#8212;  that a severe fight ensued, in 
which Roper was getting the advantage when he heard of the movement in 
his rear  &#8212;  that he fell back to protect the trains, but too late to 
save his artillery  &#8212;  and that both parties suffered heavily.  The 
Yankee army is said to be still moving down the Valley.  Reported that 
a part of the town of Woodstock has been burnt.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, Oct. 12.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">No news to-day, except a report that Gen. Early has gone into the Page Valley.  I 
rode up to Legh's this afternoon, or rather to my strip of land, to see 
how much wood Jim had cut  &#8212;  very little.  Had a peculiar feeling of 
desolation.  The country is wasted by war; and the land mourns.  Now, 
at this usually abundant season of the year, people heretofore 
accustomed to live in ease and luxury, are scuffling for the meanings 
of life. How different it was from years ago!  I found a copy of the 
"Staunton Spectator" published by Lyt + 
me in December 1858 (1858) and read it to-
night with a sort of pleasant  &#8212;  gloomy feeling.  The 
advertisements, everything in <i>[deleted: and about]</i> the paper, indicate 
the peace and plenty which then prevailed.  Alas, how changed!  Since 
dark we have been hearing the noise made by a mill grinding sugar cane 
(sorghum), there it is still  &#8212;  after 10 o'clock  &#8212;  probably half a 
mile off  &#8212;  Something sweet  &#8212;  molasses  &#8212;  is eagerly sought 
after.  At Waynesboro the other day, I drank, at supper and breakfast, 
"rye coffee" without sugar  &#8212;  While out with wagons we had it without 
sugar or cream.  The Yankees left a number of horses here on their 
recent visit.  One gave out near Alick's house, and the rider abandoned 
him.  Alick took the animal in charge  &#8212;  the Yankee saying he might 
have him.  Our cavalry entered town on Thursday after the fight at 
Waynesboro, and remained in line of battle on the hills several 
hours.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, October 15.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Nothing talked of except the recent orders calling into service all 
detailed men.  One order has followed another in rapid succession, from 
Adjutant General's Office in Richmond.  They indicate that almost every 
male person from 17 to 50 years of age is to be taken to Richmond.  
Capt. Smith went to Richmond on Tuesday to 
see if he could retain the detailed men in his Department, especially 
those of us assigned by Medical Boards to "light duty," on account of 
physical disability; returned last night without accomplishing 
anything.  He represents the Departments in Richmond, as in utter 
confusion, nearly every body, except commissioned officers, being taken 
out and sent into the intrenchments.  -
-  Society here bids fair to be broken up.  &#8212;  The recent orders take 
millions from their grinding, but men sent from the army undertake, in 
some cases, to run the machinery.  Farmers are sent from their houses, 
and soldiers are detailed to thresh the wheat.  All men engaged in 
making horseshoes are ordered off, so that our cavalry will have to go 
bare-footed.  The officials at Richmond are in a state of panic, 
apparently.  They are evidently making no provisions for the future, 
and are staking everything upon a single throw.  The army itself cannot 
be sustained two months.  Another and another young man of this place 
is cut down by the casualties of war.  Oh, the horrors amidst which we 
dwell!  I am often ready to exclaim:  "Hath God forgotten to be 
gracious?  hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?"  But no, God 
is still merciful as well as just.  We deserve all we have suffered, 
and therefore have no right to complain  &#8212;  God grant that we may be 
humble, submissive, and trustful, even though He slay us!</p><p class="p10">Chestnuts are very abundant this Fall.  Va + Kate took Wright and Jinny out of the 
woods day before yesterday, and gathered more than half a bushel.  
Kitty and Nanny went with Adeline to-day, and

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">News to-day that Early was falling back,

about to take place at Fisher's hill.  Two young soldiers, killed 
recently down the Valley, were buried this afternoon.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, Oct. 19.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">While we were at supper to-night John 
Alexander arrived, most unexpectedly.  He has been a prisoner since 
July, 1863, most of the time at Point Lookout, and was at last paroled.  
From his account our soldiers and citizens held by the Federalists as 
prisoners, have a miserable time of it.  Legh goes to Richmond to-morrow to report  &#8212;  about 150 men went down 
this morning.  My going has been delayed till next week.  I have never 
asked for any indulgence, but when a respite is tendered I am not 
unwilling to accept it.  Some days ago I received a letter from John 
Hendren, stating that he had not entered upon his duties and expressing 
an earnest desire to have me in the Treasury Department.  I have pretty 
well made up my mind to go, and all my friends, including Va., urge me to it; but it will take all my 
pay, I fear, to support me in Richmond, so that I shall have nothing to 
send to Va.  In the mean time my <u>status</u> in the military service has to be 
settled.  Gen. Lee is preparing for a 
desperate assault from Grant or upon him.  John Alexander says large 
numbers of men, called out by the recent orders, are arriving in 
Richmond.  We have heard nothing more about Early's falling back  &#8212;  
the Richmond papers of yesterday had accounts of his achieving some 
success lately.  It is reported, and I believe truly, that the greater 
part of Sheridan's infantry has gone to join Grant.  Hood, having moved 
round to Sherman's rear, seems to be getting along very successfully in 
Georgia.  West of the Mississippi, the Confederates appear to have 
things their own way.  Price is again on or near the Missouri river.  
Mosby has been committing a good deal of havoc in Sheridan's rear, down 
the Valley.  Altogether things look a little brighter for us  &#8212;  May 
God continue to help us!  A considerable number of men from the town 
and county have run off to avoid military duty.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, Oct. 20.  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This afternoon, it was announced that Early had attacked the enemy 
near Strasburg and captured 1500  &#8212;  that the prisoners were brought 
through New Market this morning.  &#8212;  Before the first glow of 
satisfaction at this good news had subsided, I heard that Early had 
"lost his cannon," and was retreating before the enemy.  There was a 
dreadful sinking of the spirits.  Next it was said that Early had 
captured prisoners and cannon, and was sending the former up this way; 
but the enemy being reinforced he was compelled to retire with the loss 
of "some men and artillery."  This was rather better.  Since dark it is 
said he really did capture 1500 men, and had them safe now, having 
defeated the enemy; but having no forage for his horses, and, moreover, 
learning that the 6<sup>th</sup> Corps of the Federal army was 
returning to re-inforce Sheridan, he thought it advisable, or found it 
necessary, to return up the Valley, which he was doing without loss of 
any kind.  Legh went to Richmond this morning, to report at the Camp of 
Instruction  &#8212;  I shall go in two or three days.  The 62<sup>nd</sup> 
Reg. has been sent on an expedition 
towards Beverly.  There are said to be many deserters in North 
Mountain.  A company has been sent after them.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, Oct. 21</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A number of officers and men who were engaged in the recent affair 
down the Valley, &#8212;  and many ambulances with wounded, have arrived.  
They say that the enemy was attacked early in the morning and 
completely routed, being driven a long distance, with the loss of 
cannon, wagons, about 4000 prisoners  &#8212;  in fact almost everything.  
Early ordered a halt and <u>immediately his men 
scattered to plunder</u>.  The enemy rallied, + another corps coming 
up, attacked Early's men, while they were dispersed; at the same time 
the Federal cavalry attacked our wagons in the rear.  The result was 
that we were routed and lost more than gained at first, except in 
prisoners.  It is said we lost 1000 men, and succeeded in bringing off 
1300 prisoners.  There are different versions of the affair, and the 
truth will not be known for some time.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, Oct. 22.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A large body of prisoners were brought in this morning and sent off 
as soon as possible by Railroad.  The number was stated to be 1340, but 
my impression was that it was much greater  &#8212;  at least 2000.  &#8212;  So 
nearly every body thought.  They were very indifferent looking, dirty, 
faces unwashed and unintelligent.  I am sorry to say that the guard did 
not scruple to take their clothing from them  &#8212;  Such articles as 
overcoats.  They had an idea that they were to be robbed of everything, 
and sold oil cloths, +c.  It was stated this afternoon that 1100 more 
prisoners were coming, but there are so many false reports, we do not 
readily believe anything we hear.  The recent affair in the Valley is a 
curious episode in the war  &#8212;  Our army routes the enemy, and is 
immediately routed in turn, but brings off a large number of prisoners.  
It is still a doubtful question on which side is the balance of 
artillery.  Report says that our total loss of men was 1000, while the 
Federal loss was 10,000.  &#8212;  We had few killed, they a great many.  
How the affair occurred, exactly, is not ascertained yet, so far as I 
am advised.  The last report is, that Early was moving down the Valley 
again.  John Alexander's account of his imprisonment has greatly 
increased my dread of ever falling into the hands of the enemy.  How 
such systematic cruelty can be practiced in this age and country is 
marvelous.  Henry C. Alexander arrived to-
night from Lexington.  The Rev. 
Dr. Armstrong, late of Norfolk, was in L. at Synod.  Butler had been 
<u>sweeping stables</u> at one time while he was 
a prisoner.  He denies the truth of Butler's report of his examination, 
as published in the papers.  Says Butler's conduct on the occasions was 
worthy of Judge Jeffreys  &#8212;  walking about and heaping upon all sorts 
of abuse.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, October 31.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">On Tuesday, the 25<sup>th</sup>, I went to Richmond under orders to 
report at the Camp of Instructions.  A J. Gilkeson started with me, and 
Brig. Stewart + T. H. Antrim joined us 
at Waynesboro.  J. E. King was to follow.  Besides W. B. Hyde, who was 
in Bath, we formed the corps of "light duty" men in the Tax-in-Kind 
department of this Congressional District.  The cars were crowded with 
detailed farmers and others, also going to Camp Lee.  Most of them were 
very merry.  &#8212;  I felt far otherwise.  About dark we arrived in 
Richmond, and the crowd generally went to the Powhatan House and took 
lodgings.  The evening + night, I suffered greatly from head-ache.  The 
next morning I called to see Col. Larkin 
Smith, Asst. Q. M. 
Gen, in charge of the Tax-in-Kind business.  He was very 
friendly, and said he would try to get a detail for me without a re-
examination by a Medical Board.  The assessors, he said, were to be 
released, by order of Mr. Secretary of War.  Antrim, Stuart + Hyde were 
the assessors on my list.  Col. S. endorsed the paper <sup>[what paper?]</sup> and 
sent an officer with me to the Commiss. Dept. or Bureau.  This officer 
had a talk with a Capt. Riddick, who first 
proposed to give us a "protection" for twenty days  &#8212;  then said it 
was unnecessary to multiply papers, and if he (the officer) would get 
the Q. M. Gen. to endorse 
the paper, he would grant a detail.  The officer requested to me to 
take the paper back to Col. Smith and ask 
him to procure the endorsement while he was after the assessors.  I 
hurried to Col. S. and he got the Q. M. Gen.s endorsement.  Capt. Riddick then wrote something on the paper, 
saying to me that it was unnecessary to order details for the three 
assessors, as they were in the general list for the State.  After 
finishing the paper he handed it to a clerk, who made an entry in a 
large book; he handed it to another clerk who enveloped and sealed it, 
+ delivered it to me.  I discovered that it was addressed to Col. Shields, and the second clerk went with me 
to Adjt. Binford's office where I was to 
leave it.  &#8212;  The last named informed me that the paper would be sent 
to the Camp, where details were made out.  He also informed me that 
"the men" must report + register there.  Late in the day we marched off 
to Camp.  When we arrived, found several hundred men in line, preparing 
to leave for Early's command in the Valley  &#8212;  many of them from 
August.  Legh came to meet me  &#8212;  I had heard that a Medical Board had 
assigned him to artillery, pronouncing him unfit for infantry or 
cavalry.  We had a private talk, and my affections yearned towards him.  
As soon as possible I inquired of Col. 
Shields if the paper had come from Adjt. 
Binford; he took me into the Detail office  &#8212;  no paper there  &#8212;  
must call again next morning.  About dark we got back to the hotel.  
Legh went with me to spend the night.  He had not been absent from Camp 
before since his arrival.  Augusta county was still well represented at 
the Powhatan, and there was a good deal of merryment among the party  -
- whistling to keep their courage up.  On Thursday morning we went back 
to camp quite early  &#8212; Still no paper had arrived.  Got an order from 
Col. Shields to bring it up from the city.  
&#8212;  Hurried down  &#8212;  found it had gone up  &#8212;  was in the office at 
Camp when I got back.  Clerk began to make off the details  &#8212;  I stuck 
by so as not to lose sight of the papers.  Had much difficulty in 
getting myself and party registered  &#8212;  finally the clerk, who knew 
me, put other matters aside and hurried my business through.  &#8212;  Then 
I hastened back to the Detail Office.  The papers when made out were 
delivered to a Lieut. Richardson  &#8212;  he asked me to hand them to Lt. Potters, in another room.  This Lt. signed them, and directed me to return 
them to Lt. Richardson.  He put them 
with a large pile of similar papers, and delivered them to a Sergeant, 
directing him to place mine on the top so that I should get them first.  
The Sergeant told me to follow him into the office, and away we went 
over the grounds for several hundred yards to Lt. Doyle's Office  &#8212;  crowds of men, who 
had probably been waiting for days or weeks, running up and calling, 
"Sergeant, got my papers?"  "My papers, Sergeant?"  At Lt. Doyle's my papers were dispatched in 
quick time, and Gilkeson, King + I were ready to return home.  Legh 
went back with me to the Hotel.  I felt very sad to leave him.  He did 
not know what his fate would be.  Officials at Camp Lee told him no 
more artillery men were wanted, while the Med. Board pronounced him 
unfit for any other branch.  All day Thursday we heard the roar of 
battle below Richmond  &#8212;  at night there were many reports as to the 
result, and rumors that no one would be permitted to leave the city 
next day.  So it turned out Friday morning, when we arrived at the 
Depot.  No one was allowed to enter the cars unless his passport was 
dated that day.  I hurried back to the Passport office  &#8212;  told there 
that no one between 15 and 55 years of age would be allowed to leave 
the city.  So we were caught.  The expectation that the enemy would 
renew the assault had led to the order.  At such times there is a sigh 
of terror in Richmond  &#8212;  Armed guards parade the streets and 
sometimes search the hotels, and order all males between the prescribed 
ages to the "Soldiers Home," preparatory to sending them to the front.  
The guards are generally rude men, and take pleasure in executing their 
orders as rigidly as possible.  No matter who the person is, or what 
papers he may carry, or what indispensable business, public or private, 
he may be on, he will probably find himself in the trenches before he 
finds a hearing.  Under these circumstances on Friday morning, I went 
from the Depot to Mr. Cook's in a retired part of the city, and lay 
there during the day  &#8212;  in fact till Saturday morning.  &#8212;  The order 
for a general arrest was countermanded on Friday, as the battle was not 
resumed, + I had no difficulty in getting off Saturday morning.  
Reached home that evening about dark.  John Henderson came up with me  
&#8212;  he goes in as Treasurer about the 1st of January  &#8212;  still urges 
me to take a place, and I <u>almost</u> promised 
to do so.  Since my return have been trying to do something for Legh.  
Tate has applied through May.  Noland to have him detailed.  The 
recruits recently sent to Early  &#8212;  many of them wealthy and highly 
respectable citizens of this county  &#8212;  have been sent through town 
under guard, to the great disgust of the citizens.  &#8212;  And Alexander 
came up with me from Richmond, and staid with us till this morning.  B.

had arrived on the RR train.  A few days 
ago a "protection" for him for 30 days was secured, with a promise of a 
detail.  I sent him the paper by Hawk Young.  No military movements 
this week, so far as we have heard.  Some of the Northern papers

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Several detailed farmers called into the army by recent orders 
brought their cases before Judge Thomson by 
writ of <u>habeas corpus</u>, and he rendered a 
decision to-day in their favor, on the ground 
that the Government had entered into contract to release them from 
military service for twelve months in consideration of their selling 
their surplus produces to the army at schedule prices.  Most of the 
detailed farmers of the county are now in the army, and unless 
Congress, which meets on Monday, authorizes the suspension of the unit, 
<u>habeas corpus</u> will probably be 
extensively patronized.  Many detailed men  &#8212;  some of them 
respectable and wealthy  &#8212;  have run off  &#8212;  probably hiding in the 
mountains.  I saw Legh yesterday.  He gives an interesting narrative of 
this two weeks' experience at Camp Lee.  The authorities at Camp were 
utterly at a loss what to do with the men (only 8 or 10) recommended by 
Medical Boards for artillery service, as no more were wanted.  He had 
no duties to perform, and being subject to no restraint, after I left 
him, he visited the fortifications below Richmond.  The day I lay at 
Mr. Cook's, the denizens of Camp Lee were formed into companies to 
march to the front, in case of emergency.  Some of them, however, took 
to the bushes!  Early is said to have established very rigid discipline 
in his army  &#8212;  four or five role calls a day and innumerable drills.

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Great difficulty in procuring sustenance for Early's army.  The 
Chief Commissary telegraphed to Tate on Saturday, to borrow flour, that 
he had only a half day's rations.  Nothing can be obtained from 
Rockingham, and Augusta is relied upon almost exclusively.  It is 
impossible, however, for this county to feed the army, the military 
Hospitals here, the other public institutions, about one half of 
Richmond city, and our own population to boot.  &#8212;  Yet all this seems 
to be expected of her.  There was a rumor this morning that the Yankees 
were advancing up the Valley against Early.  I presume it was untrue.  
To-morrow will decide who shall be 
President of the United States  &#8212;  Lincoln or M<sup>c</sup>Clelland.  
The election of the latter would surprise me.  1<sup>st</sup> because I 
have no reason to suppose the people are tired of Lincoln and his 
policy, and 2<sup>nd</sup>, if they were, the party in power can carry 
the day by force and brand.  With Lincoln re-elected I see no prospect 
of peace, but of long years of slaughter and bloodshed and anguish; 
with M<sup>c</sup>Clelland, we <u>may</u> have a 
change for the better.  God reigns, and may He order the event in 
mercy.  I brought Sandy Waddell home yesterday from church  &#8212;  he is

kitchen asking for something to eat.  Considering the lateness of the 
hour, I thought it very strange, and went down to see the men.  One had 
his back towards me and I could not see his face, the other seemed to 
have a good countenance  &#8212;  both were sitting by the stove.  The 
latter apologized for calling so late, wished me not to put myself to 
trouble, he expected to get something from the old man (Wright) as he 
had been here before  &#8212;  they were away from the army on "horse 
details," (that they belonged to the cavalry, and were furloughed to go 
home for fresh horses).  I found in the storeroom some bread + meat, 
which I gave to Jinny for them, with some apples.  No news for several 
days  &#8212;  a rumor that Sheridan is moving off  &#8212;  supposed to join 
Grant below Richmond.  From the efforts making to provision Early's 
army, it must be in great straits for subsistence.  Commissioners and 
Quartermasters with details of men are traversing the county in search 
of supplies.  The mills are watched and every barrel of flour taken up 
as soon as it is turned out.  A great fight near Richmond is 
anticipated soon.  A detail for Legh has been sent up from Richmond, 
till the 1<sup>st</sup> of May next.  The salt purchased for the town 
has arrived.  Every housekeeper is allowed to purchase 25 pounds for 
each member of his family, at 30 cents a pound.  I purchased 275 pounds 
and paid $82.50.  Hope to trade the greater part of it to some farmer 
for sorghum molasses.  Mr. Stuart married a couple last night, and

Walters' on a visit.  We went in Alick's spring wagon drawn by an 
indifferent mule borrowed from the Government stable.  The animal 
required a great deal of whipping, but we accomplished the trip of six 
miles in about two hours.  I was reluctant to go, but was amply repaid 
for my trouble by the relaxation and good cheer which the visit 
afforded.  We had for supper and breakfast, first of all, genuine 
coffee, as well as tea, and buckwheat cakes, with plenty of butter, 
chicken, eggs, honey +c.  But better still, the associations and 
feelings of the last four years were interrupted.  I almost forgot the 
war and all its travails, and awoke this morning strangely refreshed 
and cheerful.  I came back with a load of pumpkins for the cow.  Va will return to-
morrow, by church time.  Early is certainly moving down the 
Valley after the Yankees.  Intelligence from the Presidential election 
in the United States indicates the success of Lincoln.  If this is the 
result, by a decided popular majority, at least four years more of war 
are ahead of us.  How can we endure it!  Our soldiers must become 
discouraged by the prospect, after all they have endured.  I should say 
that Lincoln's election by a small and doubtful majority would be the 
most favorable result for us, as likely to give rise to popular or 
party discontent and tumult in the North.</p></p>

Valley, and the enemy driven through Winchester.  At night it was said 
our army was at Winchester.  This morning it was reported that a corps 
of Sheridan's army had gone into Pennsylvania to quell popular 
outbreaks.  This afternoon we heard that Early was back again at New 
Market, the want of subsistence, it is presumed, having brought him 
back.  I understand that the Richmond papers of this morning, received 
to-night, say again, as they have been 
saying for nearly a week past that Lyncoln 
was undoubtedly elected; but so far there has been no definite or 
reliable information as to the votes of the different States.  Northern

A letter from the Valley says that a Northern paper arrived in our army

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">No longer a doubt as to the election of Lincoln.  &#8212;  Thus the 
Northern people have declared in favor of prosecuting the war, even to 
our extermination.  &#8212;  Lincoln has called for a million of men!  &#8212;  
probably for "Buncombe."  Seward announced in a public speech the night 
before the election, that the re-election of Lincoln would discourage 
the South and cause us to give up; the call for a million of men is 
doubtless intended to strike additional terror into our hearts.  A 
rumor that Sherman has burnt Atlanta and is marching upon Charleston.  
Forrest has been destroying a large number of Yankee transports, 
gunboats +c on the Tennessee river  &#8212;  but <u>cui 
bono</u>?  This evening I rode up to my wood land to see how much 
wood Jim had cut  &#8212;  Mr. Tate's Thornton is hauling for me.  The 
Artillery company camped on my land have destroyed a considerable 
amount of timber, and I fear will leave very little for me.  I hoped to 
get a little corn from the patch I had cultivated, but from my 
examination of the shucks, neither corn nor fodder 
is worth sending for.  Va bought <u>a pound</u> of brown sugar to-
day, for $12  &#8212;  cheaper than some time ago.  Just about four 
years ago I began this journal  &#8212;  when I get through this book, I 
shall have no more paper  &#8212;  and no heart to enter upon another 
campaign of four years.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, Nov. 16.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This day was observed as a day of prayer, by recommendation of 
President Davis.  The service this morning in our church was informal, 
and a prayer-meeting, remarkably well attended, was held in the 
afternoon.  I feel revived and encouraged  &#8212;  If God has given us a 
spirit of prayer, will He not answer our prayers?  We read in the Bible 
again and again of His interfering in bhalf 
of those who sought His assistance and He is the same God, still mighty 
in power and full of mercy.  We are utterly undeserving of His favor, 
it is true; but they were sinful men who prevailed with Him of old  &#8212;  
"Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are"  &#8212;  And we have a 
great High Priest who has made our atonement and intercedes for us.  
God may not answer as exactly as we now desire, but if he <u>bless</u> us we shall be satisfied.  
Notwithstanding all we have suffered, and all we apprehend in the 
future, we have great cause for thankfulness  &#8212;  We thank Him for 
turning so many of our people to Himself, and giving us so many God-
fearing rulers and soldiers.  He said to the children of Israel:  "I 
bare you on eagles' wings, <u>and brought you unto 
myself</u>."  May this be the end of His dealings with us!  Show us 
wherefore Thou contendest with us!  &#8212;  If for any special sin, reveal 
it to us, and cause us to repent of it and forsake it!  Alas!  alas!  
how much of my time do I spend in practical infidelity  &#8212;  as if there 
were no God governing the minutest affairs, but accident or men or 
Satan ruled the universe.</p><p class="p10">Capt Smith has been quite ill for

not seen him to-day, as I have been unwell 
myself this afternoon, and company is injurious to him.  Kershaw's 
Division has left the Valley, having marched from New Market to 
Waynesboro; where the men took the Railroad cars.  We have had no mail 
since night before last, in consequence of the movement of troops.  We 
are not advised as to their destination.  Some anxiety is felt in 
regard to affairs in the South.  The Federal army under Thomas has been 
largely reinforced from Missouri, and Hood may now be held in check by 
Thomas while Sherman does as he pleases.  Our troops under Price and 
others West of the Mississippi, have no enemy to detain them there, but 
cannot cross the river to our assistance.  A rumor to-day of another reverse to our cavalry in Page 
Valley.  &#8212;  It is said the Federal government has annexed Jefferson 
county to <u>their</u> State of "West Virginia,"

can be gotten Sherman is moving down into Georgia, burning towns +c, as 
he goes.  &#8212;  We have some forces in that quarter, and they have had 
some encounter with the enemy; but we can get no particulars.  A

<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, Nov. 29</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The newspapers give us no intelligence from Georgia, because, I 
presume, the enemy would get information in regard to Sherman in that 
manner.  Rumors are encouraging for our side, but vague and uncertain.  
Among the crowd of soldiers  &#8212;  a hundred or more  &#8212;  who went down 
the Valley to the army, on yesterday, several were barefooted  &#8212;  A 
few mornings ago I met some eight or ten men on their way down  &#8212;  
nearly all were lame and several were on <u>crutches</u>!  They said the object in sending  
them to the army was to "retire" them, but to require such men to walk 
forty-five miles for any purpose is an outrage and shows very bad 
management <i>[illeg.]</i>.  I have been quite unwell since yesterday

has never before been occupied by our forces.  He took between 600 and 
700 prisoners, many horses and wagons, +c +c.  Destroyed a quantity of 
ammunition.  He did not attempt to hold the place.</p><p class="p10">Sherman seems to be at a stand-still in Georgia.  We have no force 
there adequate to meet him in battle, but he seems to be surrounded by 
small bodies which embarrass his movements.  Hood has arrived near 
Nashville, when last heard from.  A deputation has arrived in 
Washington from England, bearing a petition or memorial to the 
President of the Untied States, signed by more than 300,000 persons,

ridiculously small.  After supper, I brought into the dining room for 
Va to see, and hung it up to the 
mantelpiece  &#8212;  Wright went to get it to put it in the meat house and 
was greatly perplexed when he found it was gone.  He felt sure some one

else in the house, I took them some apples.  The weather is bleak, and 
altogether my sympathies for the soldiers have been greatly excited.  
The men, however, shout as if they were in good spirits.  &#8212;  All of 
Early's Artillery is coming to muster near Fishersville  &#8212;  a portion 
passed through town to-day.  I met Judge 
Thompson this evening, and had a talk with him.  He was greatly cast 
down.  Said that Sherman had probably taken Savannah by this time, that 
Hardie had only 8000 men to oppose him, and there was danger of his 
being captured.  The Judge had had a conversation with Gen. Fauntleroy, who said we had not seen the 
worst yet, and our only alternative was subjugation or death.  Most of 
the Yankee infantry have left the Valley.  Judge T. thinks Sherman will 
now move upon Richmond, which must soon fall.  After Supper to-night Capt. Jimmy 
Smith (whose father once lived in this house) and Lt. Jimmy Smith, of Wetumpka, Ala., both of Brig. Gen. Battle's staff, called up.  &#8212;  Va, Kitty and Matty were at the Seminary, I am

killed.  Uncertain whether the enemy had destroyed the Salt Works or 
not.  &#8212;  I heard to-night that President 
Davis was very ill.  Had been very much worried to-
day, trying to set the Gas Works going once more.  Two Irishmen 
demanded $500 each a month as laborers.  We have very little rosin 
secured, and my judgment is adverse to attempting to make gas under

the business is devolved upon me.  Quartermasters and Commissaries 
passing upon me, one after another, and every now and then a call in 
reference to the Gas Works.  I finally had to write a note to the other 
Directors declining any further attention to the business.  About 
eleven o'clock the troops began to pass through town again, and I then 
learned that the enemy was advancing up the Valley.  The infantry 
passed through from Fishersville, and the cavalry from the West.  &#8212;  
The girls (Kitty + Nanny) are greatly disappointed, as they expected 
beaux from both quarters for their school entertainment, which will

up the Valley.  They came within a few miles of Harrisonburg, and all 
accounts concurred that they advanced no further.  One report stated 
that they had gone back, another, that they had crossed the Blue Ridge; 
and a third that the advance towards Harrisonburg was to cover the 
movement of a larger party across the mountain.  Refugees from 
Harrisonburg, however, were preparing yesterday evening to return home.  
&#8212;  This morning, I learned that Roper had a little fight yesterday 
below Harrisonburg, and captured forty of the enemy.  This evening the 
cavalry returned.  &#8212;  They said the Yankees had gone off.  We have no

thirty-two men.  Early this morning the cavalry entered town again, 
having been aroused at 3 o'clock, in consequence of movements of the 
enemy East of the Ridge.  The men were chilled and hungry  &#8212;  four 
came to our house before I was up, to warm and get breakfast.  Others 
called during the morning.  Poor fellows!  The weather is bitter cold, 
the ground covered with snow, and the roads slippery.  How can men 
stand such hardships!  No wonder that they are disheartened, as it is 
reported they are.  There is a rumor that the 5<sup>th</sup> Regiment 
Infantry is under arrest, having refused to go to Georgia.  Northern 
papers continue to give glowing accounts of their victory over Hood  &#8212;  
they say that Forrest was killed.  No advices from our side, but our 
people are prepared to believe anything.  The feeling of depression is 
deep and general  &#8212;  It seems to me impossible for us to stand out 
much longer.  Our servants have a party to-
night  &#8212;  Va + Kate have their

not arrive till this morning.  &#8212;  Savannah has been evacuated by our 
troops.  The Salt Works, in S. W. 
Va., it is rumored, have fallen into the hands of the enemy.  
Northern papers continue to give glowing accounts of Thomas' victory 
over Hood, at Nashville.  They say we lost 60 cannon and 15,000 men 
captured by Thomas, and that Hood's army is completely scattered.  No 
reports yet from our side, or at least our authorities have divulged no 
dispatches received by them.  Our affairs to look rather desperate.  
Some persons are hoping again that the U. 
S. will get into trouble with England  &#8212;  I do not expect it.  
Nothing but darkness all around the horizon  &#8212;  Light comes only from 
above.  God reigns!  Oh, "Show us wherefore thou contendest with us."  
Four soldiers called to-day and got dinner, 
while their horses were at the blacksmith's shop.  Mr. Stuart has 
returned from Prince Edward.  He says troops were going South by the 
Danville Railroad, and that one night, eight or nine men froze to death

third that they were not destroyed at all.</p><p class="p10">We have certainly fought too many battles  &#8212;  It is absurd for us 
to attempt to whip the North by main force.  We should never fight 
except when there is a certainty of success  &#8212;  Let the enemy take the 
towns  &#8212;  they cannot hold them all; and so long as we maintain our 
armies, frequent opportunities will be afforded of striking effective 
blows.  The army and the people would be far less discouraged by the 
policy of retreating before superior forces, than by the insane course 
which has been pursued of fighting at every point at great 
disadvantage, and having our armies routed and destroyed.  Frederick 
the Great and Napoleon concentrated their forces, and always brought 
superior numbers to bear upon the enemy when they fought  &#8212;  Gen. Hood sends off a part of his army, +

her what she had been doing.  She replied  &#8212;  "Doing my night's work."  
Dear child!  She brings in wood and water, and does all sorts of 
drudgery.  She then turned her face up to me and said  &#8212;  "Uncle Addy, 
could you get me a piece of black paper?"  I told her that I could not, 
and asked her what she wanted with it.  To put her paper lady in black, 
she said.  "Why," said one of the family, "is her husband dead

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Lelia Stuart is somewhat unwell and Kate found her this morning 
lying up with one of her mother's night-caps on, trying to <u>play</u> sick and looking very quizzically.  I went 
down to see her after dark.  When I returned home, before I entered the 
sitting room, I discovered a man on a chair before the fire.  Kate met 
me at the door and I asked who it was; she replied "a soldier."  It was 
Jimmy Tate, who had come home on a furlough of fifteen days.  Of course 
there was great rejoicing.  Jimmy Frazier is here also, having come in 
last night.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, January 12.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">For some weeks past we have been eating only two meals a day, the 
second one at 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  Wednesdays and Fridays 
we have it at 5 because the weekly lecture and prayer meeting are not 
over before that hour.  It is a convenient arrangement on several 
accounts.  Having no sugar, coffee and tea as formerly, we cannot 
afford supper, and do not need it after a late dinner.  Secondly, it 
suits me and the school girls.  I remain at the office till 4 o'clock, 
and then stop work for the day.  The shifts we are driven to these 
times to get along are sometimes amusing.  The State sells <u>salt</u> to citizens at less price than the market 
affords, and I have secured all I am entitled to as the best investment 
for Confederate money.  Some time ago the article was distributed to 
the people of the town at the rate of 25 pounds to each person, and I 
have obtained 275 lbs, our family consisting of eleven members.  
Another distribution has been made, and to-day 
I secured 220 lbs more.  We had some on hand previously, and after 
salting our beef and pork, have now about 400 lbs which we propose 
trading hereafter for other necessaries of life.  Farmers and graziers 
cannot obtain a sufficient quantity from county and town authorities to 
meet their wants.  I have paid 30 cts per 
pound  &#8212;  the market price is 75 to 80 cts.  
During the last two years, Va has 
purchased only one dress.  It has distressed me much that she has not 
been able to procure more.  Perhaps the salt may be available for this 
purpose.  A dress which formerly cost $10 to $15, now costs $400 to 
$500  &#8212;  that is, my pay for four or five months.  I have engaged six 
barrels of flour, for which I am to execute my bond, 
amounting to $66, payable "after the war"  &#8212;  Two of these will go to 
repay two borrowed by us last Summer, one of them I expect to let Aunt 
Sally have.  __________  After dinner this evening I went down to 
Sister's  &#8212;  She and Mr. Stuart were at Mr. Baker's.  Mary and the 
younger children were at home.  The latter had just returned from a 
juvenile party.  Net, and perhaps Lelia, had been invited to another 
to-morrow night, and Jinny seemed to think 
it a hard case that she had been passed over.  Lelia was full of life, 
as usual, She has no musical talent, but nevertheless sought to 
entertain me by singing.  She attempted the Sunday School hymn, "Oh!  I 
would be an angel," without being able to hit the tune; and then, not 
in the least discouraged, proposed to try "The frog he thought he'd 
take a ride," in which she had no better success.  I called at Alick's, 
and had Addy's account of the party also  &#8212;  Mary had gone to bed.  
_____  Jimmy Tate complains of home as very dull.  Alas!  alas!  There 
is nothing cheering in this world for us to look forward to.  Everybody 
depressed.  I hardly ever look into a newspaper.  Cant afford to subscribe for one, and they are 
filled with everything that is depressing  &#8212;  Their attempts to 
encourage the people only prove that a feeling of discouragement 
prevails.  Parents whose boys are approaching military age (17) are 
generally suffering great anxiety.  Jimmy Frazier expects to start home 
to-morrow.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Roper, with a portion of his command made an expedition to Beverly 
recently and captured the place, with six or seven hundred Yankee 
soldiers.  The prisoners were expected at Swoope's Depot this evening.  
There is much talk about peace negotiations.  F. P. Blair, Sr., has 
come from Washington to Richmond and had one or more interviews with 
President Davis.  He left Richmond on Saturday, and by that time a 
General Singleton, of Illinois, had arrived.  There are various 
speculations on the subject of these visits, but the public are not 
advised as to the object.  Northern papers also have much to say in 
regard to peace projects both at Washington and Richmond.  They say 
that our Congress has appointed a committee to proceed to Washington to 
negotiate and intimate that we are ready to give up.  For some time 
past it has been rumored that many "original secessionists" were in 
favor of "re-construction"  &#8212;  that is going back into the Union with 
the view of saving the institution of slavery.  I greatly prefer 
independence without slavery, to <u>submission</u> with it, and would be glad enough to 
get rid of it if I could see any way of disposing of the negroes, 
without giving <u>them up to barbarism or 
annihilation</u>.  It is rumored, on what authority I know not, that 
France and England have notified Lincoln of their intention to 
interfere in bhalf of the Confederacy, upon 
our agreeing to <i>[deleted: gradual]</i> emancipation + to take effect sixty 
years hence  &#8212;  agreed!  Gen. Foote the 
obstreporous member of Congress from 
Tennessee, was arrested a few days ago, near Fredericksburg, while 
trying to make his way to the North.  He said he was going to try and 
make peace!  The President referred the matter to the House of 
Representatives.  In the mean while another assault on Wilmington is in 
progress.  The infamous Butler, it is reported, has been sent home by 
his employers at Washington.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The first thing I heard this morning, while I was getting out of 
bed, was that Fort Fisher had been captured by the enemy.  Thus 
Wilmington is at last closed to foreign commerce, even if it should not 
be captured.  "Bad news," was on the lips of everybody.  Some say that 
gold is over a hundred in Richmond (that is that one dollar in gold 
brings more than a hundred in Confederate Treasury notes), while others 
say it has fallen to thirty or forty, in consequence of the closing of 
our last port  &#8212;  no need for gold now to send 
abroad.  The prices of all imported articles has gone up.  Pins sell in 
town at $12 a paper, and needles at $10  &#8212;  Flour in Richmond at $1000 
a barrel!!  Confederate currency is almost gone.  Jimmy Tate has to 
return to the army on Monday next  &#8212;  Poor fellow!  he bears up 
bravely.  Many persons since ready to go back into the Union.  I would 
rather lose slavery and everything and become a serf to Russia.  
Weather very cold.  There are rumors of perilous dissensions in 
Congress, in recent session.</p><p class="p10">Later.  &#8212;  We heard a vehicle dash by with fearful speed, and all 
of us rushed to the front porch.  It was so dark we could not see, but 
we heard voices on the M<sup>c</sup>Adamized, or Augusta, Street, Jimmy 
+ I hurried down.  James Skinner was starting to a wedding in a one 
horse wagon, driven by an old negro man, and the horse ran off and 
pitched them out against a plank fence.  The old man was lying on the 
ground, while Jim was groping about.  Neither of them as it turned out, 
was seriously injured</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Many persons were encouraging themselves to-
day, with reports about foreign intervention.  Northern papers 
have published versions of the sort, and this morning it was stated 
that letters had been received from Richmond saying that England had 
acknowledged our independence, +c +c.  There was no foundation for the 
reports, but still quite a hopeful feeling prevailed.  The philosophy 
of Don Quixote is the only source of consolation or hope, so far as I 
can see.  After he had suffered a series of disasters on one occasion, 
he thus discoursed to Sancho:  "All these storms that fall upon us, are 
signs that the weather will clear up, and things will go smoothly; for 
it is impossible that either evil or good should be durable:  and hence 
it follows, that the evil having lasted long, the good cannot be far 
off."</p><p class="p10">The prisoners captured by Roper at Beverly, went sent off by 
Railroad to-day.  They have suffered greatly 
from cold and hunger.  Several of them died on the way to Staunton, and 
others will probably not survive long.  After the train started, I saw 
one of the prisoners lying on the pavement at the corner of the Court-
house yard.  A crowd was around him, some of whom said the man was 
dying.  He was taken to the Hospital.  All of the prisoners 
<i>[deleted: were]</i> <sup>are</sup> from Ohio.  It is said that one of them 
boasted that he had been in many of the houses about here, and that his

should have been.  Yesterday was a day of sleet and rain, and this 
morning the trees had a thicker coating of ice than I ever saw before.  

Some trees were bowed down to the ground, and many branches were 
broken.  Thawing all day, and the branches, relieved of their burden, 
are standing up nearly as before.  Notwithstanding the inclement 
weather, there was quite a dining party at Alick's yesterday  &#8212;  Mr. + 
Mrs. Baker, Mr. + Mrs. J. H. Woods, Mr. Stuart + sister, Va, Kate + myself, another Wm. Gallaher.  The dinner was remarkably good  &#8212;

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">F. P. Blair has returned to Richmond.  Northern papers lately 
reported him as in close conference with Lincoln.  Of course, every 
body surmises that some peace negotiation is on foot.  All of the 
Virginia delegation in Congress, with one exception, have requested the 
resignation of the Cabinet, excepting <i>[illeg.]</i> of Treasury 
Department.  Seddon, Sec. of War, has 
already resigned.  Both houses of Congress have requested the

appointment of a "General-in-Chief."</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, January 26.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Gen. Smith, of the Military Institute, 
came up from Richmond last night, full of reports.  A gentleman on the 
train yesterday, was telling that Blair had dinner with him, and 
expressed the belief that the war would be over by April.  Blair said 
he reported to Lincoln after his first visit to Richmond, that he must 
either acknowledge the independence of the Confederacy, or exterminate 
the people  &#8212;  that there was no hope of peace  &#8212;  with the South on 
any other terms.  &#8212;  It was presumed that Lincoln was anxious to bring 
this war to an end, on account of the threatened interference of 
foreign powers, England.  Gen. Smith said, 
had now thirty-odd vessels of <i>[illeg.]</i> on the coast of California, 
and had ordered every man in her military and naval service to report 
for duty.  It was reported in Richmond, on Tuesday, that an armistice 
had been concluded.  Gold was falling rapidly notwithstanding these 
rumors, it is evident that many of our people are ready to give up  &#8212;  
especially the <u>original secessionists</u>.

<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, January 30.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yesterday morning, at church, I heard that a dispatch was received 
the night before, stating that Vice President Stephens, Senator Hunter 
and Judge Campbell had gone to Washington as peace commissioners.  The 
report was confirmed by passengers from Richmond, last night.  Most 
persons to-day gave way to the most delightful 
anticipations of peace.  I felt afraid to hope for such a result, but 
nevertheless could not but think that we had gained a great point, as 
Lincoln had at last agreed to receive Commissioners from our 
government.  The papers received to-night 
state, however, that the gentlemen named (who started yesterday) have 
not gone as formal commissioners but as private citizens.  I therefore 
see no use in their going.  A part of Thomas' army has passed Harper's 
Ferry; it is said, going towards Washington.  Estill Waddell is here 
to-night.  He came home on furlough.  
Weather less cold.  Yesterday and to-day 
comparatively very pleasant.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, January 31.  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Our "peace Commissioners" were detained at Petersburg yesterday, 
owing to some difficulty in getting through Grant's lines.  Whether 
they are permitted to go on or not, I am persuaded that Lincoln has no 
idea of making peace with us, except upon condition of our returning to 
the Union, and that this whole matter is a Yankee trick.  President 
Davis is probably not deceived by it, but has some object to accomplish 
by giving in to it.  The Washington Congress has passed resolutions for 
sending a minister to "the Republic of Mexico," whereupon, it is 
reported, the French minister demanded his passport.  Hope it's so.  
Sherman is marching upon Charleston and Augusta.  Gen. Early has had his head-quarters in town for 
some time past, and Fitzhugh Lee moved up from Waynesboro a few days 
ago.  The latter, with his staff, occupies the old Cease house in our 
part of the town, the former has his flag planted at the gate leading 
to my office, which his adjutant occupies.  The many army wagons about 
town have been assisting the citizens to fill their ice houses.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, February 2.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">John Graham called to-night.  He is going 
home on a brief furlough.  The <u>peace 
com</u>missioners have at last passed through Grant's lines, on 
their way to Washington.  The whole business seems to me a mere pretence.  Gen. Lee 
has been made Commander-in-Chief.  It is said he is looking for an 
attack in a few days.  A large part of Thomas' army has come round from 
Tennessee and joined Grant.  The Senate has passed a bill abolishing 
the offices of all past Quartermasters and Commissioners who are under 
45 years of age and not disabled or unfit for field service, and 
prohibiting the detail of persons in those departments who do not come 
within the exceptions.  Last night I called to see Daniel Wilson, an 
old College acquaintance, who is a member of the Military Court now 
sitting here.  Met Gen. Early for the 
first time.  Did not like him.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, February 3.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The Richmond papers received to-night 
bring no extracts from late Northern papers.  Seward said, in an 
address recently delivered in Washington city, that he was waiting for 
the submission of the rebels, which was bound to follow their military 
reverses.  No sign of peace at the North.  Yet three of our first 
citizens have gone to Washington to talk about it.  I am more and more 
satisfied that it is a farce.  President Davis and the three gentlemen 
(not Commissioners) have doubtless some object in view  &#8212;  I cannot 
think that they anticipate peace.  But if it should come, how would 
every heart thrill with joy!  Alick and I bought twelve pounds of sugar 
to-day, thinking we had a great bargain  &#8212;  
it was only $16 a pound.  When we came to divide it, there was a little 
over ten pounds.  The seller or servant who brought it home cheated us 
out of two.  So we might as well as have bought it from a store.  My 
five pounds cost me $96.</p></p>

Lee, and Capt. Smith, and Tate brought 
Capt. Bayly.  While we were at dinner 
Gen. Lilly and a young Lt. Meade, of somebody's staff, called.  I 
have heard no war news to-day.  Sherman, I 
fear, is having his own way in Georgia and South Carolina.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">It was reported to-day that our 
Commissioners had returned to Richmond after an interview with Seward 
at Fortress Monroe.  One passenger by the train last night brought this 
report; others had not heard it in Richmond.  I have doubted the truth 
of it, especially as I think Seward will be smart enough to detain the 
Commissioners, Committee, or whatever the three gentlemen are.  Va and I walked out to Wm. P. Tate's to-night, + sat about two hours.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, February 7.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">It is true that our Commissioners have returned to Richmond.  The 
newspapers say that they were not permitted to land at Fortress Monroe, 
but Lincoln and Seward met them on the boat.  The "rebels" were 
informed that they could have peace by laying down their arms and 
coming back into the Union <u>as it is</u>.  
These terms were not but talk, and the conference terminated.  Lincoln, 
it is said, asserted that Blair had gone to Richmond without his 
authority, which might be false.  It is inevitable that he would or 
could have come to Richmond, and after interviews with President Davis, 
gone back to Washington, and had long private conferences with Lincoln 
(as <u>Northern</u> papers say he did) and then 
returned to Richmond to hold further communication with our 
authorities, unless Lincoln had, at least, <u>authorized</u> his movements.  Rumored that foreign 
powers have notified Lincoln that after the 4<sup>th</sup> March they 
will recognise him as President only so 
far as his jurisdiction extends, and that to the same extent they will 
recognise the Confederate States.  An 
attack from Grant is expected.</p></p>

victory over Sherman, but alas! no such dispatch has been received in 
Richmond.  So far as we know Sherman is carrying everything before him 
in South Carolina.  Gen. Lee urges putting 
negroes in the army, with the promise of freedom to those who serve.  
The measure seems to me a concession of despair.  &#8212;  It has been under 
consideration in Congress and the Legislature.  The negroes have heard 
of it, and are greatly troubled.  They will doubtless stampede in large

The evaculation of Charleston is a matter 
of course.  We seem to have lost a large amount of valuable property at 
the former place.  We have no power to withstand the great multitude 
which has come against us.  Our cause seems nearly hopeless.  Gen. Lee not only urges that negroes shall be 
employed as soldiers, but that a general system of emancipation be 
inaugurated.  The Yankees, he says, are doing both, and we must make a 
virtue of necessity.  As these pages attest I have always believed that 
the war would bring about the overthrow of slavery.  <i>[deleted: as our 
institutions.]</i>  I never regarded the institution as a desirable 
one, and would have been glad to see it abolished everywhere, but for 
humane considerations, having reference more to the black than the 
white race.  If emancipation could not be effected safely in peaceful 
terms, how can it be accomplished in times like these!  I shudder at 
the prospect.  We have fallen upon awful times.  But God reigns,

inquired for his lodgings and a servant showed them to his room in the

recently that the party had left the town far behind them, on their

Have felt uncomfortable since.  <u>Later</u>  &#8212;

<p class="p11"><b>March 1863 </b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday March 14.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I returned from my Fourth Hegira yesterday.  On Wednesday morning, 
the 1<sup>st</sup> inst., I took leave 
of Virginia, having very little expectation that I should actually have 
to go from home, but all hands were at the office prepared to start, 
and we went off on the first Railroad train.  The town was unusually 
quiet for such a time, and I was entirely free from the anxiety and 
depression which I had always felt before.  The train was, of course, 
much crowded.  Our immediate party consisted of Smith (Capt O) A. J. Gilkeson, myself and a servant-
man.  J. H. Blackley and J. J. Points, who were going to Lynchburg with 
official papers, joined us, and afterwards formed a mess <sup>with 
us</sup>.  <i>[deleted: We were detained]</i>  Many other persons from 
Staunton  &#8212;  Bank officers and others  &#8212;  were also in the train.  We 
were detained the usual time at Charlottesville, and then proceeded to 
Lynchburg on a train loaded to suffocation.  We arrived at Lynchburg 
after dark, and after storing our boxes at the Quartermaster's office. 
Obtained lodgings at the Norbel House, where we also 
got a very good breakfast next morning  &#8212;  price of lodgings $10 and 
of breakfast $10 each.  Thursday the 2<sup>nd</sup>, was a miserable 
rainy day, but we sallied out, and obtained two decent rooms from the 
Quartermaster to which we removed our boxes, and obtaining some fire 
wood and cooking utensils set up housekeeping.  Every body believed 
that the enemy were arriving for Lynchburg but we had no regular troops 
there, and very inadequate means of defense.  Thursday night we learned 
by telegraph from Charlottesville that Gen. Early had made a stand near Waynesboro and 
been utterly routed  &#8212;  nearly his whole force captured and he himself 
killed or a prisoner.  On Friday the local forces were called out to 
man the fortifications, and the Commandant of the Post notified 
officers having papers or public property to have them ready to move to 
a place of safety.  Where was there a safe place if Lynchburg should 
fall!  For the first time my spirits gave way.  I felt that our cause 
was hopeless.  On Friday we heard that the whole force of the enemy had 
crossed the mountain at Rockfish Gap, and were sneaking for the James 
River at Hardwicksville Bridge.  I urged Capt Smith to leave Lynchburg and go to some 
point on the Tennessee RR., but he 
imagined there was some obligation of honor upon him to keep ahead of 
the enemy.  The Post Officers at Lynchburg were preparing to remove, 
but where they were to go no one could tell.  Smith wished to go to 
Petersburg or Danville, which I strongly objected to, wishing to step 
aside that the torrent might pass us and have the way home open.  The 
telegraph line from Charlottesville ceased to work, but there were 
frequent reports, all telling of disaster.  Wagon trains captured near 
Waynesboro, RR trains destroyed and 
Greenwood Depot, all or nearly all the Post Officers from Staunton 
supposed to be captured.  Being so averse to a trip down the South Side 
RR Capt. 
Smith proposed to procure the necessary papers for us to leave the city 
by any route I pleased.  The papers were obtained and I prepared to 
leave for Salem.  This was Saturday.  That night several men arrived at 
the hotel, one of whom had been only an hour or two ahead of the 
Yankees all the way from New Market, Shenandoah.  He estimated the 
force of the enemy at from 5,000 to 10,000  &#8212;  all mounted.  All, he 
said, had left the Valley.  Sunday morning before daylight, I left our 
quarters for the Tennessee R.R. Depot, 
and got aboard the train.  <sup>When I left Lynchburg a few troops had 
arrived from the S.W. and a small force of Reserves by the Southside 
Railroad.</sup>  Many parolled prisoners 
just from the North, were on board.  I was informed that a stage ran 
from Bousack's Depot to Buchanan, and therefore left the cars at the 
former point.  When the train had passed on I found there was no stage 
from Bousack's to any point, but that one passed along the 
M<sup>c</sup>Adamized road, four or five miles distant, from Salem to 
Buchanan.  There was no alternative for me but to walk across carrying 
my baggage.  The road was very muddy, and I found the walk extremely 
fatiguing.  Every hundred yards or so I was compelled to rest.  My 
spirits did not flag; however, except once when a flock of crows 
started up in a field and circled above my head, keeping up a furious 
crowing.  The idea of the <u>sinister crows</u> 
quite haunted me for a few minutes!  As I approached the turnpike, I 
met two of our wobegone cavalrymen, and 
asked if they had any news from towards Lexington.  They replied that 
twenty thousand Yankees were at Staunton and ten thousand at 
Greenville.  <i>[deleted: I asked if it was an infantry force and]</i>  The 
further information that the whole force was mounted satisfied me that 
the statement was certainly false.  I knew there was no public house on 
the turnpike, and felt some solicitude about a shelter till next day, 
as begging for lodgings was a new and disagreeable business to me.  I 
came upon the turnpike at Cloverdale Mills, Botetourt County, and 
applied at the first house  &#8212;  the miller's.  The old lady said that 
<u>he</u>, meaning her husband, was away, and 
she had but one room.  I perceived the want of accommodation, and went 
to the next house, a Mr. Langhorn's.  This gentleman was a little 
gruff, but finally said he could keep me.  He could not tell when the 
stage would pass, but knew that a train of government wagons would come 
by next morning, going from Salem to Buchanan.  I met him in a house 
formerly used as a store.  He ordered a servant to show me to "the 
office" and kindle a fire for me.  I was conducted to a small log house 
in the yard; where there was a bed, chairs +c.  The arrangement suited 
me exactly; and I felt relieved and thankful at finding such quarters.  
Early in the afternoon, I lay down and fell asleep, being overcome with 
weariness.  After dark, I was aroused by a servant, bringing in some 
supper to me.  I was not hungry, but eat a 
little.  Soon afterwards I fell asleep again and did not wake till the 
servant came in the morning to kindle my fire.  Shortly afterwards my 
host came in and invited me to remain as long as suited me, assuring me 
repeatedly that I was welcome to anything he had.  What produced the 
change in his manner I did not know, nor did I see him afterwards.  At 
breakfast time I was invited into the house and asked to take a seat 
with Mrs. L. and her daughter.  When the 
meal was over, the daughter followed me into the porch, and from her 
talk I discovered that we were descended from a common ancestor, Robert 
McClanahan.  I was then invited into the sitting room, and the mother 
was called in.  We struck up quite an acquaintance, but had not 
proceeded far when the government wagons came up; and I hurried away.  
I rode in a wagon eighteen miles to Buchanan, where I arrived about two 
o'clock.  I left my baggage at the Commissary's Office, weighing it 
first and surprised to find it only thirty-five pounds.  I then went to 
the home of Mr. + Mrs. John S. Wilson, where I was received most 
cordially and invited to remain till the stage would start to 
Lexington.  At Buchanan I received the first news of the conduct of the 
Yankees in Staunton, although one or two men connected with the army 
had told me, while on the road, that no enemy was here now.  I heard of 
the injury done to Judge Thompson's house and furniture (his family 
being from home), the indignities offered to Mrs. Skinner and her deaf-
mute sister and daughter, the burning of Mayse's tan yard +c.<a href="#n85">85</a>  As none of my name were mentioned, I was hopeful 
that my family and relations had sustained no special injury.  The 
running of the stage had suspended on account of the movements of the 
enemy, and also, perhaps, because of the very bad roads.  Consequently 
I could not leave Buchanan for Lexington till Wednesday morning, the 
8<sup>th</sup> inst.  The time passed 
away pleasantly except when I was oppressed with the dread lest the 
enemy should return through Staunton and complete the work of 
destruction.  I heard that Roper had collected a small cavalry force, 
and was endeavoring to rescue the prisoners taken up at Waynesboro  &#8212;  
that there had been no fight and only three or four persons killed  &#8212;  
that Early instead of retiring to Rockfish Gap, had formed a line of 
battle in the open country and that his men finding themselves 
surrounded by a vastly superior force, had laid down their arms that 
Early, Long +c had escaped, but that nearly all the command, with 
artillery, wagons, +c had been captured.  Early Wednesday morning the 
stage started for Lexington.  A lady and myself were the only 
passengers.  The road was almost impassable.  The distance by way of 
the Natural Bridge, is 26 miles, and the stage fare was $39, or one and 
a half dollars per mile, Confederate currency.  We paused at the Bridge 
an hour or two, and arrived at Lexington before dark, in a hard rain.  
As it was the first stage that had arrived for some time, a crowd 
assembled at the hotel as we drove up, to inquire the news.  Among 
other persons was John L. Campbell, who invited me to go to his house.  
Davis Kayser from the same Department as myself in Staunton, was there, 
and from him I obtained further intelligence in regard to affairs at 
home.  One or two names were added to the list of those who had 
suffered from the enemy, but still not a word about any of my family.  
The main body of the enemy had crossed the Blue Ridge at Rockfish Gap, 
and was then so far as known, prowling about the Orange Railroad in 
Amherst, threatening Lynchburg.  We heard that the Lunatic Asylum and 
D. + D. + B Institution at 
Staunton had been robbed of provisions, and that the Ministry of Va at Charlottesville had been destroyed.  The 
latter report proved untrue.  After at Waynesboro, a body of the enemy 
returned to Staunton with the prisoners (1000 to 1200), and proceeded 
down the Valley on Saturday, the 4<sup>th</sup>.  Roper, with a few 
cavalry was pursuing them.  Then we heard that Roper had returned to 
Staunton, unsuccessful, but that many prisoners had escaped.  Much 
apprehension was felt at Lexington lest the enemy should return into 
the Valley, I heard there of the burning of Swoope's Depot, Swoope's 
Mill, barns and other property in that neighborhood.  Col. R. H. Lee, who was captured by the enemy, 
but escaped, was in Lexington.  Having many friends in L. and feeling comparatively easy about 
friends at home, I spent a pleasant time there.  Staid two night's at 
A. Alexander's, and visited at Dr. M<sup>c</sup>Clung's, Mrs. N. 
Graham's, Miss Reid's, Col. Preston's, 
Mrs. Alexander's, besides Mr. Campbell's.  No vehicle was running to 
Staunton, and I had no means of getting on home.  The roads were said 
to be almost impassable.  Lomax and Jackson had passed through 
Lexington going to Lynchburg, and their men were straggling along in 
the same direction.  They were in Bath, Highland, Pendleton +c where 
the enemy advanced up the Valley.  On Saturday morning the ground was 
frozen, and I proposed to Kayser that we should start home.  He had a 
horse and we rode and walked alternately.  We started at eleven 
o'clock, A.M., (11<sup>th</sup>)  &#8212;  met soldiers on the road 
straggling up the Valley, one or more of whom had escaped from the 
Yankees near Woodstock.  We reached the Providence Church before night, 
and were hospitably entertained at Mr. John Withrow's.  Sunday morning 
we started on the road in dreadful condition, making walking or riding 
very laborious.  We heard that Roper had gone to Lye River Gap.  At 
Middlebrook we heard that the enemy were about to recross the mountain 
at the Gap.  D<sup>r</sup>. W<sup>m</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Chesney invited 
us to spend the night with him and wait further intelligence.  There 
was a good deal of excitement in the country, but before dark we became 
satisfied that the enemy was not then coming back.  &#8212;  
M<sup>c</sup>Chesney loaned me a horse, and Monday morning, the 
18<sup>th</sup>, I came home.  I saw Legh, while passing his place, and 
got full particulars in regard to our friends.  He had refugeed across 
North Mountain, and the Yankees had not injured him.  Alick's Nathan 
had gone off with them, and one of his stables was burnt, when the 
Tanyard was destroyed.  I felt grateful to find Va and all friends safe.  &#8212;  and gratified at 
the hearty welcome I received.  Was quite unwell, however, and quite 
broken down.  &#8212;  The Yankees had not been in Mr. Stuart's house at 
all.  At our house their conduct had been insolent and threatening, but 
no personal violence was suffered from them.  They took some pork, 
flour and butter from Va.  This occurred 
on Thursday, the 2<sup>nd</sup>.  The same day, in the evening, they 
burnt Swoope's Depot +c.  By night Thursday, they had all left town.  
Friday the prisoners were brought in from Waynesboro and the Asylum was 
robbed.  On Saturday they proceeded down the Valley, without further 
injury to the citizens.  The usual testimony is that these Yankees are 
the rudest and most lawless we have ever had.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday, March 15</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Roper crossed the Mountain at Tye Run Gap in pursuit of the enemy, 
who were said to be on the James River Canal below Columbia.  Pickett's 
Division of infantry and Lomax's Cavalry were said to be near them.  
Since I left Lynchburg I have heard a report that Sherman had been 
defeated in South Carolina.  &#8212;  It was ripe in Buchanan, Lexington and 
Staunton  &#8212;  I was hopeful at first, but do not believe it now.  This 
morning we heard that Sheridan had crossed the Central Railroad and 
escaped towards Fredericksburg.  Later Legh came in with a report that 
Sheridan had been reinforced by a column from Fredericksburg and was 
within nine miles of Richmond.  We of course have no cars and no mails 
from the East.  The Railroad near Staunton was not injured, but the 
bridges near Charlottesville were destroyed.  A mail was sent yesterday 
on a hand car to Charlottesville.  Sheridan is said to have done 
immense injury to the people East of the Blue Ridge.  He had no train 
and subsisted off the country, destroying and plundering as he went.  
Tate, Bayly, Price and others got home several days ago.  They escaped 
from Greenwood Depot just before the enemy arrived there.  Early had 
several trains of cars unloaded then, and the stores fell into the 
hands of the enemy.  Early's whole management of affairs has been 
miserable.  Tate met Capt. Smith, A. J. 
Gilkeson, J. H. Blackley + others at Farmsville.  &#8212;  They left 
Lynchburg on Wednesday, the 8<sup>th</sup>, and were going to Danville.  
Our wagons could not get further from Staunton than Midway.  I found 
Mr. Heiskell at home, and we have been attending to business.</p><p class="p10"><u>Wednesday night</u>.  This evening the 
stage arrived from Harrisonburg and passengers brought a report that a 
Yankee force was at Woodstock.  The report occasioned some anxiety 
which was allayed however, by the arrival of some scouts from 
Harrisonburg, who stated that we had scouts below that place who had 
given no information and the rumor could be traced to no source.  Capt. Baylor with a company is here, acting as 
Provost Marshal.  Eight or ten men passed, by Davis Bell's this evening 
going towards the McAdamized road, and a party was sent out to 
intercept them and ascertain who they were.  Mr. Stuart says the number 
of our men captured at Waynesboro did not exceed 500 or 600.  While the 
Yankees were here little Lelia was so wrought up that she exclaimed "I 
feel like cursing!"  The Yankees did not return to Staunton with their 
prisoners till Saturday (not Friday, as stated heretofore), and 
remained several hours only.  Their officers notified the people that 
they might contribute food for the prisoners, and nearly the whole 
people, especially the females, turned out with their baskets.  One 
Yankee is said to have remarked that he had no idea there were so many 
women in Staunton.  An officer affected great contempt at the meagre supply of food offered  &#8212;  it was a mean 
lunch, he said; he expected something more liberal, and they would 
obtain supplies.  The prisoners were halted on the Railroad near the 
Lunatic Asylum, and the citizens were not permitted to communicate with 
nor approach them.  They were then marched through town, and the guard 
allowed them to speak to their friends and receive supplies.  The 
Asylums were robbed of flour and bacon on Saturday.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, March 16, 1865.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We hear nothing more about the enemy coming up the Valley.  &#8212;  A 
man just from Martinsburg reports that the Yankees in that region are 
greatly discouraged.  Wherefore?  Persons from Richmond say that Gen. Lee has announced a signal victory of 
Hampton over the enemy's cavalry commanded by Kitpatrick, in North or 
South Carolina.  No intelligence of Sheridan.  I hauled several loads 
of manure this afternoon for my garden.  Weather mild and rainy  &#8212;  
Grass begins to come out and the fields look green.  Seven or eight 
ladies of Winchester, exiled by order of Sheridan, have arrived in 
Staunton, and are entertained by several citizens.  They were sent out 
before Sheridan started on his expedition up the Valley, and arrived 
here on Monday night last.  Yankees occupied the lower rooms of their 
houses, and the locks were taken off their chamber doors.  At any hour 
of the day or night they were liable to the intrusion of soldiers, and 
they could not write a note without having a guard to look over their 
shoulders.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, March 17.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This morning I got a Government wagon and went after wood.  I sent a 
load home, and waited till the team returned when we loaded up the 
wagons again for Mrs. Smith.  I dined at Legh's.  Kitty followed us to 
the woods, bare-footed.  The day was bright sun shiney, and would have 
been delightful but for the high wind.  I came home feeling excessively 
fatigued.  Uncle Lyttelton, Aunt Sally, 
and Miss Sarah Warden had taken dinner at our house.  There is a report 
to-day that a French Minister is in Richmond.  
President Davis requested Congress not to adjourn, as he had an 
important communication to make to them.  Sheridan, at last report, was 
in Goochland county.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, March 18.\</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The first report of to-day was that Early 
had been captured between Richmond and Gordonsville at which no tears 
were shed.  This evening came a rumor that fifteen hundred of 
Sheridan's raiders had been captured.  No more of the French Minister.  
As we have no sexton several of us <sup>attend to the church</sup> 
<i>[deleted: take it]</i> a week about.  After dinner to-
day, Va., Nanny, Matty and I went 
down + swept out the house.  Feel very tired.  We have still no mails 
from Richmond  &#8212;  only reports and occasionally a paper brought in 
different ways.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, March 20.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The reports of to-day contradicted all the 
pleasant rumors of last week, and left us nothing to hang a hope upon.  
Instead of President Davis having any-thing to communicate to Congress 
in regard to French intervention, he merely wished to ask for more men 
and money.  Sherman has not been defeated nor even checked; but was at 
Fayettesville, while Johnston was at 
Hillsboro.  Sheridan has joined Grant, after devastating the country 
and destroying the Canal and Railroads.  Candler and others captured 
last Summer in Nelson got home yesterday from Camp Chase.  They say 
that many of our men in Northern prisons refused to be exchanged and 
that Lincoln has large bodies of troops at different points.  It is now 
said that Early was not captured.  Still no mail from Richmond.  Many 
persons are gardening a little, farmers generally plowing, but in town 
there is little business or work going on.  All day knots of men stand 
or sit at the street corners, engaged in idle talk.  The town looks 
like a pestilence had swept over it, leaving the people who survive, 
deprived of energy and spirits.  A general feeling of depression 
<i>[deleted: to-day]</i>.  It is reported that negro 
women determined to go off with the Yankees threw their young children 
in the James River Canal.  We planted onions to-
day thinking all the time that the Yankees would probably get 
the benefit of them.  I have been <u>out of 
sorts</u> since my return.  Have a feeling of uneasiness almost 
constantly.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, March 21.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A violent thunder storm on hand  &#8212;  the wind has been blowing 
furiously  &#8212;  now comparatively calm  &#8212;  Lightning vivid and thunder 
shakes the window glass.  eleven o'clock.  The very last report is that 
fifteen hundred of Sheridan's raiders have been captured near Richmond  
&#8212;  probably the old report revised.  J. M. M<sup>c</sup>Cue arrived 
this morning from Richmond, <u>via</u> Lynchburg 
and Lexington.  He says Bragg was falling back before  &#8212;  (I forget 
whom) <sup>Scofield</sup> and Johnston 
before Sherman, towards Raleigh.  Much anxiety felt about affairs in 
North Carolina.  Ose Kyle has at last got back from his long 
imprisonment.  He started from Richmond to go home, two weeks ago.  I 
got a horse and cart this morning to haul manure from Legh's stable.  
Wright was busy preparing ground for potatoes, and I loaded the cart + 
at first drove the horse myself, which attracted much notice in the 
streets.  Not liking the business, I hired a boy to drive for me.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, March 23.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Gen. Lee reported to the Secretary of 
War on the 20<sup>th</sup> that Gen. 
Johnston had the day before, attacked Sherman at Bentonville, N. C., at 5 o'clock P.M. and driven him a 
mile.  Sherman was then reinforced, but Johnston continued the assault.  
At 6 o'clock both armies rested.  The battle is supposed to have begun 
at 5 A.M. as an hour is short time for to much 
to have occurred in.  A. J. Gilkeson returned Tuesday, having left our 
boxes in Danville.  Smith got back last night.  I was quite sick  &#8212;

<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, March 24.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Another report this morning about a Yankee force at Winchester, 
hopefully coming this way.  A Lynchburg paper of the 22<sup>nd</sup> 
had been received, which stated, as rumor, that Gen. Johnston revived the attack on Sherman on 
the 20<sup>th</sup> and defeated him, and was still pursuing and 
fighting him on the 21<sup>st</sup>.  It states that we had taken 2700 
prisoners.  It is now said that 650 of Sheridan's raiders were captured 
and taken into Richmond.  Many of them must have been captured as they 
passed through the Country.  Four were caught at one house in Nelson 
county, where they ventured to put up for the night.  I called at Mr. 
Campbell's to-day.  Like every other family, 
they had their narrative of adventures with the Yankees.  Mrs. C. acknowledges that she had told them a 
falsehood.  <i>[deleted: when]</i>  They demanded butter, and she brought out 
less than a pound, telling them, in reply to a question, that it was 
all she had, although it was not.  She said she was greatly alarmed, 
and hardly knew what she answered.  The question <i>[deleted: how]</i> whether 
the truth should always be spoken to the enemy under such 
circumstances, is much discussed in the community.  The miserable 
creatures were prowling about our house all day Thursday, the 
2<sup>nd</sup> inst., riding into the 
yard, and acting as though the premises belonged to them.  They 
plundered Wright of his clothing, and as fast as Selena cooked food for 
dinner they took it off.  The family had nothing to eat during the day 
except some potatoes which Wright managed to smuggle into the house, 
and which were roasted in the dining room.  None of the Yankees entered 
the house.  Several of them came upon the back porch at one time, and 
ordered the storeroom door to be opened.  Va refused to open it till she found they were 
about to break the door.  Then they took butter +c found there.  They 
next demanded flour in a pillow case.  Va 
refused to furnish the pillow case and they declared their intention to 
enter the house and help themselves.  Kate stood against the house 
door, on the outside, and they threatened to pull her away and come in, 
their looks and gestures being in the mean while most insolent.  Jinny 
brought the controversy to a close by a raking up from the dust an old 
bag made of bed ticking, into which Va 
put some flour.  When the people waked up Thursday morning, they found 
the town full of Yankees.  By night they had all passed through, and 
none returned till Saturday.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, March 25.  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The first thing I heard this morning was that the Yankees were in 
Harrisonburg.  The report did not move me, as I did not believe it, and 
it proved untrue.  Reported this afternoon that Johnston had driven 
Sherman seven miles and captured 4500 of his men.  Rumored also that 
Gen. Early will be in Staunton a few days 
hence with a considerable force.  Much regret expressed at his coming.  
Yesterday and to-day Wright planted 
potatoes.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, March 28.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yesterday the rumors of Johnston's operations against Sherman 
continued to be favorable.  It was said also that Gen. Lee had attacked Grant's left wing, and 
driven him from his position, capturing 500 men.  This attack was made, 
said the rumor, to prevent reinforcements going to Sherman.  Some one 
in Richmond telegraphed these reports to a person in Waynesboro, as 
reports current in the former.  (No telegraph battery at Staunton yet.)  
This morning, upon going down street, I was told, as a Richmond rumor, 
that Johnston had captured 18,000 men and seventy-five pieces of 
cannon.  I went after a load of wood, taking two mules and a wagon 
belonging to the Tax-in-Kind Dept. and 
on my return heard another <i>[deleted: report]</i> <sup>version</sup> that 
Johnston had captured 8000 <i>[illeg.]</i><a href="#n86">86</a></p><p class="p10">I felt discouraged <i>[deleted: and]</i> as it was not likely we would find 
either the men or horses, or that the latter would be given up.  Having 
started, however, we went up.  Some time after dark, we arrived at 
Lange's, 18 miles from Staunton, where we got lodgings, eating our 
provisions.  We started early next morning.  Left one bag of corn at 
Rhyan's, for feeding when we returned.  Nothing of interest occurred 
till we approached M<sup>c</sup>Dowell.  After crossing the bridge over 
the Bull Pasture, we met John Alexander (not Jno. M<sup>c</sup>D. A. of Rockbridge) and two other 
men, who told us the horses were at Pullings'  &#8212;  that two men 
supposed to be deserters came along on them, and were pursued by a man 
named Shafer and another named Gladwell  &#8212;  that the thieves, or 
deserters, escaped after their capture, but the horses were secured  &#8212;  
that we were just in time, as Shafer was about to start to the army 
with the more valuable of the horses, a fine stud.  He (John) agreed to 
go with us to Pullings', and went to get his dinner and a horse.  Legh 
and I went on to Robert Sittington's, a mile blow  M<sup>c</sup>Dowell, to borrow another horse, 
and wait till John A. arrived.  The 
road to Pullings' was impassable for a buggy.  Mr. Sittington had not 
returned from preaching, but Mrs. S. 
gave us a most hospitable and Kind reception.  Legh saddled his horse 
and went on with J. A. while I 
followed on a little stud colt, and lady's saddle.  It soon began to 
rain, and by the time we reached Pullings' I was quite wet.  We found 
there several of Jackson's cavalry, but neither Shafer nor Gladwell.  
The stolen mare had been taken by the latter, and was at pasture five 
miles off, while Shafer had traded the horse to Andrew 
M<sup>c</sup>Clintic, who lived near <i>[illeg.]</i><a href="#n87">87</a>  The horses and equipments, moreover, were 
utterly unsuitable for such a trip.  So we returned to Mr. Sittington's 
intending to start early next morning, calling at <i>[deleted: at]</i> a Mr. 
Stuart's and leaving word for Gladwell to bring up the mare.  Between 
Sittington's and Pullings', three miles, we crossed the Bull Pasture 
run four times.  Mr. S. was at home 
when we got back, and advised Legh to see M<sup>c</sup>Clintic as soon 
as possible, as he was not likely to Keep the horse more than a day or 
two, so it was arranged that Legh should go back forthwith and spend 
the night at Wm. M<sup>c</sup>Clung's, which was on the way to 
Williamsville, which he could thus reach early Monday morning, while I 
remained at Sittington's to go to Wilson's, on Cow Pasture, the next 
day, it being understood that Byrd's company were to meet at that place 
and set out for the army.  <i>[deleted: Legh was off in a]</i> to one of whom, 
it was thought possible, M<sup>c</sup>Clintic might trade the horse.  
Legh was off in a few minutes, and I made myself comfortable by the 
fire.  The mountain upon which the battle of M<sup>c</sup>Dowell was 
fought, was in view of the house, and Mr and Mrs. S. had a great deal 
to tell about the fight.  The next morning, Mr. S. furnished me a horse, bridle and saddle, 
and I came over to Wilson's, a heavy rain falling during part of the 
way.  I knew Wilson, and met several persons at his house, among them a 
man named Chew, who formerly subscribed to the Spectator, and Knew me 
as editor.  They <i>[deleted: did]</i> had heard that Marshall's, on Shaw's 
Fork, was the place appointed for the meeting, and advised me to go 
there.  Accordingly, after waiting an hour or two, I rode on.  I left 
my horse at Reynolds and walked up to Marshall's.  There I met the 
Rev. Mr. Price and others, all of whom 
told me that Williamsville was the rendezvous.  As Legh had gone there, 
I felt that the matter was working well.  Two soldiers from Gen. Lee's army had passed along, spreading 
reports of great disaster, and while I was at Marshall's two more, who 
had left the army on Thursday, the 6<sup>th</sup>, passed by.  They did 
not tell of so much disaster but there was reason to fear the worst.  I 
returned to Sittington's, and upon approaching the house was surprised 
to see Legh coming to meet me.  From his quick return and apparent down 
cast look, I inferred we had been unsuccessful.  He informed me, 
however, that he reached M<sup>c</sup>Clintic's just as he was riding 
off on the horse, the animal was given up without opposition, and Legh 
had him then at Sittington's.  In the evening, Shafer brought up the 
mare, and Legh gave him $600, Confederate currency, for his trouble in 
capturing the horses.  They had been pursued for about 20 miles.  At 
dark Mr. Jos. Mann, of Augusta, 
arrived having brought our young cattle and colts to graze.  While we 
sat before the fire after night there was much talk about the 
lawlessness and robberies in Highland, of late.  Neither property nor 
life was safe.  Many citizens had been killed during the war, and horse 
stealing and robbery were frequent occurrences.  On Tuesday morning, 
the 11<sup>th</sup>, Mr. Mann accompanied us a part of the way on our 
return.  Legh having brought a saddle and bridle, rode his horse.  It 
rained a good deal during the day.  We repeatedly met soldiers, 
generally three together, but none of them had any news.  I inferred 
much that was bad from encountering so many fugitives.  On this side of 
North Mountain, I met one soldier walking who informed me it was 
reported in Staunton that Gen. Lee had 
surrendered his whole army, while another report stated that Longstreet 
only had surrendered his corps.  We next encountered a number of the 
signal corps, who said that Lee had surrendered, according to 
information received in Staunton.  I heard the same report, with some 
variations, at Westview.  Legh turned off the turnpike to go home, and 
I came to town in the buggy.  Night overtook me, and was so dark that I 
could not see to drive.  My mind was in a state of confusion, and I 
finally got home in poor plight, as I have stated.  To-day, the town is full of stragglers from the 
army.  Lynchburg is in the hands of Federal troops, from Grant's army, 
and it is undoubtedly true that rumor of Gen. Lee's army have been captured, scattered or 
killed.  It is still doubtful whether Lee is a prisoner, or effected 
his escape to Johnston.  The latter can make no effective opposition.  
There have been many wild rumors  &#8212;  one that Kirby Smith crossed the 
Mississippi with 50,000 Southern troops  &#8212;  another to-day that the French had taken New Orleans.  Our 
people generally are remarkably quiet, awaiting the will of the 
conqueror.  Every body feels that the "Confederate States" is a thing 
of the past.</p><p class="p10"><u>Later</u>.  Va has come in says that only Longstreet with 
8000 men surrendered  &#8212;  that the men fought with desperation, and 
finally sank down from exhaustion  &#8212;  that France has recognized the 
"Confederacy"  &#8212;  too late  &#8212;  too late if true.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We heard last night from an authentic source that Gen. Lee has certainly surrendered himself with 
his army.  His address to his men states that the surrender was made in 
consequence of the immense superiority of force against him and the 
consequent uselessness of shedding more blood.  He returned to 
Richmond, having been paroled with all of his officers and men.  We do 
not know of the fate of President Davis.  &#8212;  When last heard of he was 
between Burksville Junction and Lynchburg.  Soldiers from the army have 
continued to arrive only one who was paroled.  A call has been made by 
Gen. Lilly for soldiers to meet at 
Lexington and Staunton to proceed South.  I presume that very few will 
respond as the cause is generally considered useless.  Arthur Spitzer 
has got back  &#8212;  He marched three days and two nights, on the retreat 
from Petersburg, with nothing to eat but a can of corn.  &#8212;  Says he 
saw men on the road side dying from hunger.  We hear that no one in the 
Rockbridge Artillery was killed and hope that Jimmy Tate will get home 
soon.  Reported that James H. Waddell was slighting wounded and taken 
to Richmond or Lynchburg.  Reported yesterday that Mosby had been in 
Richmond and held the place for several hours driving the Federal 
soldiers out.  O'Farrel is still operating in the lower Valley.  The 
Yankees sent him word he was violating the parole given by Gen. Lee, and he (O'F) has sent him to ascertain the terms of 
Lee's surrender  &#8212;  whether the whole army of Northern Va was included.  Capt. Smith returned home yesterday from 
Lexington, to my great surprise, as I had heard he was going to North 
Carolina to fall in with Gen. Johnston.  
Grant is supposed to be pressing after Johnston, and there is no 
probability of his withstanding.  For several days past the people of 
this town and county have been appropriating all the public property 
they could find  &#8212;  wagons, old iron picks, +c +c  &#8212;  distributing 
the assets of the Confederate States.  What a termination!  I am 
surprised by the general composure  &#8212;  even very complacency.  But 
while I felt an intense indignation against the North, the Confederacy 
never enlisted my affections or compliance.  I never ceased to deplore 
the disruption, and never could have loved my country and government as 
I loved the old United States.  Yet our cause seemed to be the cause of 
state rights and involved the question whether or no the people should 
choose a government for themselves, or have one imposed upon them.  
With our fall every vestige of State rights has disappeared, and we are 
at the mercy of a consolidated despotism.  What the conqueror will do 
with us we know not.  Pierpont, the "Governor of Virginia," recognized 
by the Washington authorities, who was elected by a few votes in 
Alexandria, Norfolk, +c, has been in Richmond, and, it is said, passed 
a Proclamation advising the people to remain at home, and assuring them 
that they would not be disturbed.  Another State called West Virginia 
is presided over by Governor Boreman.  Nothing remains for us but 
submission, notwithstanding my strong local attachments, I feel that it 
would be a relief to get to some new and foreign country.  Here 
everything is associated with the visions we have 
experienced during the last four years.  I do not know what has become 
of John Hendren, the C. S. 
Treasurer.  He left Richmond in charge of a large amount of specie.  I 
am thankful that I did not go to Richmond with him.  There is much 
religious interest in our Church.  Meetings every afternoon for more 
than a week.  Aunt Sally is very ill not expected to live long.  It is 
sad to see our kindred passing away, although I hope it will be a happy 
release to her.  Kate was married last night.  Arthur Spitzer has 
called to ask my advice as to what he should do; some persons insisting 
that soldiers should, if possible, join Gen. Johnston.  I told him that under the same 
circumstances, I would go home and stay there, and he determined to do 
so.  The weather is delightful.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Jimmy Tate has arrived.  He was present at the surrender and was 
paroled with others.  This morning, I removed an ambulance from a late 
Government stable but wish now that I had not touched it.  I do not 
like to be mixed up with the scramble for spoils.  The whole affair 
disgusted me.  Aunt Sally is very low.  Her disease is pneumonia.  
Jimmy has a piece of his flag, which the battalion cut up and divided 
amongst themselves.  In the conference between Gen. Lee and Grant in regard to the surrender, 
or after it was accomplished, a Federal officer asked Lee if he had any 
objection to tell the number of men in his army before Richmond.  Lee 
replied that it was about 35,000.  The officer expressed astonishment, 
and Lee called for his rolls which showed the number to be 32,000.  He 
then inquired the number of men in Grant's army and was told that it 
was 125,000  &#8212;  So "it is said."  Jimmy says the Yankees claimed to 
have an army of 200,000 under Grant.  He says they professed to expect 
a war with France and England, and reported that a fight had already 
occurred in the Gulf of Mexico between the U. S. and French squadrons.  Some of them asked our men 
if they would not join them against the French, and the reply was, "No 
we prefer the other side."  Several of our Generals made speeches 
exhorting their men to be ready for another struggle.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Easter Sunday.  &#8212;  Authentic intelligence to-
day that two persons have arrived in Charlottesville from 
Richmond, sent by Lyncoln in search of 
Governor Smith, to write him to return.  Reported that the Governor 
while escaping from Richmond on a mule up the tow-path of the canal, 
was thrown into the canal (or the mule fell in) and escaped by clinging 
to the mule's tail.  Reported that Roper is coming to Staunton to 
collect a force.  A man from the lower Valley reports that a N. Y. paper says France has concluded a treaty,

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Four years ago to-day the two military 
companies started from Staunton to Harper's Ferry, and Virginia 
seceded.  Now the war is virtually over, and we are  &#8212;&#8212;  What shall I 
say?  A few minutes ago it made me inexpressibly sad to see Jimmy's 
canteen hanging up in the passage.  It reminded me of the war, and our 
utter failure.  Coming by the old market house to-
night, I forgot that no sentinel was posted there now, to guard 
ordnance stores, and lowered my voice so that our conversation should 
not be heard.  Rumors to-day of recognition by 
England, France + Spain.  &#8212;  President Davis, it is said, announced in 
Danville that active assistance would be afforded some by foreign 
points.  If so he was guilty of a great blunder in not proclaiming the 
fact sooner.  The army and the people were hopeless of success  &#8212;  
there seemed to be no end to the war  &#8212;  but foreign assistance, 
however slight, or even recognition, would have inspired new life into 
the Confederacy, and every man would have rushed to do what he could.  
The people seem exhausted and hopeless; and therefore the soldiers 
deserted.  Now almost every body looks forward to peace and <u>reunion</u> on any tolerable terms Lincoln may 
offer  &#8212;  To talk about re-union and contemplate it as an event about 
to occur, after all we have suffered, is almost intolerable, 
notwithstanding I never anticipated much good from the Confederacy.  &#8212;  
Echols disbanded his command at Christiansburg.  Johnston must fall 
before long, if his army is not already scattered.  The Va Legislature is invited by Lincoln to meet in 
Richmond and <u>safe conduct</u> has been sent 
to many citizens.  A meeting for consultation at Charlottesville is 
proposed.  Judge Campbell, of Ala., late 
As. Sec of War, C. S., who remained in 
Richmond, published in a slip, an account of an interview he had with 
Lincoln.  The conqueror appears to be quite amiable.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, April 19.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">No rumors to-day of any consequence.  
Yesterday there were many afloat.  One that Lincoln had been 
assassinated in Washington city.  Another that a French fleet was on 
the coast of North Carolina.  A third that a Yankee force was coming up 
the Valley, paroling our soldiers as they were met on the road.  Have 
felt very dull and listless all day  &#8212;  Could not work in the garden, 
+ begin to despair of making a living by bodily labor.  &#8212;  Don't know 
how we are to subsist  &#8212;  I have not a cent of money, and no prospect 
of getting any.  Cant buy anything to eat or to wear.  Confederate 
notes are of course, entirely worthless, so far as relates to 
purchases.  Some persons have been giving as much as $1 specie for $300 
C. S. treasury notes, getting the latter to square off their accounts.  
Much talk about the distribution of public property  &#8212;  persons who 
got none are denouncing those who obtained a share.  Soldiers have been 
taking off horses and cattle.  Tate has been trying to hold the latter 
till he could make some satisfactory or judicious disposition of them.  
Thirty were driven off from a pasture a few evenings ago, but 
recovered.  As a drove was coming down the Lexington road to-day, some soldiers waylaid them and the man 
having them in charge gave up a part by way of compromise.  Last night 
a party of men drove off M. G. Harman's sheep, probably supposing them 
to be Confederate States property.  He raised a posse and made pursuit.  
The party was over taken and captured, (four in number), but three 
miles from town five men sprang out to rescue them.  Shots were fired 
on both sides and a horse killed.  All of the marauders escaped, except 
one, who was brought to jail.  Such is the state of society amongst us 
at present.  We shall be ready soon to entrust the Yankees to come in 
and restore order.  From all accounts I Johnston had a very small force 
before Lee's surrender.  Probably none at all now.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, April 20.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The report of Lincoln's assassination was renewed this evening.  It 
is said that he was shot from the stage of the theatre in Washington, 
by one of the actors, a foreigner.  &#8212;  There is a general regret in 
our community, as Vice President Johnson is a much worse man than 
Lincoln.  &#8212;  Reported to night that Gen. Johnston has defeated Sherman, and that 
Forrest has taken Knoxville.  All very ridiculous, as several weeks ago 
Johnston had but 13,000 infantry, to 9oppose Sherman's large force, and 
it would be marvelous if his men did not drop off as soon as they heard 
of Lee's Surrender.  Roper is expected here to organize his men, and 
then it may be said he has <u>taken</u> 
Staunton.  If his men rally to him, and the horses, in the county will 
be taken off.  I anticipate nothing but evil from his attempt.  With 
our armies captured or scattered and all munitions of war lost, it is 
impossible for us to accomplish anything against the overwhelming odds 
of the North; and a guerrilla warfare will only result in general ruin.  
We are now in a condition of anarchy.  Bands of soldiers are prowling 
about taking off all cattle, sheep, horses +c. they suspect of being 
public property.  I hear that they took from the Tax-in-kind Depot at 
Deerfield all the wool collected there.  The agent at Greenville has 
refused to deliver up several hundred pounds of bacon received by him 
as Tax-in-Kind, because he says, the Government owes him.  We proposed 
turning it over to indigent soldiers' families.  It is reported that 
the people of Harrisonburg sent for the Yankees to quiet a soldiers' 
riot in that place  &#8212;  The people of Lynchburg, it is said, did the 
same.  Don't know whether this is true.  The Yankees went off from 
Lynchburg last Sunday.  About 9 o'clock to-
night we were startled by a report somewhat like the explosion 
of cannon.  The house shook and the windows rattled.  Upon going to the 
door we found persons out inquiring what it could be.  It was more like 
a sudden clap of thunder than any other sound, yet the sky was 
generally clear.  Perhaps some building fell over.  For the last two 
weeks there have been prayer meetings every afternoon, at 4 o'clock, in 
the Section Room of our church.  The room has been filled at every 
meeting.  The Rev. Mr. Gilmer preached 
this afternoon.  I swept out my office this morning and took my table 
back  &#8212;  getting ready to go to work as Commissioner in Chancery, as 
soon as the times permit.  Aunt Sally still very ill.  Jimmy Tate says 
that on the day of the surrender he saw Gen. Lee as he returned from Grant's 
headquarters, and that when his men cheered him as usual the fears 
flowed from his face.  I met to-day; at the 
blacksmith's shop a youth who has been in the army for three years, C. 
L. 5<sup>th</sup> Va Reg., and participated in sixteen battles, 
besides skirmishes.  He said that a Yankee rode up, after the 
surrender, and demanded the flag of the Stonewall Brigade.  He was shot 
down, and the colour sergeant wraped the flag around his body, under his 
clothing, and brought it off.  I am paind to 
learn that the residence of our relation, Mr. John N. Gordon, in 
Richmond, where I have visited so often, was burnt with a large portion 
of the city, upon the <i>[illeg.]</i>.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I hear that a lady arrived this evening from Washington, <u>via</u> Winchester, with papers giving an account 
of Lincoln's assassination.  Seward was assailed and wounded at the 
same time, being in his chamber.  Some mischievous person fired a 
cannon last night at the Market House, which was the report we 
heard.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday, April 22.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Lincoln was certainly killed in the theatre, as reported.  The 
assassin was an actor named Booth, an Englishman.  He and 20 or thirty 
others, associated with him, escaped down the Potomac, on the Maryland 
side.  They routed a party of cavalry, and another party was sent after 
them but at last accounts they had not been captured.  An attempt to 
kill Seward was also made.  Booth was not regarded as a Southern</p><p class="p10">(see page 60)<a href="#n88">88</a></p><p class="p10">sympathizer, having left Richmond early in the war, to go North.  
Rumor says that some persons at the North attribute the murder to the 
"Knights of the Golden Circle"; while others attribute it to the ultra 
Abolitionists who are disaffected on account of Lincoln's supposed 
leniency to the South.  Vice President Andrew Johnson has sworn in as 
President of the United States, and has made several speeches in which 
he announced a vengeance against "traitors."  He has withdrawn the 
invitation or permission for our Legislature to meet at Richmond.  It 
is reported this morning that several persons in town have sent a 
recent message inviting the Yankees to occupy Staunton and restore law 
and order.  Bands of soldiers are still traversing the county demanding 
public property, and running off cattle and horses.  In several 
instances they have taken off private property, but I presume it was by 
mistake.</p><p class="p10"><u>Night</u>.  &#8212;  Aunt Sally died to-day, about half past one o'clock.  As I was going 
down to her house to-night, I met Blackley, 
who told me it was reported that Gen. 
Elzy, one of our paroled officers, had been assassinated in Baltimore.  
Alick had heard that Gen. Ewell and four 
other Confederate Generals had been hung by a mob in Baltimore.  The 
report is revived also of a battle in the Gulf of Mexico between the 
French and U. S. squadrons, in which 
thirty ships and two iron clads of the latter were sunk.  Reported that 
the Episcopal churches in Richmond have been closed by the Yankee 
authorities, until the clergy will pray for the President of the United 
States.  The invitation for the Virginia Legislature to meet in 
Richmond, is supposed to have been withdrawn by Lincoln, as it is said 
to have been published in a Richmond paper of the 15<sup>th</sup>, and 
Johnson did not become President till that day.  Four armed men went to 
Tate's farm to-day, and drove off 40 
Government cattle.  We have no law; but every man does as he 
pleases.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Aunt Sally's funeral took place yesterday afternoon.  Mr. Baker 
delivered an address in the church, at 3 o'clock, to quite a large 
congregation, after which we proceeded to the house, and conveyed the 
corpse, to the cemetery.  There were five vehicles, besides the horse, 
but many persons walked, as the weather was pleasant.  Aunt S. owed me about $900, principal and interest, 
money paid for building her home, and I see no prospect of getting it 
back. The war has made havoc with her property.</p><p class="p10">Our public affairs looked gloomy to us to-
day.  The Pierpoint government is 
established at Richmond, and we will doubtless be required to recognize 
it as the legitimate authority.  Gen. 
Johnston was at Greensboro, N. C., at 
last accounts, and Mr. Davis also.  They were about surrounded by 
Federal armies; although it was reported that Johnston had 30,000 men 
and abundant supplies.  &#8212;  This report cannot be true, as before the 
evacuation of Richmond Gen. Lee told 
Andrew Hunter that Johnston had only 13,000 infantry, which he said was 
<u>less than had been sent to him from the Army of 
Northern Virginia</u>.  &#8212;  So rapidly were the Confederate armies 
wasting away by desertions.  It is reported that the Federal 
authorities in Richmond are requiring citizens to take a stringent oath 
of allegiance.  The county court was busy to-
day, trying to devise means for preserving law and order in the 
community.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, April 25.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Rumors of momentous events came in rounds to-
day.  First we heard that Gen. 
Johnston had surrendered.  Next that a Federal force of 1200 was coming 
from Beverly to establish a garrison at Staunton.  Then a gentleman 
arriving from Charlottesville with a report that Andrew Johnson, 
Lincoln's successor, had been killed, and that Washington, Philadelphia 
and New York were in flames.  Finally, it was reported by some one who 
came up the Valley, that Grant had been killed, that fighting was going 
on in Washington city, and that all the troops had been removed from 
Winchester.  We know not what to think of all this.  It is not more 
strange than the intelligence of Lincoln's death, which we did not 
believe, but can it be that society is broken up, and the whole country 
in a state of chaos! that assassination, heretofore unknown amongst us, 
has become a common event!  I cannot think so.  The man who killed 
Lincoln must have been a lunatic, and surely a similar act has not be 
perpetrated since.  There has been no confirmation of the report that a 
mob in Baltimore hung Gen. Ewell and 
others.  We have no mails, no newspapers, and no regular communication 
with the world.  Occasionally some one arrives with a Baltimore or 
Richmond paper.  The Richmond Whig is issued by new hands as a Union 
paper.</p><p class="p10">"The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed; a <u>refuge in times of trouble</u>."  Trouble, 
suspense, anxiety, a time when we have no government, and know not what 
will be on the morrow.  Our neighbor, Mrs. Points, died last night.  
The lights we have seen at her house since dark, make it look more 
cheerful than it ever did before.  Poor woman!  She had much

the afternoon.  It was then rumored on the streets that Andrew Johnson 
had not been poisoned, as previously reported, <u>but was under arrest as an accomplice in the 
assassination of Lincoln</u>!  Some body had arrived up the Valley 
(I forget whom), who said that Col. Mosby, 
had been to see the Federal General Hancock, and told him he had read 
this statement in a Baltimore paper.  Nothing further about rioting in 
Washington and other cities, nor in regard to the removal of troops 
from Winchester.  On the contrary, there was a report that a Federal 
force was coming up the Valley.  Another report this evening that the 
French have taken New Orleans.  <i>[illeg.]</i> has arrived in town, to 
collect men to go South.  This movement will only lead to the advance 
of a Federal force to Staunton  &#8212;  it can do no good, + and is

first time I have seen a force of armed Yankees.  Just as we finished 
the appraisement of Aunt Sally's property, it was announced that they 
were coming near town.  As I came home to dinner I observed men in 
pairs upon several of the hills, and presumed they were scouts.  While 
we were at dinner, Jenny came in and said "The Yankees are coming."  We 
all went on the front porch, and I finally went to Moses' shop; and saw 
the whole force pass.  There were six companies of the 22<sup>nd</sup> 
N. Y. cavalry, decidedly mean looking men  
&#8212;  generally.  Gen. Roper left town this 
morning, and there was, of course, no opposition.  Two negroes, who ran 
off with the Yankees formerly, returned with this party &#8212;  one a son 
of Moses, and the other a boy who was with us in the Tax-in-Kind 
Department.  The former said the Regiment would remain here four days  
&#8212;  I have no other information in regard to their movements.  Northern 
papers contain an account of Gen. 
Johnston's surrender, and the terms which seem to embrace a settlement 
of the whole matter.  But Andrew Johnson, Pres. after Lincoln, disapproved of the terms, 
it is said.</p><p class="p10"><u>Night</u>.  &#8212;  It was a curious spectacle 
this afternoon to see Federals and Confederates mingling on the 
streets.  Every body seemed to be at ease.  The Yankee force is 
composed of two regiments, both making 400 or 500 men.  A Col Reid 
commands.  He is said to be very affable.  I have not spoken to one of 
them.  How can we ever get along with a people who have waged such 
warfare against us, <u>and at last conquered 
us</u>!  I felt greatly cast down this afternoon.  The Federals are 
camped near the Cemetery, but on the opposite side of the turnpike.  We 
could see some of their camp fires to-night.  
Jimmy Tate says the men are not allowed to cut down trees, but are made 
to divide up for branches here + there.  Col. Reid says he will remain on, for possibly 
two days.  His object appears to be to afford an opportunity to our men 
to be paroled.  Jesse scouts were in town considerably in advance of 
the main body.  Alick met four of them as he was going to visit a 
patient in the country.  They were dressed like Confederate soldiers.  
When he met the first two, one of the said</p><p class="p10">see page 69</p><p class="p10">"The Yankees are coming."  Alick replied, "Well, they are not 
hurting anybody, I suppose."  "Oh no," said the man.  The next two 
asked him what was going on in town, and he said there was nothing!  
One of them then inquired if he intended to return soon, and he 
replied, Yes, he was only going to visit a patient.  The man repeated 
the answer to his comrade, and they rode on.  The town patrol is out 
to-night as usual.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, April 30.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The day passed off quietly.  Many Yankees were riding and walking 
about, unarmed.  Four officers and two other soldiers attended the 
Presbyterian Church in the forenoon  &#8212;  none in the evening.  The 
Episcopal Church was not open because Mr. Latene was apprehensive of 
trouble if we omitted to pray for the President of the United States 
<sup>as prescribed in the ritual</sup>.  Surely these are pleasant 
times, when churches are required by military authority to pray for 
certain officials.  The Yankees say they were fired upon as they came 
up the Valley and several of their men Killed or wounded.  The office 
for paroling our soldiers was crowded all day.  Our town patrol 
arrested a drunken Yankee soldier last night, and put him in jail.  It 
is understood that the report of Andrew Johnson's arrest is untrue.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>May 1865 </b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, May 1.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I went down street early this morning, and found the Yankees moving 
about quite freely.  Negroes were flocking to the camp.  Some of them 
having come from home on horseback.  A negro woman belonging to Mrs. 
Sidney Crawford had gone off with her children.  Some five or six  &#8212;  
Uncle Lyttelton's Eliza was there too, 
dancing, it was said, for the entertainment of her Yankee friends.  &#8212;  
Legh came in and said all of his negro boys (3) had left home.  The 
Yankees gave up stolen horses to their owners, when called for.  Jimmy 
Tate went out to recover a horse of his father's which a negro of F. 
Bell's had ridden in, and was treated with great politeness.  The horse 
was delivered to him promptly, and he was asked if he would take the 
negro too.  The latter is a fellow of bad character, and his owner is 
glad to get rid of him.  The Yankees seem to be afraid of guerillas, and invited Jimmy to take part 
against them, which he declined.  The officers have told everybody that 
they did not wish the negroes to go with them, and would furnish to 
them neither transportation nor rations; but they were not at liberty 
to send them home.  This afternoon, however, they began a system of 
treatment which must have been discouraging to "American citizens of 
African descent" (Lincoln).  A number of tents had been taken from the 
Military Hospital to the Yankee camp, and some of them were spread upon 
the ground and used as blankets for tossing up the colored friends.  
Men, women and children were thrown up into the air, at the risk of 
breaking skulls or breaking necks.  Eliza was tossed up several times, 
and finally fell on her head.  At last accounts she was lying 
insensible.  &#8212;  I felt indignant to-day to 
see the Yankees moving about on horseback and on foot with so much 
assurance, although they were perfectly polite.  It was provoking, 
ludicrous, and pitiful, all together, to see the poor negroes crowding 
the streets, some of them, especially the women, dressed in all their 
finery, rejoicing in their freedom.  The poor creatures seem to imagine 
that to be "<u>free</u>" cures all the ills of 
life, and many of them leave kind masters and good homes to suffer and 
die among people who have no sympathy for them, and only wish to <u>spite</u> us.  "Freedom" to them means respite from 
toil, care and trouble.  About dark large numbers returned to town from 
the Yankee camp.  I could not learn whether they had become disgusted 
with their treatment, or were merely returning home to prepare for the 
march down the Valley.  The Yankees start back to-
morrow, it is said.  Everybody who owns a horse has him under 
guard to-night, to prevent a negro from 
riding him off.  I wrote to Janetta Alexander to-
day, and asked Mrs. Hirsh to send it by one of her Yankee 
friends.  She has no delicacy about ingratiating herself with them, and 
uses her influence for the protection of her friends as well as 
herself.  The town patrol had some trouble last night with several 
squads of Yankee soldiers.  This evening a Confederate and Yankee had a 
fist fight in the street  &#8212;  The former got the better of his 
opponent, but both were lodged in jail.  I think it likely the Yankees 
are disappointed at the inhospitality of Staunton.  They are obtuse 
enough to expect our people to open their houses to them.  Gen. Jackson ("Mudwall," as the Yankees call 
him, in contradistinction to "Stonewall") is said to be in the county 
with fifteen men.</p><p class="p10">James Calhoun arrived to-night from 
Richmond, having walked all the way.  He went as far as Petersburg, but 
could hear nothing of his son Tom, who was wounded in the battle of 
March 17<sup>th</sup>.  He says the Yankees permitted him to pass 
everywhere unmolested.  They talk about a war with the French, and say 
their negro troops are to be put in the front ranks.  It was generally 
regarded as a fixed fact that France was in for a difficulty with the 
U.S.  Many of our people thought our difficulties with the Yankees were 
not over yet.  He says Mosby is in Albemarle with his men.  It will be 
a crime against humanity for him to prosecute hostilities under 
existing circumstances.  Ex-President Davis was reported to be making 
for the Mississippi with all the gold, and an escort of two thousand 
cavalry.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday, May 2.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Jenny aroused me this morning with the announcement that the Yankees 
were passing out of town, and I hurried up to see the negro exodus.  
There were negroes of all ages, and some who, I thought, had too much 
family pride or attachment to go off with the Yankees.  A. A. H. 
Stuart's Peyton was among them, who was identified with the family, and 
was really as free as his master, and who leaves a comfortable home and 
the kindest treatment for the uncertainties of freedom among Northern 
<u>friends</u>  &#8212;  freedom to starve and die, 
but hardly freedom to labor.  Poor wretches, they seem possessed with 
mania.  Legh's Jim went off.  &#8212;  I have not heard of the other boys.  
Since his marriage, Legh has been impoverished by having to maintain a 
troop of young negroes, and now the one most able to labor goes off, 
leaving his younger sisters to be maintained by others.  One woman left 
her infant child in the street.  This will perhaps be quoted by our 
Yankee masters, as proof of the slave's longing for freedom.  Many of 
the Yankees denounced the negroes for going off with them.  At 
different points while passing through town, they urged them to 
reconsider the matter and return, telling them they would starve  &#8212;  
that there was no work for them at the North +c.  Sometimes they 
indulged in oaths and curses.  When they got out of town, however, the 
women and children were helped into their wagons.  The negroes say the 
Yankees talk one way to them, and another way to the white folks.  The 
officers profess to be opposed to taking the</p><p class="p10">see page 80</p><p class="p10">negroes, but say it is the policy of their Government to take them, 
and they cannot <u>drive</u> them home.  
Miserable creatures!  miserable Government!  The former are lending 
themselves to a worthless cruelty.  They must know that the poor 
negroes are rushing to destruction.  Eliza went off with her Yankee 
<u>lovers</u>.  &#8212;  The Yankee Government is 
encouraging the most debasing <u>prostitution</u>.  One old negro man started with 
the Yankees, but soon returned, saying it was too far!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, May 3.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I rode up to Legh's this morning to help him to plant corn, but 
found he did not need me.  Jim had left with the Yankees, but none of 
the other servants.  Soon after dinner, I returned home.  Several 
negroes who went off yesterday, have come back, and they say many 
others are returning.  By some sort of Federal military power, the 
State of Virginia has been divided along the Blue Ridge into East + 
West Va. which are called "insurgent 
territories."  We are under the jurisdiction of "Governor Boorman."  I do not know how they are to 
manage us  &#8212;  With a rod of iron, doubtless.  It is intolerable  &#8212;  I 
feel ready to burst.  It is said that Booth, the assassin of Lincoln, 
has been shot.  Yankee officers have no doubt provided transportation 
for all the negro wenches they took from here yesterday.  Wm. Garber says his yard was used as a general 
brothel  &#8212;  on Monday night.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, May 4.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Early this morning, I found a movement on foot for a public meeting 
on Monday next.  A. H. Stuart had received a letter from a gentleman in 
Albemarle, urging him to go to Richmond with the others and use their 
influence in favor of a reorganization of the State Government, in 
opposition to the Pierpont and Boreman establishments, or a military 
government.  He preferred to go as the delegate of a meeting of 
citizens.  A call for a meeting to take steps "for the organization of 
the State government," was signed by a number of persons, and printed 
in handbill form.  I signed the call, wishing to leave the Yankee 
authorities no pretext for imposing a different government upon us; but 
at the same time I would be willing to suffer much more if it would 
embarrass them.  The rebellion has been crushed out, however, and we 
can only make the best terms possible  &#8212;  Some of the returned negroes 
say the Yankee soldiers robbed them of money, watches, and all 
valuables.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, May 6.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I was laid up at home sick all day till six o'clock in the evening.  
Feeling better then.  I walked down street.  It was reported during the 
day that a Federal force was coming up the Valley, but not believed 
till the stage arrived, when we learned that the Yankees would be at 
Harrisonburg to-night.  It is said that the 
force consists of infantry, artillery and cavalry.  The object is 
supposed to be to garrison Staunton.  With the exception of farmers our 
people generally are idle with no means of making a living.  I can find 
nothing to do.  I have not physical strength to labor for a support, 
and the war has destroyed at least half of the little wealth I had.  
Oh, to live nearer to God!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, May 7.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This morning we hoped that the report of a Federal force coming was 
untrue, as it was vouched for by no authority; but in the afternoon A. 
D. Trotter arrived from Winchester, and put the matter at rest.  He 
says a brigade of infantry and cavalry are on the way, and will be here 
to-morrow, or next day.  Their wagon train 
is three miles long.  They are said to have thirty days rations.  No 
one can tell the object of the movement.  It is doubtless to let us 
feel the force of Federal power.  William Smith, our fugitive Governor, 
is in town to-night, and has sent round 
notice that he would deliver an address at the American Hotel  &#8212;  
Don't know what he is after.  Reported that Roper has been captured in 
Hanover.  Mr. Baker came to me to-day  &#8212;  
said he understood the Yankees would allow no one to preach unless he 
took the oath of allegiance; that he did not preach for his own 
benefit, and, if conscience should not be involved in it, he would take 
the oath or not, as the congregation might decide for him.  Jacob 
having gone off with the Yankees, I acted as Sexton to-day  &#8212;  Poor fool!  he is nearly blind, and 
cannot support himself.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, May 8.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The County Meeting came off to-day, in 
pursuance of the notice, and was largely attended.  Several persons 
came down from Lexington to see about matters, but did not remain to 
the meeting.  Gov. Smith approved of the 
meeting.  He had previously sent a committee to Washington to inquire 
if overtures would be received from the State authorities.  I 
understand he returned to Lexington this morning.  He goes armed with a 
brace of pistols, and his servant carries a gun or two.  The meeting 
adopted resolutions declaring that the contest is ended, that a State 
Convention should be held, +c. +c.  A committee was appointed to 
proceed to Richmond to ascertain whether the Federal military 
authorities will permit a Convention to be elected and to assemble.  I 
doubt if the military will do anything more than <u>snub</u> our Committee.  The Yankees had passed 
Harrisonburg this morning, and I presume they are near Staunton now.  
The Washington Executive has offered a reward of $100,000 for the 
arrest of President Davis, and $25,000 cash for Geo. Saunders, Beverly 
Tucker, and others, all of whom they charge as being implicated in the 
assassination of Lincoln.  It is reported that the notorious Brownlow 
charges in his paper that President Andrew Johnson was accessory to the 
murder.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, May 9.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The Yankees entered town this morning.  First came three or four 
scouts, next the cavalry  &#8212;  three regiments  &#8212;  and then the 
infantry, three regiments.  Gen. Duval 
commands.  Their principal camp is on the Parkensburg road near town.  
Most of their wagons are in the meadow, near the Gas Works.  Their 
ambulances and a few wagons are in the meadow, blow the stone wall, near the RR Depot.  &#8212;  The Quartermasters and 
Commissaries use the buildings formerly occupied by the confederate 
Officials.  Head Quarters are at the Virginia Hotel.  As the first 
infantry regiment marched in, the band played "Hail Columbia"  &#8212;  
showing that the wretches have not the instincts of gentlemen.  I went 
down street after dinner, and walked round to see what was going on, 
with less feeling than I anticipated.  The private soldiers seem good-
natured enough, but they are a low order of men, much inferior to our 
men, who have always whipped them when not outnumbered more than three 
to one.  The officers are a sp<i>[illeg.]</i>, dapper-looking set.  They 
have about one hundred and fifty (150) wagons, and supplies for 30 
days.  We have not learned what they came for.  Some of them say, we 
are to vote whether we will belong to East or West Virginia.  Roper is 
in town, having been paroled in Richmond.  He was drinking with Yankees 
to-day, and giving them his autograph.  I felt 
sad and humiliated to hear of his walking through the streets drunk 
this evening.  John Hendren arrived this evening.  Tom Calhoun has been 
heard from  &#8212;  He is at City Point, and is doing well.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, May 10.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The Committee appointed by the County meeting on Monday, called upon 
Gen. Duval this morning.  He was extremely 
civil, said the only orders he had were to restore order by suppressing 
guerilla parties, and to parole our 
soldiers.  He had no instructions in regard to civil government.  The 
Yankee gentlemen no doubt think it strange they are not invited to 
partake of our hospitalities.  They have not sensibility enough to 
understand our feelings.  Many of these creatures were in Staunton with 
Hunter last June.  They have infested the streets like the plague of 
Egypt, but are generally well behaved, and, to all appearances, totally 
unconscious of any difference between us and them.  It is reported that 
Col. Reid said he had come to Staunton on 
a peaceful mission, and the only persons who offered him hospitality, 
were a stage driver and the family of a German Jew.  I have been sick, 
sick all day.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, May 12.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">We are tasting the bitterness of a conquered people.  The Yankees 
are evidently trying to worry us, because they are not taken into 
society.  No disrespect is showed to them, but the most cold 
politeness.  They have so little sense and breeding as to expect to be 
treated as friends.  &#8212;  The officers ride and walk about decked off in 
shining coats, and evidently desire to attract the attention of the 
ladies.  Gen. Duval is not satisfied with 
the temper of the people  &#8212;  "they are still defiant."  For this 
reason no doubt, he has resorted to various petty annoyances.  A few 
invitations to dine would probably put matters to right.  Yesterday he 
alleged that several persons had murdered within four miles of Staunton  
&#8212;  "Union people" who had recently come back.  No body else had heard 
of it, and I believe the statement utterly false.  This morning an 
officer with a squad of men was going round notifying merchants that 
they must take the oath of allegiance or shut up shop.  It is said 
there is to be a general search for public property.  Some search has 
already been made.  We all expect to take the oath sooner or later, as 
there seems to be no alternative.  A few persons have taken it.  I 
understand that the Provost Marshall is giving slaves certificates that 
they are free and at liberty to make contracts with their "late owners" 
or others for employment.  I see nothing before the poor negroes, but 
distress and ruin.  Many of them, deluded with the idea of freedom, 
will give up comfortable homes and go out to suffer and die.  Our 
servants have so far been faithful and contented.  Yesterday and to-day the private soldiers have not been in town so 
much as before, but were Kept in camp.  Mary Stuart and several other 
girls were here to-night, and Mr. Stuart 
came up a little before ten o'clock to say it was time to go home, as 
no one is allowed to be on the street after that hour.  Jimmy Tate 
started to walk home with Agnes Atkinson, and one of the sentinels on 
the street warned them to <u>hurry up</u>, as it 
was nearly ten.  At the urgent request of Mr. S. and the girls he returned immediately.  It is 
hard to hear this.  This morning a Yankee soldier was found dead near 
town, but strange to say the "rebels" are not charged with killing him.  
Yesterday a body of four of five hundred cavalry came in from 
Charlottesville, to open an office for parolling, not knowing that any troops were here.  
They returned this morning.  We hear that the Yankees at Winchester 
have the negro men who lately went off from this place, working on the 
streets, guarded by soldiers, and that the women are begging from door 
to door.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, May 14.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The greater part of the day passed off quietly and without anything 
disagreeable occurring.  This morning, I gave Philip, Selena's husband, 
a long talk about the condition of the negroes, that he might repeat it 
to Selena and Jenny.  Contrary to expectation there was not a Yankee at 
Church, either at morning or afternoon preaching.  In the afternoon a 
Yankee Chaplain preached to the negroes in the Methodist Church, 
proclaiming to them that they were free, but taking good care to advise 
them to remain where they are.  With all their pretended love for the 
negroes, they do not want them amongst themselves.  It is inhuman and 
infamous to make such proclamations to a set of creatures who are like 
children in some respects, and barbarians in others.  As well throw 
around firebrands among tinder.  The whole social fabrick will be destroyed, and the negroes be the 
chief sufferers.  That a great change has taken place and will 
ultimately be consummated in the institutions of slavery; no one 
doubts; but laws must be enacted to regulate the new state of affairs, 
and the negroes, in the mean while, kept under some control, or 
universal ruin will result.  This, however, is probably what the Yankee 
nation desires to accomplish  &#8212;  destroy us and the negroes together.  
&#8212;  <i>[deleted: I never liked slavery, as these pages attest, and would gladly 
have given it up at any moment, if I had seen any humane mode of 
providing for the negro population.  May God, in his mercy, order for 
us.  &#8212;  All we can do is look to him.]</i>  Having occasion to go 
down street late this evening, the throngs of blue coats everywhere, 
depressed my spirits no little.  We are a conquered people, in the 
hands of a powerful and imbittered 
majority, who have never exhibited a spark of magnanimity towards us.  
I heard on the street that President Johnson had issued a proclamation 
declaring the property of all aiders and abettors of the "rebellion" 
confiscated, (this sweeps nearly all the property in the Southern 
States), declaring all public offices vacant, and setting aside all 
sales made since 1860.  Pierpoint is 
recognized as Governor of Virginia, of course.  Yet all this is not 
very different from my anticipations  &#8212;  See diary during the Winter 
of 1860 + 61.  Many servants have left their homes, to set up as free 
people.  Some have behaved very insolently.  Tate starts to Richmond 
to-morrow with the county committee to see 
if anything can be done to settle our affairs.  We hear that a great 
many persons have been arrested on account of Lincoln's assassination.  
The Yankees are managing it as if it were a monkey show.  Everything is 
done for effect.  There is but one man in the whole country who had any 
motive for killing Lincoln.  &#8212;  Certainly the Southern people have 
derived no advantage from his death.  I never regarded him as our 
greatest enemy, and we, above all others, have cause to lament his 
taking off.  (A Yankee chaplain was at Church this morning.  He 
declined an invitation to go forward to a pew, but sat on a cushion, on 
the floor, near the door.  His name is Little, who was about here some 
years ago as a singing master.)</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, May 15.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Not having been at Sister's or Alick's for several days, I went down 
this morning, although I felt like staying where I would not have to 
meet or see the hated Yankee soldiers.  Being down street I found some 
business which took me to the Quartermaster's (Yankee) office, and I 
was brought in contact with a half dozen or more officers and soldiers.  
They behaved so much like other people  &#8212;  all of them polite, and 
most even friendly  &#8212;  that my antipathy was overcome for the time.  
It is difficult to realize that some of these men were here last 
Summer, plundering and insulting our people.  A sentinel has been 
promenading before Trout's house to-day, 
because the Yankees allege that the girls made mouths or hissed at the 
band as they entered town a week ago!  The girls deny the charge, but 
what if they did, could that hurt the United States?  Such petty doings 
are characteristic of the Yankee.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, May 16.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This morning John Hill came in with a horse to take Va and me to Legh's.  I borrowed Alick's buggy.  
We learned at Legh's that Polly, John Hill's wife, had taken it into 
her head to come off to town yesterday and set up as free.  She went 
home, however, at night, and was there to-day, 
attending to her work.  John seemed really troubled about her behaving 
so.  All the negroes who leave their homes went to set up housekeeping 
in town.  John said as he was passing the Yankee pickets on his way 
home this morning, they asked him who has master was.  &#8212;  He replied, 
"Mr. Legh Waddell."  One soldier said, "No you have no master."  "Yes," 
said John, "I have till he gives me a paper stating that I am free."  
"Oh," said one, "You are free," and had better go to the office and get 
free papers."  "Free!" said John, "to do what?  To stand on the streets 
in town and do nothing?"  "Well, old man," the Yankee replied, "I 
believe you are right."  Many persons in town have been making what 
money than can out of the Yankee soldiers.  Adeline thought she would 
try her hand.  She had some pies made and sent Betty, the negro girl to 
sell them.  In due time, Betty returned, greatly elated with her 
success  &#8212;  she had a handful of notes.  Upon examination it turned 
out that the papers for which she had exchanged her pies, were bottle 
labels, advertising cards +c, without a cent of money among them.  
During the day some Yankees, riding by the house, stopped and inquired 
if they had any pies for sale!  It is not impossible that Betty had 
told very freely where she lived.  The affair is so ludicrous that we 
have to laugh at it, but it is hard to be cheated as well as <u>subjugated</u> by the Yankees.  Citizens were 
notified to-day that they must not assemble in 
crowds on the streets.  While in the country, I longed to stay where I 
should not see a blue coat, nor hear the music of Yankee bands.  It's a 
ding-dong and a screech all day.  The County Committee did not go to 
Richmond on Monday, but expect to start to-
morrow.  (Adeline says the pies were Betty's)</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Wright started this morning to take the cow to pasture, but came 
back saying that the pickets would let no one go out of town, as Gen. Duval had been shot at last night.  Jimmy 
Tate went down street after breakfast, but soon returned, the guards 
allowing no one to walk about.  He said Duval was spending the evening 
with Mrs. Hirsh, and <u>they said</u> some one 
fired into the room.  I did not believe a word of it, + feeling 
satisfied that it was either the gun of a Yankee soldier that had gone 
off accidentally, or that the affair was a Yankee trick resorted to as 
a pretext for some arbitrary measure.  I went into the garden to weed 
the onions, and Va came out where I was.  
While we were there Kitty called to say that the guard was searching 
houses in our neighborhood.  Va went in 
the house, and I proceeded with my work.  After a while I looked up, 
and saw a Yankee soldier passing from the kitchen to the house.  Upon 
coming to the house, I found three or four officers and a half dozen 
men searching everywhere for arms.  They were all over the house, but I 
could have secreted a hundred pistols, if I had <i>[deleted: wished]</i> owned 
them, so that they could not have been found.  Jimmy had delivered up 
our only weapon, a little shot gun, more of a toy than anything else, 
which had lain in a closet for years, till it was quite rusty.  Some 
years ago I put a little powder in it, and a cap on it, but it has 
never fired off since it has been in my possession.  Yet this weapon 
too formidable to be left in rebel hands  &#8212;  it might shoot Gen. Duval, or hurt the United States in some 
way  &#8212;  and the soldiers of a mighty nation bore it off triumphantly.  
They were kind enough to label the gun with my name and leave a 
memorandum with us, so that I might recover the property hereafter  &#8212;  
upon what conditions, I did not learn.  I think, however, of presenting 
it to the United States.  I hope it will be taken to Washington city, 
and deposited in the national museum, as a specimen of the murderous 
implements used by rebels for the purposes of assassination.  There is 
not a sparrow in the fields that would not laugh to see it pointed at 
him.  When things had quieted down, Sister and Adeline came up to make 
a visit.  Mr. Stuart and Sister were on their front porch when the gun 
was fired last night, and Mary Stuart was in Capt. Smith's porch.  They all say it was the 
gun of a Yankee soldier in the street.  The subservient Mrs. Hirsh 
shows a little puncture in the wall of her room, where the ball struck!  
No body, however, has seen the ball.  What a flaming report will appear 
in Northern papers of the audacious attempt to slay the distinguished 
Gen. Duval!  What proof the attempt 
affords of the "defiant" spirit of our people!  This spirit must, of 
course, be crushed out, if a garrison has to be maintained here till 
dooms day.  If the object had been to provoke the people to some act of 
indiscretion and violence, a better course could not have been pursued.  
No body contemplated resistance to the authority of the United States, 
and nothing is necessary for the entire pacification of the country but 
the withdrawal of the troops.  As long as they remain in a community, 
there will be collisions and jealousies.  The soldiers couldnot allow the negroes who are contentedly attending to 
their business, to pass them, without seeking to lead them stray.  
<i>[deleted: Witness the conversation with John Hill.]</i>  Since Satan 
tempted our first parents in the garden of Eden, there has been nothing 
equal to it.  They have been tossing the negroes in blankets at their 
camp, and it is reported that one was killed and buried yesterday.  
There is a report that Ex-President Davis has been captured in 
Georgia.</p><p class="p10"><u>20 mins to 11 
o'clock</u>.  &#8212;  Heard a gun just now  &#8212;  Am anxious to know what 
it means.  The Yankees have kept the town surrounded all day, allowing 
no one to go out or come in.  Legh no doubt wonders what is going on.  
Mr. Stuart and Sister took supper with us this evening.  We had genuine 
coffee.  I did not go down street during the day.  Found much 
entertainment in weeding my onions, but the work was very fatiguing.  
Mr. Stuart says the Yankees have one of their negroes under arrest, 
charged with shooting at the Gen. last 
night.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, May 19.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I had a conversation this morning with the Yankee Quartermaster, a 
Capt. Farnsworth, about the shooting 
affair.  He professed to believe that citizens were implicated in an 
attempt to kill Duval, and said it was fortunate for us it did not 
succeed, as the town would have been laid in ashes!  His whole talk was 
ridiculous, and I left him with a feeling of ineffable contempt.  Some 
of the Yankee soldiers are N. W. 
Virginians, and they say the shooting was done by some of their own 
men.  I still do not believe that a ball was fired into the house.  It 
is reported that some of the soldiers have mutinied, charging that the 
officers are keeping them in service in order to draw pay themselves.  
The Yankees have taken charge of the deaf + dumb and the blind, and 
have concert for them to-night, at the 
Institution, late Army Hospital.  No one is now allowed to go to the 
country, unless he has taken the oath of allegiance.  One or two new 
stores have been opened in town, by sutlers and others.</p><p class="p10">The report of President Davis' capture is repeated  &#8212;  I am grieved 
to say.  Another mutiny of citizens, with a view to organizing civil 
government, is called, for to-morrow.  It 
seems to be in opposition to the former meeting, and I presume the 
leaders aspire to be "Union men" <u>par 
excellence</u>, although some of them were secessionists long before 
the mass of our people.  They are unprincipled cravens.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Saturday night, May 20.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The meeting was held to-day in the Court 
house, Gen. Duval graciously permitting 
the people to enter.  I was attracted by curiosity, as doubtless were 
many others.  D. Fultz was holding forth when I arrived.  This speech 
was a puerile, miserable affair, for the benefit of the Yankee officers 
who were present.  R. G. Bickle presided.  He and F. got up the meeting for their own peculiar 
benefit, although the former was a zealous secessionist long before 
most of us gave into the movement.  F. has 
the merit of having been a consistent Union man all the time.  &#8212;  
While Yankee raiders were plundering him, he was abusing the 
secessionists.  F. proposed resolutions, not 
materially differing from those adopted at the former meeting, which 
were carried after some opposition.  Resolutions were also adopted 
thanking Duval and his command for the <u>protection</u> afforded by them, and denouncing the 
horrible, vile, wicked, wretched fiend who had attempted to assassinate 
the General.  Fultz, Bickle and Peck were appointed a committee to go 
to Richmond and confer with "Governor Pierpont."  All opposition to the 
other committee was disclaimed, but F. had 
not the art to conceal that he was hostile to it.  Never have I seen a 
more disreputable affair.  Some of the men who united in calling the 
meeting are already ashamed of it, and see that they were made tools 
of.  F. and B. 
wanted to go to Richmond, and got up this sham  &#8212;  it was a mere sham 
of a county meeting.  &#8212;  The idea of men who could not enter the house 
without the permission of Yankee soldiers  &#8212;  we were all kept out of 
the yard yesterday  &#8212;  acting the farce of a free popular meeting, 
when any word uttered not entirely tasteful to our military rulers 
would send the speaker to the guard house!  Shame on them, now and 
forever!  Yesterday no one was allowed to leave town unless he had 
taken the oath of allegiance  &#8212;  all restriction was removed to-day.  But no one is permitted to be on the 
streets after 8 o'clock, P. M.  J. Parent called for Alick last night 
to see his wife who had dislocated her jaw bone  &#8212;  An officer 
accompanied P. and also escorted Alick 
home.  The town council have offered a reward of $1000 for the 
apprehension of the assassin, provided he shall prove to be a citizen 
of the town.  Ridiculous!  Many of the Yankees, especially the N. W. Virginians, declare that if Duval was 
shot at, it was by one of his own men.  &#8212;  Legh told me this evening 
that he had seen a Methodist Yankee chaplain browbeating Albert Garber.  
He was applying for the Episcopal Church, to preach to the soldiers in.  
Garber said it was not their custom to allow their churches to other 
denominations.  The Yankee replied, "Why, you are no better than other 
people  &#8212;  I have the power to take your church, and if you lock the 
doors, I can break them down."</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Sunday, May 21.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I went to Sunday School this morning, and heard there that Ex-
Governor Letcher was brought to town last night, a regiment of cavalry 
having been sent to Lexington, to arrest him.  He was taken on to 
Washington this morning.  A reward has been offered for the arrest of 
Ex-Gov. Smith.  As Judge Thompson got 
home during the night, I called to see him.  He looks badly.  Has 
nothing of special interest to tell, although he was in Richmond ten 
days.  At 11 o'clock I went down to church, Legh was standing under one 
of the trees, and came to meet me saying that a Chaplain to one of the 
Federal regiments was in the pulpit.  Mr. Wayt and J. F. Patterson 
escorted him up.  I returned home, and await a report of proceedings 
with anxiety.  Have tried to commit this matter to God, asking Him to 
prevent any unpleasant occurrence, and to guide us all.</p><p class="p10"><u>Night</u>.  Va and Kate reported, on their return from 
church this morning, that Mr. Baker preached, and gave notice that "the 
Rev. Mr. Collier," Chaplain, would preach 
in the Baptist Church to-night.  The 
Chaplain sat in the pulpit, but did not officiate.  I felt thankful 
that everything had passed off quietly.  Meeting Mr. Baker after 
evening service, he gave me an account of the affair.  The tragedy I 
anticipated, turned out something of a farce.  I imagined this morning 
that the chaplains had usurped the pulpit, before Mr. Baker's arrival, 
and intended to preach by force of arms.  &#8212;  The truth was, that a 
notice of preaching at the <u>Methodist</u>Church, by Mr. C. was handed to Mr. Baker through J. F. 
Patterson, and another notice of preaching by Mr. C. at the same hour, but at the <u>Baptist</u> church, was handed up by Mr. Wayt.  Mr. 
Baker was considering the discrepancy, when it seems to have occurred 
to the Chaplain who, I presume, spoke to Wayt and Patterson about it.  
The latter in their embarrassment, blundered up the pulpit with the 
chaplain to set the matter right.  Mr. Baker invited the Chaplain to 
take a seat, and this was the whole affair.  The preacher must be an 
ignorant and uncouth fanatic.  His talk with Garber prepared me for 
anything from him.  I think it likely that the Yankee officers make a 
butt of him.  It is reported that he was in a rage this afternoon.  
Some of the officers asked him if he had preached to-
day, and he replied, No, he had been at a church where they 
asked him to neither preach, pray nor sing.  He did sing, however, out 
of the same book with Mr. Baker.</p><p class="p10">The military authorities have undertaken to turn out of office the 
Superintendent and physicians of the Lunatic Asylum.  Very likely they 
will attempt "to run the churches" next.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, May 22.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Many persons in town to-day, as the Yankee 
Quartermaster had a great sale of Confederate property collected up by 
him  &#8212;  horses, mules, wagons +c.  The people were allowed to go as 
well as come without passes.  The property sold wonderfully high, 
considering the scarcity of money.  For some nights past  &#8212;  since the 
shooting  &#8212;  no one has been allowed to go out after 8 o'clock, P.M.  
I presume the restriction has been withdrawn, as one or more church 
bells ran to-night.  The report that the 
Yankees had ousted the officers of the Lunatic Asylum and D. + D. + B. Institution is 
untrue.  Baldwin has telegraphed to Stuart to go to Richmond, and he 
goes in the morning.  Pierpont is recognized by the Washington 
authorities as the legitimate Governor of Virginia, and we are 
uncertain what policy he will pursue.  We are apprehensive that no one 
will be allowed to vote or hold office unless he purges himself by oath 
of all sympathies with the "rebellion," and that then the government 
will be thrown into the hands of the lowest rabble.  There will 
doubtless be many to swear they never did sympathize.  It is enough to 
disgust one with human nature.  History is ever repeating itself, and 
human nature is ever the same  &#8212;  See No. 629 of the Spectator.  The 
applications for office upon the restoration of the monarchy in the 
person of Charles II, was not more disgusting than they are now.  Many 
negroes in town to-day, especially women.  
Legh gave one of them a clap in the face yesterday 
for some insolence.  The Yankees made a great display of flags through 
main street this evening, returning from an exhibition at the 
Institution.  The whole of them are cut out for showmen.  Barnum is the 
representative man of the race.  They have caught President Davis and 
several "rebel" Governors, and are hunting down the rest.  They no 
doubt anticipate a big show at Washington, to which an admiring world 
will be invited.  This morning I went down with Capt. W. L. Clarke  &#8212;  and  &#8212;  took the oath 
of allegiance!  Most of the citizens had already taken it, and I was 
advised by my friends to <u>go through</u>.  
There is no alternative for us.  Gen. Lee 
advises it, and so does Roper.  It pains me to see Judge Thompson so 
cowed.  He looks badly and seems ready for any humiliation.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, May 23.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yesterday evening it was reported that the Yankees would leave town, 
and this part of the country, in a few days.  This morning we learned, 
however, that their wagons were to go to Winchester for thirty days 
rations, after which, the Railroad being then repaired, supplies could 
come by way of Richmond.  New orders, it seems, were received last 
night.  We feel almost in despair.  The state of things is bad enough 
here, but what must it be in Eastern Virginia, where there are so many 
more slaves!  The negroes generally have quit work, it is said.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, May 26.  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A wagon train and one of the Yankee regiments started to Winchester 
yesterday morning.  Everything quiet about town for the last two days.  
I worked in the garden nearly all day yesterday.  The rain kept me in 
doors to-day.  A letter from Tate yesterday, 
and another to-day.  Nothing of special 
interest in Richmond, except that Judge Campbell, formerly of the 
Supreme Court of the U. S., and 
latterly Assistant Secretary of War C. 
S. has been arrested on the charge of being an accomplice in the 
assassination of Lincoln.  Absurd!  The Yankees do not believe it, but 
the charge is a part of their paltry attempt to degrade us in the eyes 
of the world.  Pierpont was to arrive in Richmond yesterday.  Stuart 
when down yesterday, and the Committee of meeting No. 2 went at the 
same time.  Gov. Smith was going to 
Richmond, through Buckingham, at last accounts, of his own accord.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Monday night, May 29.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Things seem to be getting worse for us.  Yesterday morning U. S. flags were hung at several street 
corners, so that persons going to the Episcopal Church should have to 
pass under them; and a small paper flag was suspended over the church 
gate.  Some persons, young ladies, rendered themselves ridiculous by 
walking in the middle of the street.  If U. 
S. officers are <u>small</u> enough to do 
such things, other people should have sense enough not to regard them.  
This morning a small flag was found posted to the portico of A. F. 
Kinney's house, where Gen. Long, late of 
the C. S. A., boards.  And Kinney, who first discovered the flag, 
pulled it down, for which act of treason he was arrested and threatened 
with banishment to a Northern prison!  A larger flag was then put up at 
Kinney's gate.  Thus every effort is made to humiliate us.  I learn 
that a string of flags was suspended to-day 
across Main Street, opposite from Kinney's house; but all of them were 
taken down this evening.  The Yankee gentlemen here are indignant that 
they are not taken into society, and are venting their spleen in every 
petty way.  They imagine that every lady they meet insults them.  We 
hear that in Richmond, Charlottesville +c. the citizens are treated in 
a very different manner.  Chaplain Collier applied for our Church to 
preach in, at 2 o'clock yesterday, to the soldiers, and we let him have 
it.  Very few citizens attended.  The performance of Chaplains Collier 
and Little, who seem to go in pairs, was from all accounts very silly.  
The latter was singing-teacher hereabouts, some years ago.  An election 
was held in Frederick last week, for county officers, under the 
Pierpont government.  The State Constitution under which Pierpont is 
acting, was made at Alexandria by sixteen men, and has never been 
submitted to the vote of any part of the people.  It prescribes an oath 
which persons must take before voting, that the party has not given 
"aid and comfort" to the rebellion since January 1, 1864.  Many persons 
in Winchester took this oath, but the Commissioners of Election had 
further tests to apply.  &#8212;  Persons were asked if they were glad or 
sorry when Gen. Lee surrendered, and if 
they said, Sorry, they were not allowed to vote.  The consequence was 
that the right of suffrage was denied to all except <u>eight (8) men</u>.  Stuart and Baldwin, as well as 
Tate, write encouragingly from Richmond, but we have not heard from 
them since they had an interview with Pierpont.  A military force has 
gone to Lexington.  I was very sick the greater part of the day.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Tuesday night, May 30.\</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Legh's negro boy Edward has gone off to Winchester with the Yankees.  
From present appearances, the Pierpont Constitution, formed at <u>Alexandria by sixteen men</u>, and never voted for 
(or against, either, for that matter) by any body else, is to be thrust 
upon us by Federal bayonets.  The Federal Constitution guarantees to 
every State a Republican government, and this is the Yankee 
interpretation of the clause.  The Pierpont Constitution wipes out 
slavery, now and forever, if the instrument lasts so long.  It makes no 
provision for young children, nor for aged and infirm negroes  &#8212;  but 
sets them <u>free</u>!  &#8212;  free to perish!  
This is philanthropy with a vengeance.  Alas, for the poor negro!  His 
truest, best friend has always been the intelligent, Christian slave-holder of the South.  &#8212;  
Ruthlessly taken from such guardianship, tempted and deluded with the 
pretended boon of freedom, seduced from home and friends, the negroes 
go out to suffer and die.  It is preposterous to imagine that the 
master, in a majority of cases, can maintain the aged and young slaves, 
when deserted by all the able-bodied.  This sham Constitution does not 
require him to do it  &#8212;  no law can accomplish an impossibility  &#8212;  
and these helpless classes, in many cases, have no relations who can be 
charged by law with their support.  What is to become of them?  And the 
whole negro population set free  &#8212;  brought into collision with free 
white labor  &#8212;  how can it bear up in the struggle!  They go forth 
like Cain, with every man's hand against them  &#8212;  no friend, no 
protector, an inferior race, to be trampled upon and finally 
exterminated.  The next twenty years will witness scenes at which 
humanity will shudder, and in fifty years the negro will disappear from 
the continent  &#8212;  Killed by the Kindness of Northern philanthropy.  
Never an advocate of slavery in itself, always earnestly longing for 
universal emancipation when it could be effected humanely or when the 
slave could be suitably provided for  &#8212;  and hoping that God would 
bring it about in some way, I stand appalled at this wholesale cruelty.  
Gen. Duval is going ahead with his flags.  
They are everywhere on the streets.  He seems to be trying to entrap 
the people into some imprudence.  Before the war he kept a little 
country store  &#8212;  it is doubtless a fine thing for him to be a Brig. Gen. And he wants to keep <u>it</u> as long as possible.  &#8212;  Unless he reports 
that this community is "defiant," he may be ordered off, and his 
command disbanded.  I forgot to mention that Legh's woman Polly came to 
town several days ago and took lodgings in Irish alley.  Poor fool!  
She is not smart, and is subject to fits.  Legh bought her as an act of 
charity to her husband, John Hill, some years ago.  Now she is all agog 
about being <u>free</u>.  Since his marriage, 
Legh has been kept poor by raising a family of young negroes, and as 
they got old enough to render some service, they leave, one after 
another.  Jim went first, and then Edward; John will probably go soon.  
Polly is no loss.  John Hill is running about after that ignorant 
Yankee chaplain, Collier, and even he is in danger of being carried off 
by the same contagion.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Wednesday night, May 31.  </b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The County Committee No. 1, expect Stuart, returned from Richmond 
last night.  Tate has a great deal to tell, but it does not amount to 
much.  Pierpont so far insists upon his Constitution with its provision 
restricting the right of suffrage to persons who can purge themselves 
of aiding and abetting the rebellion.  Tate, and Baldwin also, is 
hopeful, however, that as one county Committees from different counties 
are going to Richmond all with the same tale, that the whole people 
nearly will be disfranchised, Pierpont will ultimately relax.  Lelia 
Stuart saw a fig to-day for the first time. So 
far as she knows.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Thursday night, June 1.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Gen. Duval's flags are spreading 
themselves.  &#8212;  Another string of them is stretched across Augusta 
Street, near Main.  The General says the flags are not put up by his 
order, but being up he requires that they be treated with respect.  &#8212;  
Sensible man, that  &#8212;  and highly patriotic.  He sees no impropriety 
in his soldiers intruding upon private property, contrary to his 
general order  &#8212;  if they only go to stick up flags for the purpose of 
taunting rebels.  Most of our people feel highly amused at the puerile 
exhibition.  Addy ran home to-day, highly 
excited, saying there were a great many <u>hankerchiefs</u> for sale at the new 
store, by the pump, like little flags.  He went to the store to inquire 
the price of the hankerchiefs.  A 
Confederate soldier passing under the line, was asked by the Yankees at 
the guardhouse nearby, how he liked to walk <u>under</u> the flag.  &#8212;  He replied that he had 
walked <u>over</u> it so often it had ceased to 
effect him.  The Provost Marshal returned to 
Mr. Craig a negro girl to-day that had gone 
off from home, notwithstanding Chaplain Collier appeared as her 
advocate.  Yesterday and to-day the Yankees 
had the stray negro men at work on the streets.  Legh tells me that 
John Hill declares he has no intention of going off with his wife.  
Little John, too, Legh thinks, intends to remain at home.  Legh milks 
the cows now.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Friday night, June 2.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The last "agony" from Washington appeared this morning  &#8212;  
President Johnson's Proclamation of Pardon to rebels on certain 
conditions.  An oath of allegiance to the U. S. is prescribed, and also an oath to support all 
acts of Congress and Executive Proclamations for emancipating the 
slaves.  There are so many Proclamations and oaths of one sort and 
another that it's hard to keep the run of them.  For the <u>information of posterity</u> I beg leave to explain 
that there is, 1<sup>st</sup>, Lincoln's "Amnesty Oath," as it is 
called, viz: an oath of allegiance coupled with one to support the 
emancipation acts and proclamations, until the latter shall be 
modified, or declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  This oath 
has been administered everywhere by the military authorities, except 
for Staunton.  Why it has not been administered here we are not 
informed.  It professes to restore the <u>swearer</u> to all of his civil and political 
rights, and to wipe out all taint of <u>treason</u>.  The oath administered at Staunton is 
the 2<sup>nd</sup> in order.  Stript of 
some of its Yankeeisms, which have no special meaning, it is merely an 
oath of allegiance without a word of slavery.  Lastly comes the Johnson 
oath of amnesty, which, as I have said, binds the applicant to go for 
everything that Lincoln and the Yankee Congress have done to abolish 
slavery, through thick and thin, now and hereafter, notwithstanding 
Congress and the President may recall every word of it, and whether 
Constitutional or unconstitutional!  Certain persons are excluded from 
taking this oath, or at least from its benefits, viz:  all military 
officers above the rank of Colonel, all Naval officers above the rank 
of Lieutenant, all civil officers of the "pretended" or "so called" 
Confederate States, all persons worth more than $20,000, +c, +c.  
Persons belonging to these classes must file petitions to his 
Excellency for pardon, and he promises to grant it liberally.  In the 
mean while, however, they will be excluded from all participation in 
the government.  But in Virginia, Gov. 
Pierpont's Constitution requires in addition that no one shall vote 
unless he swears that he has given no "aid and comfort" to those 
engaged in the rebellion for the last two years.  Two questions arise:  
first whether those who have taken Lincoln's oath can now be deprived 
of its benefits, and, secondly, whether the terms of the parole granted 
to Gen. Lee's army, and all others which 
have surrendered (now the whole C. 
S. force) does not protect the men from civil prosecution.  My 
opinion is not clear upon either point.  But it seems to me 
preposterous for Pierpont to prescribe different terms from those 
offered by the United States when any offense committed was against the 
latter, and not against the State of Virginia.  Northern papers say 
that Ex-Pres. Davis, being 
refractory, has been put in irons.  I almost sicken at it, although 
Davis' course latterly was not calculated to inspire confidence and 
respect.  His action in regard to substitutes +c, +c destroyed all 
confidence in the good-faith of the Government, and hastened the 
catastrophe.  His removal of Johnston from the command in Georgia was 
another great blunder.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Sunday night, June 4.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A pleasant Sabbath, for which I thank God.  How different in some 
respects from this day a year ago!  Then we were anxious about the 
approach of Hunter's army.  &#8212;  We heard Saturday evening, June 4, 
1864, that Hunter had moved down North River, from Mt. Crawford, and 
that the Confederate force under Gen. 
Jones, including hundreds of our county people, my brother Legh among 
them, was moving towards Mt. Meridian, to keep in front of the enemy.  
We were extremely solicitous about the result, and busy with 
arrangements for leaving home (that is most men in military employment) 
in case of disaster.  Now we have seen the end of all our efforts and 
sacrifices, and are as composedly as possible submitting to the rule of 
our Northern masters.  But God has not forgotten us, as this day 
proves.  It was communion Sabbath in our church, and nineteen (19) 
persons made profession of religion, including Kitty, Nanny and Matty.  
Mr. Gilmer preached yesterday and Mr. Stuart this afternoon.  A part of 
Mr. Baker's sermon this morning seemed to have been suggested by the 
times  &#8212;  He spoke of the disappointment of the disciples at the death 
and burial of Christ, and remarked that probably some of the very men 
who had shouted hosanna upon his entrance into Jerusalem, were ready 
now to persecute his followers.  &#8212;  Whether he intended it or not, I 
could not help thinking of some originally zealous secessionists, who 
to ingratiate themselves with <u>their</u> 
conquerors, are cringing to them, and lending themselves to every 
arbitrary measure, however offensive.  There is a good deal of talk 
about immigrating to Brazil, although I doubt if any body, in this 
region at least, goes.  I dont want to go 
where I cant see the North star.  And, as I 
heard remarked on the Street, if we should go to Brazil and get a snug 
place, the rapacious Yankees would probably try to get possession of 
it.  No doubt, the first person we should meet on landing, would be a 
Connecticut vendor of wooden nutmegs.  I believe the Federal 
authorities at Washington are taking voluminous testimony to show how 
barbarously their prisoners were treated at the South during the war.  
&#8212;  All a part of their miserable humbuggery, to justify themselves in 
the eyes of the world.  Alas! the poor Confederates can take no 
testimony, or they could unfold a tale of cruelty too.  There was 
doubtless enough on both sides.  John M<sup>c</sup>D. Alexander, who 
was confined for many many months at Point Lookout, expressed the 
opinion that the Yankees were systematically trying to kill their 
prisoners.  &#8212;  I revolt at such cruelty, by whichever side practiced.  
Of the many thousands of prisoners brought through this place during 
the last four years, I never spoke to one.  To one of them, however, I 
sent shoes and stockings, and never failed to do what I could for 
others.  The collection at church to-day for 
the poor, amounted to only $3.75, so scarce is money.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The first anniversary of the battle of Piedmont.  At this hour a 
year ago I was riding up the Greenville road, a fugitive from home.  We 
spent the evening at J. B. Baldwin's, going early and leaving at half 
past 8 o'clock.  Some of the ladies seemed anxious to wait till after 9 
o'clock, to see if the military patrol would put them in the guard 
house.  I had no desire to try the experiment.  The pupils at the 
Seminary are preparing for a concert next week, and Ettinger, the music 
teacher, applied this evening for a pass to return to his lodgings at 
10 or 11.  It was peremptorily refused, on the ground that the 
Principal of the school had ordered the girls not to walk under the 
flags (false) and that the girls had insulted the soldiers  &#8212;  
possibly "made mouths" at them, which is the general charge!  
Chivalrous <u>men</u>, to vent spleen at a set 
of school girls!  But I doubt if the accusation be true.  A man in a 
sulky<a href="#n89">89</a> while passing under the flags on 
Saturday, cut at them with his whip, for which grave offence he was put 
into the guard house and kept there till to-
day.  Robert Gilkeson, a respectable farmer, who came to town on 
Saturday, to deliver some property claimed as belonging to the U. S., was detained in the guard house 
till to-day, when he was discharged upon 
giving bond and security to appear when called for.  No cause for his 
arrest was assigned, but it is said to have been a report made by a 
negro that he (G) had threatened to shoot 
any Yankees coming to his house for property.  Yet he brought the 
property in, and the negro denies having given any information of the 
kind stated.  A bee stung me on the middle finger of my right hand, and 
I write with difficulty.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The flag farce has reached to <u>ne plus

demanded a flag he had.  Morris stated that he knew of no flag on his 
premises, and the men brushing by him found a negro child having a 
little red rag tied to a switch, which it had been playing with at the 
Kitchen window!  Full of patriotic ardor, the soldiers seized the rag, 
and tearing it in pieces, warned Morris that his whole family would be 
put under arrest, if the offence were repeated!!  A number of meat 
houses have been broken open and robbed at night, during the last two 
or three weeks.  Todd Gilkeson, who now lives near us, in Burdett's 
house, had sixteen pieces of bacon stolen from him.  Night before last 
one of Alick's stables was broken open, but from some cause or other 
the horse was not taken.  Alick went to the Yankee guard to inquire if 
they had heard any disturbance, and was sur-</p><p class="p10">(see page 112)</p><p class="p10">prised to learn from them that they were withdrawn from duty at 12 
o'clock.  This is another outrage upon us.  We are not permitted to

that idleness would not be tolerated, and those found unemployed would 
be severely punished; advising them to remain at their houses, +c +c.

that we might save the milk.  Legh, being in town went with me in the 
wagon, and Alick rode up on horse back.  The children were impatient to 
take me to a cherry tree, where Lucy displayed great agility in

an immense train of wagons.  One of the regiments of infantry which 
came up with Duval, was sent to Harrisonburg several weeks ago.  The 
officers of the Ohio regiment which left to-
day, are apparently gentlemen, and we are sorry they did not 
remain, as we are still to have Yankees here.  Col. Duval (no relation of the Gen.) and the Lt. Col., Wilson, have always seemed to be sensible and 
liberal men, and have freely expressed their disapproval of the 
General's fooleries.  The General's coach is a luxurious vehicle drawn 
by four elegant gray horses.  Many of the ambulances were quite 
stylish.  How unlike our Confederate equipage!  A few negroes went with

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">As Mr. Tate has been keeping his riding horse in town for a number 
of weeks, I got him to exchange it for one that would work in shafts, 
so that when he was not using it I could haul some wood.  This morning 
I started out with the horse, but the wagon (W. H. Heiskell's) has 
disappeared and could not be found.  I was much disappointed, but being 
on the horse, concluded to ride out and see a small farm, two miles 
from town, which I have some thought of trying to trade my town 
property for.  Met Legh and Mary Stuart walking in, and the former 
proposed going with me to see the farm, if I would wait till his return 
from town.  So I went on to Legh's, and was detained there some time by 
a furious storm.  While there, a poor man and his wife arrived, 
searching for employment.  They are from Alleghany, and have a young 
child.  &#8212;  Coming home I met Legh, but we did not go to see the farm.  
Another rain came up, and drove me for shelter into W. P. Tate's.

with the Yankees now stationed here.  Stewart, the Col., says Duval gave him a very bad account of 
the people of Staunton, but he has had nothing to complain of.  James

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Heavy rains to-day.  Much wet weather for 
some time past, so that the corn cannot be worked, nor the grass cut.  
Corn growing rapidly, and oats very flourishing.  Wheat ready to cut in 
many places.  The Yankees have been arresting all negro men unemployed  
&#8212;  allowing them to go to service in the country  &#8212;  otherwise  &#8212;  
otherwise they will be put to cleaning the streets.  The poor negroes 
flock to town, as if they could not be free in the country.  One small 
tenement where an old couple lately lives, is occupied by <u>thirty</u>.  Some negro men who have families of 
children are greatly embarrassed.  The <u>late</u> owners of the women (mothers), being 
deserted by their men and boys, cannot, of course, maintain females 
with children who will desert in their turn as soon as they are able to 
work; and in many cases have notified the husbands, who generally have 
belonged to other persons, to take charge of their families and provide 
for them.  The negroes are beginning to find out that the Yankees are 
not altogether the good friends they imagined.  "Freedom" is not all 
that is necessary for comfort, yet it is all the Yankees have given to 
the negro.  There is a charm about it, however, and old negroes, more 
than seventy years old, and unable to maintain themselves, have left 
comfortable homes where they would have been cared for, to shuffle for 
themselves.  James Calhoun says that much sympathy is shown to 
Confederate soldiers in Baltimore and elsewhere.  While bringing his 
son to Richmond, a stranger tendered him money.</p></p>

engaged by John Hill had not been there, or had done no work  &#8212;  Worry 
No. 2.  Loaded up with chesnut wood, cut by 
the Confederate artillery company encamped there last Fall, and started 
home.  Legh's children were at the Spring, and called to me.  I left 
the wagon + horses in the road, and went over to them.  Then went up to 
the house.  While I was in a cherry tree, Lucy told me she heard some 
one cutting wood on my land, + I then heard the sound myself.  Going 
over, I found the man at work, and after giving him some directions, I 
came on home.  A white boy in the street applied to me for employment 
as a driver, and a black man wished to buy my wood.  I staid at home 
two hours, and then returned to Legh's.  Went out to the harvest field, 
where L. had a number of hands cutting wheat.  
Coming back to the house, I ate some more cherries.  Leaving the wagon 
at L.'s, as I expect to use his horses on 
Friday, I started home late in the afternoon or evening.  Echard at 
Peaco's butchering a beef and several sheep for market to-morrow.  Took both horses to Mr. Campbell's  -

reached home some time after dark.  &#8212;  A report that 400 Yankee negro 
troops, in Texas, demanding the surrender of some Confederates, were 
attacked and all but 60 killed.  It seems to be regarded in town as a 
good joke.  We are a part of the U.

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I rose early this morning, so as to be ready to start after wood 
immediately after breakfast.  My intention was to haul two loads to-day, and one to-
morrow.  I walked to Legh's (three miles) without experiencing 
any inconvenience, notwithstanding the extreme heat.  But then my 
troubles began.  Legh and his hands were in the harvest field, and 
could not assist me.  Belle sent Susan (colored) to the far pasture to 
drive up two horses for me, while I got out the harness.  There were no 
lines suitable for driving two horses, and little Lucy was sent to 
Peaco's to borrow a pair.  As Susan did not return, I went to the field 
and brought in the horses.  I then hitched up, having much difficulty 
with the harness, and managed to drive one to the woods, with a single 
line to each horse.  Could not get the wagon near to the wood which had 
been cut.  So I turned in to carry, drag +c the logs, first to a half-
way chesnut tree, and then to the wagon.  
Weather very warm  &#8212;  I perspired profusely, and had to take off my 
spectacles  &#8212;  logs comparatively light, but too heavy for me  &#8212;  I 
carried, dragged, or pitched head over heels two logs, and sat down 
overcome with heat and exhaustion  &#8212;  sometimes transporting one log 
would cause me to give up for a while, heart beating violently  &#8212;  
becoming very thirsty  &#8212;  tried a piece of calamus<a href="#n90">90</a> in my mouth, which relieved me temporarily, but 
finally, after getting fourteen logs, little and big, in the wagon had 
to go to Legh's spring for a drink  &#8212;  fished up an old tin or copper 
vessel from the water, and drank and drank  &#8212;  sat down in the spring 
home door  &#8212;  my face burning hot, with a smarting sensation and my 
temples aching  &#8212;  getting some relief I started back  &#8212;  as I 
approached my team, met horses and wagon coming to meet me, and getting 
further from the wood pile at every step  &#8212;  was almost in despair, 
but tried to drive the horses back, up the hill, by a circuitous route  
&#8212;  removed a brush heap out of the way, and made several attempts to 
ascend the hill  &#8212;  the wagon at last stuck fast, and I could not move 
it a peg in any direction  &#8212;  determined to unload and take the empty 
wagon up  &#8212;  threw off three logs, found them much heavier than when I 
put them on, wondered how I got them on at all  &#8212;  had to give up and 
quit, and concluded to go over to the house and call for help  &#8212;  
passed the spring and took another good drink  &#8212;  reached the house 
utterly prostrated  &#8212;  the family at dinner, a Yankee soldier being at 
the table with them (!)  &#8212;  could not eat, but lay back in a rocking

coffee, and I could not say no  &#8212;  drank two cups and took a hearty 
meal of mutton dressed with onions  &#8212;  left the table feeling like a 
well man, but rather averse to further exercise  &#8212;  Legh took four or 
five of his harvest hands over, and they got the wagon up the hill, 
loaded on the wood, (forty sticks in all) and drove down into the road  
&#8212;  Lucy had failed to borrow the reins, so I mounted on the wood and 
drove home with the single lines.  Got home about five o'clock, 
determined not to go alone hereafter for wood, at least in a hot 
day.</p></p>

removing several prostrate chesnut trees, 
we got quite near to my wood pile.  The loading was done with great 
ease.  I went to the spring, and then to Legh's house for a minute.  
The children were under a cherry tree a little way off.  Lucy came up 
and told me that Lelia, one of the twins, was fast asleep under the 
tree.  I went down and found the child astride a rail, her head resting 
on the end of another rail, sleeping away most profoundly.  She was as 
dirty as a pig, but that only made the sight more picturesque.  I left 
still sleeping on the rail.  In the afternoon I took the horses and

before Hirsh's house and sang a Yankee war song.  All of our family

upon one of their number to improvise a song suitable for the occasion.  
A miserable affair was then sung, with a chorus, making rude and 
pointed allusions to Mr. Stuart and his family.  There's the <u>magnanimity</u> of our conquerors!  &#8212;  I started 
to make a report of the matter to Col. 
Fisher, but being detained on the way he set off for Winchester before 
I reached his quarters.  Col. Steward has 
gone to Lexington with part of the command lately here.  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  The 
bee martins have been devouring my bees lately, and yesterday I shot 
one of them.  It had a tuft of colored feathers on its head, which, 
according to a common belief, the bird expands into a flower to attract 
bees.  Ordinarily the flower is covered by the common black feathers.  
The bird was not dead when I picked it up, and its meek, bright eyes 
have quite haunted me.  I begin to doubt if it devoured honey bees.  
The hive it frequented seems to be overrun with drones, and they 
probably furnish food to the bird.  But not a bee martin has been about 
the premises to-day.  &#8212;</p></p>

Atkinson is spending the night with Kitty, as she frequently does.  She 
is staying at present with her sister, Mrs. Smith.  &#8212;  Raised in 
wealth, or at least abundance, the war has left her, like so many

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Baldwin, to whom we referred the various questions arising under 
Aunt Sally's will, having awarded that most of the personal property 
must be sold to pay debts, I was at the house to-
day arranging things for the auction to-
morrow.  &#8212;  While there Mr. Stuart handed me a letter 
postmarked Washington city and addressed to Va and me.  It was from the agent of Adams 
olo's Express Company, and stated that a package of 
money had been received there for Va.  We 
are envious to know where or whom it is from, and who it is for.  We 
presume that Washington is at present the nearest point to which the 
package can come by Express.  Much interest felt in the County election 
to take place next Tuesday, and a great deal of discussion in regard to 
qualification of voters and eligibility to office.  I declined becoming 
a candidate for the clerkship against Jos. 
Ryan.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Friday, July 14.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The sale on Wednesday turned out far beyond any calculations I had 
made.  The property was sold to pay a debt due to me, I having advanced 
nearly all the money to build Aunt Sally's house, and now amounts to 
more than $900.  As Cousin Sally was cut out, by Baldwin's award, of 
the legacy left her, I purchased all of the articles named, except a 
carpet, and intend to present them to her.  They amount to about $100.  
This morning we were notified that a box from Princeton had arrived at 
the Express Office.  Wright soon brought it up, and it was found to 
contain various articles.  &#8212;  a handsome silk mantle for Va, several books for me, and other things for 
other members of the connection  &#8212;  sent by Janetta Alexander.  She 
said, in a letter to Va., that she had sent 
$100 by Express, with directions as to what was to be done with it.  We 
have taken steps to get the package on from Washington  &#8212;  cant tell why it was stopped there, as the box came 
through.  &#8212;  Early in the war, a mulatto girl belonging to Mr. G. M. 
Cochran ran off.  She appeared in town a few weeks ago, said she was 
married to a <u>white gentleman</u> at the 
North, and living in high style.  Her manners were so offensive at Mr. 
Cochran's, where she called, that she was rebuked pretty effectually, 
and then she went off taking with her a younger sister.  Within the 
last few days a decent-looking white man came to town + inquired for 
Mr. Cochran.  Some one pointed him to one of Mr. C's sons who stood near, and the man going up 
introduced himself by saying:  "I married your sister."  "My <u>sister</u>!" exclaimed Geo. C.  "Yes," said the man, "your sister Ellen."  "My 
servant," said Geo.  The man exhibited much emotion, and said it was 
the first information he had received that she was not white.  He found 
her in a cloak making establishment in Philadelphia, and she 
represented herself as a daughter of Mr. C. who had left home on account of some family 
difficulties.  He came on with her as far as Charlottesville, whr she insisted on his waiting for her, and as 
she did not return he came for her.  I take it for granted that he is a 
low fellow, and not very particular at that.  
Ridgeray, former editor of the Richmond Whig, always 
opposed to the war, went down lately to edit the paper again as a <u>par excellence</u> "Union paper."  As soon as the 
first number appeared, it was suppressed by a military order, on 
account of some editorial remarks in it</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The first election for county officers, under the new order of 
things, was held yesterday.  The vote quite full, contrary to 
expectations.  Most of the late incumbents of the various offices were 
reelected, also contrary to expectations of some would be Union men.  
But the State Attorney General has published an opinion, received here 
after the election, in which he lays it down that all persons who have 
held office under the "so called" Confederate State Governments, are 
ineligible to office, which will probably cut out many of the 
successful candidates.  &#8212;  I have never doubted that this was the 
correct doctrine (legally correct) however outrageous.</p></p>

He and other persons living on the Middlebrook road are greatly annoyed 
by the soldiers blonging to a 
Pennsylvania regiment which came here last week from Richmond.  The men 
are dissatisfied and very lawless.  The officers seem to have no 
control over them.  A Lt. Col. 
Clay, a young fellow who wears a jacket and has only one arm, commands 
this regiment.  This section of country has been thrown into the same 
military district as Richmond and the soldiers who have been here for 
some time past, are to be relieved by those last arrived.  There is bad 
feeling between the two sets.  The Federal authorities appear to have 
no desire to conciliate the Southern people, but are proceeding in a 
ruthless manner, generally.  No mails yet from or to Richmond or 
Lexington, although the cars and stages run regularly.  Va is sitting up to-
night with Mr. Woods' little girl, who is very sick.  I went out

Steward started down the Valley this evening, leaving only the landless 
set under the command of Lt. 
Col. Clay.  Every body regrets the departure of Steward.  His 
conduct has been sensible, gentlemanly and magnanimous, and we wish he 
could have remained as long as any troops are kept here.  The 
58<sup>th</sup> Pennsylvania, the regiment now here, is under very bad 
control.  The officers seem to be afraid of their men.  &#8212;  It is 
currently reported that one man gave his Captain a whipping, a few days 
ago.  This morning I read an article in the New York Observer, which 
excites my resentment and disgust more than anything I have seen 
lately:  The caption of it is, "Southern Christians," and the writer 
evidently thought he was influenced by a most Christian spirit.  He 
says we have committed great sin, and are called upon to repent and 
make ample acknowledgements.  Instead of confessing the outrages practiced upon us, to be exhorting up to 
repentance!  Such insolence can only be properly met by slapping the 
writer in the face.  His brazen effrontery could appreciate no other 
answer.  The Yankee clergy are evidently calculating upon extending 
<u>their</u> jurisdiction over the South.  Thank 
God!  we are not prohibited from resisting their domination.</p></p>

mother's, slit down the front, and streaming behind her as she ran.  
There was something inexpressibly ludicrous in her appearance, which 
her assumed gravity helped to increase.  Her mother ordered her off, 
and she came back, wearing her dress, and looking pretty.  Sister 
remarked to me that she was much distressed about Lelia  &#8212;  that she 
came to her to-day saying she Kept feeling

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I have written nothing for several weeks because nothing of interest 
has occurred.  I am still without remunerative employment, but always 
have plenty to do, and time never hangs heavy on my hands.  Gov. Pierpoint has 
ordered new elections of county officers, in place of those lately 
elected who held Confederate offices.  The County magistrates elected 
on the 18<sup>th</sup> July, met recently, and adjourned over to the 
regular Court day in this month.  The Corporation elections took place 
last week  &#8212;  and I believe the military have made a <u>formal</u> surrender of the town to civil 
authorities.  It is said the Yankee soldiers committed several outrages 
last night.  Hirsh's store broken open, a white man knocked down and 
robbed of a gold watch, and a negro shot  &#8212;  mortally wounded.  Our 
present Yankees seem to have a great dislike for the Negroes, and treat 
them very badly, robbing and beating them on all occasions.  Betty Lyle 
arrived last evening, after many adventures since she started home last

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">It turns out that the negro who was shot Saturday night, is the man 
who entered Hirsh's store  &#8212;  he was shot by the store boy, who fired 
repeatedly, but did not know that he had hit the burglar.  The negro 
has made confession.  The man who robbed another of a watch has been 
detected also.  &#8212;  This morning early Wright came in and announced 
that Mr. Tate's horse had disappeared from the stable  &#8212;  not heard of 
yet.  Soon after breakfast, Legh arrived, saying that his grainery was entered last night, the hinges being 
bored off with an auger, and 10 or 12 bushels of wheat, some oats, and 
from 20 to 30 sacks, were stolen  &#8212;  His potatoes have all been dug 
and carried off by thieves.  His neighbors have suffered more or less 
in the same way.  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;  Kitty has gone to a party to-night.  Nancy and Matty were greatly interested 
in fixing her up.  It is delightful to see these girls living on such 
affectionate terms.  A singular phenomenon occurred in our neighborhood 
this evening  &#8212;  A Miss Points who has not been out of the house for 
many years, nor down stairs, except when she was carried, disappeared 
from the premises.  Search was made for her, and she was found at her 
uncle's, in the lower part of the town, whither she had gone after 
endeavoring to get into the church-yard to visit her mother's grave.  
It was supposed that she could not walk.</p></p>

transacted, and I suppose the Grand Jury will make some presentments.  
I was appointed a Commissioner to settle Fiduciary's Accounts  &#8212;  a 
little office with little pay.  Otherwise somebody else would have got 
it.  A meeting of the people nominated A. H. H. 
Stuart for Congress, and he accepted with tears in his eyes.  
Candidates for the Legislature were also nominated.  Some of my friends 
seemed anxious to run me for the Legislature, but when the meeting came

About twenty-five young men contended for the honor of selecting and

their spears, while at full speed on horseback.  The proceedings were

horrid scenes through which we have recently passed.  The Yankee 
soldiers here took much interest in the affair, and assisted in making 
the arrangements.  A number of the officers were present, but took no 
part.  Peter Sowers has come in from Missouri to try to get back his

as to what the Yankee nation will do with us.  The "Republican" State 
Conventions are very ultra  &#8212;  Witness the resolutions passed in 
Pennsylvania.  The Democratic Conventions and newspapers are as liberal 
as we could expect under the circumstances.  The course of the Yankee 
nation, or least "the powers that be," is well illustrated by the 
anecdote of the Dutchman and his son.  After a severe whipping from his 
father the boy retired, snubbing to a corner.  "What you tink, Hans?" 
asked the father.  "Me tink noting, father," replied Hans.  "You lie," 
said the old man, "you tink d&#8212;n, me whip you again."  We have

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A negro woman from Philadelphia preached in the Methodist church 
this afternoon!  I presume our town Negroes attended in large numbers.  
Wright says she is not educated; but, with a few exceptions, used good 
language, and preached a good sermon.  Jenny says she (the woman) had 
two negro children fanning her, and remarked that her voice was feckle, 
and she could not speak, at all if the <u>angels</u> were not fanning her.  &#8212;  She did not 
justify women preaching generally, but professed to have a special 
call.  The poor darkies are getting besides themselves, and will soon, 
with the assistance of their Northern friends, work out their 
destruction.  &#8212;  Notwithstanding we now have civil courts, our Yankee 
Provost Marshal continues to try all sorts of cases, including some 
which require thorough legal knowledge for their correct adjustment.  
He is, however, ignorant of the first principles of jurisprudence, and 
imagining that the white people are disposed to oppress and defraud the 
negroes, he sustains the latter in the most unjust pretensions.  &#8212;  
Yesterday, he gave judgment in favor of a negro against John S. 
Churchman, on a claim for wages, allowing the negro to testify in his 
own behalf, and either refusing to receive Churchman's statement, or 
disbelieving it, and not allowing him to bring in witnesses.  Was there 
ever such a mocking of justice!  And the Lt. Col. commanding the post says there is no appeal.  
The matter has been reported to Gov. 
Pierpoint.  Northern radicals are all agog 
for compelling the Southern States to allow negroes to vote.  
Notwithstanding the <u>leanings</u> of the 
Yankee military authorities in favor of the negroes against the whites, 
when they have to <i>[deleted: deal]</i> punish them, they do it with a 
severity which deters humane persons from preferring 
complaints.</p></p>

all the candidates for the House except Baldwin, and, of course, was 
one of the three chosen.  My success and the large vote I received 
excited great surprise among some persons, who seemed to take it for 
granted that I could not be elected.  Some who predicted my defeated, worked hard to accomplish it.  A faction 
of men in town who aspire to rule, did all they could against me  &#8212;  
Why or wherefore, I do not know.  Several months ago, I heard of one of 
them, whom I considered a personal friend, saying that I was 
wonderfully clever, but could not be elected to anything.  Probably he 
worked against me, only to prove the truth of his prophecy.  Another of 
the set had three grounds of objection to me.  1<sup>st</sup> He would 
vote for no man who said he would not feel compliments by an election.  
[I had said directly the reverse], 2<sup>nd</sup> I was so bashful, 
that if I went to the Legislature, I would not say anything, and 
3<sup>rd</sup>, I was a stiff fellow anyhow, and did'nt care for any body unless he was a 
Presbyterian.  This man was doing his best to injure me, and I was glad 
to find that he could trump up nothing more serious.  From my 
opposition to leaving home, I felt little or no desire to succeed, till 
I heard of the efforts of my enemies.  The returns from the country 
came in slowly, and, while I was ahead all the time, the vote between 
Baylor, Sterrett and myself was so close, that the result was somewhat 
doubtful till Monday, the 16<sup>th</sup>, when the Poll Books arrived 
from all the Precincts.  On Friday there was a good deal of excitement  
&#8212;  my friends hopeful, and my enemies amazed to find that there was a 
probability of my election, after their predictions and efforts to 
defeat me.  On Monday we heard from New Hope, Shenando and Midway, and on footing up all 
the votes cast I was about Sixty ahead of Baylor, and exactly a hundred 
ahead of Sterrett.  The interest many persons took in me, gratified me 
much more than my triumph.  &#8212;  There were seven (7) candidates for the 
House.  I fear there will be some difficulty about Baldwin's election, 
as in the opinion of many persons, myself included, he was ineligible 
under our present Constitution.  Saturday last was a very stormy day  -

<p class="p10"><a name="n1">{1}</a>  Virginia, usually abbreviated "Va," was Joseph 
Waddell's wife.  They married in February of 1853.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n2">{2}</a>  Here Waddell probably referred to his stepmother.  
His mother died in the early 1850s and his father remarried.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n3">{3}</a>  "Aunt Sally" was Waddell's father's 
sister.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n4">{4}</a>  Waddell referred to his oldest sister, Cornelia, 
as "Sister."  Cornelia married Samuel D. Stuart, called "Mr. Stuart" in 
the diary.  They had several children:  Kate, Mary, Addison Waddell, 
Cornelia ("Corny"), Sam, Roberta, and Lelia.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n5">{5}</a>  Legh Richmond Waddell was Joseph Waddell's younger 
brother.  In the division of their father's estate, Legh inherited 
Joshua, a slave, and purchased the family farm.  In his <i>Home Scenes and Family Sketches</i> (Staunton, 
Virginia:  Stoneburner and Prufer, 1900), Waddell explained "On the 
division of the estate, Joshua fell to my brother Legh, who then lived 
on the Farm, Moses to me, and Stephen to my brother Alexander.  Joshua 
soon wandered off and set up for himself.  He is now living in the 
Pastures in a hale old age.  Stephen followed his example, and has long 
been practically free.  Moses has also been his own master, really, 
since he fell into my hands, as he was, indeed, long before.  The law 
would not permit him to remain in the State if formally manumitted, and 
several years ago I offered him his freedom if he chose to go away.  He 
took the offer into consideration, but finally declined it.  He is a 
slave only in name, and some of my waggish friends have started the 
question, Whether Moses belongs to me, or I to Moses!  Our relation 
with all of them is not only friendly, but affectionate" (53-53).  
Waddell added in a footnote:  "When the war ended and all the slaves 
were liberated, very little change was made in my relations with Moses.  
A year or two before the war began he came to me and proposed that I 
should enter into a contract to purchase a lot in town, where he could 
have his shoemaker's shop, assuring me that he would be able to pay for 
it, in the course of time.  The lot he said, would belong to me, a 
slave being legally incompetent to own property, but he could have the 
use of it as long as he lived.  I accordingly entered into a written 
agreement with the owner of the lot, binding myself to pay a hundred 
dollars down, and the same sum every year until the whole price was 
paid.  Moses furnished the money regularly, and at the close of the war 
only a small sum, comparatively, was left unpaid.  I then went his 
security for the remainder and had the property regularly conveyed to 
him.  The note executed by us was duly honored in Bank, and he is now 
in possession of property worth probably fifteen hundred dollars.  
After the foregoing note was written, Moses, being in declining health, 
requested me to write his will and act as his executor; and when he 
died I sold his property and distributed the proceeds to his wife and 
children, as the will directed."</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n6">{6}</a>  Catharine "Kate" S. Waddell was Waddell's younger 
sister.</p>

<p class="p10"><a name="n14">{14}</a>  Jimmy, Nancy, and Matty were the children of the 
widower William M. Tate.  Joseph and Virginia Waddell boarded with Tate 
from 1853 to 1857 when they purchased their own house in town with 
Joseph's sister, Kate.  Jimmy, Nanny, and Matty Tate became the 
Waddells "adopted children" as they never had their own.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n15">{15}</a>  Kitty Waddell was Joseph Waddell's niece.  Kate

<p class="p10"><a name="n23">{23}</a>  Wygand apparently encouraged the hopes of a 
German woman from Richmond.  According to Waddell's history of Augusta 
County, when the would-be lovers met for the first time, Wygand did not 
find the woman suitable.  Fulfilling her threat that "I makes you marry 
me," the woman filed a suit for breach of marriage.  See Waddell's 
account of the marital woes of Martin Wygand in <i>Annals of Augusta County</i>, pp.  446-
447.</p>
<p class="p10"><a name="n24">{24}</a>  The residents of Staunton did not see Wygand 
again.  Local gossips considered Wygand "little better than a lunatic" 
and figured that he had wandered off, perhaps to Winchester.  See 
Waddell's account of the Wygand's disappearance in <i>Annals of Augusta County</i>, pp.  446-
447.</p>

<p class="p10"><a name="n37">{37}</a>  Daniel Downey was the local Catholic priest.  On 
December 12, 1857, passersby found the body of William Mullins on the 
pavement outside of Downey's house on Augusta Street.  Apparently, 
Mullins had seduced Margaret Lee, Downey's housekeeper, and promised to 
marry her.  When Mullins repeatedly delayed marriage, either Downey 
summoned Mullins or Mullins confronted Downey at Downey's home on the 
night of December 12th.  According to Margaret's testimony in Downey's 
first trial for murder, Mullins took out a pistol and Downey ordered 
him to lay it down.  In the ensuing scuffle, Joseph Waddell believed 
that Mullins was accidentally shot.  The jury could not reach a verdict 
in the first trial in January 1858.  In the second trial, the jury 
found Downey guilty of murder in the second degree.  Waddell wrote 
about this verdict in his diary entry for November 24, 1858.  Judge 
Thompson set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial set for February 
1859.  As in the first trial, the jury could not agree.  Robert L. 
Doyle, the attorney representing Downey, requested bail.  The judge 
agreed to bail if Downey's health was failing from confinement in jail.  
Dr. Waddell, Downey's physician, could not make such a diagnosis, so 
Downey remained in jail.  The fourth and final trial took place in 
Charlottesville.  Joseph Waddell reported that the jury acquitted 
Downey with "public opinion generally approving."  (See Waddell, <i>Annals of Augusta County</i>, pp. 447-448; "Trial of 
Rev. Daniel Downey," <i>The Staunton 
Spectator</i>, 22 June 1858, p. 4, c. 1; "Trial of the Rev. Daniel

<p class="p10"><a name="n40">{40}</a>  William L. Goggin, of Bedford, was the 
Opposition candidate for governor against the Democratic John Letcher.  
Supporters of Goggin formed "Goggin Clubs" in several towns in 
Virginia.  In Staunton, David S. Young served as President of the 
Goggin Club, Joseph Addison Waddell as Vice President, William Grey as 
Secretary, and James Bumgardner as Treasurer.  (See "Goggin Club," 
<i>The Staunton Spectator</i>, 10 May 1859, p. 2, 
c. 1.)  Goggin won Augusta County with 2,170 votes over Letcher's 
1,402, but lost Virginia as a whole.  (See "The Gubernatorial 
Election," <i>The Republican Vindicator</i>, 22 
July 1859, p. 1, c. 6.)</p>

<p class="p10"><a name="n71">{71}</a>  Anne, Duke of Montmorency, served France during 
an invasion by Charles V, the Holy Roman emperor and king of Spain.  
Montmorency successfully withstood Charles's forces by strengthening 
his camp's fortifications and devastating Provence.  Robertson wrote 
"The fortifications of such places as might have afforded shelter or 
defence to the enemy, were thrown down.  Corn, forage, and provisions 
of every kind, were carried away or destroyed; all the mills and ovens 
were ruined, and the wells filled up or rendered useless."  He 
concluded that history "does not afford any instance among civilized 
nations, in which this cruel expedient for the public safety was 
employed with the same rigour."  See William 
Robertson, <i>The History of the reign of Emperor 
Charles V</i> (New York:  Harper &amp; Brothers, 1845), pp. 267-

in 216 B.C. during the Second Punic War one of their greatest defeats.
