<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Jan 24<sup>th</sup></p>
<p class="p10">Camp Pierpont </p>
<p class="p10">Dear John: </p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 21<sup>st</sup> came to hand last evening, and the
                    perusal of it afforded me much pleasure. It is now over a month since I
                        <i>[unclear: took]</i> sick; and, because during that time I have not been
                    able to answer many letters the folks have all quit writing. The papers you
                    send, come regularly and are <u>very acceptable</u>. Reading
                    is a most excellent means of passing the time, which drags heavily under
                    circumstances like the present.</p>
<p class="p10">I had <u>intended</u> going over to a farm house to<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>
                    stop a while; and it was the Dr's desire that I
                    should; but the weather has been so bad that I could not be moved out. Besides,
                    when I come to think of it now, it is perhaps best that I remain where I am. Did
                    I go I would have to pay three dollars per week for board -- buying out of my
                    own pocket such <u>extras</u> as I might need -- besides
                    paying some one to wait on me, -- and when all these things are taken into
                    consideration, it would fall too heavy on my pocket, especially as we have not
                    yet been paid off, notwithstanding reports in Pittsburgh papers to the contrary.</p>
<p class="p10">The report is that we will be paid off to-day, and I would like to send some
                    money to Mr. Smith <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> but don't know, until I <u>settle</u> up what I can do. The extras I have had to purchase will eat a
                    big hole in my amt. Wine $1 per bottle, Currant
                    jelly $1/2 per small glass, Lemons 5 cts each etc.
                    etc. These things are all prescribed by the Dr., and if I were in the Hospital
                    would get them without charge -- <u>if they had them</u>. And
                    the Dr. would send them down to my tent any way; but they are entirely out, and
                        dont know how soon their stock may be replenished;
                    as it is done principally by society contributions.</p>
<p class="p10">The Col. has been back for a day or two, but has not
                    sent me down any package; so I suppose he could not bring it. It is likely he
                    had his hands quite full.<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">I am still improveing. All I want now, is strength,
                    which returns slowly. My tent is very comfortable. We have a stove in it and can
                    always manage to keep warm &amp; dry.</p>
<p class="p10">Mrs. Col. Jackson, Mrs. Lt.
                    <i>[unclear: 
                        Walkenstam
                    ]</i>, &amp; Pierce, and Mrs. Capt
                    Brookban &amp; Fleming are all living in Camp
                    now. There is nothing new going on, that I hear of. My love to all the family.
                    Respects to all inquiring friends.</p>
