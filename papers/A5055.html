<p class="p10">My Dear Uncle, Aunt &amp; Grandma</p>
<p class="p10">I am again in camp, and feel pretty well. I started from Staunton on Sunday
                    morning. I got Dispatches for Genl Early and by
                    that means got transportation - I hope this may find you all well. No news of
                    any importance - had a little fight yesterday - <i>[unclear: Hunton]</i> Rubush
                    was killed (son of Peter Rubush) and about 25 wounded - we have a fight every
                    day <i>[illeg.]</i> - Enclosed you will find ($100) One Hundred Dollars which
                    you will pay to <i>[unclear: Wm J McKee]</i> and lift my <i>[unclear: Due]</i>
                    bill. I borrowed it from him the evening I was there for fear I wouldn't have
                    enough - attend to it at once and thank him for his kindness - give love to all
                    - I am</p>
<p class="p10">your Affectionate Nephew</p>
