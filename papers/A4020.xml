     <salute>My dearest One:</salute>
    </opener>

    <p>I thought I would only write to you briefly, as I am feeling rather dull tonight, but I wrote
     out my half sheet and had not told you anything about the living world, the fleeting daily
     shadows that come and go over the ever stormy sky that now covers our humanity. Our camp is
     still under the hill, by the side of the run, under the shade of the oaks, cedars and hollys,
     the noise of the camp in our rear, goes up every day the same, one picket marches out and
     another marches in, the Yankee camp fires send up piles of smoke away off on the Stafford
     Shore, we build our fires, eat our meals, read the papers, talk &amp; work in the most
     humdrum way imaginable, everything going as if wound up to run down &amp; then wound up
     again -- a dreary sort of <orig reg="existence">existance</orig>, a sort of trance after our
     perpetual motion, unending variety -- way of doing ever since last spring, with an occasional
     night mare rumor that promises to turn up some novelty, that vanishes when you turn over, or we
     turn the corner for the next days course over the old track I have not been away from my tent
     vicinity, but once to see the Gen. on some business, until day before yesterday, since I wrote
     to you, until day before yesterday when the Gen. sent for a copy of the Map of the Battle of
     Fredericksburg, complete as far as our wing was concerned to write his report by &amp; as I
     had not information enough for that I rode up to Gen. Stuarts <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd.
      Qrs.</abbr> to see his Engineer -- (he was away but stay I must &amp; wait for him so I
     chatted round Stuart's Staff of which he is the genuine soul, always full of life &amp;
     humor -- (he had gotten two sets of Hoops which he sent to his wife, who was at a house near
     by, and told the boy to tell her only one set was for her, he wanted the other for his
     sweet-heart -- and when the boy came back and reported that she said she would <hi
      rend="underline">see</hi> about the other set, he had a very hearty laugh -- Major Van Borcke,
     a Prussian on his staff is a fine looking intelligent German &amp; Stuart <pb n="2"/> jokes
     him every now &amp; then to see him blush -- he does it so charmingly. I spent the night
     with his Eng. Capt. Blackford, who came back late, after a visit to Fredericksburg, in which he
     had been picking up some of his uncle's books -- (By the way have my Intelligencers &amp;c
     gotten out of the garrett.) Yesterday Gen. Lee reviewed a Brigade of Cavalry, in the rain, the
     time had been set and he would not have it put off -- I did not go to see it, but as soon as I
     got what I went after started back &amp; had to come most of the way, 14 miles, in the dark
     &amp; part of the way by a mere path through ditched meadows, trusting solely to the
     instincts of my horse to find the way, which he did nobly, and I could but admire the wonderful
     genius, or whatever you call it, that unerringly picked out in the storm &amp; darkness,
     the right path among many similar ones, and brought me safely to our almost hidden quarters. I
     have been reading today, sermons, Bible &amp;c and was up in the Gen's room a short time.
     Our supplies hold out well and we "fare sumptuously every day", thanks to your providence --
     even Boswell's sausage still exists, with diminishing proportions <abbr expan="though"
     >tho</abbr>. I wish you would send out vests, if they are done, to Staunton, to the care of
     Capt. Garber, to be left at Maj Bell's -- mine &amp; Boswells, if they are done &amp;
     send me the expenses of his. I sent the buttons for mine, which I hope reached -- Tom Kinney
     has gotten back, cured -- . Gen. Jackson's <abbr expan="Head Quarters">Hd. Qrs.</abbr> gave the
     Fredericksburg people some 850 dollars -- Have Hamilton vaccinate the children if not already
     done, which I expect has been done already with your characteristic prudence &amp;
     foresight -- I have a splendid map of the battlefield which I should like to send home, but
     Gen. Lee will not let us send any more of them away -- for we may fight there again -- . I hope
     Allen is a good boy, -- I will remember my promise to him about a farm in the spring if he
     attends well to his duties now &amp; does as you desire -- I hope my little daughter Nelly
     is learning well these long winter evenings -- and little Anna is growing &amp; being good
     -- &amp; that they both are very kind &amp; obedient to their Mother --. I sent for the
     Examiner &amp; hope it has come -- I asked Mr. Stover to save the missing <abbr
      expan="Numbers">Nos</abbr>. if no trouble to get them -- until very soon -- &amp; may our
     God be with you all is the daily prayer of your husband </p>
