<p class="p10">I received your letter dated August the 27th last eavening. it put
     me out of sorts to heare that you have not heard or got no letter since
     i hav
     bin in this camp. i have ritten some 7
     letters to you since the first day of august. i think it long between your letters. i have
     received some 3 or 4 that was dated in august from you. i cant tell
     why mine dont go to you. it haint because i
      dont start them but i trust that they will come to hand yet. it must
     be the falt of the mail some whare or how i
      dont
     no which. if the paret is with calf and her is not it may be that it
     would be best to beef her tho i leave that with you to judge. it will
     suit me the way you think or doo best. you want to no what i think of the war. i think it is a hard war but i dont think that it can last a great while longer tho it may
     last longer than i think. they is a good deal of confusion amongst
     some of the soaldiers in some of the brigades. it is moastly of the noth
     carolineans. some virginians they say that the South is whiped but i don't think that and i don't think that the yankeys will ever subjugate the south by fiting. for my part i can't say how long it will last but i still hoap and trust god will soon see fit to put a stop to this horabel war. we have had a great revival of religion in our brigade and still a going
     on yet. Many have professed [part of the letter is gone here]<br> I must come to close by
     informing you that i am well and i hoap and trust to god that this will
     find you and all of the family injoying the same blessing of health
     which God has bin so kind to bless me with.</p>
