                    >Jany</abbr> 29th 1866 I have the honor to submit the following "Report" showing
                    the condition of "Freedmens affairs at this date in the above named Division.</p>

                <p>Nothing has occurred during the "Month" which is calculated to change the
                    opinions hitherto expressed as to the capacity of the colored race in the matter
                    of becoming a thrifty self-supporting population. Occaisionally <pb n="2"/>I
                        <orig reg="met">meet</orig> with one who seems disposed to remain poverty
                    stricken by declining to take advantage of opportunities by which employment
                        <orig reg="etc.">&amp;c</orig> might be secured but with these
                    exceptions the race as a race are evidently advancing in intelligence and
                    industry - and <hi rend="underline">I</hi> am convinced they would show more
                        <unclear>earnestness</unclear> in embracing education &amp; other
                    advantages if any substantial encouragement was given them by the whites. I
                    believe that the feeling of distrust cherished by them toward the white people
                    which was engendered by the disposition betrayed (immediately after the war
                    closed) to not allow them any of the rights &amp; privileges of the citizen,
                    has been strengthened by the indifferent and <unclear>careless</unclear> manner
                    in which the interests of the freedpeople are handled in the Courts and by the
                    whites generally. I am not prepared to <pb n="3"/>produce any particular
                    instances wherein the aforementioned facts can be established but my conclusions
                    have been arrived at after close observation of the workings of public
                    sentiment.</p>

                <p>The crops have so far as a general thing turned out better than was generally
                    expected thus demonstrating the fact that the farming interests have not been
                    injured by the change in the larbor system and if all of the employers would
                    deal justly and honorably with the laborers many of the evils of which they
                    complain would be lost sight of entirely but when they impose all kinds of
                    charges <orig reg="etc.">&amp;c</orig> upon the laborers reducing the
                    balance due to almost nothing and frequently bringing the latter in debt they
                    must expect that dissatisfaction would grow out of such <pb n="4"/>injustice and
                    it becomes very reasonable when it is <unclear>remembered</unclear> that by
                    reason of the ignorance of the laborer in connection with his suspicion of the
                    white man the nature and details of business transactions cannot be explained to
                    him in many cases.</p>

                <p>Intemperance does not seem to be increasing to any marked extent among the
                    colored people.</p>

                <p>The Schools have been closed during the summer months but it is expected will
                    open in few days with much larger numbers than ever.</p>
