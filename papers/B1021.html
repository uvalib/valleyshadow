<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Orlando Brown, February 29, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson's report to Brown describes the ongoing problems with contract
                    negotiations, relief efforts, the rise in drinking, and the political views of
                    whites and blacks in Augusta County.</p>

<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Circular Order No. 6 S. 1866 B.R.F.&amp;A.L. I have the honor to forward the following report of
                    condition of Bureau Affairs in this 4<sup>th</sup>
                    Div. of 9<sup>th</sup>

                    comprizing the counties of Augusta and Highland.
                    This office is still visited by many Freedmen asking assistance in making
                    settlements or seeking redress for grievances. Most of the crop accounts of 1864
                    are now adjusted and the unsettled claims for wages are generally against men
                    who cannot pay and where no written contract exists. Contracts to labor for the
                    year are not so common as could be wished. Two reasons for this are assigned by
                    freedmen. Some say their employers will not make contracts for the year as they
                    intend to discharge them if they do not vote to suit them but most say they can
                    do much better when their agreements are by the month as they can have monthly
                    settlements and know how they stand. <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>I encourage written contracts by
                    the year as much as possible because my experience shows men so employed prove
                    best off at the end of the year, provided they refuse to open store accounts
                    with their employers. The great drawback to Freedmen not employed by the year,
                    is the outrageous rents demanded for Tenements in which to live. <u>As a class</u> freedmen here are not making much progress
                    in material prosperity, the long hard winter eats up the surplus earnings of the
                    harvest season and the sick &amp; widowed and deserted women experience much
                    suffering. The distribution of clothing at this office has done much good,
                    enabling many to go out to labor who otherwise from want of clothing would have
                    been prevented. The corporation and county officers relieve such cases of
                    distress, as have been presented, and no complaints can now be made, except
                    perhaps about the regulations in some county districts, which disallow out <i>[deleted: ]</i> relief and present to the poor only the option of poorhouse or
                    nothing. This month there has been less than usual number of complaints by
                    freedmen of ill usage at the hands of white citizens.</p>
<p class="p10">Little is now said on political questions it appears <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>to be conceded
                    useless to "fish" for the colored vote with the "base hook," and not worth while
                    to offer anything, as the conservatives are confident they will reject the
                    Constitution whatever it may be, either by remaining at home on election day, or
                    dragging every white man to the polls to vote it down. The freedmen are uneasy
                    but hopeful, and will generally cast their votes, but not near so unanimously as
                    at the last election a large proportion of the white men will stay at home
                    anyway.</p>
<p class="p10">No prospect has been made in organizing Temperance organizations in this Division
                    and I regret that since the distillers here have resumed operations whiskey
                    drinking has become too common among freedmen in country districts where it can
                    be procurred from the still houses.</p>
