<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Roswell Waldo to Orlando
                    Brown, November 30, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Waldo writes about the poverty in his district and the Bureau's lack of supplies
                    with which to alleviate it. He also comments on the difficulty in opening
                    schools due to lack of funds.</p>

<p class="p10">November 30 1868.</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton, Va.,</p>
<p class="p10">General</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Circular No VI - dated Head
                    Quarters, Asst Commissioner Richmond Va
                    Jan'y 29, 1866 I have the honor to submit the
                    following Report of Bureau Affairs in 4th Division (Comprising Highland and
                    Augusta Counties) 9th Sub District Virginia viz:</p>
<p class="p10">Nothing has transpired during the present month calculated in any way to change
                    the tenor or my last report. The main difficulties under which the freedmen
                    labor are just and proper settlement of their accounts with their employers, yet
                    through the aid and instrumentality of this office many complaints of this
                    character have been fairly adjusted. On account of the disposition manifested
                    toward the colored population even while the latter were under the protection of
                    the Bureau, I fear that its withdrawal, at this time <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>will have a very
                    damaging effect upon the interests of the colored community.</p>
<p class="p10">Some suffering <i>[unclear: evidently]</i> exists among a class of this
                    population chiefly I think among women and children for want of the necessary
                    clothing for winter wear. They wages in this locality are small, not averaging
                    over $4 or $5<sup>
                        <u>00</u>
                    </sup> per month for females, and it requires all they can possibly earn to buy
                    provisions and pay house rent which is exorbitant <i>[unclear: without]</i>
                    parallel, Consequently nothing remains with which to provide for their warmth
                    and comfort. Applications to this office, by females especially, have been
                    numerous during the present month, but as all articles suitable for this class
                    of applicants had been previously issued it was impossible to alleviate the
                    suffering so plainly demonstrated. The Aged and indigent are also in some
                    distress for want of proper care and provision in this respect. The County of
                    Augusta has made provision for its paupers, but there seems to be a great
                    disinclination to aid any except they become inmates of the Institution provided
                    for this class of persons. -- (With the exceptions above enumerated the
                    freedpeople seem to be doing as well and are as prosperous as could be
                    expected.)</p>
<p class="p10">The school at Staunton, opened on the 23rd inst under the auspices of the
                    American Missionary Association, and taught by Mr. Jno
                    Scotts At this time there is every prospect of a large and increased attendance
                    over any previous term and I have no reason to doubt that a successful and
                    profitable session will ensue. The only drawback now apparent is the want of a
                    suitably and properly arranged and ventilated School room. The one now in use is
                    the basement of the ME Church (colored)
                    which in my opinion is inadequate and in almost every respect unsuitable for
                    school purposes at this place. It is found necessary, for the accommodation of
                    that class of colored persons who are obliged to labor during the day, to carry
                    on a night school - at least four evenings in the week, but by present
                    indications I fear trouble in procuring the use of this basement even for this
                    purpose, as the Church authorities require its use for religious meetings nearly
                    every evening.</p>
<p class="p10">The Schools in other localities are very backward, for want of proper pecuniary
                    support of the community. The one heretofore in operation at Arbor Hill Augusta
                    County, the teacher was forced to close for the season on the 31st ultimo.</p>
<p class="p10">The school at Waynesboro will probably open sometime during the coming month The
                    slow progress made in finishing the school building and the inability to procure
                    a suitable teacher soon has caused this delay.</p>
<p class="p10">Intemperance does not seem to be increasing in this locality to any marked extent
                    among the freedmen, and so long as the white population does not set them an
                    example, I have no doubt very little can be accomplished toward overcoming this
                    Evil.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respectfully<br>Your obedient servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Roswell Waldo<br>A.S.A. Com<sup>r</sup></i></p>
