<h4>Franklin County: Diary of Abraham Essick (1849-1864; 1883; 1888)<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>About Abraham Essick:<br></b>Abraham Essick was a native of Franklin County, Pennsylvania, who left   
that area to become a Lutheran minister in the 1840s.  His diary begins when he   
received his license to preach in 1849.  It continues through the 1850s,   
when Essick preached before congregations in York, Pennsylvania,   
Springfield, Ohio, Lutherville, Maryland, and Lancaster County,   
Pennsylvania.  Of special interest is his account of his time in   
Winchester, Virginia, where he also preached, and where he took note of  
differences between Virginia and Pennsylvania.  Essick returned to   
Franklin County in 1861, where he preached for the duration of the war.</p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Received license to preach the gospel October 1, 1849 from the Synod of  
Western Pa.. Rev. Prof. U.L. [Laesto], Pres. I. Ulrich, Secy. Rev. I.G. Morris D.D. of  
Baltimore, Md., preached the license sermon in the En. [Litt.] church  occupied by the Rev.  
Oswald.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 14</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Preached in U. [Medekind's] Church by his request, in the morning at  
Greenvillage, Franklin Co., Pa. and in the evening at Fayetteville. Text Jno 3:16 - same  
sermon at both places.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>October 20</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Came to York, Pa. for the purpose of taking charge of the Eng. Branch of the  
First Ev. Luth. Congregation in said place, having obtained (central?) permission to do so,  
from the Pres. of Synod my call to this place came before I had finished my studies at  
Gettysburg. During the summer I preached for these people several times, as a supply, the  
Rev. Jas. A. Brown their former pastor having resigned in May last. An election for pastor  
was held on the 11th of Sept. at which time my call states that I was unanimously elected.  
The call is dated Sept. 20, 1849 and signed by Geo. A. Barritz, Esq. David Rupert, E.G.  
Simpson, Wm. F. Shetten, John Busser, Benj. Zeigler, Theo. Albright, constituting the  
vestry.  Mr. Brown's resignation was occasioned by church difficulties, which are  
represented as being very great - it being his conviction that the present connection of the  
two branches cannot be retained in harmony. At present both branches occupy the same  
church alternately. It is in contemplation to build a new church for the Eng. Branch, and it  
was this principally which occasioned the difficulties. Many apprehensions are entertained  
concerning the result. Some of my friends dissuaded me from accepting the call, whilst  
others advised it.  They have no stipulated salary. My predecessor got four hundred dollars.   
Since his resignation a number of his friends have withdrawn and are scarcely expected to  
return. I know not what they shall be able to raise. I came here, I trust, under the guidance  
of divine Providence. The will of God is certainly correct and if I have not mistaken it, there  
can be no danger.</p></p>

and Bro. Good of the Ger. (obscured) sent him a supply, and I filled Bro. Good's pulpit. In  
the evening I preached in the Luth. Church from Matt. 20:6 "Why stand ye here all the day  
idle?" The sermon was addressed practically to the members of the Congregation, who  
supposing that I had referred to building a new church, applied much of it this way, though  
it was not so intended. It seems to have created a considerable  
stir.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>December 12</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">The afternoon of this day was spent in visiting the members of the  
congregation. The first person I called upon was a Mrs. Hays, whose husband and children  
belong to the espiscopal church. Last week they buried a son, a young man who died in Balt.  
The family are very much affected by the affliction. I met the mother and one daughter, and  
most of their conversation was about disease. The mother wept much, but seemed to indulge  
rather an [agreeable] melancholy. Her son had died a most triumphant death. After leaving  
this family I went to the  home of a Mr. Gallapher, whose wife and family belong to my  
congregation (the father is a catholic). This lady has evidently seen better days. I understand  
that her husband had been dissipated for years, but had recently been picked up the Sons of  
Temperance.  They live in an old house and are poor - although he is a lawyer by  
profession. I found the poor woman sitting in a chair, a sad picture of a heart-broken wife  
and mother. She is evidently also in the last stages of consumption. She told me that she had  
not been out of her bed so long for many days. My heart was grieved at the sight. I  
conversed with her, read a chapeter, and prayed for her and then left. - The next place I  
entered by mistake, though I found upon inquiry that part of the family belong to the German  
brach of the church. Here I found a widowed daughter and the mother of the family dying  
with the consumption. Her mother's name is Bupp and hers [Hovllen]. I was told that she  
has kept her bed for eighteen months and at time coughs herself into most painful  
convulsions. I came away with a sick heart. I made a number of other visits but encountered  
nothing special.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>February 1</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Today the funeral of Mrs. Sichelhager, an elderly lady belonging to the Ger.  
branch took place at two o'clock. Bro. Lochman did the funeral services. On my return I  
dropped in the see an invalid gentleman who has passed the meridian of life and whose limbs  
(his legs only) have been almost totally paralyzed for something over seventeen years. In the  
course of conversation, in which the death of a daughter was the subject, the wife of the  
gentleman said that their only sonsolation was the happy assurance which she had of her  
confidence in the savior; she then added that this was a subject of great distress to the Mr S--  
-- her husband. "he thinks that his soul is lost." I was glad to have the opportunity of  
directing such a one to the Savior. He said he had at one time when he first entered the  
church, experienced a sense of pardon: but now it seemed impossible for him to come to  
Christ. I tried to remove his difficulties and presented the promises of the gospel, the  
Savior's willingness to accept the chief of sinners, and the great sin of unbelief. He must  
trust the savior, comee just as he is, willing to do what he can, but not to rest confidence in  
any thing that he does - in short, to  leave all to God as though he himself had done nothing.  
I then read a chapter of S. and engaged in prayer during which boht he and his wife were  
much affected. I then left them after giving additional encouragement  
ot trust the savior.</p><p class="p10">Friday - lectured for the latter part of the fifth Chapter  
of Heb.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Feb. 2</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">After breakfast I took James' "(obscured) Inquirer" from my library and called  
upon Mr. S ---- whom I left in deep distress of mind yesterday. He seemed much more calm.  
He said he felt that the savior was willing to save him also. I said, "certainly he is." and  
then  spoke of Paul's having made hovoc of the church and yet was (obscured) and made a  
vessel of mercy. He said of that sin he was never guildty. He had always helped to support  
the church but said he with deep emothin "My heart has been so much in the world. I know  
its vanity. Many of the old men of my acquaintance left large estates and now their sons are  
poor. They took nothing with them, and what was left behind proved a curse to their  
children. He said much more in the same strain. I left the book and some counsel with him  
and returned to my study. Indulging my own reflections upon what I had seen and heard, -   
here, thought I, is the true issue of a life spent in hoarding riches. This man is wealthy - his  
heart, according to his own acknowledgment, was in the world. Now he feels the vanity of  
all, and sees also the  curse which  fathers have thus frequently brought  upon the children,  
who they tried to leave in affluence. This also is vanity!</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Feb 3.</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Sabbath. Preached a sermon on missions in the morning from 16:15 of Mark.  
"And he said unto them. Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature"  
Attended Sunday school and examined the children at 1 o'clock - attended a meeting of the  
[Colporter] association in the  German Reformed Church at 3 o'clock, and made a short  
address - preached in the evening from Luke 24:25 "Then open he their understanding that  
they might understand the scriptures."</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Feb 4</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">As usual I feel very little disposition for mental exertion after the labor of the  
Sabbath. Spent the morning in my study and tried to entertain myself by looking over the  
church book, making a list of families which I am expected to visit, reading the papers, etc.  
After dinner I called to see a sick woman, and found her in a very low state. Her mind was  
deeply exercised about her soul, but she was not permitted to have a comportable peace of  
mind in view of death. She had been conversed with some persons who call themselves  
Albrights, and was taught to expect something extraordinary, some wonderful light,  
something that would impel her to shout and clap.  Thus was this poor soul prevented from  
trusting the Savior because she did not experience such a state of mind. She was barely able  
to speak in a low whisper and yet she talked much and made many inquiries and revealed her  
mind to me. I told her that she must make no condition for the Savior, but simply give  
herself to him and leave the whole event in his hands. She held my hand and did not let me  
go for an hour. She regretted her past life, though she had been a church member from an  
early age: but she said she had been so cold and so un[obscured]. After praying with her,  
and telling of the precious promises of the gospel, I left. I spent the whole afternoon in  
visiting the members of the congregation.</p><p class="p10">At half past six o'clock we had our missionary concert in the lecture room of  
the Prebyterian  church. After meeting I called upon Mrs. T----, the sick woman. She said  
she felt much more comfortably in her mind since I had left her - she was willing to trust the  
Savior. Oh, I felt that it was a delightful task to direct the penitant sinner to Christ. What a  
precious Savior we have! That after a whole life of disobedience he is willing to receive the  
returning sinner!</p><p class="p10">After leaving my patient I stopped in to spend a few moments with a neighbor,  
and found there a "sociable," a small party of young ladies and gentlement, their  
comversation was lively and trifling. The transition was too great from the chamber of the  
dying to the house of mirth. I felt miserable - I said in my heart "It is better to go to the  
house of mourning than to the house of laughter." In a very few minutes I took my departure  
and was glad to be alone.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Feb 5</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Spent the morning preparing an address for the next monthly concert for  
sabbath school teachers. After dinner I called upon my patient Mrs. T---. She said that her  
heart was so light and peaceful after my departure last evening, but that it was heavy and full  
of doubts this morning. I found that she was clinging to some erroneous notions on the  
evidences of regeneration. She said that she cared nothing for the world, her shame which  
she felt in speaking about religion had been taken away, she loved the Savior and saw that  
his compassion towards her was wonderful. But she did not seem to ask herself how this  
change of feeling and views were brought about. I told her this was evidence that the Savior  
had accepted her, for he had sent his spirit to change her heart. She clasped her hands and  
said with her weak, tremulous voice "here Lord, I give myself away, tis all that I can do." I  
conversed nearly an hour with her in the most familiar way, which she freely revealed her  
whole heart, I felt that it was a delightful privilege to be with one who seems so near  
heaven. I know not what may be the Lord's pleasure with this soul: but it appears that she  
cannot stay long in this world.</p><p class="p10">I spent the whole afternoon in visiting the members, with evening I attended the  
sewing society, but nearly all the ladies had gone to see an exhibition of canary birds. After  
leaving the sewing society, I had a conversation with one of the church members, who has  
been engaged for several days in getting subscriptions to build a new church. he found nearly  
all willing to do according to their ability, which they generally imagine to be very little.  
Returned to my study at eight o'clock.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Feb 6</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Spent the morning in my study - the afternoon at visiting, reserving only  
enough for myself that I might write a letter. In the evening I attended the Lochman's weekly  
lecture.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Feb 7</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Spent today in the same manner as yesterday. In the eveining I called upon two  
members of the building committee and found that very little is doing towards a new church.  
My heart has its focus and its hopes. A new new building seems indispensable to the  
prosperity of our branch and, as far (as?) I can [learn] a failure here will be fatal to the  
project of building up a Eng. congregation. I have used various endeavors to stimulate the

<p class="p11"><b>September 11</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This institution was chartered on the 7th day of March 1850. On the same day a  
meeting of the trustees was had and prof. Wm. M. Reynolds of Pa. College elected president  
of the institution. Prof. Reynolds was inaugurated on the evening of the 21st of May (as  
stated above). On the 22nd of May the Grammar school was opened and instruction given by  
J. A. Tressler, Esq and myself. Pres. Reynolds was engaged upon a agency for the benefit of  
the institution during this term. The number of the pupils connected with the school during  
the summer was 61. The first term was closed on the 26th of July, two weeks earlier than  
was contemplated, on account of the presence of cholera in the city.</p><p class="p10">Immediately after the close of the school we left the city. Pres. Reynolds went  
in company with the Rev. Passerant of Pittsburg, Pa., to visit a colony of Swedes and  
Norwegians in the norther part of Illinois and Wisconsin. Mr. Tressler went to Williams Co.  
Ohio to visit his friends and I went to Starke Co. to spend the vacation with a [bro] and  
uncle who reside in the neighborhood of a small town near the line of Starke and Columbiana  
counties called New Franklin. On my way thither I passed through  Mt. Hermon, Wooster,  
Massillon and Canton. In Canton Bro. Riger, formerly a schoolmaster, having caught a  
glimpse of me in the coach, hastened to the hotel, when an exchange of horses was making,  
to meet me. He insisted on my stopping and preaching in his church on the following  
Sabbath. As I was impatient to see my friends, who live 15 miles east of this, I could not be  
induced to tarry, but promised to return and preach in two weeks. During my stay in this  
section I preached twice in New Franklin, by request of Bro. Guenther, pastor in the place,  
three times at Canton by request of Bro. Tiger, and twice in Paris by request of father  
Melsheimer. I became acquainted with Bro. Fast, who lives in Canton, has a book store, and  
preaches to farm congregations in the surrounding country. Father Melsheimer serves seven  
congregations, one of which (Ger.) is in Canton, where he also lives. He wishes to resign  
three of them (Canton, [obscured] and Paris) and asked me to recommend a suitable pastor,  
upon which I wrote to Mr. Roedel, a student now at Gettysburg, who graduates this fall.  
Bro. Riger serves the Eng. Congregation in Canton, which numbers about 70 communicants.  
Father Melsheimer preaches no English, although it is very much needed. Two of these  
brethren (Melsheimer and Fast) belong to the Eastern district Synod of Ohio, and in  
accordance with a [obscured] of said body at their last meeting a year ago are about adopting  
the gown, which is a new thing in this country, excepting only with the Episcopalians. Bro.  
Rigere belongs to the Miami Synod, but intends to connect with the English band of the  
"Joint Synod." Bro. Guenther is in connection with the Eng. Synod of Ohio (not in  
connection with the joint synod). He is an old gentleman, without much education, or ability,  
and yet the author of a work on Baptism, which I was sorry to find had involved the  
pecuniary affairs of the author and publisher, without any credit to himself or benefit to the  
church. What a strange infatuation seizes upon some men! The poor old man has a la rge  
family, lives in a log cabin without an inch of carpet on the floor, with barely enough to eat  
and hide their nakedness. His congregations (two, formerly four) have dwindled  away under  
the influence of ultra "new measures" and now barely raised a salary of two hundred dollars.  
In this state of things he has been obliged to commence teaching a common school for a  
living.</p><p class="p10">During my travels I met with a great deal of infidelity and skepticism. Much of  
which is doubtless due to a want of the proper kind of preaching. Much of the ministry in  
this portion of the Church is poorly qualified to meet and counteract heresy. Upon the whole  
I am much impressed with the impoprtance of educating men for the  
work.</p></p>

principally in the care of Mr. Tressler and myself. Having received the second [mo] of the  
second vol. of the Evangelical Review this evening, I read the first Art. by Dr. Schmucker  
on "Church Development." Many of his remarks are good and timely; some of them will not  
be well received in the Church. Having preached yesterday I have had the feelings common  
to one on Monday after performing divine services.</p></p>

is a branch of the "Joint Synod" of Ohio, was composed of ten members, but received an  
increase of four (including myself) at this meeting. Synod expressed itself favorably toward  
our institution at Colubus. Among the more important buisness transacted was the  
appointment of a committee to process a good Eng. translation of the Augsburg Conf., the  
Apology, the [obscured] Articles, Catechisms of Luther and Formula Concordia.</p><p class="p10">After my return to Columbus, we formed a sophomore class consisting of two

with Br. Albrecht of Thronville, Somerset Co. has taken ana agency in behalf of our  
institution, and I have promised to fill his pulpit in English and Bro Lehman's in the city,  
whilst Bro Lehman fills it in German. Consequently I am again to preach every Sabbath

by the "Old Lutherans" of the Ohio Synod. This Synod has never formed a connection  with  
the General Synod of the Lutheran Church, which the Ohio brethren do not regard as  
orthodox in the faith. An attempt was made by Dr. Reynolds to bring about a more friendly  
state of feeling between the two bodies with the view of ultimately inducing the Ohio Synod  
to become united with the Gen. Synod. This attempt failed and rendered Dr. Reynolds  
unpopular with many who had been friends of the College. Difficulties began to increase,  
and at length finding it impossible to conduct the college on such principles as we desired,  
we though it best to resign and allow those who differed from us to have their own way

undertake too mcuh. The stores in town were nearly all closed, and business  generall

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Thursday. Returned from Reading to Allentown in a stage coach. Owing to the  
recent heavy rains the roads were bad, but this inconvenience was atoned for by the  
delightful scenery that surrounded us on all sides. This is one of the richest and best  
improved agricultural districts through I have ever travelled. The farms are usually not much  
over one hundred acres in size, and in the finest state of cultivation. Although the present  
spring is unusually backward in growing crops present in promising appearance. The  
luxurient growth of wheat, the green and [rank] meadows the gently sloping hills with spring  
bubbling from their sides, the creeks and revilets winding along the valleys, and the blue  
mountains on either side in the distance make this a most charming country for the traveller.  
The people are almost  exclusively German, that is Pennsylvanians of German descent.  
Scarcely any English is spoken in this valley. At Reading English is gaining ascendancy. At  
Allentown German is spoken chiefly. In Reading there  are three  Lutheran Congregations  
the largest one of which is to a great extent  German and is served by the REv. Jno N.  
Koffman in boht languages. The next largest, which is a colony of the former, is served by  
Rev. R.A. Muhlenberg Keller in the English the third by Rev. J.A. Brown also in English.  
In Allentown ther are two Lutheran churches. The first and by far the most numerous is  
served by Rev. A T. Gessenhaimer in German. He has recently taken charge, and has not  
yet removed his family from his former residence in Trenton, N.J. The English congregation  
is small, numbering less than 100 members, and is served by Rev. B.M. Schmucker. Both of  
these congregations have recently built very fine churches.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Sabbath. Preached in the morning in the  Reb. B.M. Schmucker's church and  
heard him preach in the evening. May 26-7 visited the coal mines near Mauch Chunk Here  
there is much to be seen. The county is mountainous and the scenery exceedingly  
picturesque. The  operations in coal mining are [numerous]. THe Lehigh Coal Company are  
the chief proprietors. When in full operation they send away about three thousand tons of   
coal per day, chiefly on the Lehigh Canal. On my return I stopped at a palced called  
Slatington, where there are a few houses, and extensive slate quarries. Immense numbers of  
tiles for roofing are made here, and sent to various parts of the country. The manufacture of  
slates for school purposes, of various sizes, is also carried on extensively. But the most  
interesting part of the slate business is a new process of giving to the slate stone a marble  
color and polish. I have learned that this art has been understood for years in England, but  
not until recenlty has it been introduced into this country, first in the neighborhood of Boston  
and since then in the state of  New York. It is not much more than a year past since it has  
been commenced in Pennsylvania. They manufacture of the slate stone into mantels, tables,  
etc. which are quite equal in color and polish to any marble and all said to be superior in  
durability. This will doubtless in a few years become a very extensive  
business.</p></p>

Sadtler with their wives. We had a very agreeable clerical party. Mrs. Reynolds and my wife  
returned to Allentown in the evening and I remained for the purposes of spending the sabbath

the purpose of taking me with him to his house. He lives two miles from Easton, across the  
Delaware, in the State of New Jersey. He has a large adn interesting congregatiotn,  
consisting chiefly of farmers. I preached for his people on Sabbath morning. Bro. Plitt  
preached at Bloomsburg [obscured] school house in afternoon to which service I accompanied  
him. He went with me into Easton in the evening, were I preached for Bro Greenwald's  
congregation. Easton is a pleasant and flourishing town of about ten thousand inhabitants.  
The Lutheran Churches are the most influential in the  place. The congregation of Bro.  
Sadtler (Eng and German)  is very large numbering some seven or eight hundred. He speaks  
of sending out on colony. Brother Greenwald's is  not nearly so large, but embraces the most  
influential families of the place. I returned to Allentown on

abundant in this region. Farming seems to be much better done in Maryland and Pa. than in  
Virginia. At Hagerstown I remained over night putting up at the Washington Hotel. Called  
and spent part of the evening with the Rev. C.C. Braughman at the Female Seminary. The  
school seems to be in a prosperous condition considering all the circumstances: but is still  
embarrassed in consequence of the bad management of its pecuniary affairs in the beginning.  
The building was put up from the proceeds of the sale of scholarships - then  scholarships  
now give them pupils without a sufficient income to support the school.</p><p class="p10">On Wednesday I took the coach for Greencastle from which place I proceeded  
in a private vehicle to convey me to Bro Adam's, arriving there about 4 o'clock. I spent  
Thursday, Friday and Sataurday visiting my brothers and sisters in the neighborhood, having  
no spare time for seeing my numerous other relations and acquaintances in this [obscured]  
old neighborhood. This was my first visit home since the death of my father. The pleasure of  
recalling the scenes of my childhood, was saddened by the felt want of those who were my  
all in the days of childhood. They lie side by side in the graveyard of Grindstone Hill   
Church. I stood by their graves and felt how hard it is to lose a  
kind father and mother. </p><p class="p10">On Sabbath (the 13th) I preached in the Grindstone Hill Church. Here I heard  
my first sermon not in this same church, but in the old log house that stood near the spot.  
This old log house was one of the first churches in all this country, having been build about  
the time of the revolutionary war. I recollect very distincly when the cornerstone of the new  
church was laid in 1832. Then I was ten years old, and a pupil in the Sabbath School. It was  
built con jointly by the Lutherans and German Ref. The logs of the old church were sold to  
the [United] Brethren who removed them about two miles (To Saml Fetherhuff's) and built  
what was called "The Chapel." In passing this place during the present visitn I perceived that  
a new brick chaped had taken place of the old.</p><p class="p10">Throughout all the neighborhood I saw great changes, not only in the people,  
but more still in the general apperance of the country. New houses have been erected in  
places of the old, and farms have been divided and many houses built where none stood  
before.</p><p class="p10">On Monday (14th) Adam took me in his carriage to Gettysburg. My object in  
this visit was to attend the annual commencement of Pa. College. Here I had the pleasure of  
meeting a large number of my classmates and schoolmates in College. The exercises wer  
continued three days (Tues thru Thurs) were varied and all interesting. A class of 16  
graduated from the College - o nly two from the Seminary. I  returned to Winchester by way  
of Balt - spending the night (Friday) in Balt and  
reaching home on Saturday.   
</p><p class="p10">I forgot to mention in connection into my visitn to Franklin Co that I sold my  
interest in the farm to my brother in law. Mr Slaughenhaupt. He is buying out  all the heirs  
at teh rate of $60 per acre. The farms consists of 123 acres and a few [parcels].  This is the  
only real estate my father ever owned. This he paid for by his own industry and brought up  
on it a family of twelve (one died at the age of four years) children, giving them all an  
education equal to any his neighbor's children and the best which the neighborhood afforded.  
But when this is said it implies only a common school education. Only two of the sons  
(Hiram and myself) studied professions and the expense of these were borne ourselves. We  
made the money chiefly while engaged at study. What we got from home was charged to our  
account. I got, in all, but 283 dollars. Hiram got a trifle more. We could not compleain of  
being charged for this as we had shared equally with the other children in  this education  
which we got before leaving home. I received the loan of $100 without interest from the  
Grindstone Hill congregation, which I refunded fromthe proceeds of my father's setate. The  
rest of my college expenses I made up teachisng and colporting, etc.</p></p>

sufficient to accommodate about three hundred persons. In this chapel I preach to them  
regularly every sabbath morning. In the evening immediately after worship I have a Bible  
class consisting of the pupils of the institution, and held in the study Hall. In connection with  
this exercise I ask them questions in regard to the sermon which they heard in the morning. I  
have been plpeased to find that many of them are able to repeat the text and give the leading  
divisions of the discourse. In Bible class we are occupied with the sets of the Apostles at

<p class="p11"><b>Feb 7</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Luke 13.24</p><p class="p10">I continued in charge of Lutherville Seminary until the close of the session July  
29, 1859. At this time I graduated a class of nine young ladies. The commencement  
exercises were largely attended, and it was evident that they gave general satisfaction. My  
connection this institution was among the most unpleasant  experiences of my life. I was  
induced to take the position partly be the fact that preaching had an unfavorable effect upon  
my health, and partly by the promise that I should have the entire control of the sschool My  
experience in teaching had given me assurance to hope that I could make this school popular  
and efficient, while I expected to make myself and family comfortable. But soon found that  
its affairs were so arranged and complicated that my hopes could be  realized neigther in  
regard to the school nor my family. My self and wife, with three childre, were confined to a  
single room, and, though other rooms could have been vacated I was n ot at liberty to make  
the arrangment. The school was managed by a committee resident in Baltimore, none of  
whom had ever been a practical teacher. The story of our difficulties is long, and vexatious.  
Yet the shcool seemed to prosper, and when the session closed there were fifty seven pupils  
in attendance, nearly all of whom were boarders. I was succeeded by Mr. Creery, formerly a  
teacher in the boys' high school of Baltimore. The  school experienced a falling off during  
the succeeding year, there being only about twenty four in attendance. I inquired around for  
a situation,a nd was finally induced to open a school in Hanover, Pa. This is a German  
community, strongly Lutheran, and disposed to educate. I made arrangements to purchase  
property, hoping to be able to pay for it (if the money could not be realized from the school)  
by using  some portion of my wife's patrimony, which is real estate in Pittsburg. The school  
opened under favorable auspices. I had two female assistant. Mrs. C. C. French, and her  
sister Miss Mary E. Hauer, daughters of Rev. D. Hauer of Manchester, Md. I felt deeply  
interested and greatly encouraged in my undertaking until my plans were all deranged, my  
energy paralyzed, and my hopes blasted by the death of my dear wife. This sad calamity  
made it next to impossible to carry on a boarding school, as my plan contemplated, while her  
death left only a life estate in her property without  the poewr to sell or appropriate any of it.  
THe consequence was that I was obliged to throw up my purchase, and sell out my furniture  
and school fixtures, losing about five hundred dollars in the operation. Truly I am in deep  
waters! Left wtih my motherless children, without a home and deeply in debt, there is a sore  
vurden pressing upon me. The say "Every cloud has a silver living." I try to believe it, and  
hope to be able to see through the gloom, but at present I view the darkness only.</p><p class="p10">This entry was made subsequently to my removal from Hanover, and intended  
to fill up a gap which would have broken the connection in the

dear Elizabeth. She died at half past five o'clock in the morning, having given birth to our  
fourth child in the very moment of her death. My heart is completely overwhelmed with  
grief - the shock was so great - the death so sudden - we were not at all prepared for it. She  
spent the previous evening with us as usual, preparing the children's clothes, which she was  
anxious to have ready before her confinement. About ten o'clock we retired adn both fell  
asleep. In about an hour she swoke in a fright and was immediately taken with a chill,  
succeeded by colic pains and vomiting. She suffered in this way for about four hours when  
she became unconscious, and was soon afterward thrown into spasms. After the spasms  
ceased she gently breathed her last, apparently without any suffering.</p></p>

Mrs. Anna M. Reynolds:<br>  
  
My Dearest Sister:<br>  
</p><p class="p10">I have just returned from Gettysburg, and found your letter on my desk. I read  
it with a sorrowful heart, as I have read all the letter received from my friends since the  
death of my dear Elizabeth. I have no words to convey the utter desolation of my heart at  
this lone hour of night, as I have  just put our dear little John into the bed where his mother  
slept and died and seated myself in our chamber wtih all its furniture, just as she l eft it,  
every article recalling the memory of her sweet presence, and then leaving me to the sad  
consciousness that her presence will never cheer me again in this world. Anna and little  
Walter remained with their grandma at Gettysburg, where they intend spending several  
weeks. Poor, dear little pets! It is a mercy of that they cannot appreciate the extent of their  
loss. John and Anna talk a great deal about their Mamma, and by their entire belief in all  
that I tell them of heaven and the employment of their sainted mother and the little babes she  
has with her, reproach me for my want of faith. "Of such is the kingdom." I never realized  
the meaning of this saying until now. Children have more faith than we have, for they have  
never learned to doubt. I first tuaght John that his Mamma was happier than we, when I  
could not realize the truth of what I was teaching. He believed  it without a shadow of doubt,  
and now consoles me, whenever he sees my distress by saying "It is better - Ma is happier  
than we - she is with the angels and little Willie - and we will see her when God takes us to   
heaven." Annal often says "Has has a golden harp and a crown on her head." There are  
delightful thoughts in the midst of our deep gloom and as I hear the children repeat them so  
often, I think how true it is that "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings He has ordained  
strength." For these little children, in t he simplicity, do more to divert my thoughts from the  
dark and gloomy present to the bright future than  
all the pious counsels of older heads.  
</p><p class="p10">My sorrows are not at all mingled with the bitterness of despondency. With  
such a light in my eye of faith as the life which my dear, devoted Elizabeth  led me, I cannot  
but see the brightness of a cheerful hope, that we have parted only for a season to meete  
again, whree partings will never take place. The darkness of the night in which her suddes  
departure has left me is mellowed by the advancing light of the morn, where "they that sleep  
in the dust shall awake and come forth." Dear departed One! If she were her she would bear  
testimony to the depth of love I bore her, and the tenderness with which she was cherished  
by he now stricken husband. If ever I have been unkind to her it was only a momentary  
weakness of poor human nature, followed by an intense degree of affection, the former of  
which no one was more ready to forgive, whilst she fully appreciated adn promptly  
acknowledged the latter. Elizabeth was in all respects a faithful loving wife, and eminently a  
devoted mother. Such a wife is from the Lord. "The Lord gave her, and the Lord hath taken  
her away." I should not repine or murmur, but thank the Lord that he gave her, and left her  
so long with me.</p><p class="p10">I have every reason to believe that Elizabeth was a Christian. Whie she she  
made no parade of her religion I may say with truth (as far as one may judge, who knew her  
sevret life best) she lived the life of the righteous. She taught the children (John especially) a  
great deal of  scripture -hymns-prayers, etc., and by her great conversations with them about  
heaven and their meeting their little brother there - showed that she understood its language -  
and was laying up treasures there. She was especially concerned about the religious training  
of our children, and very often requested me, at family worship, to pray patiently for the  
children. She continally expected to meet in heavaven who she was so anxious to have  
trained for heaven. Owing to her sudden and unexpected departure, we could have no  
conversations where death was at the door; and, if  even that had been allowed my faith  
inher happy passage would not have been changed either by her hopes or her fears; "for by  
these fruits ye shall know them." and the falling of the fruits, or the cause of its fall, does  
not change its character. Elizabeth was somewhat apprehensive as her period approached but  
I did not think hre more so than usual. We had often talked about our children in case either  
of us was called away; but she never made any requests in regard to them, as one always  
said she know I would take good care of them and bring them up properly. She always  
wished, as all parents do, that she might be spared to bring them up herself. She said nothing  
at all, about them on her deathbed, or even made any allusions to her dying. At first I  
regretted very much that she could not have talked with us; but upon reflection I think it was  
a kind providence that she could not, and that her mind was n ot exercised in this way: for  
her parting with husband and children would have been the sorest part of death. Although  
she suffered severely for several hours (yet not apparantly more so thoan I have often seen  
her suffer before) in death she suffered not at all. It was like a gentle sleep, not a muscle of  
her jaw was distorted, and her corpse was perfectly life-like.Now she has gone - gone before  
us - not [last]. The [??] left her little ones on earth to meet her little ones in the skies - she   
has left her husband to go to her savior, and her friends below, to join a happier and more  
numerous band above. God took her to himself for the same reason that I  looked to myself,  
because he lover her. In me she found a husband, found but frail and erring, and not able to  
confer the happiness which it was in my heart to confer; in him she has found more than a  
husband, brothers, sister, morther or frined  who will be her eternal reward. Blessed be God!  
Thy will be done!</p><p class="p10">After writing the above I stopped to read what I had written, and when I had  
finished reading I had a hearty cry. But there is relief in tears, and now I am sufficiently  
composed to commence writing again. It is half past ten o'clock and the stillness of death  
reigns around, save the breathings of dear little John, who is  fast asleep. THer is Elizabeth's  
bureau, and her dressing box, and her work-basket and pin cushion - but who is Elizabeth?  
We laid her body inthe cold earth on New Year's day, but she is not there either. That  
handful of dust is not the dear companion that walked side by side with me nine years of my  
pilgrimages. She has passed over to the Lord now, and that which we looked up as we  
shivered in the cold by her open grave three  weeks ago, was only the worn-out tabernacle in  
which she  had sojourned on her way to the promised land. She has gone over safely, for she  
trusted in a better leader than Moses, and is now enjoying "the rest which remaineth for the  
people of God." In her arms she carried her youngest borm, who God suffered not to be  
exposed in the wilderness at all - her sweet, dear little babe, made in the very image of his  
mother, born in the very [?] itself, and safely landed with her. Oh, my heart, say not that  
God is unkind. He has [trasured] thy jewels where alone they are safe - He has left thee  
others to polish which, with thyself, he will [treasure] in due time, if ye faint not. It is  
enough! God is good and I am resigned. My tears are not the burning tears of one who will  
not be comforted, but fond tears of affection meet to be wept on the bosom of a friends, yea,  
even on the bosom of that friend that sticketh closer than a brother. I mourn not that my dear  
one has been released from the toils of  earth, but because in her release we have been  
separated, as the dove in the thicket mourns his mate that enjoys the freedom of the skies.</p></p>

return to the active duties of the ministry. With this view I made efforts to secure a suitable  
change, but although there were several vacancies at teh time, I did not succeed, from the  
fact that other applications had preceded mine. I am not in circumstances to live without  
employment, and was therefore induced, for the present to take charge of the "Washington  
institute" in Columbia. This school was established by the authorities of the town, who own  
the building, and [rent] it to me. I  have a borther (Hirma)  living here, who was desirous of  
having me near him. I removed my family on the first day of  August, and opened the school  
on the first Monday of September. Previvous to the opening I had a public meeting and made  
an address on the subject of Education, which was noticed  with flattering comment in the  
town papers. It is nevertheless my purpose to take a pastorate, or some situation connected  
with my own church, as soon as the opportunity offers. Although I have not had a  
congregation to serve for three years past, yet I have preached, I think, upopn an average of  
once a week. At Lutherville it was my duty to preach every Sabbath. At Hanover I preached  
very frequently in absence or during the illness of the pastor (Rev. M.J. Alleman) and often  
for  the neighboring clergy. Since my removal to Columbia I have preached every Sabbath   
with one exception, and on two or three occasions, twice a sabbath. Yesterday September 30  
I preached twice in York during the absence of Rev. Menger, while  
attending synod.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Sabbath. To day I assisted at the laying of a corner-stone for the Lutheran  
(German) congregation of  Columbia, under the pastoral care of Rev. J.A. Darmsteatter, and  
made an address. Rev. B.W. Schmauck of Lancaster made the address in German. Rev. E.  
Dorsey of the English Lutheran church of this place was also present. The new church is  
being built on the site of the old one, which was found too small to accommodate the  
congregation. A great crowd was in attendance.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Oct 13</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This evening the  directors of the "Washington Institute" held a meeting for the  
purpose of taking into consideration the interests of the school. The number of pupils  (at  
present 49) is not sufficient to sustain its present expenses&gt; It is porpopsed to make such  
changes in the building as will adapt a part of it to the residence of the pripncipal. At present  
it is arranged for school purposes alone, and is sufficient to accommodate 300 pupils. It is  
not likely that this number will ever be in attendance, unless something is done, either to  
increase the income or curtail the expenses I will be obliged to abandon it. I employ an  
"assistant" for $500, pay $6 per month to a janitor, $100 per year for rent, besides fuel, etc,  
and have to rent a horse for my family besides. A committee was appointed to inquire in the  
proposed change, make an estimate of teh cost and resport on next  
Thursday evening.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Sabbath. Preached in the morning the German Reformed Church and in the

Anna and Walter. I am alone here with only John for company.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This evevning the Trustees of the Institute met and after talking about various  
measures to sustain the school with its present force and arrangement parted without taking  
actiont on anything. The most feasible thing suggested was the propriety of dismissing the  
assistant, and securing pupils enough for myself alone to teach. This might be done and  
afford a very good income. But I am resolved upon returning to the active duties of the  
ministry, or at least laboring in some capacity in connection with my own church. So soon as  
a way opens it is my purpose to transfer the school to other hands and resume the work of a  
pastor.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Oct 21</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Sabbath. Preached in teh Presbyterian Church in teh absence of its pastor. On  
Saturday morning I mailed a letter to Rev. Dr. Baugher, President of Pa College, offering  
my services, for six months, as agent to complete and  endowment of the college. On  
Saturday evening I had a letter from Rev. P. Rizer of Sunbury, saying that the Milton charge  
was not yet supplied, though a candidate is before them viz Rev. H. Baker of Lewistown.  
Bro Rizer had kindly recommended me  in case the negotiation with Rev Baker does not  
succeed. I try  to submit myself to God and look to Him for direction. I have no doubt but  
He will bring me out of the deep water in due time.</p><p class="p10">This is the season of the "dear old yellow leaf" and these are days of beauty,  
mellowed by milder suns, and adorned by the varied hues of the advancing autumn. The  
heart derives a tone of sadness from the fading beauties of nature. Death is at work upon all  
around. With what lovely colors does he paint his victims ere he sweeps them off with his  
[season] of destruction! Yet how  timely is the death of the myriad leaves that now flutter  
and jostle each other in this descente! The fruit, fully ripe, has been gathered, and now  
nought but the decorations of nature f ade and fall before the breaths of autumn - not so with  
the frail tribes of men. I have buried my dead in life's full summer, when the flower of our  
loves were just blooming into beauty.</p><p class="p10">"Leaves have their time to fall,<br>  
And flowers, to wither at the North wind's breath,<br>  
And stars to set - but all<br>  
Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death!"</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Winter has gone and spring has come again, the gayest adn loveliest of the  
seasons. How pleasant it is to walk forth in the green meadows or on the sunny side of the  
flower-decked hills! The orchard regales our senses with its fragrant blossoms, the groves  
and the meadows are clothing themselves in living green, the singing of birds has come, and   
all nature is joyous withnew life. But alas, the din of war, and clash of arms are distracting  
our once happy land. The sectional strife, arising chiefly from the unfortunate contest about  
slavery, has culminated, and the result is a civil war between the north and the south. The  
attack of the secessionists on Fort Sumter has aroused such  indignation in teh loyal people of  
the free states t hat they are unanimous in favor of chastising the offenders. Active  
preparations for war are going on throughout the whole land. The President (Lincoln) has  
made a requisition upon the states for 75000 men, and will soon call for more. In the p

<p class="p11"><b>Columbia  
May 8, 1861</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">My dear Friend,</p><p class="p10">I received your letter after considerable delay. The mails are evidently much  
deranged. I am told all letters are examined in certain post-offices near "Mason and Dixon's  
Line," which suggests the caution of being being very careful about what we write. I am  
distressed exceedingly for our beloved country. Never did I anticipate such a state of things  
in my day. Our lot has been cast in calamitous times, and we who are near the confines of  
slave and free territory will, doubtless, be the greatest suffered. The war spirit aroused in  
both sections is wonderful. No one could have imagined that the sober-minded  
Pennsylvavnians could be so aroused. Yet it seems that  she is taking the lead in furnishing  
men and means and all the essestials of war. Such unanimity I never heard of. Conservative  
men, who did all in their power to avert the collision before our flag  was dishonored, are  
now burning with indignation. I have not heard a dissenting voice. From the minister of the  
gospel through all classes of the community, the sentiment is universal, that the government  
must be sustained, rebellion suppressed and the honor of the nation vindicated. May God  
defend the right!</p><p class="p10">The position of Baltimore is sadly deplored. It has no doubt, given great  
satisfaction to the seccessionists: but it seems to me that nothing could have operated more to  
their detriment. It has done almost as much as the affair at Fort Sumpter to arouse the l ion  
of the North. The idea that the Federal troops should not be allowed to pass peaceably  
through a city or state stil owing allegiance to the union, to the defense of their own capital,  
has justly awakened the extreme indignation of a loyal people. Baltimore is now very much  
in the position of Sodom and Gomorrah and it is only the assumed that there ris a large  
number of loyal citizens threre that s aves it from a similar doom. Of course I am not giving  
any opinion as to what o ught to be done in sucha case, but simply giving expression to teh  
universal feeling around me. On Saturday I visited "Camp Curtin" at Harrisburg. The scenes  
were new to me and though the display of the military was beautiful and imposing, yet it was  
sad to think of the terrible havoc that will be made by these gathering hosts. Whil I was  
present Governor (Curtin) reviewed the troops,a nd there were five thousand on parade,  
never before had I so lively an imporession of the phrase "Terrible as an army with  
banners." I spoke with a number of the soldiers, and found them all determined and eager  
for the fight. I saw Eugene Rizer, in the Sunbury Company,a nd was told that even his father  
(a clergyman) will lead a company from Sunbury, if their services are needed. Everywhere I  
heard ministers of the gospel declaring that the government must be sustained, that to fight  
for the union was doing God service, and that it is the duty of all good christians to come up  
to the rescue. I found large numbers of the members of churches in the army. From our own  
town many of the most pious and active members of congregations have shouldered the  
muskey. I have been told that there is a regular union prayer meeting, kept up in the camp at  
York. The Lutheran church and Harrisburg (Dr. Hay's) had been used to quarter soldeirs last  
week. I preached for Dr. Hay on sabbath evening, adn found the carpet, sofa and other  
furniture removed. Dr. Hay and another clergyman  were appointed to  preach to the solders  
in Camp Curtin on sabbath afternoons, but were prevented by the rain. I was told that REv.  
Dr. Brown, recently from Newberry College South Carolina, where he was obliged to flee  
on account of his union sentiments) has accepted a chaplaincy to one of the Penna regiments.  
At the depot in Harrisburg I met Rev. Gottwald from Shipensburg. He was on his way to  
Springfield, Ohio, where he intends leaving his wife and chiold, while he joins the army  
either as chaplain o r a private. (note - neither of these gentlment became a chaplain). In  
these items you have a sample of the feeling whihc activates the people of the free states. If  
the conspirators encouraged themselves by the hope that love for the old union had died  out,  
they will be woefully mistaken. Our people love  their country as they love th eir mothers,  
and, though they quietly submitted to the indignities heaped upon her a long time, yet are  
they ready now in the hour of her danger and impending dishonor, to imperil their lives adn  
shed their blood for defence. In these time the sentiment of the Jewish exiles is in the hearts  
and upon the lips of thousands, who love the church and the nation with pious affection and  
filial gratitude: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning: if I do  
not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth. If I prefer not Jerusalem  
above my chief joy."</p><p class="p10">The war excitement has had a serious effect  upon my school, causing a very  
considerable falling off in the attendance. I do not know whether I will have sufficient  
engagement to continue to the close of the quarter. I have made every exertion to get  charge  
of a congregation, and have failed in every instance. I believe, on account of my  
unwillingness to take sides with extreme parties in the church. Other ministers of the church  
are laboring under the same difficulties. Recently I wrote to Mr. Sentman in refereance  to a  
charge near him. In his reply, which I received yesterday he uses the following language: "It  
makes me sad" say he "to think that some of our ablest and best ministers are out of  
employment as pastors, and that too, in some  cases I fear, on account of prejucices excited  
by the unscriptural, uncharitable,a nd unchristian controver about `old and new measures.'"  
In these controversies I take no part, and yet, as I have the best reasons for belieiving, am  
one of the proscribed. In at least half a dozen of congregations to which I made application,  
this application was set aside for no other reason. And this has taken place not because the  
people act from theri own convictions, but because theire clerical advisers direct their  
movements. I have loved my church and prayed for the peace of Zion; but, if the war among  
brethren is to be carried on this  way, I for one, will seek a home elsewhere, rather than be  
set aside., contrary to my wishes, from the active duties of the ministry. I hear of several  
vacant congregations in Maryland, but in these uncertain times, we feel almost afraid to  
cross Mason and Dixon's Line. I have no doubt that my conservaism would keep me from  
giving occasion for offence, but we cannot be sure that the people would be governed by a  
similar forebearance and charity. Mr. Lentman offered to recommend me to the Smithburg  
charge. He himself was urged to take it, but does not wish to make the change. It is probable  
that I will spend the summer, after school closes, with my brothers and sisters in Franklin  
Co. They live in the country, secluded from the din and confusion of war.</p><p class="p10">Yours truly,<br>

<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>May 28</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I closed my school a month earlier than I had intended, partly because the war  
had occasioned a serious decrease in the attendance, but chiefly because I wished to have  
time to prospect around for a charge in  which to preach. At present there is an  
unprecedented number of clergymen without employment, which has been occasioned by  
their having been driven from seceded states. I took leave of my pupils on Friday (the 24th)  
and, closing our house in Columbia, we came upon a visit to Gettysburg the next day. There  
I have met many dear freinds. Next to my native place this is the dearest spot in my  
recollection of the past. Here I spent eight years in the College and Seminary - and happy  
years they were. Here I learned to know my dear wife and love her. After spending ten years  
without ripply in teh quiet depths of our wedded love, I brought her body back to lay it by  
the side of her kindred in cemetery. One of our first visits, after arriving, was to this sacred  
spot. With her mother I and our three surviving children, I stood and wept by the grave. The  
children were deeply affected by their recollection of their "mama." Poor little Walter (only  
3 years old) who had never been to it before, could not comprehend why his "dear dear  
mama" should be put under the ground, and wanted to take the ground off that he might see  
her. I planted a white Jessamine at her head, and a sweet scented honeysuckle and a wisteria  
in the inclosure. Blessed is the memory of the dead, when there is such a fragrance about  
their life as that which embalms my dear Elizabeth in my heart of hearts! It makes the heart  
better to stand by her grave and hear the silent voice speaking from  
the ashes of the dead.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Dear Bro.,</p><p class="p10">We did nto cross the mountains from Gettysburg quite as soon as we expected,  
and therefore have I delayed writing. I was requested to remain in Gettysburg in order to  
preach to the congregation which was recently made vacant by the resignation of Rev. J.R.  
Keiser. I have preached there on the sabbath evening after our arrival, on a very short notice  
and was requested to make an appointment for the next sabbath morning and evening. From  
all accounts the impression made by my preaching was quite favorable, and there is a strong  
probability of their giving me a call, if a demand on part of some of the congregation for  
German doe not interfere. The salary however at least in the beginning will be small, the  
congregation being somewhat divided and some members considerably disaffected on account  
of the difficulties occurring during the pastorship of the late pastor. I would be satisfied,  
under present circumstances, with barely enough to support my family.</p><p class="p10">We came across on Wednesday in the stage coach as far as Greenwood; where  
Bro. Adam met us with his carriage. We found our friends all well. The country is  
charmingly beautiful at this season and the prospect for any abundant harvest was never  
better. I left Anna and Walter with their Grandmother and aunst Eliza Smith at Gettysburg.  
They are delighted to be there, but still would have preferred coming with us. John is  
wonderfully interested in the country, where everything is in a measure nwe to him. He  
taked great plasure in seeing horses, cows sheep, etc and thinks they have wonderfully good  
dinners here. We are disappointed in finding no very good propect for fruit. They cherry  
trees have scarcely any cherries, and the apples likewise will be scarce. I found a great many  
changes about our old homestaed - some for the better and some for the worse. There is a  
mournful interest in the thousand recollection of childhood and youth started by the familiar  
objects met at every turn. The very rocks and stones have tongues in this enchanted region.  
John and I wet all through the barn yesterday, visited every stall and shed, and took a good  
look into every "nook and corner." To me it was a book of many histories, while John  
seemed deeply interested in the accounts I gave him of the places where I used to play when  
at his his age (9 years) and he had numberless questions to ask.</p><p class="p10">I find the folks here pretty well poseted in regard to the war, but not nearly so  
much excited as in the towns. We get a tri-weekly mail, but only weekly and semi-weekly p  
apers. Adam takes the Weekly Press and the Chambersburg (semi-weekly) Transcript. We  
are planning a trip to  Chambersburg as soon as the weather is favorable. There are said to  
be upwards of fifteen thousand troops encamped in and around the town. I have not been to  
see Samuel or Elizabeth yet. THe latter, as you are aware, lives at Jackson Hall. I am told  
that the are well pleased with the change. I feel anxious to hear from Maggie Heise whom  
we left so vrey ill. I hope you will write soon. Give my love to Annie and remember me  
kndly to Mr. Heise, Mary, "Lizzie," "Pace," Dr. McCorkle, and all inquiring friends  
particularly Julia and Emily. </p><p class="p10">Your Brother, Abr.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>Gettysburg - June 25, 1861</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I returned to Gettysburg on the 21st and preached in St. James Church on the  
23rd. On the 24th a letter was enclosed to me containing a call to take charge of the  
pastorate with a salary of five hundred ($500) dollars and the free use of the parsonage. Thus  
has God, at length after much seeking and many complaints, opened to me the peace of all  
others, which I would select as a residence. My strongest attachments are centered around  
Gettysburg. Here I spent eight happy years in acquiring an education - here are the venerable  
men whom I love to honor as my preceptors and among my earliest and most valued friends.  
God be praised for his goodness!</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Sabbath morning - This has been set down in my plans as the last sabbath of my  
sojourn in Columbia. I returned from Gettysburg about the first of this month,a nd spent the  
time since then preparing an article for the Evangelical Review on "The Live Records, or the  
Bible and Geology" and making ready to move. I shipped my goods on Friday and propose  
following them tomorrow. My children remain with their grandmother in Gettysburg. Dear  
little pets! how I have longed to see them! I have two appointments to preach today - at 10  
o'clock in the Presbyterian Church and at 6 in the Lutheran.</p><p class="p10">Now that I have the prospect of returnign to the minstry I feel very happy. I  
regard my leaving it before as a mistake, though my health did not seem to bear up well  
under the labor of it. Providence has evidently been against me. Within four years I have had  
three situations, all promising well in the beginning and all disappointing my expectations in  
the end. I have repented and humbled myself under the hand of God. I have given myself  
anew to the work of the ministry, and am resolved to devote the residue of my life to the  
Master's work. I feel that He has greatly strengthened me in view of what I shall be called to  
do. Never have I put on the srmor with a heart so full of courage. All my efforts undertaken  
without his approbation have hitherto failed. His grace has brought me back to a porper  
appreciation of my duty. I have been sorly tried in the furnace of affliction: but I can  
sincerly say with the psalmist. "It was good for me that I have been afflicted." I trust my  
heart has been made better in this sever school. My attachment to the world has been greatly  
lessened. It seems to me now that nothing but the service of God can satisfy me in this world  
or make me comfortable in view of the world to come.</p><p class="p10">On many accounts I feel very reluctant to leave Columbia. My dear brother  
Hiram and his excellent wife have done everything to make my stay among them pleasant  
and happy. Besides them I leave a number of kind friends behind. I am hopeful enough to  
believe that the Lord will raise up others equally kind.</p></p>

vacate the house until Wednesday morning. The ladies of the congregaton were very kind in  
assisting to arrange  our furniture. The house is pretty well set in order now, but the family  
have not yet come to occupy it. Yesterday I preached twice to large audience. The day was  
intensely hot, and I was much exhausted in consequence.</p></p>
<p class="p12"><i></i></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Aug 12</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yesterday I preached twice - in the morning from 1 Tim 3.16 in the evening  
from Jno 3.16. Neither of these discourses was written in full. I used no manuscript  
whatever in the pulpit. My prececessor, during most of his ministry among these pepole, was  
in the ahbit of reading his sermons, and, being near=sighted, was abliged to read very  
closely. This created great dissatisfaction and with some other difficulties, made him very  
unpopular. I regard Bro. Keiser as a most worthy man, well educated, pious and devoted to  
his work. He prepares his discourses very carefully, and they are, I believe, invariably good.  
Yet he failed to interest these people generally in himself and in the church. The people are  
plain and simple in their manners - many of them farmers and mechanics. They requre a  
minister to mingle among them freely and will then, I think, become very much attached to  
him. In this respect Bro Keiser seems to have failed. I have come amongst them with a full  
determination to do my duty and a feel that the Lord will give me grace and strength to do  
it. Thus far I have had great encouragement  
and a blessed experience of divine support.  
</p><p class="p10">Last week most of my time was occupied putting our house in order. The ladies  
of the congregation kindly came to our  aid and rendered valueable service. We have  
everything arranged now except a carpet for the dining room. We were obliged to get a new  
one. The ladies propose collecinting tomorrow for the purpose of making it. These little  
things have an intrest and importance beyond the mere assistance rendered. They serve to  
attach the people to the minister's family, and, as I told one of them last week, at making  
them feel that they have an interest in the parsonages.</p></p>

University preached for my people. The day was cloudy and the aspect of the weather  
threatening rain. Some of the country members were prevented from coming in, but the  
church was pretty well filled nevertheless. In the evening I preached from Psalm 2.6. Last  
week I spent much time in visitng the congregation. I called upon forty families and have the  
names of about twenty nine in the town beside about an equal number in the country.  
Yesterday afternoon I addressed the sabbath school. I find the number of pupils much smaller  
that it wsa a few years ago, and a deplorable lack of interest and faithfulness on the part of   
teachers. A meeting of the officers and teachers was held after the school was dismissed.  
Various matters connected with the  school were discussed. It was decided to have an  
excursion to a neighboring grove, and a festival. A meeting for Bible class, to be composed  
of the teachers, was appointed for next Saturday evening.</p></p>

day last week in a similar manner and have already visited twenty three families in the  
country. The number will be found much larger than I anticipated. Yesterday I preached  
twice to the largest audience I have had any time yet. In the evening I passed through a  
severe ordeal in speaking before the professors and students of the college and  seminary  
(who attended my church) without a written sermon. But I got through without much  
difficulty, and I suppose that the experience will be beneficient to me. It is  really provoking  
that we, who serve a master so infinitely exalted, should be so rimorous when a  
distinguished hearer is found in the audience. But so it is. We are vexted at ourselves for  
being faint-hearted, and yet find it utterly impossible to be otherwise under certain

deferred. The children were of course greatly disappointed. It rained all day. I was very  
happy in my study preparing a sermon, and sometimes reading. Yesterday was a delightful  
day. The school went to the grove, and the children all were delighted. At two o'clock I  
attended the funeral of a poor German who came here a stranger and died amongst us. I was  
called upon to visit him only a few days ago. He was then so far gone (with consumption)  
that he could, with great difficulty, speak -his mind also was wandering. I was unable to  
learn any thing  of his history. He, however, said he was a member of a church and seemed  
to realize his condition, and said he was prepared for it. He died a stranger in a strangte  
land, but he was kindly cared for and decently buried. If Jesus were his friend he lacked  
nothing, and is now happily relieved of his bodily sufferings.</p><p class="p10">Today Bro. Keiser intends offering his furniture (which has been stored in the

Illinois and received a call to the congregation at Dixon. On his way east he attempted to get  
off the cars while they were in motion, when he was thrown violently, his arm broken and

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Monday. Last week I visited Columbia and spent the week with my friends,  
returning on Saturday. Immediately after my return we had a meeting of the church council.  
The brethren seemed very greatly encouraged by our prospect of success in the congregation.  
One of them, who has been most active in his efforts to create a deeper intrest among the  
people, states that he believed  the congregation in a more hopeful condition nw than it has  
been for ten years. I felt greatly strengthened in my purpose to labor zealously by these   
evidences of success. Yesterday I preached twice to large audiences. This being  
commencement week with college, we are in expectation of a large

congregation. Bro. Bishop of Emmitsburg is here to assist me. It would be impossible for me  
to desribe the feelings of my heart on this occasion. I have been endeavoring to carry out the  
apostolic injunction by examining myself. As my thoughts wander back over the past, alas!  
What mistakes have been committed that can never be repaired, and how dreadful their  
consequences! What sins have been indulged, and, oh, how fearfully corrupt is my heart!  
Truly God has been exceedingly good and has led my by a way I know not. He has taken my  
out of the miry clay and out of the horrible pit. To thee, O God, be all the praise of my  
salvation. I have no confidence in myself - give me grace and wisdom: through my weakness  
manifest thy power, and give me victor. To the cross of Christ I cling - this my daily hope,  
and, in this, I cannot be disappointed.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Our communion yesterday was solemn and impressive. As nearly as I could  
estimate, about 250 persons communed. The membership of the church is estimated at 300,  
but this is very uncertain, there being no correct list! Many have been exceedingly careless,  
and can scarcely be regarded as members.</p></p>

humiliation and prayer, in view of the deplorable state of the country. We had religious  
services in our church and I preached a sermon on our national sins from 2 Chron. 7.14.  
The church was filled to its utmost capacity, and the audience unusually devout and attentive.  
Truly we have great reason to humble ourselves. Pride, avarice, intempreance, lack of  
charity, profanity, sabbath-breaking and various other sins, are rife. To purge out these God  
is, doubtless, scourging the nation. From all such good Lord deliver  
us!</p></p>

Pennsy. synod at Mechanicsburg. Upward of forty ministers, and an equal number of lay  
delegates were in attendance. The meetings were harmonious, and very pleasant. Nothing  
beyond the ordinary  business was transacted. The gospel was faithfully preached every  
evening, and the Lord's supper admihnistered on Sabbath. I preached before synod on  
Saturday afternoon, preparatory to the Communion, and on Sabbath in a neighboring village

permitted to preach the gospel! When I can succeed in first preaching my discourse to  
myself, and making the text my own by experience, then am I most happy in preaching to  
others. My experience since my return to the active duties of the ministry has been omst  
gratifying. Truly the Lord has been good to me and his grace has sustained and comforted

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">On Saturday last (9th inst) we buried Walter S. Swan, my brother in law, near  
the grave of his sister, my dear Elizabeth. Poor Walter! He has had a sad life. Both his sight  
and hearing were defective from childhood; yet he was neither blind nor deaf. (Passage  
scratched out) In the month of December 1959 his uncle Robert Smith, with whom he lived  
at teh time, died very suddenly (previous to this Walter had left off the habit of drinking).  
On the 30th of the same month his sister Elizabeth died also very suddenly. About two weeks  
after this we observed Walter's mind was giving way. We had noticed some symptoms of  
mental imbecility and eccentricity for several years before, but no one was much alarmed by  
it. At this time he became so much excited that it was necessary to send him to the hospital  
at Harrisburg. He continued there without any improvement, until he bega a few weeks ago  
to sink rapidly and finally died on the 6th inst. His corpse was brought home and laid among  
his kindred.</p><p class="p10">It is a great comfort to all his friends that Walter had become, as far as we can  
judge, a changed man before his derangement of mind came upon him.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>December 1861
  
</b></p>
<p class="p11"><b>Dec 31</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This is the evening of the last day in the year. It has been a year of sad and  
stirring events in this land. From a quiet and peacable people, who scarcely knew of thought  
anything about war, the military feeling has been aroused through out the entire land.  
Upwards of six hundred thousand (600,000) soldiers are in the field from the loyal states, for  
the purpose of putting down the great rebellion, which threantens to destroy our beneficent  
government. How many are in arms against us, we cannot tell; but the number is very great  
- perhaps not much less than our own army. During the last week a regiment of Cavalry  
from western New York came to make their winter quarters at this place. Our usually quiet  
streets are full of soldiers and drilling is going on every day. I deplore the existence of this  
unnatural war with all my heart. There was no justifiable ground for it. Nobody was  
suffering from bad government. The country  (especially the southern states) was never more  
prosperous than when the war commenced. It is a war between brethren. Families are  
literally divided, brother against brother, and father against son, in numerous cases one  
member of a family being in the northern army while another is in the southern. For our   
sings, the Lord is  chastising the nation. What the issue will be no mortal can predict. Our  
trust in is the Lord. But for this I would despair. The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice.</p><p class="p10">The past year has been one of great abundance. The country was never more  
blessed with a full harvest. The whole country has been healthy, there being no prevailing  
epidemics, on this account the country was never in a better condition to sustain a war. </p><p class="p10">Our government is greatly annoyed by the sympathy manifested on the other  
side of the ocean,  especially in England and France, with this deplorable rebellion. The only  
solution of this unnatural state of things that seems plausible, is found in the jealousy with  
which the great poewrs have been viewing our nation. The United States have been growing  
immensely in all the elements of greatness. The experiment of free institutions has  shown  
here here a degree of prosperity unequalled in the whole world. In t he eyes of the  
aristocratic nations abroad the  example was considered dangerous. And hence the desire to  
have it dismembered and weakened. They are disposed to favor the south the mroe also  
because it is there where they find the nearest approach to an aristocracy, among the  
slaveholders. The people of the North are firm in their sense of right, and, I think are  
deterimned to sustain the government and preserve the union at all sacrifices.</p><p class="p10">During the past year I made a very important change, in  returning to the active  
service of the ministry. I have now been laboring in this charge five months; and  they have  
been happy months to me. I have worked hard - rather beyond my strength - and have been  
cheered with many token of seccess. The congregation has been greatly strengthened, not so  
much in additions to its membership as in restored unity of feeling and actions. A large  
number who had virtually, though not formally, withdrawn, have returned to their places. At  
our lsat communion which occurred on the 22nd of this month, we received fourteen new  
members, all being heads of families but one.  </p><p class="p10">My family and myself have been blessed with good health the past year. My  
children are a great comfort to me. Though young they are becoming almost necessary  
companions. They are all ardently attached to me, and show a commendable degree of  
respect and obedience. It will be two years tomorrow since their dear mother was taken from  
us. Here loss has been a sore affliction to us all. The children have a very distinct  
recollection of her, and very often talk about their "dear dear mama."</p><p class="p10">It is now eight o'clock at night. They sky is clear and many bright stars are  
twinkling. Our dear little pets are all snugly in bed and sound asleep. Their grandmother,  
who is mother to us all, is spending the evening out (with her sister Eliza). I am all alone in  
my snug and comfortable studio. My mind  is thronged with many thoughts of ths past, and  
my heart stirred iwth recollections both fond and sad. May the gracious Father of us all  
forgive the delinquencies of the past, and prepare for the emergencies of the future. I  thank  
him for all the mercies and blessings of the year. To his name be honor and glory forever!  
Amen.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>June 26, 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">This was a memorable day in Gettysburg. Pennsylvania is invaded by the army  
of the Confederate States. They had made their appearance at Greencastle and Chambersburg  
some ten days ago, and we had many rumors of their advance in this direction. Our  
merchants sent away most of their goods and the horses had been removed from the town  
and surrounding country several times under false alarms. But today they came numbering,  
according to the best estimates, about three thousand, consisting of cavalry and infantry  
supported by four or five [caissons]. The place was not defended and of course they met with  
no resistance. A regiment of militia had arrived from Harrisburg the evening before, but  
these made no stand. About two hundred of them were captured and paroled. A small troop  
of horsemen (about 25) from Philadelhpia and another collected in the country made their  
escape from the east end of town as the enemy entered at the west. I witnessed the charge  
down York street, and it was truly terrific to one unaccustomed to such things. They rode at  
the top of their speed and yelled like demons, their faces [?] and their hair streaming in the  
winds. They overtook a number of citizens endavoring to make their escape with their  
horses, and captured a car of government stores. They gathered up all the horses they could  
find. They demanded of the twon, among other things, ten barrels of whiskey, sixty barrels  
of four, one hundred beef cattle and five thousand dollars. The town council refused to give  
them anything. They then proceeded to help themselves to such things as they wanted. They  
took a great many things from the stores, for which they paid confederate scrip or left a  
recept and order upon their government. Their stay was very brief lasting only from about  
three o`clock PM to the following morning. They burned some eight or ten cars and the  
railroad bridge over [Rock] Creek. With few exceptions they molested no families. They  
pushed forward from this to Hanover and York, destroying railroad bridges and ware-houses  
and capturing horses.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>June 29</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Yesterday (Sabbath) about two thousand union cavalry entered our town. They  
are the advance of Gen. Hooker's army which is said to be near Frederick Md. They were  
ordered back again this morning, for what reason we do not know. All our communications  
are cut off and we receive no mails from any direction. The rebels are said to be in very  
heavy force in the Cumberland Valley adn moving upon Harrisburg. They are also said to  
have done immense damage in York and along the Northern Central Railroad. Our town is  
completely invested by the two armies, though, at present, not occupied by either. I am  
alone. My wife has gone upon a visit to her sister, Mrs. [Thodes] at Bellefonte. John is in  
Franklin Co with his uncle, and the two younger children are with my brother in Columbia. I  
can hear from none of them. Our citizens are deeply depressed today. All business is  
suspended and nobody does anything but inquire for the news and anxiously await the  
decision of the great contest. The farmers are in great distress about their crops. Haymaking  
and harvest are upon them and no horses to do the work.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">Our town was occupied this morning buy a large force of Federal Cavalry. The  
confederate pickets were in sight when the advance entered, but they fell back along the  
Chambersburg road toward the mountain, where they are said to be in heavy forces. News of  
a fight between Pleasonton's Cavalry and the Confederate Cavalry under Stuart near  
Littlestown, was brought in this evening. It is impossible to get reliable information, but it  
seems evident that both armies are in large force in this region and a great battle is imminent  
any day.</p></p>

<p class="p11"><b>July 1863</b></p>
<p class="p10"><p class="p10">A great battle was fought at Gettysburg on the first, second and  
third days of July. I remained in our house alone (my family having gone o  
n a visit to Columbia) during the first day's fight. Shells shrieked over  
the town for more than three hours and then, on the retreat of our men,  
they fell around the house in the yard. During the early part of the day,  
I watched the movements of the armies from the steeple of the church,  
which stands next (to) the parsonage - saw the wounded and dying  
constantly brought in. In the afternoon our church was taken for a  
hospital, but before night the wounded had to removed, because the enemy  
outnumbering the union forces three to one on this first day's fight,  
drove our men into the town and through it. Night closed in leaving us  
within the enemies lines. The streets were strewn with dead men and horses  
and littered with the debris of the battle. Some of my neighbors were  
roughly treated during the night - and some of the stragglers of the rebel  
army threatened to strip us of shoes and other garments. On this account I  
left with a number of other citizens on the morning of the second day's  
fight. We proceeded north as far as Petersburg (14 miles) meeting the  
entire Cavalry of the enemy at various points of the road. I remained at  
Petersburg with my early friend and college chum, Rev. P. Raby, until  
Sabbath. During these dreary days we heard the cannonading very  
distinctly, but could get not news of battle. When at length the welcome  
news came that the enemy were retreating Bro. Raby and myself went on foot  
to Gettysburg, taking with us such things as we could carry to assist the  
wounded soliders. It was nearing night of the Sabbath when we reached the  
village. On Monday morning we proved to the battled fileld and saw sights  
which I cannot describe. Dead men and horses already far gone into decay,  
muskets, knapsacks, broken caissons, and cannon, etc etc. lay everywhere.  
During these days the entire stock of provision in the whole county for  
many miles, was exhausted. The railroad was broked up and bridges burned,  
so that we were cut off from any immediate supply. Immediately upon the  
cessation of hostilities our friends from a distance came in with  
provisions to relieve immediate necessities. Otherwise I cannot see how it  
would have been possible to avoid great suffering. My church was occupied  
for a hospital and it was several weeks before it could be used for  
religious services. For many weeks after the battle there was a stench  
filling the air, which was almost unendurable. This caused a great deal of  
sickness. I was taken down with fever and was unable to perform  
ministerial duties for about two months. Two of my children had severe  
illnesses (obscured). We were fortunate to escape with very little loss of  
property during the battle. Some of my neighbors had their houses  
thoroughly plundered. Quite a number of houses and barns in teh county  
neaer the village were burned. Several members of my church lost nearly  
all their property and one member, a young lady Miss Jennie Wade, was shot  
and killed during the battle. </p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I served the congregation of the York Street Church in Gettysburg a little over  
three years. The congregation was considerably distracted and scattered when I took charge.  
I worked hard, and, by the help of the Lord, succeeded not only in gathering in the  
scattered, but also in adding about one hundred and twenty new members.</p><p class="p10">In the autumn of 1864 I removed from Gettysburg with my family and took  
charge of the Lutheran church in [Beaford], Pa. This congregation had  suffered sadly by  
dissensions growing out of the war. The cong. here were very much divided in sentiment, a  
large number sympathizing with the rebellion. I found it very different to stay clear of  
threatening dangers on both sides. I vacated the charge after two years, congratulating myself  
that I had saved the congregations from deplorable schisms, although the membership had  
not been very greatly increased.</p><p class="p10">In the autumn of 1866 we removed to Ohio and I took charge of the the  
congregation at New Franklin and [Minerva] in [Sturns] County. In this vicinity I had three  
brothers and other relations. These congregation shad also sufferd very much by distractions  
growing out of the war. They had been vacant for many months and there seemed to be very  
little church life. Nevertheless my ministry of four years here was among the most successful  
labors of my life. The membership was numerically increased, and the charge greatly  
strengthened. During the latter part of my ministry and Franklin and [Minerva] I was invited  
to teach in Wittenburg College. I taught during the summer terms of 1870, returning to fill  
my appointments on Sabbath. In the autumn I removed in Spirngfield and continued my  
labors in College one year. I did not experience the same satisfaction in teaching that I  
enjoyed in my earlier life. Consequently at the close of the summer term of 1871 I gave in  
my resignation with a view of removing to Kansas.</p><p class="p10">I came to Ellsworth County Kansas in September 1871. During a visit in July  
prepvious I had purchased 230 acres of land on the Smoky Hill River, south of the Fort  
Harker reservation, payingg forth some 2500 dollars, which I ascertained afterwards was  
nearly double its real value at the time. This was paying largely for my inexperience in such  
matters. Fort Harker, at this time,  wsa occupied by several companies of soldiers stationed  
here to watch the Indians on the frontier. But there were no Indians near, nor have they ever  
troubled us. At this writing (July 10, 1878) the post has been abandoned, and a bill is  
pending in Congress to have the whole  appraised and sold. We ofund few settlers and  
neither church or setttled pastor in the county, except the chapel and chaplain at the post.  
Very little had been attempted, as yet in the way of farming, and it was generally believed  
that this would not be a farming country on account of drout and  
grasshoppers.</p></p>

<p class="p10"><p class="p10">I have been negligent about writing in my journal, and therefore it become  
necessary to go back and supply what has been omitted. In the autumn of 1873 I was induced  
by the Superintendent of Missions in Kansas (Rev. J. Heil, D.D. of the Presbyterian Church)  
to supply a vacant Presbyterian congregation at [Marnego], Kansas. Since my coming to  
Kansas I had preached very frequently in school-house, and superintendent a sabbath school.  
There were not enough members of the Lutheran Church to justify an attempt to organize,  
and therefore I was willing to accept this invitation to some as a supply in a church of  
another denomination. I continued in this charge until the spring of 1875, when I returned to  
Ellsworth County, and lived with my children (John S. Walter B. and Anna R) on the farm  
and stock ranche six miles south east of Ellsworth. In the autumn of 1878 I purchased a  
block of ground (No. 8) in the town of Ellsworth and built a house fo myself and wife,  
leaving our children in possession of the farm and ranche including 115 head of cattle, 12  
horses, and all the machinery and implements necessary to run the establishment. My  
children managed the business well and are still in charge of it, the two boys are married and  
Anna is staying for the present with Walter, as we are not settled permanently. We left  
Ellsworth on the 16th day of May last and are now boarding with my brother Adam's widow  
in Chambersburg. My throat has not been in a condition for several years to justify me in  
taking charge of a church, though I have frequently preached as a supply. While serving the  
congregation at Marnego Kansas I was sorely afflicted with Bronchitis and was obliged to  
give the charge on that account. This throat disease also affected my hearing badly, since our  
return to Chambersburg these troubles have been relieved to a great extent, and I feel now as  
if I might be able to resume the duties of a pastor.</p></p>

Quincy in this county and continued preaching to them once in two weeks for about seven  
months. On the 20th of November (87) they elected me pastor and preparations were made  
for my installation. Before the appointed time I was stricken with a partial paralysis of the  
left side and was thus compelled to give up all attempts to speak in public. I have recovered  
in a great measure from the affliction, but still feel it necessary to observe great care to  
avoid another similar attack.</p><p class="p10">When I commenced writing in this book at the beginning of my ministry nearly  
forty years ago I expected to make regular and pregnant entries, but, as in most similar  
cases, the record is only fragmentary. I now intend to commence at the beginning and note  
down the events of my life in order, giving as far as I can, some account of the other  
members of my family, and also of my ancestry. There notes may be interesting to my  
children and their descendants and may serve to fix dates and help any that may be disposed  
to trace their genealogy.</p><p class="p10">I was born on the 17th day of November AD 1822, and consequenly  
have very recently passed my 66th birthday. The place of my birth is in  
Quincy Township of this Franklin County on a farm about two miles from the  
Grindstone Hill Church. My ancestors for three generations are buried in  
the cemetary adjoining that church, especially those belonging to my  
mother's side. My father John Essick (originally spelled Essig) was born  
in Northampton County near Easton. His father moved to Adams County near  
Gettysburg, where he lived and died. He left to the best of my knowledge  
three sons, Lewis (or Ludwig) Johna nd Abraham, after who I was named. He  
also left two daughters by a second marriage, who I cannot name. One of  
these married a man named Cleveland, and at her death left two sons and a  
daughter. The other half sister of my father was not married. </p><p class="p10">In a book published some years ago in Harrisburg, giving the German  
immigration into Pennsylvania, by a man named Rupp, I discovered that a certain Ludwig  
Essig landed at Philadelphia in the year 1754. This I take to be the ancestor of the Essicks in  
this country. While there are fewe of that name in this region I am told   
that at a reunion in Starke, Co, Ohio several years ago they had seventeen hundred enrolled. Most of these retain  
the original [orthography] (Essig). My mother's maiden name was Catharine Cook, also of  
German parentage. Both my parents talked German as well as English,  but as we were  
surrounded by English spoken neighbors we seldom heard the German spoken, and  
consequently none of the children learned to speak that language.</p><p class="p10">My maternal grandfather (George Cook) belonged to a large connection of that  
name descended from John George Cook, one of the original settlers who entered  
government land in what is now called Quincy Township. This John George Cook, my great  
grandfather was one of the first buried in the Grindstone Hill Cemetery, and he had been one  
of the founders of that church long before the Revolutionary War.</p><p class="p10">My maternal grandmother's maiden name was [Ankeny]. She died several years  
before my grandfather, at what age I do not know. My grandfatehr was upwards of ninety - I  
think he was ninety three. Both are buried at teh Grindstone Hill. They had twelve children,  
all of whom lived to a mature age. There were five sons, Adam, John, George, Jacob and  
Samuel; and seven daughters - Mary, Rachel, Rebecca, Nancy, Catharine (my mother)  
Martha and Margaret. The sons all married (except Adam) and left families. Of the  
daughters Mary and Rachel married brothers named Wertz.  Rebecca was married to Secrist,  
Martha (Mattie) to Frederick Tritle, Margaret (Peggy)  to Samuel Repp.</p><p class="p10">My parents also ahd twelve children, nine sons, George, John, Adam, jacob,  
Samuel, William, David Abraham and Hiram and three daughters, Elizabeth, Rebecca and  
Catharine. All these but the youngest wh died at four years, lived to be grown men and  
women. Of the sons Jacob died when a young (single) man; the others all married. Adam,  
Samuel and Hiram, though married, had no children.</p><p class="p10">Of the daughters Elizabeth married Dr. Thomas B. Maxwell and had three  
children. Rebecca married Wilham Slaughenhaup and has six children. Incluidng myself  
there are five of the family living - Samuel, William, Rebecca and David.</p><p class="p10">My father came from Adams county when a young man, and, after his  
marriage, settled on the old homestead, where we were all born and raised, and where both  
of my parents died.</p><p class="p10">Our near neighbors were Jacob Fry, John McCleary, George Brown, Joseph  
Eaker and family named Hill, several families named Davidson, [Clingston], Hassler,  
Meade, etc.</p><p class="p10">We all received a common school education at what is known as the Davidson  
School House. The free school system had not then been introduced. My father paid for  
schooling his children by subscription, and we were sent the whole year, except through  
harvest. The teacher that I remember were Samuel Wise, John Armstrong, John McDowell,  
James Gillam, Augustus Aughenbaugh, etc. The schools were very inefficient, and, for want  
of proper methods, a great waste of time. We were taught only reading writing and  
arithmatic. Occasionally an older scholar, at his own request, was put to Grammar and  
Geography. The parents themselves had studied only the three first named branches, and the  
teachers did not care to be bothered with anything further.</p><p class="p10">I remained on the farm until my fifteenth year, when I  went into a country  
store at Jackson Hall - first with William McCleary and then with John Wunderlich, who  
bought the store. There I remained three years, until the spring of 1840. Then I accompanied  
my brother John who moved with his family to Stark County, Ohio. My desire was to  
procure a situation as clerk in a store again. But the country was new and no opportunity  
offered. I was young and strage and had no one to help me in procuring a situation. The  
following autumn I returned to my old home, and soon after was taken into a store in Quincy  
with Murphy and Kurtz.</p><p class="p10">The year 1832 is especially memorable in my history. That year a large bank  
barn was built on the farm. Until then, like nearly all the other farms in the neighborhood,  
ours had a barn build of unhewed logs and covered with thatch made of rye straw. It  
sheltered the horses and part of the ay, but had no room for the cattle and the wheat crop.  
The wheat was stacked and the cows spent the winter in the yard. In the same year the first  
sabbath school was organized in the Grindstone Hill Church by the pastor Rev. (afterwards  
Dr.) Benjamin Kurtz, who served our congregation in connection with the Lutheran Church  
in Chambersburg. I was then ten years old, and with the other children of our family became  
a member of that school at the time of its organization. This took place in the old log  
church, which was replaced the next year by the present brick church. My father was an  
officer of the church and one of the buildting committee.</p><p class="p10">Another event of the year 1832 made an impression on my mind, which is now,  
after the lapse, of more than fifty six years, as intensely real as if had happened in the  
present year. My little sister Catharine (Cassy) aged about four years was taken with scarlet  
fever in the midst of harvest and, after a short illness, died. It was the first death in our  
family and the first I had ever witnessed. Though I am now old and gray, and though ten  
thousand other scenes have utterly faded from my memory, this one is ever fresh and starts  
the tears and often I recall it. I was ardently attached to the dear child and she w as intensely  
fond of me. My mother often kept me from school on busy days to take care of baby for the  
baby was always good when I was with her. One strange thing I recall, which I could never  
fully understand. Just before she was taken sick she went with me to bring the sheep from  
the field, and after we had driven them into the pen, we started in the dusk of evening  
toward the house, she holding my hand and running by my side. She apparently in deep  
thought when all of a sudden she said "Poor Little Cassie is still living, but she will die one  
of these days." Her funeral was attended by a large number of relations and neighbors.</p><p class="p10">Before leaving this period of my narrative I feel inclined to ntoe a  few things  
by way of contrast between the past and the present. I suppose that the period of time  
included in my life has been more fruitful of important changes and improvements in all the  
departments of human industry and modes of living and procuring the necessaries of life than  
any preceding age of the world. When I was born there was no railroad, telegraph or  
telephone in existence. The use of steam was just commencing. The art of making  
daguerrotypes and photographs was unknown, no daily and few weekly papers through the  
country. Ploughs had wooden [moulboards], wheat drills and threshing meachines were not  
know, and horse reapers were not thought of. Farmers sowed broadcast, reaped with the  
sickle, and threshed with horses on the barn floor. When a small boy I sometimes rode the  
horses while tramping out wheat from the beginning of winter to the end. Our mothers and  
sisters spun flax and wool and our garments summer and winter were homemade. They  
cooked over the open fire- their houses generally were built of logs, and the floors without  
carpets. But the farmers had plenty of food and warm though coarse clothing. A dozen of fat  
hogs and a beef constituted our winters meat. Apples, peaches and cherries were so plenty as  
hardly to be appreciated. But grapes were scarcely introduced.</p></p>
