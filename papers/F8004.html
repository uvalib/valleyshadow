<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Oct 29th</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg,</p>
<p class="p10">Hon S. Cameron<br>Dear Sir-</p>
<p class="p10">My name has been used in combination with the Speakership of the House, and I
                    shall be a candidate.</p>
<p class="p10">I have been advised from several quarters that you are opposing me; and that you
                    are willing to concentrate on any other candidate who promises to be
                    sufficiently strong to defeat me,</p>
<p class="p10">Not wishing to do you any injustice I am unwilling to yield to the connection
                    that you are interfering actively in the contest, without affording you an
                    opportunity of contradicting it.</p>
<p class="p10">I certainly never dreamed of an issue with yourself because my humble name has
                    been used for the Speakership and my being a candidate, or my election, should
                    it occur, have never been <i>[unclear: denied]</i><br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>by one, or any
                    friend of mine that I know of, to be used to your prejudice If therefore an
                    issue is to be made, as has been intimated to me, by several of your friends, it
                    shall not be by my act, or by anything that I have countenanced.</p>
<p class="p10">Cherishing no hostility to any member of my own party, (one of whose members I
                    have regarded you since 1856) and having no ulterior purposes to accomplish by
                    reaching the Speakers chair, I certainly effect that the context for the
                    position will not be made to turn on any personal<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>interests; and, if
                    successful, as I hope to be, I would feel that I had been faithless to my party
                    were I to wield the position to the detriment of any one.</p>
<p class="p10">I have written you most frankly, and shall be glad to hear from you in the same
                    spirit of candor &amp; kindness.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AKMcClure</i></p>
