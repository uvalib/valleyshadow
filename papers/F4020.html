<h4>Franklin County: Alexander K. McClure to Eli Slifer,
                    June 21, 186x<br>

<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>McClure asks Slifer's help in securing a political appointment for McClure's
                    brother-in-law.</p>

<p class="p10">June 21</p>
<p class="p10">Chambersburg</p>
<p class="p10">Dr Sir</p>
<p class="p10">Judge Shaver of Perry Co is dead &amp; the Gov
                    will have a vacancy to fill.</p>
<p class="p10">I have written to Gov asking him in case he has no
                    special political obligations to discharge there, to appoint Saul
                        <i>[unclear: Lupfer]</i>, my bother-in-law. He lives in Shaver's district,
                    &amp; is a most worthy, competent and acceptable man. He was very strongly
                    supported for Leather Inspector under Pollock, &amp; was withdrawn by me at
                    Curtins suggestion.</p>
<p class="p10">I have never asked political preferment for a relative in my life, and feel
                        peculi<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>arly delicate about asking it upon Curtin. If
                        <i>[unclear: Lupfer]</i> were <u>not</u> my
                    brother-in-law I would, as I then could with <u>propriety</u>, urge his appointment as by odds the most judicious one that
                    could be made. I have written Curtin asking him to say frankly whether the
                    affiliation will in any degree embarrass him, &amp; if so, it will be
                    promptly withdrawn &amp; his wishes in the matter cordially concerned in.</p>
<p class="p10">I do not mean of course to charge you with any responsibility in securing this
                    appointment, but if Curtin has no special preference or duty in the matter, a
                    kind suggestion from you might <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> be of advantage, and I confess that
                    the appointment would be to me a special gratification.</p>
<p class="p10">I will go to Phila Wednesday morning.</p>
<p class="p10">Truly thine</p>
<p class="p10"><i>AK McClure</i></p>

                        Col Eli Slifer
