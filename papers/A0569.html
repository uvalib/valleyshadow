<p class="p10">Dear Mother </p>
<p class="p10">I recieved your letter of the fourth and was very glad to hear
     from you. We expect a fight soon now we have had one or two skermishes at honey wood mills we wer down there a few days ago
     that is about 20 of us working at a dam to blow it up whilst we were at work a body of men the
     other side of the river showered there balls amongst us from the bank
     of the canal from behind the stone wall but none of us were hurt we ran under cover and got our <i>[unclear: 
      carpiner
     ]</i> then Col Stuart ordered us to make for the dam and
     cover I was the first one to step from the house<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> which we were behind I made a
     slight <i>[unclear: 
      pass
     ]</i> to look for <i>[unclear: 
      afor
     ]</i> to fire at when I was hailed by a shower of balls which struck all around me we
     fired from four oclock PM untill dark two were killed on the eneymes side or badly wounded We have but little time for play we have to
     stay up every other night on picket there is one post 15 miles from camp four of us have to
     stand picket there some times when we start from camp and very often theris nothing to carry with us to eat we go out one morning and come back the next
     about 12 oclock without a thing to eat some times the neighbors send us something to eat<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br></p>
<p class="p10">There is no knewse here you can here more
     than we can for we are not alowed to go out of camp without a pass
     and then we cannot go out of bugle sound We are now placed 25 miles from the Ferry but Col Stuart sends one man to the Fery
     evry two days for the mail and boxes sent to us I am verry glad that you are going to make me some calico shirts make them like the linen
     shirts with pleated bosom and fix them so that I can change the colors you need not make any colars for them as I have
     plenty of white ones Direct your letters to the Fery How is little
     Adam. I did not see Mr. Mc C when he was down to the Fery</p>
<p class="p10">Your Affectionate son </p>
