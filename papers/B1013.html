<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Thomas P. Jackson to
                    Garrick Mallery, July 1, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Jackson's report on the condition of Bureau Affairs is optimistic due to the
                    prospect of good crops and the need for labor in Augusta County. He writes that
                    because of the demand for labor, whites are more likely to overlook the
                    participation of freedmen in "Radical" politics.</p>

<p class="p10">July 1<sup>st</sup> 1867</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Captain</p>
<p class="p10">In compliance with Cir. 6 S. 1866 (BRF &amp;
                    AL) I have the honor to report as condition of Bureau affairs in this
                        Div. (comprizing
                    the counties of Augusta &amp; Highland) that at the present time and in
                    prospect for some months to come the Freedmen in this district will be fully
                    employed at very remunerable wages. the bountiful crops of Wheat &amp;c rendering farmers willing and able to pay
                    liberally while those of the Freedmen who have rented land on shares or for
                    money will realize a good return for their labor. In anticipation of this and in
                    view of the abundance and cheapness of vegetables and believing also that it is
                    the duty of the prosperous to aid the needy of their own race I have not made
                    any requisition fo Rations for issue in July believing that <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>none will
                    suffer. I shall observe closely, and if I find any cases where want exists and
                    the full relief of which does not legitimately belong to the local authorities I
                    shall promptly report the same to the S.A. Com<sup>r</sup> of the District and request needed
                    supplies. This office is still sought by a large number of Freedmen who have
                    been <i>[unclear: overreached]</i> or cheated in settlements for labor
                    performed. As to these cases I repeat my former report that parties, as a rule,
                    are ready to comply with every requirement of the Bureau and make fair
                    settlements. The really important settlements will however as usual occur when
                    those working on shares have an accounting for supplies furnished to them during
                    the working of the crop and which <i>[added: supplies]</i>
                    are chargeable against the crop returns. I heard less of threats against
                    Freedmen in case they vote "Radical" as it is termed. I do not attribute this to
                    change of sentiment on the part of the citizens, but the labor of the Freedmen
                    is not absolutely necessary to the farmers and they think more of the <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>present benefit of freedmen than the prospective danger of a Radical majority.
                    The meetings which have been held at several places in Augusta Co. have been attended by a respectable "outside"
                    sprinkling of whites and no interruption has anywhere occurred. The Freedmen are
                    moderate in their ideas but to a man insist upon such legislation as will secure
                    them <u>present</u> rights in the <u>time
                        to come</u>.</p>
<p class="p10">In Highland Co. the Freedmen are few and will not
                    take any steps towards organization or public assertion of their rights, and
                    from the character and expression of the citizens as seen &amp; heard by my
                    at Court held at Monterey, they could gain nothing by any association. The
                    Freedmen left in that County are however generally well treated now as the
                    citizens find they leave at once if any undue pressure is bought to bear against
                    them. In both counties I have labored personally to instruct them in their
                    rights by meetings (public) in the evenings so as not to interfere with work on
                    the farms and <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br>I am encouraged to think that my endeavors have
                    benefitted both colored &amp; White and that a better feeling between the
                    two classes is the result of the explanations made.</p>
<p class="p10">Respectfully submitted<br>Your obt
                        servt</p>
