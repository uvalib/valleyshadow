<p class="p10">July 6<sup>th</sup> 1866</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va.</p>
<p class="p10">Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit the following report of the Action taken by Civil
                    Authorities in the following case of <u>Floyd Adams</u>,
                    freedboy, vs. <u>Madison Dooms</u>, white,</p>
<p class="p10">Adams is employed as porter at the Virginia Hotel at this place, on the afternoon
                    of Tuesday the 26<sup>th</sup> of June 1866, while calling his Hotel
                    at the Railway Station, an employee of the road named Madison Dooms stepped up
                    to Adams and after ordering him to leave the platform, according to the
                    testimony of some witnesses, in the preliminary hearing, before the Mayor of the
                    town, and according to the testimony of others, without saying anything struck
                    him a severe blow with a heavy Club <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>knocking him down - the affair
                    created considerable excitement it not being the first instance in which the man
                    Downs has struck the porters - the proprietors of the Hotel interested
                    themselves about the affair to such an extent that one of them was bound over to
                    keep the peace in the sum of $500.</p>
<p class="p10">The boy Floyd Adams complained to me and I referred the case to the Mayor of the
                    town, who after hearing the evidence, bound Madison Dooms in the fund of $100 to
                    answer to the Grand Jury. The Grand Jury, who commenced their session on the
                        4<sup>th</sup> inst., failed to find any inditement against Dooms, and he was therefore discharged.</p>
<p class="p10">The plea in favor of Dooms at the preliminary hearing, was, that he was obeying
                    the instructions of the stationmaster, who had instructed him to keep the
                    platform clear of the Hotel porters, that the platform was the property of the
                    Rail Road Co. Such a plea could not have covered an assault upon a white person.</p>
<p class="p10">In my opinion the action of the Grand Jury in discharging <u>Madison Dooms</u> from <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>accountability was an act of gross
                    injustice and the case from its <i>[unclear: prominence]</i> should receive
                    attention, the jury having literally given the white man permission to knock the
                    negro down without fear of molestation.</p>
<p class="p10">The Corporation Attorney informed me that he furnished the jury with the law <u>and</u>
                    <u>does</u>
                    <u>not</u>
                    <u>know</u> how they came to act as they did.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Sir, <br>Very Respectfully<br>Your Obt. Servant</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Geo. T. Cook<br>1st Lt 24th V.R.C. &amp; Asst. Supt.</i></p>
