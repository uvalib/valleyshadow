                    <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>

                <p>I received your letter, and immediately obtained an authenticated copy of
                    resolutions and ordinances of appointment of Commissioners on West Virginia
                    matters which I sent you by <abbr expan="Captain">Capt</abbr> Peck.</p>

                <p>We think it of the first importance that early action should be had in regard to
                    the adjustment of the public debt as the question of levying taxes the interest
                    depends, in a great measure, upon it, and the present Legislature ought to take
                    some steps toward that subject before the termination of session. I saw the
                    governor last evening and he enters into your views in good earnest, and will
                    tomorrow send the necessary papers to communicate with Gov. Boreman. He is
                    surprised to learn <pb n="2"/>through the message of the latter that he has had
                    no official information of the proceedings of our Legislature, and avers that he
                    sent him proper notice. The Gov leaves in the morning for New York, but he has
                    authorized his <orig reg="aide">aid</orig> de camp &amp; myself to have the
                    papers prepared and <orig reg="dispatched">despatched</orig> here. He agrees
                    that Richmond is the proper place to hold your negotiations hence so recommend.</p>

                <p>We are getting on slowly with legislation. I am pretty much all the while engaged
                    -- having been allotted more work to do than any other Senator and am besides
                    half the time presiding officer. The interest bill was mostly killed in the
                    House yesterday, but understand will have new life put into it in another form
                    -- and the stray law so impaired <pb n="3"/>by the decision of Judge Meredith is
                    undergoing repairs before the House Judiciary Committee. But we may tinker as we
                    please to gratify the people -- economy and labor -- can only bring property
                    &amp; money to us.</p>

                <p>The office of Governor is being looked to by a good many aspirants. I was at an
                    entertainment at <abbr expan="General">Gen<hi rend="super">l</hi>.</abbr>
                    Mahones quarters last night and met no less than <hi rend="underline">six</hi>
                    anxious public servants --Bolling, Goode, Keen, Gibbons, Sutherlin &amp;
                    Owen -- I am inclined to think the South Side will insist on a candidate
                    &amp; that choice will fall on the first named gentlemen. Baldwin is
                    regarded as a certain candidate. <unclear>Lymham</unclear> honorably mentioned
                    in same connection. By the way, a complementary call was written to you (by old
                    Mr. <unclear>McRuther</unclear> I am told) <pb n="4"/>but the Whig having shut
                    down on any name calls, it did not get into print. (The other papers publish all
                    such memorandum -- why does not the Whig do like wise?)</p>

                <p>The news from Washington inclines us to the conclusion, at <hi rend="underline"
                        >least hope</hi> that we may not be territorialized. The vote on the
                    proposed amendment has here a good effect. Fessenden seems to be the ruling
                    spirit now, and is esteemed to lean to conservatism.</p>

                <p>We had a terrible snow storm today just as church let out. I saw your daughter
                    &amp; spoke to her at the <unclear>monument</unclear> &amp;c.</p>

                <p>You have, I think, better put up at the Exchange when you come.</p>

                <closer>
                    <salute>Yours very truly</salute>
