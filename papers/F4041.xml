                    well know how gladly your letter was received</p>

                <p>On the same day that your letter came to hand I started for this place and been
                    here ever since and expect to remain here for sometime unless <del hand="h1">we</del>

                    had very health ever since I left home (not been sick one day) and I hope that
                    these few lines will find you all enjoying the same blessing</p>

                <p>While I am writing the sound of the cannons can be plainly heard in the office
                    and very likely tomorrow will bring with it the news of another victory</p>
