<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Feb 9th AD 1862 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp Justin</p>
<p class="p10">Dear friend </p>
<p class="p10">I have just red your very kind and affectionate letter
                    and received that charming keepsake indeed you could not sent me anything nicer.
                    I shall keep it sacred in remembrance of the kind hand that gave it. I did not
                    think you would take so much interest in my welfare but it appears to be a
                    common thing for the finest and loveliest ladies to take the warmest interest in
                    those who have the heart and courage to expose their bosoms to the glittering
                        beyonets of their foes in behalf of those who
                    are most dear to them.</p>
<p class="p10">I am enjoying myself as well as I expected but we have no singing or pretty girls
                    to go to see we have plenty of martial music and and <i>[unclear: light]</i>
                    cannon and rifles to amuse ourselves<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> with but if we could steal away
                    and spend some of our moonlight nights in the old way it would be very agreeable
                    but that is entirely out of the question we must not think of such things until
                    the war is over and then if we live we will try to make up lost time.</p>
<p class="p10">I am sorry to say that I cannot see you before you go I cannot go away from camp
                    more than few hours at a time for three months and by that time I may be a
                    thousand miles from here and maybe in my grave but while I live I shal be gld to hear from my
                    friend and answer them promptly. I do not know how soon we will leave but I want
                    to hear from you let me <i>[illeg.]</i> when I will. I have nothing to write at
                    present but if you write me a letter soon and direct it as the first I will get
                    it.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours Affectionately </p>
<p class="p10"><i>Lucius P. Mox </i></p>

                        Miss J. McChaffie
