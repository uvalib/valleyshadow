<p class="p10">My Dear Friend Maggie:</p>
<p class="p10">Though suffering this incarceration within the prison - walls of Pt. Lookout - thoug banished
                    from <i>[unclear: friends]</i> and <i>[added: the society
                    of]</i> much loved ones, I rejoice to feel the assureance that God is with us, and, we hope, will <u>turn</u>
                    <u>back</u> our <u>captivity</u> when we
                    are sufficiently humbled - that we may meet once more the kind - the sweet
                    embraces of our dear <u>relatives</u>, and <u>friends</u>. But we would not forget the sweet words. "Not
                    very will but <u>thine</u> be done. I wish I could be allowed
                    to write as much as I wished. I could have much to say
                    to you - This privilege is denied me. But may be, you would ask Why is it that I
                    appear as willing to continue the correspondence which has <i>[added: been]</i> so soon, and unexpectedly, cut short? I would
                    answer now, the same that I <u>would</u>
                    <u>have</u> answered on that <u>ever</u>
                    <u>memorable morning</u>, that it is as motive <u>no</u>
                    <u>less</u>, than a desire to cultivate the <u>friendly</u>
                    <u>relations</u> do not say, "there is none
                    <i>[unclear: ]]</i> in existence between us. With <u>your</u>
                    <u>sanction</u> our correspondence (though it will be rather
                    slow) will continue. I am pained when I think of my <u>uncivil</u> conduct, when in your presence that morning, and also, those <u>complicated</u> mysteries that I had boldness to write
                        <i>[unclear: since]</i> at the expence of one so <u>truely innocent</u> - Let me ask you to forgive me, and not only to
                    destroy these <u>letters</u>, but even tho <u>recollection</u> of them for
                    ever. I can write no more now. I will send you a stamp all I have. Brown
                    landed here a few days ago &amp; we both have slight colds, with that
                    exception we are <i>[added:

                    In form my mother that I have heard from <u>Danville</u> and <u>Mr. Kelso</u> -
                    they are <u>well</u> Their school is still going <i>[deleted: ]</i> Their children (<u>two</u>
                    <u>daughters</u>) are well also.<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Direct to Co "B" 2<sup>nd</sup>
