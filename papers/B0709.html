<p class="p10">In reply to your Communication of the 10<sup>th</sup>
     inst. requesting to be informed as to what
     <i>[unclear: place]</i> I am Entitled to transportation &amp; I have the honor to state
     that my appointment in this Bureau was recieved at my home in Ravenna Portage Co Ohio (near Cleveland) When I was transferred from Washington to Va I received a new appt for this
     state, but I think I am entitled to transportation to the place where I received my original
      appt (Ravenna). If it be so decided, I most respectfully
     request that it be issued via Washington, Harrisonburg &amp; Pittsburg - Having my family with me (wife &amp; infant) it <i>[unclear: would
     be]</i> utterly impossible to go by Stage to Winchester, &amp; I have business in
     Washington to settle before going to Ohio that requires my personal attention.</p>
<p class="p10">Very respectfully &amp;</p>
