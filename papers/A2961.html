<p class="p10">My dearest friend</p>
<p class="p10">I have just returned from my friend Rachel's &amp; thought I would write you
                    a short note my health is very good better than usual I think &amp; I am
                    trying to be very cheerful though I get the blues very bad some times. Pa has at
                    last consented for to have some waters &amp; get
                    married at home so I have chosen six girls though I expected to have 7 but I
                    want the privlege of inviting one gent <i>[added: as water]</i> &amp; will give you the same privlege you can invite a lady to wait as I have but
                    (on) six chosen but wish to know immediately what lady you wish. I have my two
                        sises R.C.E. Shuey, Kate Shields &amp; cousin
                    Josie of course I will expect you to have Mr. Linzy as a water to make the 6th I do not know how to spell the name; Oh how I
                    wish you were here that we could make the arangement you are so slow a bout writing I
                    think you are so careless a bout writing Willie dear
                    will you always be so it has a bad tendency <i>[added: now]</i> you can not imagin my feelings when I
                    think a bout it but then I think it will not be long
                    that I will be from you &amp; that you <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>will strive to make me
                    happy. Alas how long long did I await to hear these words <i>[added: the other night]</i> Kate I am striving to live a better
                    life to become a good Christian my dear one are you trying to do this Oh I do
                    hope you are you cannot imagine the joy those few words would create within in
                    my bosom I think the tryals that I have dayly would be nothing if I but knew that all that you
                    can do is being done; if I allow myself to think for one moment that you are not
                    doing that I almost shrink from the situation or position I have taken but I
                    feel that you are trying for I know you will not have me brake that <i>[illeg.]</i> no I know you want to make me happy
                    &amp; that will make us both happy dearest remember me in your dayly
                    prayrs but enough.</p>

                    would like to have the crowd together <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br>longer as they are so anxious
