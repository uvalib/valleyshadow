<p class="p10">Strasburg Va --</p>
<p class="p10">My Dr. Wife:</p>
<p class="p10">I have been off on a reconnaisance communication &amp;
     so have not written to you before since I rec'd your last very
     welcome letter -- I am glad you have gotten over the '<u>blues</u>' as you
     say -- dont let them get hold of you again -- they are poor comforters
     I reckon -- I never cultivate their acquaintance for that reason -- I got my bundle of things
     sent to Staunton -- hope it got through I sent it to the care of Maj. Bell -- There were 20 yds
     brown <i>[unclear: fullned]</i> cloth, 12 yds of Osnaburg -- 2 yds, wide gray cloth, 1 pr garters &amp; 1 pr shoes for you, 1 pr for Nelly &amp; 1 pr for Anna - - 1 lb of
     tea, 1 lb of Soda, pepper, a fine comb, a silk pocket hdkf,
     some cloth for sleeve lining, buttons, a box of patent thread a doz sps a spool of white thread
     -- some velvet tape to bind my coat &amp;c -- Take care of them till I come home &amp;
     make disposition of them -- Engage Miss Fisher to make me a suit of clothes before long -- I
     have not been able to find any shoes for Allen as yet, but hope I may yet find some - - Get a
     lot of candles made up if you can, tho' I do not see how you can
     are to get them or the materials for them. I cannot <i>[unclear: find]</i> my dress materials
     -- they are all picked up --</p>
<p class="p10"> We had a cavalry fight near Martinsburg, a few days ago, repulsed the enemy with much loss
     -- we lost some <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> Everything is quiet -- the enemy is in Harper's Ferry in force, but
     we picket to within 3 miles of there -- Old Abe paid the place a visit a few days ago and they
     went wild at the sight of their king -- We did not attempt to hold Harper's Ferry, we removed
     all our captures, burned the bridges &amp;c and then abandoned the place -- the enemy soon
     after occupied it -- The party that holds the Maryland Heights has the key to Harper's Ferry
     and so occupies it -- Our army is still not far from Winchester -- I am going back today, but
     am in hopes that I can come back up the Valley in a few days -- I was up as far as Woodstock.</p>
<p class="p10"> Mr <i>[unclear: Bayley]</i> was to carry up my bundle, I left it with Maj. Sam Yost at
     Winchester, where he is Quarter Master, and he promised to send it on --</p>
<p class="p10"> I have recovered from my attack of diarrhoea since I left camp
     &amp; have been riding about, and am as hearty as can be now - -</p>
<p class="p10"> Keep in good spirits my love &amp; hope for the best -- all will yet be right -- love to
     all &amp; kiss the babies </p>
<p class="p10">Your aff husband</p>
<p class="p10"><i>Jed. Hotchkiss</i></p>
<p class="p10">Write soon</p>
