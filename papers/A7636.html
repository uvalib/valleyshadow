<h4>Augusta County: John Quincy Adams Nadenbousch to
                    Hester J. Nadenbousch, August 23, 1864<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Nadenbousch writes his wife and describes the difficulties he has had in
                    attempting to go home for a visit. He encourages his wife to leave their
                    property to chance, and move to Staunton. He explains that he cannot come home
                    permanently for fear of arrest by the Federals. He also informs her he is
                    sending her an Irish servant girl, and itemizes the goods lost on his last
                    journey to Staunton.</p>

                                <u>rd</u>
                        </sup> 1864</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Capt H starts down the Valley in the morning and as
                    I <i>[illeg.]</i> not go for a few days yet, I will write by him. I have been
                    waiting for some weeks for the way to be open again so that I can get down but
                    it seems that it has not yet been open We some days hear that the
                    <i>[unclear: cooly]</i> are in Martinsburg &amp; then again contradicted so
                    we dont know what to rely upon. And to start from here
                    on an uncertainty of getting home it seems too far to travel. but I hope in a
                    day or two to get down, or so soon as I find the way open certain I will be
                    there</p>
<p class="p10">Freddy &amp; I are well and get along quite well he amuses himself in riding
                    the horses &amp; a little mule here We have written you several letters
                    lately. I sent you an Irish girl down to do your work, but I suppose she did not
                    go straight on as the Yankees were advancing up the Valley at the time &amp;
                    no doubt she was stopped at the lines. She went with M<sup>
                        <u>r</u>
                    </sup> C Stump who promised to send her to you so soon as practicable. I think
                    she will suit you. I wrote by her. If you are willing to come out I will bring
                    you out now. I most think you had better move out and let<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> our
                    property run chances. they can<sup>
                            <u>t</u>
                        </sup>
                    distroy the land &amp; I dont think the other property can be much hurt and if it does it can<sup>
                            <u>t</u>
                        </sup> be so much loss, at least not to be compared with this life we
                    now live.</p>
<p class="p10">Freddy is often wishing you here. I think to stay here would be much better than
                    for me to be there as here I can make some money &amp; live peacibly Whilst
                    to be there I would not be allowed to do business &amp; constantly in dread
                    of being " &amp; perhaps would be arrested and confined in prison which
                    would keep you Constantly in dread &amp;c &amp;c. And upon the whole I
                    rather think we had better live comfortably together whilst we do live &amp;
                    let the property go, or at least run chances</p>
<p class="p10">You asked me to let you know what things we lost in coming out We lost the Tea,
                    the lot of hats in the barrel My drawers except (1) pair, lost half of the sugar
                    &amp; the smaller portion of the coffee and the old clothes in the flour
                    barrel &amp; <i>[deleted: 1]</i>3 bags of oats the remainder we have here
                    all safe &amp; partly appropriated I dont mind the
                    loss, except the tea, but let it, &amp; I will try &amp; make some more.</p>
<p class="p10">We are doing a good business here now &amp; doing well</p>
<p class="p10">I expect to see you soon</p>
<p class="p10">Yours ever</p>
