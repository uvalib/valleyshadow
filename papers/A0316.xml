                <p>Your kind favor of Nov. the 20th came safely to hand a few days ago and as I have
                    a few leisure moments this cold morning will try and write you few lines, not
                    that I have any news of interest to <unclear>write</unclear> but mainly to let
                    you all know that I am still <unclear>alive</unclear> and well. We have but
                    little duty to do now <unclear>except</unclear> picket duty and have not had any
                    fighting <unclear>to do</unclear> the last three or four weeks but move
                        <unclear>camp</unclear> every day or two. Still moving back toward Richmond
                        <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> of our Regiment is out on picket now, been gone a day, will
                    be back this evening. Our picket <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> is twenty-three miles from
                    where we are at camp, but we only gave to go on picket every <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    day and stay on three days at a time.</p>

                <p>I was detailed to go on picket when a part of our regiment <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> out
                    the other day but got James Vance to go in <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> place by letting him
                    ride my <orig reg="mare">mair</orig> was glad to <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> it off for it
                    has been very cold ever since They <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> and the snow is about six
                    inches deep. Still <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> what we are having a <orig reg="cold"
                    >could</orig> old time of it - sleeping out without tents, but we build big log
                    fires, <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> make up shantys out of pine brush so you see <del
                        hand="h1"/> make out very well when it does not rain.</p>

                <p><del rend="none" hand="h1"/> heard from Sam a few days ago. he was very well <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    would have gone down to see him but they were <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> and I did not
                    know where to find them <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> Scott saw him he says that Sam was
                    cooking <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>

                    but they were so small that I could not <orig reg="wear">ware</orig> them.</p>

                <p><unclear>Sister</unclear> I thought that I would write this letter with
                        <unclear>pen and ink</unclear> but my pen is so bad that I will have to
                    finish it with my pencil I am almost ashamed to send this it is so badly written
                    and you can see that I have nothing to write that would interest you in the
                    least or would not fill up my letter with such foolishness--things that would
                    not intend <del rend="none" hand="h1"/>
                    <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> but I hope you will excuse <del rend="none" hand="h1"/> this <del hand="h1"
                    /> and I will try and do better next and for goodness sake, <orig reg="don't"
                        >dont</orig> let any persons see this <unclear>badly</unclear> written and
                    disconnected letter.</p>

                <p><unclear>Still</unclear> I will tell you how we are fixed about cooking there are
