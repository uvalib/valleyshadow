<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Frederick S. Tukey to W.
                    H. Woodbury, September 21, 1865<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Tukey writes on behalf of two teachers, a Miss McLeane and a Mrs. Dunn, and
                    pleads for the Bureau to not overlook the Shenandoah Valley where there has been
                    no schooling at all (presumably for newly freed slaves).</p>

<p class="p10">Sept 21st 1865</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton Va</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Friend</p>
<p class="p10">Yours of the 16 inst. is received and in <i>[unclear: hopely]</i> I wish to say,
                    that if American Missionary Society should decide to take Dist.
                    No. 1 and my proposition cannot be accepted on that
                    account, I wish you to see that Miss McLeane &amp; Mrs Dunn are again
                    Commissioned &amp; sent to Portsmouth they filed their applications at John
                        St. last May, and are both regular members of
                    the M.E. Church and have been for years
                    as their parents have been before them, and I understand have been laboring
                    somewhat for the association this summer at home, and forwarded them some money
                    as the results of said labor which I think should entitle them to some
                    consideration.</p>
<p class="p10">The children here in the Valley have never had a days schooling and I think
                    should not be overlooked for the benefit of those who have had school the last
                    three or four years.</p>
<p class="p10">Yours with Respt</p>
