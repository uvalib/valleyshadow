                    hard to make some disposition of it but it seems impossible to do it &amp; I
                    fear the only way to save it until after the war is for me to keep it open

                <p>Sometimes I think it best for you to come out here &amp; live &amp; when

                    &amp; what to do</p>

                <p>I assure you I am very anxious to be with you but I <orig reg="can't">cant</orig>
                    ask you to abandon home with all its comforts to come here with me for my own

                    it. I keep it so employed that in any event it will bring something. tell him I
                    will try &amp; take care of it for him at least &amp; if possible put it

                <p>Tell him to say the same to J. Wilson for his. I will try &amp; save it for
                    them as best I can. good chances for investment here are rare Let me know if you
