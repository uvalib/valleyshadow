<h4>Franklin County: Diary of J. Kelly Bennette, (1864)<br>
</h4>
<hr width="75%">
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>J. Kelly Bennette writes in his diary about the burning of Chambersburg and
                    describes the different attitudes in the armies toward private property, women,
                    and children.</p>

<p class="p10">30th. Scarcely had we time for our hungry horses to satisfy their hunger on
                Pennsylvania corn &amp; we  to snatch a hasty bite for ourselves when
                the bugle sounded "to horse" &amp; we are again on the dusty road. We have been
                driving before us all day a small body of yankees &amp; tonight concealed by the
                darkness they stop at every turn in the road &amp; fire on our advance guard
                &amp; although they did no hurt to anyone yet it made it very unpleasant to the
                advance guard. Arrived at within a mile of Chambersburg a little before day light.
                The first thing I knew of being in its vicinity was a dull "Boom"! &amp; a
                charge of grape came flying over us like a flock of pigeons. At this place the 36th
                    Batt lost another man killed. The yankees moved
                their position &amp; we went into line of battle &amp; waited for the other
                    
                Brig. to come up. While waiting I went to sleep
                &amp; when I awoke the town was in our hands &amp; on fire. A levy was made
                on the town thro'
                Gen McC. by order of Gen. Early for $100,000 in specie of 500,000 in U.S. currency toward paying for private property
                burned by Hunter. The Mayor being absent the demand was made known to fifteen of the
                most prominent citizens who replied that we as rebels against the General Government
                had no right to make such a demand; and moreover that Gen. Averill had telegraphed that he would be there in time to save them.
                    Gen. McCauseland immedi[ately] ordered the
                destruction of the town giving the women &amp; children two hours to leave
                &amp; remove what they could  but many of them made no improvement of
                the time thus afforded &amp; when our men urged them to save what they could
                they replied that we dared not burn it, nor would they believe that Gen. McC. meant what he said 'till the fire
                was in their homes.</p>
<p class="p10">The burning of Chambersburg was generally condemned by our Regt.
                at first when all the sympathies were all aroused, but
                when reason had time to regain her seat I believe that they all thought as I thought
                at first; that it was Justice &amp; Justice tempered with Mercy. That burning per se is wrong no one can deny; and the bare idea
                of turning out of doors upon the cold charities of the world unprotected women
                &amp; unoffending children is sufficient to cause the feelings to rebel. But
                there may be circumstances under which it is  not only justifiable but becomes a duty, - stern it is true but
                nevertheless binding. Thru several times since the
                beginning of this war we have had opportunities of laying waste northern cities
                &amp; private property generally. But instead of this we have pursued toward
                them a course uniformally conciliatory hoping by this means to set the war on a
                civilized footing &amp; thus protect our defenceless ones at home. Orders were
                issued that private property must be respected as we came not to pillage &amp;
                destroy but to conquer a Peace. Not what has been the consiquence of this
                conciliatory policy? From Princeton for 30 miles toward Raleigh C. H. you do not see a house, the blackened  chimnies alone marking where once the farm-house stood. From Memphis Norfolk
                &amp; N. Orleans women without number have been sent
                    thro' the lines not knowing where they were to find
                a home. Jackson Miss. Washington N.C. Guyandotte Va.
                a large portion of Lexington Buchanon, Fredericksburg Wytheville Va., Newbern N.C.
                Winchester Va. &amp; hundreds of other towns
                &amp; cities have been laid in ashes &amp; often not giving the women
                &amp; children five minutes notice. Private farm houses of which there are
                thousands are not mentioned. In Wytheville for instance when David St. Clair carried
                his sick child from his burning house &amp; took up its cloak to wrap about it
                he was cursed as a d--n'd rebel &amp; bid to lay it
                down, &amp; as  he passed thro' he had
                to steal from his own porch the sheep-skin on which his
                dog slept to shield his child from the cold night air. We are in this war to
                defend the women - if we try one expedient &amp; it
                fails we are recreant to our duty if we persevere in that expedient instead of
                changing the prescription. Now everyone knows that the conciliatory policy has
                failed - utterly failed - &amp; we are driven nolens volens to the opposite mode
                of proceedure. Instead of snatching from the hands of the ladies what they had saved
                from their burning houses &amp; throwing it back into the flames as the yankees
                did in K. Valley, or stealing &amp; destroying it as they did Mrs. Anderson in
                the Valley of Va. our men could be seen all over the
                city  checking the fire or carrying trunks, bundles &amp;c. for the ladies. How beautiful the contrast!
                It must be acknowledged that there were some who having become drunk seemed to glory
                in spreading destruction but it must also be remembered that many of them have had
                strong provocation.</p>
<p class="p10">Leave what remains of C.burg &amp; retrace our
                steps through St. Thomas &amp; after a march of 31 mls find ourselves at McConelsburg Penn.
                where we go into camp. 1220+25+31=1276</p>
