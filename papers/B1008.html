<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: Frederick S. Tukey to
                    John A. McDonnell, January 25, 1867<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Tukey writes about the failure of blacks to get labor disputes settled, as well
                    as the attitude of the local white population, which he views as very negative
                    towards the freedmen, except in regard to education.</p>

                        Capt.
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I have the honor to submit the following report of Bureau affairs for the Month
                    of Jany 1867.</p>
<p class="p10">About fifty complaints have been made at this Office during the present month by
                    Freedmen, the most of which have been claims against Citizens for labor. some of
                    which have been settled by <u>
                        Warrent
                    </u>
                    <u>Trials</u> before Magistrates with but little satisfaction
                    or justice to the Negro. Some by Refferees and some
                    are still pending settlement. The White Citizen seem to think that the Black Man
                    has no right to complain of his wrongs, no matter how grievous they may be he
                    must bear them all in silence, and if he ventures <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br>to make them known
                    it is a heinous offence for which he must be brutally
                    knocked down and beaten with the first thing that can be gotten hold of.</p>
<p class="p10">This is the rule. I am glad to say that there are honorable exceptions to it, and
                    am inclined to the opinion that the old prejudices are slowly wearing away. This
                    is manifest more particularly in their general demeanor toward the Colored
                    Schools, and Teachers than in any other way, for both (I think) are treated with
                    more respect than they were one year ago.</p>
<p class="p10">I am Capt. with <i>[added: much]</i> Respect<br>Your Obt.
                        Servt.</p>
