<p class="p10">I respectfully ask that Fifty ($50) dollars be appropriated by Bureau R. F. &amp; A. L.
                    to aid in building a School House at Churchville, 9<sup>th</sup>
                    District of Augusta Co. under following
                    circumstances. John Reed a colored man has had a school taught in his house by
                    his daughter Sophia J. Reed The house is small and owing to family matters the
                    school had to be discontinued. Reed has now given a piece of ground for a site
                    for a new school house, and some Lumber has been purchased and part delivered
                    for the building, but for want of means, the work is stopped. Reed is an earnest
                    industrious man and his daughter competent to teach such scholars as live near
                    the school house and the appropriation of $50 will insure completion of the
                    house by Spring.</p>
