                    Captain John Taggart, 9th Penn. Reserve Infantry

<p class="p10">August 28<sup>th</sup> 1863 </p>
<p class="p10">Camp near Rappahannock </p>
<p class="p10">
                        <u>Dear</u>
                        <u>John</u>
                    </p>
<p class="p10">I received yours of the 26<sup>th</sup>, Sam's of the 25<sup>th</sup>, Tilly's of 26<sup>th</sup>, together with
                    one from Cunningham one from Waterman, and one from a member of the Company
                    (Agnew) who was wounded at Gettysburg, and is now at home in Allegheny, all by
                    to-days mail. I will consider yours and Will's to-night. </p>
<p class="p10">The sword presentation to Gen<sup>l</sup>
                    Meade came off at Division Head Quarters yesterday. The presentation speech was
                    made by Gen<sup>l</sup> Crawford. Gen<sup>l</sup> Meade replied in a very
                    handome manner and was followed by Gov
                    Curten, Col
                    <i>[unclear: 
                        Ferney
                    ]</i>, Col Roberts and others -- After the
                    speeches came the feasting in which<br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> about Three hundred officers
                    embracing all grades, from 2<sup>d</sup>
                    Lieuts up to Major Generals, took an active
                    part. It looked quite gay to see such a congregation of officers all in sunday
                    clothes, and side arms. and it was truly astonishing the way Champagne and about
                    a dozen different <u>etcs</u> were disposed of. I a'nt going to "tell tales out of school" but I may be
                    allowed to say that I returned to Camp all right. </p>
<p class="p10">To-day we had a performance of a different character. We were marched out along
                    with the rest of the Corps to witness the execution of five deserters from the
                        1<sup>st</sup> division notwithstanding I have a <u>hearty</u>
                    <u>contempt</u> for all Deserters. -- more especially for
                    such as follow up the practice time after time for pecuniary purposes, and
                    believe they ought to be shot, to<br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> death as an example and terror to
                    such evil doers. I could not help indulging in feeling of commiseration for the
                    five poor wretches as the escort marched in front of the Corps to the "<u>Dead</u>
                    <u>March</u>" each criminal following his own Coffin, and
                    sitting down on it at the foot of his own grave, facing the soldiers who stood
                    ready to execute the sentence of the law. A few moments of preparation, the
                    Command ready -- aim -- fire -- a volley and the scene ends. You will read full
                    particulars in the papers, and it is unnecessary for me to say more</p>
<p class="p10">Mr. Kelly was up at the Regt today and stopped an
                    hour or so. He looks as well as I ever saw him. Burck Campbell called in as he
                    was passing this evening. He is well and wishes to be kindly remembered<br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> Now to business -- In relation to that money you deposited, -- if the Regt is mustered out in May as all think it will be,
                    or in April, as many think, I will have to square up. But then, I can manage to
                    save enough before that time to settle. I have about $100 belonging to the Fund
                    loaned in the Regiment. I will get it next pay day. The "fund" for which I am
                    responsible is about $260 or thereabouts which will leave me only $160 to deduct
                    from some pay day between this and settlement! You need have no hesitancy about
                    using the present deposit, and as I think we will be paid now in two or three
                    weeks. I can let you have more if you need it.</p>
<p class="p10">Give my love to all the folks. Respects to enquiring
                    friends </p>
