                    there has been another great battle over the river I was in it and came out
                    unhurt <orig reg="indeed">in deed</orig> I have escaped Wonderfully. Although
                    there was but one Officer in our regiment Wounded <orig reg="our">Oour</orig>

                    think it was the greatest Battle of the war, there was two hundred thousand
                        <orig reg="troops">troop</orig> on each Side, our loss is heavy, about
                    twelve thousand in Killed wounded and missing. Our line of Battle was 7 miles in

                <p><orig reg="Father">Farther</orig>, I never want to get into another battle it is
                    terrible Persons falling all around me. if I ever trusted in God I did that time
                    the fight was on last Saturday the 13<hi rend="super">rd</hi>" <abbr

                    all the hills and have breastworks thrown up, so it is impossible to whip them
                    behind their works consequently we have fell back on this side of the river. The
                        107<hi rend="super">th</hi>" done its duty like men it has great praise for
                    its gallantry.</p>

                <p><orig reg="Father">Farther</orig>, I Saw the Safe Harbor boys Pickel &amp;
                    Cline Young's son Just a few days before the Battle. it is Said the reserves
                    lost greatly in the fight I have not seen them since. The Weather is now getting
                    very cold the army is Suffering on account of the cold We <orig reg="laid"
                    >layed</orig> out in the open fields and woods without tents or eny other
                    Shelter for nearly one week before the Battle on frost and snow Whilst the <hi

                        >enjoyin </abbr>their good<pb n="2"/>warm beds. I wish we had them down here
                    with us for one week they would be Satisfied.</p>

                <p><orig reg="Father">Farther</orig> if my resignation would be <orig reg="accepted"
                        >exceped</orig> I would resign right away but there has been some half dozen
                    Sent in from our regiment but they were all sent back but one. therefore it is
                    no use for me to try it. My hopes we will go into winter quarters about the
                    first of the Year. our Paymaster has never Shown his face Yet. it is <orig
                        reg="too">two</orig> bad on the first of January there will be six months
                    pay due me ($600.63.) I think the next muster we will get it which is on the
                        1<hi rend="super">st</hi> of January.</p>

                <p>I am enjoying good health but I would Sooner be at home I feel now that I have
                    done my duty and would like to See Some others do theirs.</p>

                <p>I received a letter from Margaret with her likeness a week or two ago. also one
                    from William &amp; Sarah. I have not received none from Francis Since You
                    wrote I will write to him again <orig reg="perhaps">prehaps</orig> he does not
                    get my letters. I direct them as I did always.</p>

                <p>Give my love to Susan Cornelius &amp; all the rest and if I can get home I
                    assure You I will come. Hoping You all are well</p>
