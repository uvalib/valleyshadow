<h4>Freedmen's Bureau Records: R. M. Manly to Roswell
                    Waldo, October 28, 1868<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Manly asks Waldo to inform the Methodist Church in Waynesboro that they promised
                    to use their church as a school house for all children, regardless of religious
                    denomination, and Bureau funding was given to them on that condition. Manly
                    writes that the Bureau expects them to uphold their promise and keep the school
                    open for all.</p>

                    Roswell Waldo<br>Asst. Sub Asst.
                        Com'r.
                </b><br></p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Oct. 28</p>
<p class="p10"></p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir:</p>
<p class="p10">I am directed by the Asst. Comr. to
                    write to you in reference to the school at Waynesboro, referred to by you in
                    your communication to Capt. McDonnell of the 20th
                    inst.</p>
<p class="p10">Referring to the original application of Rev.
                    Wm. C. Echols for aid in erecting that house. I
                    find that he expressly states, in so many words, that the building would be used
                    as a house of worship for his church and as a school house "<u>for all children without distinction of sect</u>." On these terms the
                    grant of $150 was made. It appears therefore that the Methodist Church has the
                    right to the use of the house for Religious worship and that <u>the Public has the right to it for school purposes</u>.
                    Please inform the church of this fact and say to them that the Bureau expects
                    they will do themselves no discredit and their people no harm by trying to make
                    the school in any way denominational. Baptist and Methodist churches have in
                    many instances been aided in precisely the above manner.</p>
<p class="p10">Very Respy</p>
