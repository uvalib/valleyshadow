<p class="p10">May 31<sup>st</sup>, 1859</p>
<p class="p10">Frederick</p>
<p class="p10">My Dear Edw<sup>d</sup></p>
<p class="p10">I have been trying for two weeks to get a letter written to you, but never could
                    succeed in accomplishing it in time for the mail, &amp; in the evening, the
                    interruptions are more frequent &amp; my eyes not so well qualified to do
                    their part -- besides, all last week, I was suffering from styes. Lizzie
                    &amp; her boy have been here nearly four weeks &amp; that young
                    gentleman makes quite a sensation in this quiet, sober household. He has taken a
                    great fancy to his grandfather. &amp; the regard is mutual, for it is the
                    first child he even noticed. He is a very lovely, engaging little fellow
                    &amp; compels every one to notice him. Mr.
                    Williams is expected on Saturday to take them home on Monday. Mr Tyler goes with
                        <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> them- he has been detained here by settling &amp; arranging
                    unfinished business. It is now more than probable that you will find <u>us</u> settled in Georgetown when you get to Washington.
                    Mr. Tyler has nearly abandoned the idea of leaving us here, He thinks we are
                    both too delicate to be left alone, &amp; he would be always anxious,
                    besides many other things to be considered-- When Lizzie came she told of a
                    delightful house now going up, for rent, two doors from Dr. Grafton Tyler's,
                    &amp; the most desirable locality, in every way, in the place. When he goes
                    down, if rent &amp; all will suit, he will engage it &amp; if ready by
                    that time, we will go in the fall. There are two houses, alike &amp; he
                    desires you will tell Lizzie or Mr Mchaffey about it, for
                    we would love dearly to have them near us &amp; <u>they</u> would be so much nearer to Old Point. I suppose you have had your
                    sisters with you &amp; I wish I could have been there too, tho' it would have been a painful pleasure. Your Cousin
                    C- says she is longing to see you, &amp; we have been looking for you so
                    often, that she fears you are going to disappoint us <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> after all. We
                    are truly sorry to hear you have been so unwell--do take care of yourself. I
                    think our air &amp; water will be of service to you. We expect Susan Boggs
                        to night, with Lucretia, who has been paying a
                    little visit to Balt. Nannie Page has a daughter
                    a few days old -- she is well -- Mary Newport is just able to sit up a little
                    while during the day. Mr Page is still there, gentleman at large &amp; it is
                    supposed will remain until the Dr. sends him off-for you would suppose he
                    expected business to come to him. Gettysburg must be improving rapidly -- it
                    will look like another place to me, if I ever see it again. As to our leaving
                    here, with all its tender &amp; sad associations, I do not yet realize it --
                    the satisfaction at not being left behind, with your Cousin so delicate
                    &amp; nervous, prevents any other feeling from agitating me just now. Mr Tyler has been brother &amp; every thing to me &amp; I would not let him see any reluctance
                    on any part, to do, or go where he thinks it will be best for the interests of
                    all. Lizzie desires her love &amp; says when you <br><br>[<i>page 4</i>]<br> go down, she
                    means to take you round &amp; introduce you to some nice ladies. Mr
                    <i>[unclear: F]</i> too, intends to introduce you, if you have no objections to
                        Prof. Henry &amp; his family - his
                    daughters are worth knowing. I am truly sorry to hear Mr Wallace is so depressed
                    -- he is greatly to be pitied-- Why does John return home? He is entirely too
                    young for College- &amp; Sarah has a peculiar disposition which none but a
                    judicious mother, I think would know how to manage. They are the children of the
                    Covenant &amp; this is my strong hope for them. Expense haste &amp;
                    write soon to tell <i>[deleted: you]</i> us, we may hope to see you before
                    long. All join me in love to you. Mine to all friends. I hope the Great Head of
                    the Church, will overrule all the commotions in your church for his glory
                    &amp; your ultimate good--</p>
<p class="p10">Ever yours truly</p>
<p class="p10"><i>EHB</i></p>
<p class="p10">I am glad to hear Maggie H. has married well</p>
