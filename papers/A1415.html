<h4>Augusta: Robert L. Doyle to John Letcher, June 18,
                    1860<br>
</h4>
<p class="p10"><b>Summary:<br></b>Doyle writes to Gov. Latcher supporting the petition by a number of Augusta Co.
                    citizens to free convicted criminal James McMullen. He suggests that the witness
                    who testified against McMullen is not trustworthy and also mentions an
                    African-American accomplice.</p>

<p class="p10">18<sup>th</sup> June 1860</p>
<p class="p10">Staunton</p>
<p class="p10">Dear Sir</p>
<p class="p10">This will be handed to you by Mr<sup>s</sup> M<sup>c</sup>Mullen the wife of James M<sup>c</sup>Mullen who was sentenced
                    at the present term of our Circuit Court to Three years confinement in the
                    Penitentiary - The petition which she will lay before you sets forth, so far as
                    mere writing can; her strong claims upon the executive clemency The witness
                    against McMullen was one W<sup>m</sup>
                    Painter, one of the gang who for many years have infested the South bottom in
                    Rockbridge, he has not been long enough a resident of this section to have
                    acquired a Genl character - His testimony was verry remarkable to say the least of it. He said he was
                    sleeping in the same room with two other persons, one of them in the same bed
                    with him all men <i>[unclear: grown]</i> &amp; <i>[unclear: stout]</i>
                    there were other men sleeping in the same house all in the employment of the man
                    of the house - That after 12 o'clock at night he went out in his night <br><br>[<i>page 2</i>]<br> clothes to see about the horses of which he had the care, upon going out of
                    the house he saw a free negro man whom he knew very well coming out of the Smoke house, with a piece of bacon in his hand -
                    that he stood still &amp; presently the negro returned &amp; went again
                    into the Smoke house &amp; carried off another
                    piece of bacon that he then saw the negro &amp; M<sup>c</sup>Mullen come out from behind the Smoke house
                    with each of them a bag of bacon upon their backs - during all of this time the
                    witness said he stood perfectly still &amp; did not make any noise <i>[deleted: Th]</i> he then returned to his bed and said nothing to any of
                    his fellow lodgers - the next morning his employer missed his bacon - but now
                    Painter remained as dumb as an oyster upon the subject of his midnight discovery
                    - &amp; never said any thing about it for eight
                    days although his employer was making every effort to discover the thief.</p>
<p class="p10">McMullen I have known for several years - &amp; he has always borne the
                    character of an honest man of steady habits &amp; very industrious <br><br>[<i>page 3</i>]<br> His family are poor but of proverbial honesty in Bath County - You no doubt
                    remember M<sup>c</sup>Mullen as the driver of the stage from
                    Lexington to Goschen for several years &amp; know some
                        thing of his character - Knowing him as well as I do - I can not believe him Guilty of the charge preferred
                    against him by Painter - I hope and <i>[unclear: trust]</i> you may grant the
                    prayer of his poor wife, and believe that the act will not in any degree weaken
                    other sanctions of our criminal code</p>
<p class="p10">Truly Yours</p>
