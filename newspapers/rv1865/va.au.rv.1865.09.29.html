<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper expresses concern that the freedmen will suffer from poverty and
                    exposure over the winter. The editors posit that this condition stems from the
                    freedmen's willingness to listen to "false friends" and leave the plantations
                    and homes of their former masters in search of better work. The paper urges them
                    to remain faithful to their old masters, and applauds the initiatives southern
                    churches have taken in providing them with religious instruction.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The condition of the freedmen of the Southern States has excited the sympathy
                        and interest of their former masters in no ordinary degree. They feel that,
                        unless some inducement to labor and to remain steadfast to their engagements
                        can be offered them, there must necessarily be great suffering among them
                        during the winter seasons. It is a problem how this anticipated unpleasant
                        condition of the freedmen can be avoided or averted. They do not seem to
                        believe themselves free until they have left their old masters to live with
                        new employers, without contracts, or, if made, to break them at pleasure,
                        and swallow with avidity the councils of strangers, while the healthy advice
                        of their old friends, to keep their faith inviolable and to fulfill their
                        contracts, even if not seemingly so advantageous as some new and luring
                        offer, in order to promote their future prosperity, is almost unheeded. We
                        believe that nothing can prevent suffering among them this winter, caused by
                        erroneous impressions received from new and professed friends. Experience,
                        however, will teach some that they must follow the example of the bee and
                        the ant to be either comfortable or happy in their new condition. Next to
                        experience, comes the improvement of the negro's mental and moral condition,
                        to render freedom any thing of a boon to him. The various churches of the
                        South, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian and Episcopalian, especially, are
                        turning their attention to this subject and exhibit, in their desire to
                        ameliorate the condition of the negro, by rendering him more fit to enjoy
                        the freedom thrust upon him, real philanthropy, which is in direct contrast
                        with the shallow pretences and heartless schemes of the abolitionists, whose
                        every step but adds to his embarrassment by bringing him in conflict with
                        his real friends, with whom there should be no conflict. They do not care so
                        their own plans for self aggrandizement are accomplished. To show the spirit
                        of the Southern people, as expressed by their churches, we give the report
                        adopted by the Episcopal convention which lately assembled in Richmond,
                        merely premising that late Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist convenings
                        have taken somewhat similar action on the same subject.</p>
                    <p>"Recognizing the change in the social condition of the colored race, the
                        Church of Virginia desires to express her continued interest in the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Slowly but surely has President Johnson pursued his policy for the
                        restoration of the Union, nor, whether attempted to be cajoled by sickly
                        adulation, or dragooned by menaces, does he deviate from the path marked
                        out. He is to-day fighting the battle of a Republic of United and Co-equal
                        States against a consolidated despotism. Guided by the light of the
                        Constitution, he is pursuing the only course which will restore a permanent
                        Union. His conservatism surprises, as well as delights the people of the
                        Southern States, who had been led to expect a stern and bitter fate, and
                        will make them firm friends of permanent Union, while his conciliatory
                        measures must and will redound to the everlasting praise of Republican
                        Governments. Not only does his conservatism and conciliation meet with the
                        cordial approbation of the people of the South, but the Democracy of the
                        North have commended and endorsed his policy, and the conservative
                        Republicans of the States of New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania, recognizing
                        the fact that, the question of slavery being removed from the political
                        arena, there only remain a wise, conservative and conciliatory policy to be
                        pursued to reunite the old Republic on a firm and lasting basis, have also
                        endorsed his policy of restoration.</p>
                    <p>While the President is receiving the assistance of the conservatives of the
                        North, the South must add her voice in sustaining him, by sending, as her
                        representatives, men who have not been leaders in the Secession movement, or
                        in any way identified with its extreme measures. By such a course, the
                        Northern radicals, whose ranks are daily dwindling away, will find but a
                        meagre morsel, in the newly elected representatives of the South, upon which
                        to feed their fanatical followers. In fact we believe they will, as a matter
                        of self preservation, go over "horse, foot and dragoons" to the
                        conservatives.</p>
                    <p>The people of the South must look well to their interests in the selection of
                        their representatives, and if they be but true to themselves, their section
                        and the whole country, in the coming elections, a far brighter day will dawn
                        upon us.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One day last week, a friend of ours, residing in our neighboring town of
                        Greenville, was asked by an elderly gentleman, on horseback, to be so kind
                        as to direct him to the hotel of the town, which our amiable friend did in
                        as kind terms as the request had been made, and after the departure of the
                        gentleman, turned to pursue his business, little thinking that the
                        occurrence would again be brought to his mind. An old negro man, coming down
                        the street, passed the solitary horseman, and politely lifted his hat to
                        him, and upon approaching our friend asked him if he knew the gentleman.
                        Upon receiving a negative reply, said "why that's our great old General.
                        That's Massa Robt E. Lee." If a thousand Mortars had suddenly let loose upon
                        the town a greater excitement could scarcely have been created. The news
                        spread like wild-fire, crowds from town and country rushed in to get a sight
                        of the great and good man whom, not only the Southern people, but those
                        throughout the world, who appreciate true greatness, love to admire.</p>
                    <p>He was on his way to assume the duties of President of Washington College, to
                        which position, without solicitation, he had been lately elected, and, in
                        his unostentatious way, would have passed by unknown, but for being
                        recognized by the old negro, who had followed his campaigns. As it was his
                        advent into Greenville was an era in her history and long will she remember
                        the day.</p>
