<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial applauds the Virginia government's speedy course in
                    restoring the rights of voting and office holding to its citizens. The paper
                    favorably compares the situation in Virginia to that in Tennessee, where former
                    Confederates still cannot vote or hold office.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In response to the speeches of Emerson Etheridge and Judge Campbell,
                        denouncing the present government of Tennessee as an usurpation,
                        &amp;c., Governor Brownlow issued an address to the people, maintaining
                        that it is the lawful government of Tennessee, and contends for the
                        restricted elective franchise of the State, which prohibits former
                        Confederates from voting or holding office. Since the great desire is to
                        prevent bickerings among the people of the Southern States, on account of
                        opinions formerly entertained, and to unite all in a community of interest,
                        rights, &amp;c., the situation in Tennessee is really distressing. While
                        witnessing the harassing condition of the people of our neighboring State,
                        we are compelled to congratulate ourselves that we have the present
                        administration of affairs in Virginia. Our Governor seems determined to
                        restore our State, as speedily as possible, to her former prosperity by a
                        just and manly course, regardless of the sneers and complaints of some,
                        whose want of magnanimity and liberality to their unfortunate brethren is
                        unworthy the noble nature of Virginians. Our Legislature, in the same
                        conciliatory spirit, has placed nine tenths of our people upon the same
                        footing, allowing all who take the Amnesty and State oaths, (being entitled
                        to do so,) to vote, thus giving nearly the whole people a voice in selecting
                        our officers. Certain persons are prevented from holding office, but this
                        will obtain no longer than the convening of the next General Assembly, when
                        the voice of the people will enable it to pursue its conciliatory policy to
                        the extent of removing this restriction also.</p>
                    <p>With the policy pursued here there can be but little contention among our
                        people, and in fact, under it, Virginia is already beginning to show signs
                        of progress. It is not to be wondered at, with our present Government, that
                        the actions and feelings of the people of Virginia, are eliciting the
                        encomiums of the Northern press and people, and that it is confidently
                        asserted that Virginia, though most desolated, will be the first among the
                        Southern States to recover.</p>
                    <p>We feel that we are fortunate indeed and on this account do we sympathize the
                        most with poor Tennessee.</p>

<b>The Right Spirit</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This letter applauds Staunton's lawyers for preparing free of charge
                    applications for special pardon. It contrasts their generous spirit with "the
                    harpies of the profession in other localities, who are using this great

                        For the "Vindicator."
                    </p>
                    <p>The Right Spirit.</p>
                    <p>We are pleased to learn that the Staunton Bar--at least a number of the most
                        respectable members thereof--have determined to prepare the petitions and
                        give all other necessary assistance without fee or
                            charge, to such of their fellow-citizens of the county as are
                        excepted from the benefits of the President's amnesty proclamation and
                        require special pardon.</p>
                    <p>This exhibits the right spirit, and should, if the thing were possible, bring
                        the blush of shame to the cheek of some of the harpies of the profession in
                        other localities, who are using this great misfortune of their fellow
                        citizens to put money in their purses.</p>
                    <p>The people will remember this kindness on the part of the Staunton Bar, and
                        if there should be exceptions to the rule proposed, we hope they will also
                        remember the exceptions.</p>
                    <p>XX.</p>
