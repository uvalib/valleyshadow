<b>Tax Bill</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A summary of new proposals for taxes, drawn up by a special committee with
                    one member from each state, reveals that the new system would take one-fifth of
                    agricultural products, rather than the current one-tenth, and would use half of
                    that to feed the army. The new system would double property and business tax.
                    The intention of the new system would be to cut government expenses, to decrease
                    prices, to pay the army well, and eventually to replace the "hopelessly
                    depreciated" currency with a good currency.<br>
