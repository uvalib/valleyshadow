                <commentary>"The Dublin (Ireland) Nation publishes the following letter from a
                    Catholic priest at Orange New Jersey, explaining to his countrymen in Ireland
                    how the Presidential election was worked. The following is an extract from the
                    letter:"</commentary>

                <summary>The writer asserts that, in the recent Presidential election, Lincoln saw
                    the threat of democracy arising with the potential election of McClellen and
                    thus sent his "agents" to cities and towns across the North to bribe voters so
                    he would be reelected. The writer further challenges the Nation to print his
                    letter so that people in Ireland may have a true representation of American
                    politics instead of the propaganda that generally comes their way.</summary>

                <summary>A recent raid in Mississippi ended with many African Americans stealing
                    horses and mules from their owners and accompanying the Union troops out of
                    town, only to encounter mud, fatigue, hunger, and cold. The writer of the
                    article reports that the first to suffer were children, as their parents
                    abandoned them along the way. Twenty-two of them have been found frozen along
                    the road.</summary>
