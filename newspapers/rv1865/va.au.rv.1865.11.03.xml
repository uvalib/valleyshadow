                <transcript>
                    <p>Several weeks since, we asserted our belief that the radicals would resort to
                        every means to prevent the Representatives, lately elected in the Southern
                        States, from taking their seats in the next Congress, whether they would
                        subscribe to the test oath or not. Things seem to be drifting in that
                        direction faster than we had presumed. It seems that, by a law of Congress,
                        the Clerk of the House is required to enrol the names of all members who
                        present credentials which exhibit the fact that they have been regularly
                        elected.</p>
                    <p>There is not the shadow of a doubt that the lately chosen Representatives of
                        the South have been regularly elected, and consequently, in all reason, it
                        would seem that, upon showing their credentials, their names should be
                        enrolled, which would leave the question of their ability or inability to
                        take the test oath to be decided when they should come forward to take the
                        required oaths, and when, it was supposed by many, those who could not take
                        the test oath would be refused their seats. But there seems to be a
                        short-hand process developing which will accomplish just what we asserted.
                        The clerk of the House proposes not to enrol the names of any Southern
                        Representative, if his credentials do show that he has been regularly
                        elected, and even provided he is known to be able to take the test oath. The
                        consequence is that the clerk of the House, with the show of not desiring to
                        decide who is and who is not entitled to a seat, becomes the arbiter of the
                        qualifications of the members of the House instead of the House itself, and
                        by thus acting, conflicts directly with the policy of reconstruction which
                        the President has so earnestly and determinedly pursued. By this ruling
                        Messrs. Stuart and Conrad, who can not take the oath, on account of a manly
                        sympathy entertained for their unfortunate fellow citizens and their cause,
                        will be as likely to be admitted to their seats, as any of our
                        Representatives who can take the prescribed oath.</p>
                    <p>This, we fear, is but one of the impediments to be thrown in the way of
                        reconstruction. The right of suffrage to freedmen lately refused by
                        Connecticut, or something else more humiliating, will next be required of
                        the South, and so on, until, for the present, reconstruction will be
                        impossible. While we desire to see the Union restored as soon as possible,
                        yet we are compelled to agree with our contemporary of the "Macon
                        Telegraph." He says:</p>
                    <p>"We can <emph rend="italic">afford</emph> to take things coolly, as the
                        United States needs us and our services; they wish for us to be <emph
                            rend="italic">prosperous</emph> that we may help pay the mighty load of
                        debt incurred by the war; they need cheap cotton goods, which they cannot
                        obtain till social order is restored in the South; the world needs and is
                        languishing for our products, and will not obtain them till civil order,
                        peace and quiet allow us to restore our disorganized labor-machinery; the
                        North needs our trade, but until we can raise produce and make money we
                        cannot trade; nor will our people feel like turning themselves to productive
                        industry until all these disturbing influences in regard to the Union, and
                        State governments are settled and settled satisfactorily to us.</p>
                    <p>So peg away, Messrs. Radicals, peg away! you are only gnawing at the vitals
                        of the Union itself."</p>

                <summary>The paper announces that the Republican Clerk of the House plans to refuse
                    to enroll southern representatives, thereby denying all of them a seat
                    regardless of their ability to take the test oath. The editors proclaim that
                    such a policy is damaging to the progress of reconstruction and the cause of
                    Union, and anticipates harsher measures on the way.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>In the field of finance we confess ourself to be quite a novice, but
                        somethings, as well as others, are learned from experience.</p>
                    <p>We, in the South, have passed through a very trying financial experience for
                        the last four years, up to and including the present time.</p>
                    <p>We used Confederate Treasury notes, when they were par, and saw them
                        gradually decrease in value until they became valueless. When the currency
                        had fallen very much below par, we saw efforts made to bolster it up by
                        reducing the circulation by a discount of 23 1/3 per cent and by compulsory
                        funding. Many believed that the reduction of the amount in circulation would
                        appreciate its value to the same extent, but an old farmer, with whom we
                        took issues on this point, told us that step would be fatal, and that the
                        currency would decrease, still more rapidly in value. He agreed that the
                        loss of confidence in its ultimate value would more than counterbalance the
                        reduction of the amount in circulation. We saw that old man's statement
                        verified. The United States currency is below par at present. Secretary
                        McCulloch fears it may prove worse and recommends the same fatal compulsory
                        funding. This currency issue we have, or can have at present, and it is the
                        interest of the Government, as well as the people, that its value should be
                        appreciated. Tampering with it by legislating that it shall be reduced by
                        compulsory funding will have a contrary effect, we fear, to that desired. We
                        submit then that the present taxation, a reduction of the expenses of the
                        Government to as great an extent as possible and no greater inflation of the
                        circulation than at present, together with a gradual, as it must be,
                        redemption of the Treasury notes in specie, which should be promptly set on
                        foot, will be productive more good toward its appreciation than all the law
                        for compulsory funding that could be framed.</p>
                    <p>We trust that, for the good of the country, that no legislation looking to a
                        reduction of the currency by compulsory funding will be agitated, but rather
                        that its gradual redemption in specie may be considered by the next
                        Congress. Of course it will take time to redeem it, but by that means
                        confidence will be established among the people, that it will ultimately be
                        worth dollar for dollar as specie and confidence, we all know, has ever been
                        the great supporter of paper currency.</p>

                <summary>The paper comes out against the compulsory funding of government paper
                    currency in order to restore its value. A similar plan ruined Confederate
                    finances, the editors argue. Instead, the paper supports redemption of paper

                    <p>Emigration--The Petersburg <emph rend="italic">Express</emph> of yesterday
                        says that on Wednesday night arrived in that city the first installment of
                        emigrants from the old countries beyond the sea--hale, stalwart men, stout,
                        blooming women, sturdy flaxen-headed urchins. They come directly from Cork,
                        leaving behind the land of teeming population without lands, to work out
                        their fortunes in this [unclear] of agricultural wealth.</p>
                    <p>The encouragement of emigration should be the great object now of the
                        Virginia planter. For the present, at least, negro labor is unprofitable.
                        The colored man works reluctantly, not having yet unlearned his carefully
                        misconceived [unclear] concerning freedom, and the quickest solution of this
                        problem of labor is to ignore the race until they have learned their
                        necessities and responsibilities, engaging in their places willing workers,
                        men of strong arms and anxious hearts, who only ask opportunity to display
                        their energy. These Irish emigrants, coming from their hard-earned
                        starvation, will gladly throw their whole hearts into work which clothes and
                        houses and feeds their wives and children.</p>
                    <p>The harvest is here, the laborers are anxious to reap it, and it only remains
                        for the lords of the vineyard to send out for the unwilling idlers.</p>
                    <p>We cordially welcome these pioneers to Petersburg, and promise our exertions
                        to secure for them the consideration, legislation, and sympathy which will
                        furnish their success in their adopted country.</p>

                    <p>A refreshing instance of the gratitude of a negro towards his former owner
                        came under our observation yesterday. An old grey-headed veteran, of a
                        ginger-bread color, came into our counting-room, and, addressing himself to
                        one of the clerks, said he wished to subscribe to the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Times</emph> for his old mistress. While the address was being taken
                        down, we ventured to enquire in what capacity he was employed at home, when
                        the faithful old fellow replied: "Massa, I'se living on old missus' lot. She
                        is mity poor now, but used to be 'fore de confragration powerful rich. For
                        ten years old missus took care of me, and now she's poor, I'm gwine to take
                        care of her. I knows de proper way to act if I am a nigger, massa." Such an
                        instance of the fidelity of an old negro, who had once been a slave,
                        afforded so striking a contrast to the conduct of the majority of worthless
                        characters of that color who, as soon as the evacuation, took themselves off
                        without even doing so much as giving a day's notice to their employers, that
                        we think it worthy of public consideration.--<emph rend="italic">Richmond
