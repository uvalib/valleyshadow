                    challenging the agenda of the radical Republicans. Though the Democrats did not

                    <p>We do not know anything which challenges our admiration, to a greater extent,
                        than the heroic fight just made by the Democratic party of Pennsylvania and
                        Ohio against the radicals. They threw down the gauntlet, with the knowledge
                        that they would probably meet overpowering numbers, but like David they went
                        gallantly forth, with confidence in their principles, to meet the great
                        Goliath of Radicalism.</p>
                    <p>Fearing that the Democratic party would win, the Republicans cast off part of
                        programme intended to be played by them, and virtually ignored their pet
                        scheme of negro suffrage. By this, and a quasi
                        endorsement of President Johnson's policy, they defeated the Democracy, but
                        the vote shows an increase for the Democratic party. If the contest had been
                        waged on the question of negro suffrage, as it was in Connecticut, the
                        result would have been different, as it is the Democracy can rejoice over
                        the defeat of the Republicans on this issue, from the fact that they were
                        compelled to ignore it, or leave their policy entirely in doubt.</p>
                    <p>After the next Congress, the issues will be plain and well defined, and the
                        Democracy fighting upon principles based upon the Constitution, pledged to
                        the support of no measure that does not insure equal and exact justice to
                        all, with the prosperity and perpetuity of the Union for its aim, must and
                        will succeed.</p>
                    <p>Fight on noble old Democracy! Though the dark cloud of defeat overshadows you
                        at present, the bright sun-light of success will ere long dispel it. The
                        triumph of principles may be delayed but is eventually certain.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A short time since, judging by the acts of President Johnson, we called the
                        attention of our readers to the fact that, notwithstanding the immense
                        pressure brought to bear by the radical faction, President Johnson was
                        bending all his energies to the restoration of the Union on the broad basis
                        of the Constitution. That, step by step, having planted himself firmly on
                        the great charter of American freedom, did he move onward to the
                        accomplishment of the ends he had so much at heart, and which, attained,
                        would redound to his everlasting praise, and would result in a deep and
                        firmly rooted attachment to the Union.</p>
                    <p>We are now more than ever convinced that he firmly adheres to his [unclear]
                        intentions and need only cite his proclamation (published on our first page)
                        releasing, on their parole, Messrs. Stevens, Campbell, Reagan, Trenholm and
                        Clark, to convince even the most skeptical. By this act has he shown
                        additional generous magnanimity to an overpowered people and laid them under
                        an obligation they will amply repay. These gentlemen, freed from the
                        restraints of imprisonment, and having the confidence of our people, will be
                        the best co-workers President Johnson could have engaged to assist in the
                        great work of restoring a happy and prosperous Union. They will not betray
                        the confidence he has reposed in them and an immensity of good will follow
                        this additional step taken in the right direction.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"The Washington Union states truly that every State in the South which
                        participated in the late rebellion has returned to its allegiance, and
                        having in good faith sought with all the means in its power to take itself
                        out of the Union, has abided the issue, and now in as good faith seeks to
                        put itself upon its old footing in the Government. The change from a state
                        of war to that of peace and restoration has been swift and well illustrates
                        the wonderful energy of the American character. Prior to the first of last
                        April the Southern Confederacy reared its head defiantly, and though upon
                        the point of being hopelessly crushed, still threw the gauntlet to its more
                        powerful adversary. Six months have elapsed, and despite of Radical
                        interference and fanatical opposition, the work of restoration is
                        practically complete. On the first Monday of December there will be nothing
                        to prevent the representatives of the Southern States taking their seats in
                        Congress, and hence a completely restored Union, but the sectional agitation
                        and interference of the Republican party."</p>
                    <p>Thus speaks the "Scranton (Pa) Register," one of the earnest advocates of a
                        Constitutional Union.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing to prevent a completely restored Union, but the agitation of
                        the party, which opposes the President's plan of reconstruction. This plan
                        has progressed so happily, that, at the convening of the next Congress,
                        representatives, elected by the loyal voters of the Southern States, will
                        present themselves for admission. Whether they will be admitted or not,
                        depends upon the action of the Republican members. In nearly all the
                        Republican convenings the policy of the President has been endorsed. By some
                        this has been suspected as a trick, as meaning nothing but simply to fight
                        the Democracy without an issue, and reserving for the next Congress the war
                        against the President's policy. We shall then see whether, in reality, they
                        endorse the President's policy, and desire the existence of the Union, for
                        the preservation of which they have persistently prated, by which they
                        gained their great successes, or, by endeavoring to prevent Southern
                        representation, their acts do not belie their protestations, and show that
                        it is not the preservation of the Union which they desired, but rather the
                        continuance of power in their hands. If the Republicans act as it is to be
                        expected the Northern Democracy need not fear the result of future
                        elections.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have frequently inveighed against the horrible condition of some of our
                        streets and pavements, and hope, with the present desire for improvement,
                        they may shortly be put in respectable order, but until that is done,
                        persons who are compelled to move about at night, are, in many places, in
                        imminent hazard of bruising or fracturing a limb.</p>
                    <p>We are pleased to state, however, that our worthy fellow-citizen, P. H.
                        Trout, has a preventive for bruised shins, from bad pavements and open
                        cellar doors, in the shape of a pocket lantern, which, when closed, can be
                        buried without inconvenience in a side pocket, when opened and adjusted, is
                        a neat and useful lantern. Don't fail to call and get one and at the same
                        time examine his Kerosene Lamps, of all shapes and sizes. They are
                        economical, and Kerosene, different from the old Coal Oil, being without
                        smell and giving a brilliant light makes them very desirable.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Peck is very much pleased with the Lantern,
                        but about the Kerosene Lamps we don't know so well. He, like ourselves, is
                        in the Gas business, but in a different line, and may possibly recommend
                        Rosin as preferable to Kerosene.</p>

<b>Obituary</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Maggie Eskridge Newton, daughter of J. W. and M. W. Newton, died on August
                    13th at the residence of her grandfather in Greenville. She was 9 months and 9
                    days old. "At a time when deep affliction rested upon this household, the sweet
                    babe seemed specially sent to cheer the saddened hearts. For a few short months
                    it gladdened fond hearts by its presence. But death has claimed the jewel./ Its
                    mission is over,/ To cheer the darkened path of life, then soar/ From earth, and
                    point the way to Heaven./ Fair babe, it seemed too joyous and too pure for this
                    sad earth. Only a few weeks had passed since another infant of the same age was
                    committed to the silent tomb. The joyous song of childhood is heard no more in
                    that once happy home. May God comfort the bereaved parents and enable them to
                    feel/ "They are not lost, but only gone before/ To welcome us upon a happier
                    shore."<br>
