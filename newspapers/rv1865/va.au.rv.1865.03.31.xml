                    <p>To the People of Augusta.</p>
                    <p>The Central Committee at Richmond organized under the authority of the
                        Commissary General to procure supplies for our army and returned prisoners,
                        have appointed the undersigned a committee for the same purpose in the
                        county of Augusta, with authority to appoint sub-committees in each
                        magisterial district.</p>
                    <p>Under the powers thus conferred, we have appointed the committees hereto
                        appended.</p>
                    <p>We have authority to ask donations and loans, to make purchases, at such
                        prices as we may deem fair, for the use of our armies, and for the supply of
                        our prisoners who are daily returning to us in great numbers by exchange.</p>
                    <p>The demand for such supplies is most urgent, and delay in furnishing them may
                        be fatal.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately for the reputation of our county the people of Augusta at their
                        February Court had to some extent, anticipated this appeal--on that day
                        sixty five gentlemen contributed more than 100 barrels of flour, 8000 pounds
                        of meat, and largely over $100,000 in government bonds to this patriotic
                        object.</p>
                    <p>This was a good beginning, and we earnestly appeal to the people of Augusta
                        not to let this good work, which they have so nobly commenced, fail for the
                        want of energy and liberality. Other counties are already following our
                        example. Augusta was the first to inaugurate this system of county
                        appropriations for the indigent families of our soldier's which has been
                        promptly followed throughout the Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>Let us earn a new title to the esteem and gratitude of our country by another
                        exhibition of generous patriotism.</p>
                    <p>All that we have is at stake in the present contest. If the issue be
                        unfavorable we will hold our liberty, our property our lives at the will of
                        the enemy. We had nothing to do in bringing on the war. It was forced on us
                        against our will--our only hope is in making our defence successful. It
                        would be better for us to give all we have than be reduce to slavery. We
                        have gallant armies under glorious leaders in the field, and twenty thousand
                        of our bravest brothers recently freed from captivity, are hastening to
                        swell their ranks, fired by the recollections of wrongs and injuries
                        suffered during their imprisonment. Our present need is food to sustain
                        them. Let it not be said that we are ungrateful to those who are perilling
                        [sic] their lives for our defence. Let every man contribute what he can to
                        their support. Let them be cheered by our sympathy. Let no one hold back
                        because he has not much to give. Remember that the widows mite freely
                        bestowed was more acceptable than abundance grudgingly given.</p>
                    <p>We repeat the need for immediate relief is urgent--Let not those whose
                        hearts, during a long season of captivity, yearned for their father-land,
                        suffer destitution and hunger on their return.</p>
                    <p>Our patriot here Lee appeals to you to feed his veteran host--will you turn a
                        deaf ear to his appeal? Will you weary in well doing? To them who cannot
                        afford to give, we appeal to lend what they can spare, to be replaced after
                        harvest, or to sell it at the market price. We and those cooperating with us
                        have full authority to buy.</p>
                    <p>Recent events in our Valley have shown the folly of withholding supplies from
                        our troops. Had Early's army been supported in the Valley, instead of being
                        disbanded for want of food and forage, the recent raid of Sheridan which
                        laid waste the Valley and the Piedmont district could have been checked.
                        Sheridan found the supplies wherever he went, which were withheld from our
                        own soldiers. He reported to his Government that he found food and forage
                        enough in a single county to support his whole army for two months. Had one
                        half of this been furnished to our troops our army would have been retained
                        in an effective condition, and the invaders would have been defeated and our
                        homes saved from desolation.</p>
                    <p>Let the past teach us a lesson of wisdom. Let the people assemble in each
                        magisterial district and stimulate one another to patriotic effort. Let the
                        clergy unite in pushing on this pious work. Let the women of the county, the
                        mothers and wives and sisters of the gallant men who are upholding our flag,
                        not withhold their countenance and assistance. Let the whole community show
                        that it is in earnest. Let those capable of speaking exhort and explain to
                        those who are backward, the folly of withholding. We are persuaded that if
                        we make one more earnest, and self-sacrifising [sic] effort, victory will
                        crown our struggle.</p>
                    <p>Let old Augusta again signalise [sic] herself by her generous devotion to the
                        public welfare. She can give 1000 barrels of flour, 100,000 pounds of meat
                        and a million dollars in bonds. Let us see that she does her full duty.</p>
                    <p>Those who hoard provisions will find they are laying up stores for the enemy.</p>
                    <p>They will find that they are contributing to their own subjugation.</p>
                    <p>The committees in each district will report to Major Tate the amount of
                        contributions received with the names of the donors so that they may be
                        published weekly in the newspapers of Staunton. This will furnish assurance
                        to every contributor that his donation is fairly applied to the support of
                        the army around Richmond.</p>
                    <p>Fellow Citizens--Your destinies, under Providence are in your own hands--our
                        fathers achieved independence through much tribulation--your liberties can
                        be established only by earnest, steady, and persistent exertion. Gird
                        yourselves for this great effort, and the God of our fathers will crown your
                        exertions with victory.</p>

                <summary>The Central Committee at Richmond under the authority of the Commissary
                    General organized a committee in Augusta County to procure supplies for the
                    army. The demand for supplies is urgent. The people of Augusta have a good
                    beginning, in that on Court Day in February, sixty-five gentlemen donated more
                    than 100 barrels of flour, 8000 pounds of bacon, and more than $100,000 in
                    government bonds for this purpose. Other counties are following the example of
                    Augusta, which was the first to institute this system of county appropriations
                    for indigent families of soldiers. Recent events in the Valley demonstrate the
                    need for amply supplying the troops. Early's men had to be dispersed since they
                    could not be adequately supplied, resulting in their absence when Sheridan's
                    troops came through the area scavenging for supplies. Sheridan reported that
                    within a single county he found enough food to supply his army for two months.
                    Had the public not withheld these supplies, there would have been enough to
                    furnish Early's men, and they never would have left in the first place. Augusta
                    should be able to give 1000 barrels of flour, 100,000 pounds of meat, and
                    $1,000,000 in bonds. The committee is composed of Alexander H. H. Stuart, M. G.
                    Harman, and George Baylor. Committees representing districts in the county are
                    as follows: Staunton No. 1--John D. Brown, H. H. Peck, J. W. Hudson; Staunton
                    No. 2--C. R. Mason, W. A. Bell, John Trimble; Mount Solon--J. G. Fulton,
                    Washington Swink, R. H. Dudley; Mount Sidney--W. H. Gamble, J. C. Roler, William
                    Crawford; Waynesboro--George A. Bruce, Dr. Samuel Kennerly, Jacob Killian;
                    Churchville--Dr. R. S. Hamilton, J. W. Calhoun, Henry B. Seig;
                    Greenville--William F. Smith, Archibald McPheeters, Dr. John Tate;
                    Middlebrook--Jacob Baylor, A. S. Turk, Dr. R. A. McChesney; New Hope--Samuel B.
                    Finley, Dr. B. F. Walker, William Patterson. Public meetings will be held, with
                    addresses from Alexander H. H. Stuart, John B. Baldwin, Hugh W. Sheffey, and
                    other men. The meetings are at Staunton, March 27; Mount Sidney, April
                    [illegible]; New Hope, April 5; Waynesboro, April 8; Greenville, April 10;
                    Middlebrook, April 13; Churchville, April 15; Mt. Solon, April 17.</summary>

                    <p>For the Vindicator.</p>
                    <p>Camp Ewell, Feb. 16th 1565 [sic].</p>
                    <p>At a meeting of the Non-Commissioned Officers and Privates of the 5th Va.
                        Inft'y convened for the purpose of taking into consideration the propriety
                        of petitioning the Congress of the Confederate States, to permit the
                        Stonewall Brigade to re-organize:</p>
                    <p>On motion, Preston Tood was called to the Chair and A.J. Deakins appointed
                        Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The following resolutions were presented, considered seperately [sic], and
                        adopted.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph> 1st, That in the opinion of the men now
                        present, it would be inexpedient and injurious to consolidate this Brigade
                        with any other Brigades, Regiments or Companies and to appoint Officers of
                        the line to command them.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph> 2d, Owing to the great reduction of our
                        numbers, both in officers and men; we feel conscious of inability to sustain
                        our old and former reputation, and being desirous of handing down to
                        posterity the name given to this Brigade by "that Hero of many Battles," as
                        near untarnished as possible; Be it therefore</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph> 3d, That we petition the Congress of the
                        Confederate States to permit this Brigade to re-organize, into one Regiment
                        of Cavalry or mounted Inft'y, to be called the Stonewall Regiment, with
                        permission to elect the Officers of the line, from the officers and men that
                        may be present;</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph> 4th, That we cordially and heartily
                        approve of the course pursued by our Commissioners, Stevens, Hunter and
                        Campbell, in their conference with Messrs Seward and Lincoln, and that we
                        pledge ourselves to follow our illustrious Chieftain Robt. E Lee, until the
                        last one of our foes are driven from our beloved soil, or until we shall
                        find a soldier's grave.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph> 5th, That we appoint a committee of six
                        to confer with, and invite the 2d, 4th, 27th and 33d Regiments to co-operate
                        with us;</p>
                    <p>On motion, the following named men were elected to compose the committee:
                        John C. Baskin, Co "L," C.J. Bell, Co "D," Serg. Koiner, Co "H," B Horn, Co
                        "I," -- Britton, Co "E," -- Spitler, Co "C."</p>
                    <p>On motion, the Chairman was added to the committee.</p>
                    <p>On motion, the meeting adjourned to meet again when called by the chairman.</p>
                    <p>Preston Todd, Chairman.</p>
                    <p>A.J. Deakins, Secretary.</p>

                <summary>A meeting of non-commissioned officers and privates of the 5th Virginia
                    Infantry convened to consider petitioning the Confederate Congress to permit the

                    and A. J. Deakins to be secretary. The group adopted resolutions stating their
                    opinion that consolidating their brigade with any others would be inexpedient
                    and injurious, that they are so greatly reduced in number that they can no
                    longer maintain their reputation as the Stonewall Brigade, and that they should
                    be reorganized into a Stonewall Regiment. Further, they endorse the attempts by
                    the peace delegation from the Confederacy and pledge their support of General

                <summary>The interruption of mail service means that the Vindicator has received no
                    other newspapers since March 22, 1865, and thus that war news is scarce.
                    Unconfirmed reports relate that a fight between Johnson and Sherman on March 19
                    resulted in an enemy loss of killed, wounded, and captured of 4500, and in a
                    small loss for the Confederates. Other unconfirmed reports state that Lee
                    advanced on Grant but then withdrew to his original line and that enemy troops
                    near Winchester are preparing for movement in some undetermined direction.</summary>

                <summary>A wind blew in the end of a three-story building used as a wash house at
                    Staunton's General Hospital last Thursday. The falling wall and floors injured
                    several African Americans who were in the building and buried four children
                    under the debris. Two of them were burned to death, another died Sunday night
                    from injuries received in the accident, and one was uninjured.</summary>

                <summary>The Grand Jury of Augusta County was impaneled and charged last Monday.
                    They retired and within a short time reported through their foreman that nothing
                    had taken place since the sitting of the previous Grand Jury that required any
                    action. They were then discharged. The editor doubts such a report has been made
                    before in the county court and asserts that the morals of "Old Augusta, in these
                    troublous times, are extremely good."</summary>
