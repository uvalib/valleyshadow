<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer asserts that, in the recent Presidential election, Lincoln saw
                    the threat of democracy arising with the potential election of McClellen and
                    thus sent his "agents" to cities and towns across the North to bribe voters so
                    he would be reelected. The writer further challenges the Nation to print his
                    letter so that people in Ireland may have a true representation of American
                    politics instead of the propaganda that generally comes their way.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

<b>The Fool Nigger and their Friends</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A recent raid in Mississippi ended with many African Americans stealing

                    article reports that the first to suffer were children, as their parents
                    abandoned them along the way. Twenty-two of them have been found frozen along
                    the road.<br>
