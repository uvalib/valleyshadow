                <summary>The issue of amending the United States Constitution to abolish slavery was
                    discussed in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, and the members
                    expressed their positions on the subject. This article surveys their positions,
                    identifying some of the arguments for and against such an amendment and
                    discussing what the original Framers of the Constitution intended on the issue
                    of slavery.</summary>

                    <p>Gen'l Sherman on Slavery.</p>
                    <p>From gentleman who had several consultations with Gen. Sherman recently, the
                        Augusta Constitut[i]onalist learns, he says slavery will exist in the South
                        after the conclusion of peace, let the war terminate as it may; that
                        Lincoln's proclamation in reference to its abolition are simply means for
                        the restoration of the Union, that the Supreme Court have, nor will not
                        sustain him, neither will the Federal Government attempt to abolish slavery,
                        but will leave it to the States returning to the Union to settle it, and
                        that he [Sherman] expects to own a thousand slaves in the South one of these
                        days.</p>
                    <p>He represents Sherman as being a thorough fanatic upon the subject of
                        restoring the "glorious Union."</p>

                <summary>General Sherman contends, according to this article, that Lincoln is using
                    the abolition issue to gain support in the North to restore the Union. However,
                    after war's end, Lincoln will not have the legal backing to enforce such a
                    position state by state. Therefore, slavery will continue after the war, because
                    Southern states will chose to continue it.</summary>

                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>The lines below Richmond and Petersburg are quiet, the men busily engaged in
                        repairing damaged done by the late rains. No immediate engagement is
                        expected on either side of the river, though several transports laden with
                        troops, (mostly black) have been seen ascending the river.</p>
                    <p>From Charleston we learn that our army is advantageously disposed along the
                        line of the road between Hardeeville and Charleston.</p>
                    <p>The enemy is estimated to number about 50,000--a portion of whom will, it is
                        expected, be left as a garrison at Savannah, together with a number of negro
                        troops.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that as soon as the enemy completes his arrangements, a
                        combined land and naval attack will be made on Charleston--the land attack
                        from the direction of Savannah.</p>
                    <p>The negroes taken by Sherman are leaving him in large numbers--an officer
                        having met one crowd, numbering at least 1500, on their returns to their
                        homes, their treatment having been so different from what was promised.</p>
                    <p>Our informant also states that a large number of negro children were either
                        jostled into the river by the treacherous Yankees, or thrown in by their
                        deluded mothers, their captors having told them they could not take them
                        along.</p>
                    <p>The following dispatch to the war department gives an account of the success
                        of Gen. Rosser, and his gallant command during their recent trip to the
                        mountains.</p>

                    <p>General Early reports that General Rosser, at the head of three hundred men,
                        surprised and captured the garrison at Beverly, Randolph county, on the 11th
                        instant, killing and wounding a considerable number and taking five hundred,
                        and eighty prisoners. His loss slight.</p>

                    <p>The Richmond papers of Tuesday gave us the intelligence that Fort Fisher, our
                        principle defensive work, at the mouth of the Cape Fear river, 30 miles
                        below Wilmington had been taken by the enemy, at 10 o'clock on Sunday night.
                        There are other works, and various obstructions to be overcome before the
                        enemy can get to Wilmington.</p>
                    <p>The following official report giving all the particulars that are yet known
                        of the fall of this place was received at the War office.</p>

                    <p>"General Bragg reports that the enemy bombarded Fort Fisher furiously all day
                        yesterday. At 4 P.M., their infantry advanced to the assault--a heavy
                        demonstration at the same hour being made against their rear by our troops.</p>
                    <p>"At half-past six P.M., General Whiting reported that their attack had
                        failed, and the garrison was being strengthened with fresh troops.</p>
                    <p>"About 10 P.M. the fort was captured with most of its garrison.</p>

                    <p>Stonewall Brigade.</p>
                    <p>One of our Richmond co[n]temporaries has called attention, on two separate
                        [sic] occasions, to the wants of our noble "Stonewall Brigade."</p>
                    <p>They are in need of clothes to keep them warm. they do not complain but we
                        understand they suffer for many comforts. The men composing this Brigade are
                        from our own midst--our own friends and relatives--and can be supplied with
                        many things needful to them by us. If our people will but make the effort it
                        need not be more than a very few days before these gallant men, who
                        participated in the glory and will share the fame of the immortal Jackson,
                        may be made comfortable for the winter. Let our ladies undertake this matter
                        and we are satisfied our poor boys will not suffer long. To keep the
                        soldiers from our midst comfortable while hazarding all for us is clearly an
                        imperative duty, and its [illegible].</p>

                    <p>Head Qr's Pegram's Brigade,</p>
                    <p>January 4th, 1865.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">Ladies of the Churchville soldiers Aid Society,</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>The collation prepared by you for this Brigade, after some delay, reached us,
                        and was I assure you, enjoyed not less on account of those from whom it
                        came, than for its own sake. It was certainly an enlarged quantity which
                        prompted the ladies of a single neighborhood to attempt the preparation of a
                        feast for a whole Brigade; and the success with which it was accomplished is
                        highly gratifying to philanthropic observers, but was especially so to the
                        hardy soldiers who participated in the repast.</p>
                    <p>At the commencement of the war when means were abundant, exuberant liberality
                        toward the devoted men who so promptly went forth to battle for their
                        country, was a thing of course. But now, when supplies are difficult of
                        attainment, the sustained effort to bestow when the veterans still in the
                        field, something of the comforts that before the war they were wont to
                        enjoy, is worthy ever of the incomparable women of our own country. Nor is
                        such worthy example without its parallel in the army--where, even when the
                        foe presses most pertinaciously, true soldiers resolve the more stub[b]ornly
                        never to yield, and strike the more vigorously for their honor and their
                        freedom.</p>
                    <p>From the plains that border the Potomac--from the mountain bound Valley where
                        the Cacapon winds its way--and from the green hills far away beyond the
                        Alleghanies, come patriotic and gallant men of this Brigade, who for long
                        years, and in countless conflicts, have battled side by side with patriotic
                        and gallant men from Augusta. Their mothers sit sadly at the door where they
                        do not come; their wives go about their domestic duties with distracted air;
                        and their little children, when the day is done and they gather around the
                        domestic hearthstone, with earnest words enquire when their father will
                        return--and ever a lone heart echoes mournfully--"When Oh! when will their
                        father return!["] These are encompassed by watchful and implacable enemies.
                        No carefully prepared delicacy, no fondly wrought token, not even an
                        encouraging message, may find its way from them to the heroic men who in the
                        Camp and in the field--during the weary toil of the day and in the lone
                        watch of the night, think of those at home whom they love. But the women of
                        Augusta have ever generously divided their provident offerings between their
                        own cherished friends and the strangers whom they know only as soldiers
                        battling for a common cause.</p>
                    <p>The brave and faithful soldiers in our service will not always be separated
                        from their mothers, their wives, and the maidens they love. This protracted
                        war must one day have an end--and it can have but one termination. He who
                        controls the Universe, yet watches the sparrows flight, does not intend that
                        the delicate daughters of Virginia shall be the bond-women, or far worse,
                        the wives of ar[r]ogant puritans of New England. And when each brave soldier
                        shall have fought the fight--and finished the work before him, and the hand
                        of dissolution shall be lifted from his house, and his own fig tree shall
                        again bear fruit and his vine pour out its juice, and the trials and perils
                        of the great war shall be told to loving listeners, the patriotic kindness
                        of the noble dames and beautiful damsels of Augusta shall not be forgotten.</p>
                    <p>Most Respectfully,</p>

                        through Lt. M.C. Garber. Such substantial Testimonials of Remembrance by the
                        fair ones for whom we have been battling for near four years emblazons their
                        names upon the tablets of our memory, undoubedtly [sic] cheers our soul,
                        warmes [sic] our hearts, and nerves our arms "For deeds more great" in their
                        defence.</p>
                    <p>At the same time Mr. Editor allow me to thank you for the commendable
                        discretion exercised in reference to the communication sent by myself to you
                        for publication. Upon calm and mature reflection, I confess it was premature
                        and unjust, and regret exceedingly even the harsh thoughts indulged in
                        ignorance of the real facts, and the impulse of the mement [sic] are
                        palliating circumstances for the indiscretion. Once more we sincerily [sic]
                        thank our friends and the cittizens [sic] of Staunton and the County for
                        their kindly efforts and liberal contributions for our benefits, though we
                        received it not.</p>
