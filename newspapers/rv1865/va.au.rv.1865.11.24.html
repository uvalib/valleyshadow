<b>Anti-Marriage Movement</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports on a spreading, world-wide movement against marriage
                    begun by bachelors concerned with the expense of "keeping a wife."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Several of the impecunious bachelors of New York, according to the World, have formed an anti-marriage compact among
                        themselves. The high price of the marriageable "dears" of New York, and the
                        vast expenditures required at the present day to support them in their
                        extravagances, have induced this anti-marital movement. This crusade against
                        extravagance was originally started in Marseilles, and afterwards spread to
                        London, whence it was imported to New York. A committee to which was
                        referred the duty of framing a history and purposes of the organization,
                        reported among other items, the following table of statistics which, if the
                        accounts therein be true, would seem to authorize the formation and
                        practical exercise of the Anti-Marriage-under-some-condition-Club."</p>
                    <p>Your Committee have also prepared the following table of statistics in
                        reference to the cost of maintaining a wife, and only add that they have
                        been as carefully prepared as the necessarily limited knowledge of the
                        committee enable them:</p>
                    
                        
                            Dress, per year, at least

                        lessen these figures.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial applauds the merciful petitions for forgiveness that
                    northern and southern women have tendered on behalf of Jefferson Davis. The
                    paper contrasts that spirit to the positions of those who wish to punish him.
                    The editors argue that no northern soldiers who actually fought in the field
                    entertain such vindictive opinions.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>What mortal man ever suffered in this world but was consoled by the tender,
                        angelic sympathy of woman? To the poor, the unfortunate, the sick, the
                        maimed, the imprisoned and the hungry, it is her proud pleasure to minister,
                        and to extend her comforting sympathy. In no greater degree do we see this
                        exemplified than in the many heart stirring appeals which go up to the
                        Nation's Chief Magistrate, in behalf of the Nation's captive, Jefferson
                        Davis.</p>
                    <p>This would not serve as a general example of the holy and humane tenderness
                        of woman, if these appeals were made in his favor, alone by the women of the
                        South, of whose Fathers, Brothers, Husbands and Sons, he stands the great
                        representative, whom they unanimously chose to rule them, and in whose one
                        person they are all to be tried, but who alone must suffer the penalty, if
                        punishment is to be dealt any, but from the North as well as South do the
                        appeals for leniency to the great captive roll up.</p>
                    <p>How great is the contrast between the prayers of these angels of mercy and
                        humanity, and the resolution of one Mr. Trimble offered in the Tennessee
                        Senate on Monday the 14th inst., which closes thus:</p>
                    <p>"That for their bad eminence and great crimes against their fellow-men and
                        the United States, Jefferson Davis and his accomplices have justly forfeited
                        their lives, and deserve and ought to suffer the extreme penalty of the
                        law."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Trimble may be a zealous Union man, but the question naturally arises in
                        our mind did he show his zeal by shouldering his arms and going forth, with
                        the many men of the North, to punish in the hostile conflict Jefferson Davis
                        and his accomplices, or does he put off the exhibition of his vindictive
                        zeal until the captive is secured and he can cause public opinion to do the
                        work he dared not do. The Soldiers who fought and bled, for the preservation of the Union, express no such sentiments.
                        They deeply regret that so much precious blood was spilled on both sides.
                        They honor the appellants for mercy to Jefferson Davis, and would, if in
                        their power extend a magnanimous leniency to their sternly brave, though
                        fallen foe. Mr. Trimble may be vindictive for effect, but the effect will
                        be, with those who acted on their feelings on many a hard fought field, a
                        hearty condemnation for all time.</p>
