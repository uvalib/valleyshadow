<b>Cotton and Tobacco</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Cotton and Tobacco.</p>
                    <p>The resolution offered in Congress by Mr. Marshall to purchase for the
                        Confederate States all the Tobacco and Cotton in the Confederacy, which has
                        met with decided favor in the lower House, from all that we can learn, seems
                        to meet with the approbation of nearly all save those who have made fortunes
                        during the war and placed them for safe keeping in the hands of King Cotton
                        and his consort Tobacco. These persons seem a little feverish when the
                        seizure of Tobacco and Cotton is spoken of, and proceed without delay to
                        vent their hitherto pent up feelings upon the devoted heads of Congress, and
                        especially a few who favored the measure. We have often heard it stated that
                        "capital was timid" but it has been reserved to us of this day to witness
                        the truthfulness of this remark, handed down to us as the experience of past
                        ages, by the tremulousness of men of means when the hazarding of their
                        fortunes is even discovered in the dim distance. Had this matter been dealt
                        with in the first year of the war, as it should have been, by the purchase
                        then of all the Cotton and Tobacco in the Confederacy, we doubtless would
                        now experience a better state of affairs. It is useless, however, to repine
                        over the past. A measure calculated to promote the good of the Country as
                        much as this is likely to do should meet with universal assent. When life
                        and liberty are placed in the balance against wealth and property, we say
                        unequivocally away with wealth and all its concomitant comforts. We at first
                        felt indisposed to favor this measure, but upon a closer scrutiny and a
                        better understanding of the desired result of the resolution we feel that it
                        will be productive of great good to our Country and its cause.</p>
                    <p>Our Representative from this District, Hon. J.B. Baldwin, gives the measure
                        his hearty support, and places Va in the proud position she has always
                        desired to occupy. We append a short abstract of his remarks below.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin, of Va., earnestly advocated Mr. Marshall's resolution. He said
                        that rumo[r]s had reached Congress that parties in certain states were
                        willing to treat for peace independent of the common Government, and he
                        therefore desired that it should go forth to the country and the world that
                        the Confederacy now, as at the beginning of the struggle for independence is
                        a unit. He could speak for Virginia, and could say that she was now willing
                        to give her means as freely as she had given her sons. Mr. B, during his
                        remarks, alluded to the fact that a member from one of the cotton States had
                        threatened on yesterday to resign if the resolution under consideration
                        prevailed, and that no gentle man from that section had yet endorsed it.</p>

<b>Decline in the Price of Gold</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The price of gold has fallen, and those who have hoarded it will lose out.
                    Keeping money in circulation is beneficial to the country, while storing gold
                    simply makes it a target for the enemy. Confederate money and the fortune of the

<b>War News</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor cites information from the Lynchburg Republican regarding the
                    aftermath of the battle at Winchester on September 19, 1864. A Confederate
                    surgeon in charge of the Confederate wounded states that the army left about 400
                    wounded from the battle and another 260 previously sick and wounded in the hands
                    of the enemy. From the battle on September 19 until the close of the campaign,
                    the enemy captured 864 sick and wounded, far fewer than previous estimates.
                    Yankee surgeons at Winchester stated that after the fight on September 19, they
                    buried six Union soldiers for every one Confederate and that local hospitals
                    were filled with six thousand wounded. These large losses indicate the skill
                    with which the Confederates fought, in light of the overpowering odds against
                    them.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>At the present writing all is quiet along the lines of the James and
                        Appomattox.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday night last, an attack on our lines was expected and arrangements
                        were promptly made to meet it. The night however passed off and the enemy
                        came not. The roads and the weather, are obstacles of suffic[i]ent
                        importance to prevent either of the armies from attempting an immediate
                        advance.</p>
                    <p>From the Dispatch of Tuesday we learn that Maj. Gen. Gordon has been placed
                        in command of the Second Corps lately commanded by Lieut. Gen. Early. He
                        issued an address to the troops upon taking command.</p>
                    <p>From the Charleston Courier we learn that our forces had abandoned Pocotaligo
                        on Saturday night, burning the Saltketcher bridge and falling back to this
                        side of the Saltketcher river.</p>
                    <p>A force of the enemey [sic] estimated at 15000 men under the command of
                        General Foster, were advancing on Pocotaligo. The enemy encountered our
                        forces near the old battle ground at Old Pocotaligo. A fight ensued, and the
                        enemy were held in check until dark, when our troops, in accordance with
                        previous arrangements, were withdrawn to our lines behind the Saltkehatchle.
                        All the commissary stores, &amp;c., a Pocotaligo were brought off
                        safely. No particulars were received.</p>
                    <p>The Lynchburg Republican gathers from one of our Surgeons who remained in
                        Winchester in charge of our wounded during the whole of the campaign from
                        the 19th of September, some interesting facts relative to our losses.</p>
                    <p>This gentleman states that we left in the hands of the enemy, in the fight of
                        the 19th of September, about 400 wounded, and that there were in Winchester
                        previous to the fight 260 and wounded. Our informant further states that the
                        entire number of sick and wounded captured by the enemy, was 864. This
                        includes all the fights in the Valley from the 19th of September to the
                        close of the campaign. These losses are certainly very far under the
                        estimate we had heretofore had, but that they are correct we have every
                        confidence, as our informant's position gave him every facility for
                        obtaining accurate information.</p>
                    <p>The gentleman tells us that the enemy claimed to have 45,000 infantry and
                        12,000 cavalry.</p>
                    <p>The Yankee surgeons at Winchester told our informant that they buried, after
                        the fight at Winchester on the 19th of September, six of their own men to
                        one of ours, and that the hospitals in the town contained six thousand of
                        their wounded from that fight alone.</p>
                    <p>This exhibit of the losses of the two armies evidences the skill and
                        gallantry with which our officers and men fought, and though they were
                        unfortunate in not securing the fruits of their oft repeated victories, yet
                        none will deny that they deserve well of their country, when they remember
                        the overpowering odds against which they had to contend.</p>
