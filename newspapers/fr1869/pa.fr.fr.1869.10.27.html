<b>Our Poor House</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper comments on the Spirit's reponse to
                    charges of waste and mismanagement in the Democratic administration of the Poor
                    House. The editors call attention to questionable expenses of Democratic
                    directors.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Spirit in its last issue has attempted to
                        reply to our article of the 6th inst., in relation to the management of this
                        institution and the mismanagement of those now
                        controlling its affairs. Mr. Piper, the late Steward, has to bear the brunt
                        of the reply, but as "Davy" has heretofore received many a hard shot and was
                        not "kilt," we suppose he will survive this one.</p>

                    <p>The first item of our charges referred to by the Spirit is "fence making" done and performed by the present Steward,
                        Mr. Brandt. We had said that these posts and rails "had been bought, hauled
                        and paid for before Mr. Brandt became Steward."
                        In this we may be in error. They had been bought and
                            hauled in March, but were not actually paid
                            for until the meeting of the Directors on the 5th of April,
                        whilst Mr. Brandt assumed the position of Steward on the first of April. We were correct, however, in saying that "during
                        the twelve months that Mr. Piper was Steward, from April 1st, 1868, up to and including April, 1869, the Directors
                        had received $13,527.84, and with this, and the proceeds of the land, Mr.
                        Piper had carried on the institution for his year, and left no debts that were not paid out of this money." So much for
                        the posts and rails; but how about the hay, the
                            pigs, and the potatoes?</p>

                    <p>We are glad that the Spirit did not dare deny the
                        correctness of our list of "Provisions and Groceries" left by Mr. Piper when
                        he removed from this Poor House on the 1st of
                        April last, except in relation to the quantity of lard; and then the effort is made more to show that such a quantity
                            could not have been left, than to deny that
                        it had been left. The Spirit evidently did not know that the last butchering at the Poor House was on the 14th of January last,
                        when 160 pounds of clean lard were added to the 250 pounds on hand at the
                        settlement on the 1st of January, 1869. So there was plenty to make even
                            six fifty pound cans. But how about the hay, the pigs, and the
                            potatoes?</p>

                    <p>As to the truth of our statement about the crippling of the horse the night
                        Mr. Brandt took possession of the Poor House, and which necessitated his
                        being killed, and a loss of $200 caused the county, we would refer the Spirit to the hired men, at the Poor House who had
                        charge of the horses for a long time before--knew their dispositions
                        well--had charge of them then, and have charge of
                        them yet. Mr. Piper had nothing to do with them,
                        as they had gone into Mr. Brandt's care. So much for the "dead horse," but how about the hay, the pigs, and the potatoes?</p>

                    <p>The "horse contracts" get a full laudation from the Spirit, but some how or other the sum
                            expended is always varying. In the article published in the Spirit on the 29th of September, the amount paid
                        out for horses since the Democracy got control of the Poor House, was given
                        at $997.50. In our issue of the 6th instant we charged, and showed, that it
                        was nearer $1,250, and now in its last article the Spirit says it was only $879. Now which, even of the Spirit's statements, is true? We don't care which,
                        for either sum was too great an expenditure under the circumstances. But not
                        content with this expenditure of $879.00--$997.50 or $1,250, which ever it
                        may be--the Directors, or Steward, have, as we are informed, actually bought
                            another horse since our last article was
                        published.</p>

                    <p>But says the Spirit the horses sold were "old,
                        worn out, crippled, and blind." One mare was blind, but she was good, and suitable for
                        all purposes, another horse was crippled, under
                        Brandt's management, as above stated--but the remaining five were from three
                        to ten years old, and as good as farmers horses are usually--and certainly
                        good enough for Poor House purposes. It is not
                        necessary, in our opinion, that our Paupers
                        should have $250 horses to look at, and use, or that our Poor House team
                        should be among the fancy teams of the county. We
                        would advise the Spirit to get Mr. Brandt's
                        receipt for buying cheap horses, and publiush it
                        for the benefit of our farmers. It would certainly be more advantage to the
                        public than even Mr. Piper's receipt for making "lard," about which they
                        speak so much. But how about the hay, the pigs, and the potatoes?</p>

                    <p>The Spirit man should not fault the Republican
                        officers at the Poor House for desiring to "hold on" to their little places,
                        considering how long she has held on to his little "posish" of District
                        Attorney. The desire to get money easily and surely is natural to an
                        American, and not unconstitutional as we know
                        of--and the desire of the Democratic appointees to get hold of the Poor
                        House teat, was so extreme, so itching, and so
                        uncontrolable that the majority of the Board actually paid the Republican
                        Clerk and Attorney $50 to "git," and let their man in--and also put out the
                        Republican Treasurer, contrary to law, and inducted a Democratic successor,
                        to the end that the handling of money, the making of contracts, and the
                        emoluments of the offices might be kept among the hungry faithful. But how
                        about the hay, the pigs, and the potatoes?</p>

                    <p>We think we have fully answered the Spirit's two
                        column article, but before we close we wish to refer to another glaring
                        abuse at the Poor House, one that has existed for many years past, and under
                        all administrations, and one that we think in all candor should be abolished. We refer to the large and costly DINNERS served up to everybody who will or can
                        come to the monthly meetings of the Directors. The preparation of these
                            feasts, we have been informed, often occupies
                        the family of the Steward, and the cooks in the institution, the greater
                        part of the day preceding the monthly meetings of the Directors, (which is
                        always Sunday,) and also the fore part of the day
                        following, to the great worry, disgust and annoyance of those who have to
                        prepare them. Cakes, and pies, and other delicacies have to be baked on the
                        Sabbath, when every thing about the place should be at rest, and the inmates
                        at church, or employed in reading and meditation. There is perhaps no great objection to the Directors and officers of the
                        institution getting a dinner once a month at the public expense, but they should take "pot luck" along with the
                        Steward's family--but even this is a custom that would be more honored in
                        the breach than the observance. The County Commissioners, Jurors, Road
                        Viewers and all other public officers on duty pay
                        for their own dinners and horse feed, and why should not the Directors of
                        the Poor do the same thing?</p>

                    <p>But if, as we said before, the Directors be allowed to sponge a dinner and
                        horse feed out of the public funds, once a month, that is no reason why the
                        hordes of hungry money seekers who go there at each meeting to get pay for
                        their "little bills"--nor the dozens of others who go there without any
                        business, should have their dinners at the public expense. Parties having claims upon the
                        public usually make them large enough to cover the expense of going after
                        their "monish," and they should pay their own travelling expenses and
                        board-bills. There is no sense or reason for the county feeding such people.
                        The cost of each meal thus given away cannot be less than fifty cents--the
                            number of them must be hundreds per year--and
                        the total cost to the people not less than two or three hundred dollars,
                        which could easily be used for much more worthy purposes. Now if the
                        Democratic majority really wish to inaugurate a creditable reform at the
                        Poor House, let them at once determine hereafter
                        to pay their own expenses, and abolish peremptorily all free dinners at
                        their meetings. The public will sustain them in the act, and thank them too,
                        for the reform--and perhaps then they may have leisure to tell us all about
                        the hay, pigs and
                            potatoes.</p>

                        Sept. 1869. At the instance of J. McD. Sharpe, Esq., the Prothonotary enters
                        plea of not guilty. Sharpe, Kimmel and Stewart for plffs; Cessna, Brewer and
                        Orr, for deft. The following gentlemen were sworn as jurors; John Hawk,

                        Jarret, E. D. Weaver. As the regular list of jurors failed to fill the box,
                        the court was compelled to resort to talesmen to complete the number.
                        Several gentlemen were taken by surprise as their names were called by
                        Deputy Sheriff Brown, and were compelled to send word home that
                        "circumstances over which they had no control" compelled their presence at
                        court.</p>

                    <p>This suit was brought for the purpose of testing the title of Alex Kyner to
                        the land above described. The defendant claimed his title to the land on the
                        ground that it was devised to him by his father, George Kyner, dec'd, who
                        died in July, 1867, in a will made in the year 1855. The witnesses to the
                        document were Hon. James L. Black, of Chambersburg, and James Ross, Esq.,
                        dec'd, a former member of the bar. The plaintiffs alleged that the testator
                        being 80 years of age at the date of the instrument, was incompetent to make
                        a will from a want of mental capacity and was under the improper control and
                        influence of his son Alex W. Kyner at the time of making the will. The
                        defendant denied the allegations of the plaintiffs. The single question in
                        dispute was the validity or invalidity of the will of George Kyner, dec'd.</p>

                    <p>This case was tried, as a feigned issue, at the January Term, 1868, and
                        nearly the same facts brought forward then, as now. The jurors at that time,
                        were John D. Spear, Jacob Haulman, D. K. Wunderlich, Jacob Shank, John H.
