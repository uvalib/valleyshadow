                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>, on the subject of the payment of the
                        Border Damages, says "it is time for the Republicans of this section to take
                        a decided stand in this matter. What will they do? Can any of their organs
                        inform us?" This calling of time, and these interrogatories were prefaced by
                        two contrasting sentences, thus:--"With Asa Packer in the Governor's chair,
                        and a Democratic majority in the Legislature, relief would speedily have
                        come to our long suffering people. With Geary and a Republican majority what
                        promises does the future hold out when viewed in the light of the past?"</p>

                    <p>It might be as well to dispose of this prophecy or speculation as to what
                        Packer would do if her were Governor, by stating once more, what the <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph> dared not deny during the recent political
                        campaign, that he always cheated the State out of most of the taxes which he
                        owed her, and that from this one could not argue very strongly that he would
                        voluntarily add to them to pay the border losses. It is true he might have
                        reasoned this: "I now succeed in cheating the State, and I may safely assume
                        that if this additional tax be imposed I can elude the payment of it also,
                        and while others pay it I will receive the credit arising from having urged
                        it." But it was not likely. At any rate, Packer took great care to have no
                        opinion on any political subject while he was a candidate for Governor, and
                        on the question of border damages he was equally reticent.</p>

                    <p>There is as little upon which to predicate a desire to pay these losses on
                        the part of the Democratic party in the State as on the part of Packer, and
                        the history of the party proves, if it proves anything on this subject, that
                        a much stronger probability of their payment by a Democratic Legislature
                        would exist if they were rebel losses, and not losses of loyal men. We infer
                        this from the fact that all our Democratic legislators during the war
                        opposed every measure of border defence, as well as every measure which had
                        for its object the suppression of the rebellion. This fact is well known,
                        and a part of the history of the war not likely to be soon forgotten. Though
                        it is irresistable from their antecedents that the Democracy in the State
                        were opposed to any apropriation for the payment of these losses, we
                        believed that both parties and their organs in the border counties favored
                        it. From the editorial in the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>, to which we
                        have referred, we found that we were mistaken, and that <emph rend="italic"
                            >it</emph> at least had rather that these losses were not made good to
                        the sufferers. If interrogated we have no doubt that its editors would deny
                        such a charge, but in spite of the denial that impression will remain in the
                        minds of all unprejudiced readers.</p>

                    <p>We believe that the Legislature of Pennsylvania has hitherto refused to do a
                        simple act of justice to the border counties, and we fear that it may still
                        refuse. Yet it is not only unfair to the Legislature to allege that this
                        refusal was made because that body was Republican, but it is also damaging
                        to the claimants themselves, inasmuch as it tends to array the Legislature
                        against the objects sought by the claimants. Other things being equal a
                        Republican Legislature would be far more likely to appropriate a sum of
                        money to the payment of these losses than a Democratic one. The one would be
                        in sympathy with the cause which provoked the rebel wrath, and invited rebel
                        plunder. The other would be more likely to sympathize with the rebels
                        themselves, and their cause, and hence would be reluctant to make good the
                        losses. Indeed we must not forget that what was already appropriated, though
                        by an insignificant part of the losses, was so done by a Republican
                        Legislature.</p>

                    <p>In this question of border damages there is no place for party politics.
                        Republicans should be in favor of making whole those whose homes were
                        plundered and devastated by the enemies of the government while their
                        strength was withdrawn from their homes to protect and defend a nation's
                        life, and Democrats, unless their anceint prejudices in favor of rebels
                        still linger in their hearts, should not oppose it. We do not believe that
                        party politics ever controlled a single member of the Legislature on this
                        question, or that it ever will. The conviction in the minds of the members
                        that the taxpayers of the State are opposed to it, however unworthy the
                        motive if the cause be just, has controlled a majority of them and we fear
                        will do so hereafter. Personal popularity with one's constituents is as
                        keenly appreciated by members of one political faith as of another, and
                        Democrats are as loath to run counter to the unjust prejudices of those who
                        palced them in office as Republicans. It is possible that the Legislature
                        will be willing to do us manifest justice while it is believed that a large
                        majority of the taxpayers of the State are opposed to it, but it is not
                        probable. On the contrary, we are satisfied that if the people were known to
                        be in favor of it no member of the Legislature would oppose it because he
                        was either a Republican or a Democrat.</p>

                    <p>In these lines we have abstained from discussing the grounds upon which our
                        citizens base their claim to compensation by the State. They have been fully
                        presented a number of times already, and are admitted to be fair and just,
                        and unanswerable.</p>

                <commentary/>

                    <p>The newspapers tell us, says the Pittsburg <emph rend="italic"
                        >Commercial</emph>, that this gentleman has returned from Europe, having
                        accomplished the object for which he went. This was something connected with
                        the Evangelical Alliance--in regard to which we may soon expect to receive a
                        report from the Doctor himself.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Schaff seems to us a good illustration of the benefit conferred upon the
                        United States by the class of scholarly men from the Old World, who take up
                        their abode among us. Rather, the career of Dr. S. Shows how much good these
                        men can do us when they earnestly study and honestly endeavor to adapt
                        themselves to the new conditions by which they find themselves surrounded in
                        this country.</p>

                    <p>Some twenty-five years ago Dr. S. came to this country on the invitation of
                        the Synod of the German Reformed church, to take charge of a theological
                        school. He had just completed his studies at the University of Berlin with
                        great distinction; the eminent men in that celebrated seat of learning
                        regarded and recommended him as one of the most promising young divines in
                        Germany. He could read English, but did not speak it correctly on his
                        arrival hither. And it was no secret at the time that he was very much under
                        the influence of the prejudices against American things and notions which,
                        until quite recently, prevailed among the educated classes of his native
                        land. But Dr. S. brought with him an eye to see and a heart to appreciate
                        whatever was good among us.</p>

                    <p>We do not propose to give a sketch of his labors. We wish merely to say in
                        general that study and observation in this country destroyed his hostile
                        preconceptions. They also led him to take views of two or three German
                        questions which brought much odium upon him among a portion of the
                        German-Americans. He infused new life into many German churches in this
                        State. While efficiently performing the duties of his official position, he
                        produced a history in one volume, of the Apostolic Church, which speedily
                        gained for him a European reputation and a place among the ecclesiastical
                        historians by the side of his teacher, Neander. As a recognition of its
                        merit the University of Berlin made him a Doctor of Divinity. This volume
                        was in course of time followed by two volumes more in continuation of the
                        subject.</p>

                    <p>About 1851 visiting his native country and finding the land of his adoption
                            <emph rend="italic">enjoying</emph> a reputation there almost
                        infamous--the result in good measure a systematic calumny prompted by
                        aristocrats who feared the example of our popular institutions, Dr. Schaff
                        delivered a course of lectures on America directly adapted to remove
                        prejudices and impart correct information on the subject. These lectures
                        were delivered in Berlin, and were heard by an audience of the most
                        distinguished and influential character, and when afterwards published in a
                        book, they were very widely read. It is difficult to estimate their effect;
                        but we are justified in ascribing great influence to this work in producing
                        the friendly attitude of mind with which the cultivated classes of Germnay
                        looked upon the North during our civil war.</p>

                    <p>More recently Dr. Schaff has resided in New York, and as editor of a
                        translation of Lange's Commentaries and additions, he is furnishing the
                        American clergy of all sects with the most complete and satisfactory pulpit
                        assistant in the world.</p>

                    <p>In the preface to his history of the Apostolic Church, Dr. S. spoke of the
                        Germans and the Americans as the Greeks and the Romans of modern times; and
                        humbly offered himself as an interpreter between the mind of the former and
                        the mind of the latter. Not only by his books, but by his practical activity
                        in several ways, he is nobly fulfilling the office. His recent visit to
                        Europe was in this character. Such a man ought to be understood by all--our
                        apology for this slight notice.</p>

                    <p>SECOND WEEK'S PROCEEDINGS</p>

                    <p>The most important motion that was heard before the court on Monday morning
                        was the one made for a new trial in the case of the Com. vs. John R. Turner.
                        It will be remembered that Turner was indicted for forgery in fraudulently
                        altering a deed from John Russell to the said Turner, at the August term of
                        Court, and found guilty. Fortunately his counsel discovered,</p>

                    <p>"That when the jury in the said case were being called, and when the Clerk of
                        the Court drew from the jury box the name of Joshua Long, who had been
                        selected and returned as one of the panel of jurors for the August Sessions,
                        1869, and called the said Joshua Long to take his seat as one of the jurors
                        in the said case, the said call of the Clerk was answered by Joshua Loy, of
                        Antrim township, and then the said Joshua Loy came forward stating that his
                        name was Joshua Loy, not Joshua Long, and took his seat in the jury box, was
                        sworn, heard the evidence, and united with the other persons on the jury in
                        rendering the verdict as guilty as aforesaid. His counsel were of the
                        opinion at the time, that a mere clerical error had been committed, and for
                        that reason made no objection to Loy taking his seat, but afterwards
                        discovered that no person of the name of Joshua Loy had been drawn or
                        selected to serve as a juror at this Court, and concluded that the presence
                        and service of the said Joshua Loy, in this case, was in their opinion such
                        an irregularity and error as was not cured by the trial and verdict."</p>

                    <p>This was the only reason that was pressed for the granting of a new trial,
                        and was supported by English and American decisions. The Court decided the
                        point well taken and said that the motion for a new trial was granted very
                        reluctantly, but under the circumstances could not be refused. But for the
                        above mistake John R. Turner would be in the Penitentiary <orig reg="today"

                    <p>Com. at the relation of Charles Gelwicks, vs. Alexander Martin. This case
                        grew out of the appointment of Mr. Martin as Treasurer of the Directors of
                        the Poor of Franklin county, last February, and the removal of Mr. Gelwicks,
                        the former Treasurer, who claimed the position on account of having been
                        elected at the annual election of officers a short time before. The jury
                        found for defendant.</p>

                    <p>Few persons have any idea of the vast increase of trade and travel in this
                        valley during the last few years. The time is within recollection of those
                        living along the line of the Cumberland Valley railroad--which by the by has
                        done more to develop the resources and increase the value of the lands of
                        our citizens, than all other investments--when one freight train hauled all
                        the produce to market, and two passenger trains carried all the travel
                        Eastward, yes, and when one rickety car and spavined horse was sufficient
                        for the travel southward. This was only ten years ago. It was no unusual
                        occurrence then for the afternoon passenger train to leave Chambersburg for
                        Harrisburg with very few passengers, occasionally the conductor had no
                        tickets to collect for the first ten miles at least.</p>

                    <p>Now, however, the business is quite different. Three freight trains each
                        morning leave here, oftentimes four, and not unfrequently five large engines
                        are at work pulling long lines of cars laden with the harvest yields of well
                        tilled land. Eight passenger trains are each day well filled with the
                        travelling public, and no empty cars leave this depot. Seventy cars are the
                        average number daily employed in hauling grain and coal over the Franklin
                        railroad, and the company are seriously talking of a second freight on this
                        same road. Six passenger trains are profitably employed in transporting
                        passengers from here to Greencastle and Hagerstown. These facts should
                        greatly encourage our Franklin county friends who are contemplating the
                        building of lines to connect with the Cumberland Valley railroad.</p>

                <summary>The Synod of Baltimore met in the Falling Spring Presbyterian Church on
                    Tuesday. Rev. A. D. Mitchell opened the meeting with a sermon. A Farewell
                    Missionary Meeting was also held, at which the Rev. Dr. Harper, recently
                    returned from China, and Secretary of the Board of Foreign Mission Dr. J. C.
                    Lowrie, spoke. The synod also discussed education, especially Chambersburg's new
                    women's college. They also discussed the state of religion within the bounds of
                    the synod.</summary>
