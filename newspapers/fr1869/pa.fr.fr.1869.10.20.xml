					<p>The result of the campaign is <emph rend="italic">Victory</emph>. The
						election derived its importance from the fact that in it was involved the
						entire creed of the National Republican party. The Fifteenth Amendment to
						the Constitution, guaranteeing universal suffrage, was before the people for
						their approval or condemnation, and with it the National Administration,
						which was pledged to it. The Amendment was approved by the vote of the
						Legislature last winter, but as the requisite number of States necessary to
						make it part of the Constitution had not ratified it, the Democracy alleged
						that it was in the power of the people, by electing a Legislature hostile to
						it, to revoke the action of the former Legislature. Hence the issue was
						made, the Republicans endorsing the Amendment in their State Convention and
						the Democracy condemning it in a similar body, and the votes of the people
						can be justly claimed as an unconditional endorsement of the principles and
						policy of the Republican party.</p>

					<p>On this issue Gov. Geary is re-elected by a majority of not less than 5,000
						and at a time when all the State or local issues which enter into an
						election tended to weaken the party and give strength to the Democracy. The
						Legislature of last winter was not without faults, serious faults, and
						though the Republicans were not responsible for every indefensible act, yet
						being in the majority they were held responsible for their own and those of
						the Democratic members also. There was corruption, there was extravagance
						and there was a disregard of the interests of the taxpayers on the part of
						the Legislature which no honest journal can defend. There were also many
						measures for which the Legislature should be highly commended by the people,
						and which were the result of a careful, just discriminating regard for the
						public good. The former were seized upon by the Democratic press and
						ingenuously falsified and paraded, while the latter were carefully concealed
						from public contemplation. If one would have had access to Democratic
						journals alone during the campaign he would have been ready to denounce the
						Legislature of last winter as the most corrupt, dishonest, unconstitutional
						and arbitrary body that ever assembled. Yet it was not so. The people had
						the good sense to weigh and examine for themselves. They rejected the
						falsehoods and prejudiced appeals of the demagogues as unworthy of credit
						when set against the undeniably excellent record of the Republican party,
						both National and State, ever since it came into power. They had the acts of
						one party, which were good, to determine them. They had but the promises of
						the other, which had been violated time out of number before, and they
						rejected them.</p>

					<p>To the people themselves is the glorious victory of the Republican party due
						to their patriotism, intelligence and integrity, and not to the efforts of
						the politicians. They had seen the taxes reduced, and the State debt
						steadily but surely paid off under Republican rule, and they witnessed the
						rapid reduction of the National debt month after month, under the honest and
						economical administration of General Grant, and they were unwilling to
						jeopard these for impalpible promises.</p>

					<p>Henceforth let the Democracy treasure it up as a dearly bought lesson that
						they cannot foist their odious and degrading principles upon the people of
						the State, no matter how respectable or wealthy their candidates may be;
						that something more is needed than the extravagant and corrupt use of money
						to make the people trample upon and repudiate their splendid record of the
						war. It is clear that they are not likely soon to forget what they owe to
						the Democracy and what to the Republican party, and if politicians do, they
						stand ready, when the time comes, to remind them.</p>

				<summary>The paper declares victory for the Republicans in the fall election
					campaigns. The voters unofficially ratified the 15th Amendment by reelecting the
					Republican legislature that had voted in favor of it, despite the best attempts
					of the Democrats to gain support for its repeal. The editors assert that Gov.
					Geary's victory, in a year in which the Republican-controlled legislature made a
					number of questionable financial decisions, attests to the strength of the party
					in the state.</summary>

				<head>The Election in the County</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<transcript>

					<p>The result of the election, on the 12th, in the county, is determined in
						favor of the Democratic candidates by a majority so large as to leave no
						doubt as to the election of the whole ticket. For a time some of the most
						sanguine almost believed that Patton had succeeded in defeating Reber for
						Treasurer, but although he made a run which challenges the admiration of
						every one, it was not in human power to overcome an average majority against
						the ticket of 320, and he is defeated by 125 votes. Though defeated, and
						doubtless disappointed, he must experience a feeling of satisfaction upon a
						comparison of the votes. If his individual efforts had been backed by the
						party, as they should have been, not only he, but the whole county ticket
						could have been elected. As it is, though it is too late to mend it, and
						mere folly to complain, we cannot forget that our defeat is not due to the
						numerical strength of the Democracy in the county, but to the indifference,
						slothfulness and dissatisfaction which existed in our own party.</p>

					<p>The lack of interest is manifested in various ways in the returns, but in
						none more than in the aggregate vote, which is 895 short of the October
						election, last year. Of this number the Democratic vote for Governor is
						short 272 votes, while the Republican vote for Governor is short 617. More
						than two Republicans remained away from the polls for each Democrat. Another
						evidence of the indifference of Republicans in the result is seen in the
						majorities of the several State and county candidates. No two candidates
						have the same majority, as in former years.</p>

					<p>Packer's majority is 308; Perching's is 267; Skinner's majority is 416, and
						Welsh's, for Prothonotary, reaches 485; Cormany, for Clerk of the Courts,
						falls to 182, and Reber's, for Treasurer, is as low as 125.</p>

					<p>Thus, while the average Democratic majority in the county is 320, that of
						some falls nearly 200 below, and of others rises nearly as much above it.
						This could not have been the case if the strong desire to secure the success
						of the ticket had pervaded the mass of voters as it usually does. Why this
						feeling was lacking in such a remarkable degree, now, is an interesting
						inquiry which we do not propose to answer, though it would not be difficult
						to find a solution of much of it.</p>

					<p>A calm view of the situation need not be discouraging. What errors have been
						committed need not be repeated. Our defeat is not owing to the strength of
						the enemy, but to faults among ourselves, which can be corrected. Even a
						comparison of the returns show that if a reasonably full vote be polled, we
						have a clear, undoubted majority in the county, and by vigorous, earnest and
						honest effort our full vote can be brought to the polls. If we fully learn
						the lesson our experience of this campaign teaches, its benefits will not be
						trifling.</p>

					<p>The election in Ohio, on Tuesday, 12th inst., by which a Republican
						Legislature was elected, makes sure the ratification of the Fifteenth
						Amendment. It secures to that measure the number of States necessary to make
						it a part of the Constitution, and will be, when accomplished, the last
						grand act in the drama of human progress, inaugurated and brought to a
						triumphant conclusion by the Republican party. Before another election it
						will be officially declared a part of the Constitution, and no one will be
						excluded from voting, on account of color, from one end of the land to the
						other.</p>

					<p>We beg the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>, which has been indulging in the
						most outrageous and insulting abuse of the colored population, to prepare
						itself for the new departure in politics. It has much to accomplish before
						the next election if it would secure "our colored fellow-citizens" to the
						Democratic party, and it is absolutely necessary that it should in order to
						retain the supremacy won in the last election. With the negroes against them
						the Democracy are hopelessly in the minority in the county. By all means
						make friendly overtures to them at once. A moment's delay may be fatal.</p>

				<transcript>

					<p>With the return of the second Tuesday of October came the election, bringing
						its train of events serious and grave, comic and ludicrous, stirring up the
						slumbering enthusiasm of the voters and arousing the energies and
						apprehensions of the candidates. The day, which the evening before with its
						clear sky and steady, cool, bracing air gave promise of being pleasant and
						bright, opened with a nasty drizzling rain, casting a feeling of gloom and
						discomfort over everything. Republicans looked at the sky, saw the dark
						threatening clouds overhead, hear the falling rain, and predicted a short
						vote and reduced majorities, if not defeat. Democrats looked at the same
						signs of the weather and drew therefrom precisely the opposite conclusions,
						for long experience has determined that the worst of weather on election day
						cannot restrain Democratic voters from coming to the polls, but that
						Republicans are a thin skinned, tender race of animals, who shrink from
						storm and rain, and dare not venture out on stormy days, even though it is
						political defeat to stay at home. The Democrats, therefore, were jubilant,
						the Republicans crest fallen.</p>

					<p>Never at any time during the day did the interest in the election overcome
						the <emph rend="italic">dampening</emph> effect of the rain. A few listless
						idlers stood on the pavement around the polls munching chestnuts, and
						dropping the shells on the ground. They were particular friends of the
						candidates generally and were waiting here the approach of one or other of
						them, no matter which, that they might drink to his success if he would
						invite them. Others were sitting on the Court House steps, their elbows
						resting on their knees, and their faces on their hands. They had drunk to
						the success of the candidates of both parties so often that weariness and
						exhaustion overcame them, and they were trying to extract a little rest and
						comfort from the hard stone steps. They had done their duty nobly, had voted
						their sentiments sublimely, but excessive moisture overcame them, as it will
						the best of men, and they were compelled to yield to its powerful influence.</p>

					<p>When night came and the stragglers were being gathered in, still a large
						number of voters had not voted, and most of these were Republicans. The
						knowing ones predicted that if the vote was not brought out more fully
						throughout the county than in Chambersburg, the Democracy would elect their
						ticket. When the clock on the Court House struck the hour of seven, there
						were still seventy votes in the North Ward not polled, and the Republicans
						turned away feeling that the day had been unpromising throughout, and they
						gathered around the Repository office to await the returns, anxious to know
						yet dreading to hear.</p>

					<p>The Democracy gathered in and around the office of M'Lellan &amp;
						Kimmell, along side of the Repository office, the two crowds mingling, and
						each asseverating their faith in the success of their own ticket. The first
						cheering of the day was now heard, but though the cheers were chiefly for
						Packer, they were only the outpouring of maudlin Democrats, and excited no
						enthusiasm. The leaders of both parties, while trying to look hopeful and
						confident, certainly failed to inspire confidence, in those waiting returns,
						either by their words or looks.</p>

					<p>The first returns, those from the two wards of Chambersburg, and from the
						Guilford and Hamilton boxes, filled the Democracy with gladness and
						correspondingly discouraged the Republicans. 70 for Geary in the North Ward,
						which gave Hartranft 147 last fall was a crusher, 18 for Packer in the South
						Ward against 5 for Hartranft was not much better. Hamilton returns added to
						the Republican despair, the news from Guilford satisfied them that the
						county was lost, and unless the returns from the State would be more
						encouraging, there was sure to be an overwhelming defeat throughout.</p>

					<p>About this time the Democracy swarmed, and with cheers and oaths and much
						swaggering filled the headquarters, of the Republicans, eager to bet, and
						all boasting that at last they had carried the State gloriously. Just then
						came the first dispatches from Philadelphia. The crowd became awfully still
						to hear their dearest hopes or worst fears confirmed. The dispatch was
						opened, and the face of the reader, as he glanced along it before beginning
						to read, betrayed the character of the news. First came "Fifth ward,
						Democratic majority 850. Republican gain 237," a feeble cheer. Then
						"Twentieth ward, Republican majority 1000. Republican gain 623." Cheers gain
						in volume and spirit. Then followed, "Fuller returns show Republican
						majority of about 4000. Republican gain in Philadelphia over last October
						4,175." For some time nothing was heard but cheers and yells of Republicans.
						There was spirit enough then, there was confidence enough, Democrats were
						not quite so plenty and no longer evaded by Republicans. From that time
						until a late hour of the night, or rather an early hour in the next morning,
						the news were all of the same character, Geary was elected by about 5000, at
						least. There was no doubt of that. The editors of the <emph rend="italic"
							>Spirit</emph>, who felt sure that, after journeying so many years
						through the dark valley of Despair and Humiliation, they were about to reach
						the Delectable Mountains had prepared for a grand display of their victory
						in the columns of the paper, which they had held back until the returns were
						in, but were forced to content themselves with parading their sickly rooster
						over the unimportant triumph of Franklin county. O what a fall was that!
						What high hopes! What deep despair.</p>

					<p>About midnight the streets became quiet with the exception of an occasional
						hiccoughy cheer for Packer, the lights were turned out, headquarters were
						closed, and the election was over. The State was saved. Geary was elected,
						Williams was elected, the Legislature was as largely Republican as before,
						the people had voted on the Fifteenth Amendment, and on that question as on
						all others the Democracy had been repudiated. There was much for which to be
						truly thankful as we retired that night, and reflected on the incidents of
						the election. The golden calf had been rejected, the people would not turn
						from the true religion to worship an idol. We have not space to write of the
						many ludicrous scenes and incidents which fell under our notice during the
						evening, but as the crowds of both parties were side by side waiting for
						news they were not wanting. The different character and conduct of the two
						parties were very striking. The one was boisterous, profane, drunken and
						disgraceful the other quiet, sober and respectful. The one smashed the
						windows of its own headquarters, and made the night hideous with oaths and
						disorder, the other quietly adjourned to their homes after learning the
						news. A young man from the Academy, a Democrat, came into the Republican
						side, asking to stay there, as he wished to learn the news, and was afraid
						to remain among the mob.</p>

					<p>The Democratic deafeat had brought and left many wounded in this vicinity.
						The Democracy of Chambersburg were mainly instrumental in Packer's
						nomination, and hoped to reap rich rewards from his election. Our friend Wm.
						McLellan, remembered as a staunch Republican of the days of yore, but of
						late years a hopeless Democrat, was dangerously if not fatally injured. Not
						satisfied with defeat alone, fickle fortune toyed and coyed with him for
						days after the election, and after raising him to the highest pinnacle of
						hope suddenly dropped him to the lowest depths of despair. As late as
						Thursday night some pittiless joker telegraphed him over the name of Asa
						Packer, that he was elected by a handsome majority, and charged him to set a
						watch over the return judges of Franklin county, lest they would tamper with
						the returns. Rumor has it that instead of attending to the return judges Mr.
						M'Lellan hastened to Philadelphia in the first train that he might
						congratulate his bosom friend on his election, and malicious persons add
						doubtless without any reason therefore, to remind his friend, before other
						aspirants arrived, of his promise to make him Secretary of the Commonwealth.
						But for our deep respect for Mr. McLellan, we would have enjoyed being
						present to witness the interview between the defeated candidate and his
						loyal henchman, as they became conscious of the cruel joke. It is said,
						though we know not how true it is, that Mr. M'Lellan has forever forsworn
						politics. Well, his success in that business has not been such as to
						fascinate him, and we honestly believe that if he has so resolved, the
						sacrifice is not incalculable.</p>
