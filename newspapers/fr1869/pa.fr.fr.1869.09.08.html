<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>On Tuesday of last week the Democracy of Franklin county assembled in
                        Convention in the Court House, and "set up the pins" for the Republicans to
                        knock down again, as they have done mainly for a good many years back. Col.
                        J. B. Orr, who can always be counted on in emergencies, presided, and John
                        D. DeGolly, of Greencastle, an incipient Democrat, whose name was not
                        bequeathed from sire to son, and O. C. Bowers, of St. Thomas, were
                        Secretaries. Thus equipped the Convention proceeded to the business in hand,
                        that of making nominations, and upon the whole they did it as
                        satisfactorily, and put as fine men up for defeat as one would wish to look
                        upon. The managers, who have their headquarters in Chambersburg, had for the
                        greater convenience and facility of the delegates, arranged the ticket, or
                        made the slate, in advance of the Convention, so that there was nothing to
                        do except to put the seal of authority upon their action. Though a little
                        restive, and at times showing that they would rather set up housekeeping for
                        themselves, the delegates submitted to the dictation of the ring with
                        becoming patience, and proved themselves worthy members of the party whose
                        creed does not allow individual thought and action.</p>

                    <p>The first proposition submitted to the Convention was the nomination of our
                        young and really amiable friend, Capt. G. W. Skinner, for Assembly, which
                        well nigh started the old soldiers of the party out of their propriety. They
                        had come together to nominate men whose years were at least a guaranty that
                        they might have labored in the Democratic cause, but to nominate one for the
                        most important position, that of State Legislator, whose manhood cast no
                        shadow, behind him, was a disregard for the wheel horses of the party that
                        might well create a flutter. The questions, "What has Skinner done for the
                        party that should receive this nomination?" "Hasn't Skinner been more than
                        compensated already by his election to the County Treasurership?" were
                        vainly asked, because they received no replies, and it crept their wool we
                        beg pardon, the wool is only a figure of speech--that the thing was set up,
                        and there was no help for it. They were reconciled, however, when they
                        understood that Skinner was merely intended as a figure-head to the ticket,
                        to round it out and give it symmetry, and that there was not the slightest
                        danger that he or any other Democrat could be elected over M'Knight. So he
                        was nominated. We would urge him not to allow his nomination to interrupt
                        his study of the law, which we are informed he is industriously pursuing,
                        with a view of adopting the legal profession. A careful study of the
                        principles of law and a few years practice will do much to fit him for the
                        responsible duties of a law maker; and when
                        maturity of years comes we have no doubt, if called, he will do honor both
                        to the position and himself.</p>

                    <p>William Reber, of Southampton, who was swung around the circle of the party
                        for more years than he would like to say, and piteously begged a nomination,
                        at different times, for every office in the county, has at last received the
                        reward of his perseverance and assiduity. He was placed on the ticket for
                        County Treasurer. It is safe to say that he is the most inveterate political
                        barnacle in the memory of the oldest inhabitant. He may hope to be elected
                        after he has run as many years as he has been seeking a nomination, scarcely
                        before. Among his competitors for nomination were Hiram M. White of
                        Chambersburg; Leonard Leidy, of Mercersburg; Benjamin M. Powell, of Antrim,
                        and T. D. French, of Waynesboro. It was thought advisable to conciliate
                        White, who seemed dissatisfied and angry, by the appointment of Chairman of
                        the County Committee. The offer was made, White saw Packer's money bags in
                        the distance, with a reasonable probablility of some of them drifting
                        hitherward; his wrath abated, he swallowed his disappointment and accepted.
                        White was sensible.</p>

                    <p>The nomination for Prothonotary was given to George W. Welsh, Esq., of
                        Waynesboro, by acclamation. Whether Mr. Welsh be elected or not, and we
                        don't intend that he shall if we can help it, we are pleased that he
                        received the nomination. If not elected, he has this advantage, that he is
                        trained to disappointments. For a long time he labored to secure the office
                        of District Attorney. Once the people disappointed him. He was fairly
                        nominated, but when the votes were counted out he lacked "a few." Another
                        time he was confident of the nomination, but just when he was grasping it,
                        his friend Stenger told him that he had better wait until next time, that he
                        wanted it himself. Thus he has been trained to political adversity, which is
                        a very good thing in a candidate for political office, and may be of use to
                        him in the approaching election.</p>

                    <p>B. A. Cormany, of Chambersburg, was nominated for Clerk of the Courts. His
                        nomination is a fair one, and was made with little effort on his part. His
                        principal opponent was a young gentleman from Greencastle, M. D. Reymer, who
                        joined the Democracy about a year ago, beong led thereto by promises of
                        reward. The quiet rebuke he received at the hands of the Convention has
                        probably taught him that he paid an extravagant price for his whistle.</p>

                    <p>For the nomination of Register and Recorder Hiram T. Snider, of Fayetteville,
                        and Jacob Cook, of Upton, were both candidates. There were no truer
                        disciples of Democratic faith before the Convention than these two men, nor
                        could they be found in the party. Their highest ambition is to see their
                        party in power, and their idea of a perfect government is one adminstered by
                        Democrats, of the old Breckenridge type. Snyder proved the stronger man and
                        was nominated. He is popular in his party, but can poll no more votes than
                        his party strength, which is just enough to defeat him.</p>

                    <p>The disappointed, and they are much the largest number, have our sympathy.
                        Though disappointed now, after the election they will rejoice that they are
                        not numbered among the slain.</p>

<b>Something to Stand Upon</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Democratic Convention last week, unwilling to send candidates of their
                        making out upon the sea of politics without something to stand upon,
                        constructed for them a platform, or a raft, or something which they hope may
                        be able to float. It is built of the same material which they have been
                        using for years, and which has rarely been able to withstand a Republican
                        gale. Last fall a similar one was wrecked in the October storm, and nearly
                        the whole crew sent to the bottom. Still they have faith in the thing, and
                        mean to try it again.</p>

                    <p>The first plank, endorsing the platform of the Democratic State Convention,
                        merely copies a time-honored resolution, for it has done duty in similar
                        County Conventions from time immemorial. The names of Asa Packer and Cyrus
                        L. Pershing are introduced, it is true, which may be called new. Why Packer
                        should be called a "clear headed statesman," or Pershing "the able jurist,"
                        fails to appear except on the old rule, lucus a non
                            lucendo.</p>

                    <p>The second advocates retrenchment and reform, and the restoration of public
                        affairs back to old fashioned simplicity and integrity. These are Republican
                        sentiments out of the mouths of Democrats. But as long as the Democracy only
                        talk them and never act them, few people will be willing to believe them. It
                        was only last winter that they gave the lie to their words, by one half of
                        the Democratic members of the Legislature voting to increase their pay from
                        $1,000 to $1,500. But that the Republican members almost unanimously opposed
                        the iniquitous measure, they would have taken many thousands of dollars out
                        of the State treasury and put them into their own pockets. It is a matter of
                        general experience, that while the Democracy talk retrenchment and reform
                        largely, the Republican party alone is given to carrying these measures into
                        effect.</p>

                    <p>The next resolution announces a doctrine once universally accepted as
                        Democratic, but now generally discarded by the party outside the limits of
                        Pennsylvania. We give it entire.</p>

                    <p>"Resolved, That the efforts of our opponents to
                        give the ignorant negro the ballot is subversive of the best interests of
                        the white man; that the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment by the Radical
                        majority of the Republican Legislature was a fraud on the people, and in
                        direct opposition to their wishes, and it should be repealed forthwith."</p>

                    <p>It is a pity when this doctrine was announced last week that there were such
                        places as Massachusetts and the dozen Southern States, in all of which the
                        Democracy have repudiated it, for here in Pennsylvania and at the "Corners"
                        it is just the thing. It would be unfortunate to bring John Quincy Adams,
                        Democratic candidate for Governor of Massachusetts, into this region to make
                        speeches, for he represents a party which declares itself in favor of
                        universal suffrage. But then Democracy is all things to all men, if thereby
                        it can but persuade the people to entrust it with offices and the spoils
                        arising therefrom. What a commentary it is upon the "time honored" that it
                        can no longer agree upon what shall be dead and what living issues. Without
                        a principle it has fallen lower and lower until, a mere political harlot, it
                        is ready to sell itself for spoils.</p>

                    <p>Then follows a resolution which, we think, intended to say that it was the
                        duty of the Commonwealth to pay all the losses of property suffered by the
                        citizens of the border counties, by reason of the late rebellion, but which
                        failed to say anything of the kind. It makes no odds though, no one will
                        misapprehend it. Both political parties in the border counties are alike
                        anxious to see these just claims paid by the State. While this is true no
                        one is so blind to his own interest as not to perceive that the election of
                        Republicans to the Legislature from these counties will be far more likely
                        to accomplish this result than the election of Democrats, however friendly
                        to the measure they may be. The Spirit says that
                        while the Republican party has been largely in the majority it has refused
                        to make any compensation, and that, on the contrary, the Democratic members
                        have shown a willingness to do so. It is a sufficient answer to this that
                        the willingness of a hopeless minority was perfectly safe and harmless, but
                        if they had been in a majority they would have been as slow as the
                        Republican members to assume the responsibility of imposing a tax of three
                        million on the tax payers of the State, which however just would have been
                        exceedingly unpopular. The true state of the case is this, Legislatures are
                        always loath to burden the State for the exclusive benefit of a section.
                        This last Legislature was more than two-thirds Republican. The next one will
                        scarcely be less so. If then the people of Franklin, and the other border
                        counties, desire to secure compensation for their losses, they are far more
                        likely to accomplish it by sending members who are in political sympathy
                        with the majority. This is so simple and reasonable that no one can fail to
                        see the force of it. To send Democratic members from these counties to the
                        Legislature with a view to getting compensation would be like sending a
                        man's enemy to him to ask a favor, instead of sending a friend.</p>

                    <p>The last resolution is a little diluted claptrap to the laboring man, which
                        the laboring man will take at just what it is worth.</p>

                    <p>The Republican party and Gen. Grant still religiously keep their pledges made
                        to the people in the Presidential campaign of 1868. Economy and
                        retrenchment, and the payment of the National Debt were no catch penny
                        phrases to win votes, and to be abandoned as soon as the votes were secured.
                        A cheering feature to the whole people is that the monthly statement of the
                        National finances always shows a larger reduction of the debt than was
                        anticipated. In last week's issue of the REPOSITORY we stated on the

                        there would be little if any reduction of the debt during the month of
                        August, owing to the payment of the semi-annual pensions. A few days after,
                        when the report was made public by Secretary Boutwell, a reduction of
                        $5,604,234, was shown, making since the 1st of March last an aggregate
                        amount of debt paid off of $49,500,758, or an average annual reduction of
                            One Hundred millions. It has always seemed to
                        us that the Democracy themselves have furnished the most satisfactory
                        vindication of President Grant, by their ridiculous attempts to ridicule his
                        visits throughout the country during the summer months. If it were possible
                        to find any real, valid, objection to any of his official acts, how gladly
                        would they turn from the former, and arraign his administration before the
                        people for the latter. That they are unable to produce anything whatever,
                        has filled them with frantic despair. Each monthly statement of the National
                        finances adds to their discomfiture and mortification, and though a
                        misfortune to the whole country, they would hail a season of financial ruin
                        and embarrassment with genuine satisfaction.</p>

                    <p>Last year they claimed to prove by the incontestible evidence of figures that
                        the end of the fiscal year would show a deficit of one hundred and fifty
                        millions of dollars, that is, that the expenditures of the Government would
                        exceed the receipts by that sum. A trifling error in their reckoning of two
                        hundred millions, was all. Prophets of evil, they strove to the utmost to
                        make their statements good, but Grant and the Republican party disappointed
                        them, and hence these tears.</p>

<b>A Correction</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper sarcastically refutes the rumor that Asa Packer, Democratic
                    candidate for governor, raised and equipped a Union regiment during the war. The
                    editors joke that such a revelation would cost Packer thousands of Democratic
                    votes.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>For the sake of that large class of Democratic voters who from principle
                        would be driven away from the support of Packer for Governor, if it were
                        true, we brand the story that he equipped a regiment of Union soldiers,
                        during the war, as an unmitigated Republican lie, got up to injure him in
                        the esteem of the Democratic party.</p>

                    <p>If this fabrication were to be credited by the Democracy throughout the
                        State, Packer would lose a hundred thousand votes. Not even the fact that he
                        publicly entertained that prince of Copperheads, Vallandigham, at what was
                        thought to be his residence in Mauch Chunk, or that he judiciously retired
                        to Europe when his country was struggling in the grasp of a mighty
                        rebellion, or that he swindled his native town out of her just taxes, nor
                        all of these, though they are highly creditable from a Democratic point of
                        view, could save him from ignominious defeat.</p>

                    <p>We hasten to assure such Democrats as still cherish in the green and tender
                        recollection the memory of the "lost cause," and sincerely mourn its defeat,
                        that not through any act or deed of Asa Packer, was its melancholy and
                        untimely end brought about or hastened.</p>

                    <p>We quote the following from a recent number of the Mauch Chunk Gazette, and expect the Democratic journals
                        throughout the State to thank us for this prompt act of justice:</p>

                    <p>'Somebody has started the report that our worthy townsman (whom the Democracy
                        would take away from us and transfer to the insalubrious atmosphere of
                        Harrisburg) raised and equipped a regiment of soldiers during the war--Union
                        soldiers, we suppose, is meant; the report does not say which. But we are
                        able, on the best authority, to brand this story as a base slander,
                        concocted to injure him with that class of voters who were in the habit of
                        denouncing the soldiers for the Union as "Lincoln hirelings," &amp;c.
                        Not a person here in Mauch Chunk, his apparent residence, would have the
                        hardihood to charge that Judge Packer ever equipped or recruited a single
                        soldier during the late war. The nearest approach to it was his well-known
                        offer on behalf of the Lehigh Valley Railroad to its employees--who might
                        volunteer to defend its and Judge Packer's property from the rebel raiders."</p>

                        taken by the court in relation to roads in different parts of the county.
                        This will be a matter of general interest, as well as desired information to
                        the particular localities that desire home improvements. On the 5th of

                        up by I. H. M'Cauley, Esq:</p>

                        all other proceedings in the case, so as to show at a glance all that may
                        have been done in each case, and the said Clerk shall, for his services, be
                        entitled to a reasonable compensation, to be fixed by the Court and paid by
                        the county."</p>

<b>Sudden Death</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

                    at his residence near Greencastle. He was 58 years old. He was the only son of
                    James Mitchell and leaves a number of friends and relatives to mourn his loss.
                    "Mr. M. had been in town on Thursday, looking as hale and hearty as in his
                    younger days, and being a man of lively temperment, every familiar face he met,
                    bid him the friendly greeting, 'How are you?' and every ear listened to his
                    sallies of wit and repartee; but little did his joyous friends think that ere
                    another half revolution of the dial of time he would be numbered with the dead."
