            <commentary/>
            <transcript>

               <p>The Democrats having nominated Asa Packer because he is rich, now ask the people
                  of Pennsylvania to elect him because he is not mean. Of the propriety of
                  nominating a man for Governor because he is not a pauper, we have nothing now to
                  say; but that we should elect him because he is not a miser is another matter.
                  Stephen Girard had much money and little faith. Does it follow that Philadelphians
                  must exalt him to religious infallibility because he left the city some millions?
                  If such a demand were set up we suspect it would fail, and we know it would
                  deserve to fail. And so with Packer.</p>

               <p>The people of Pennsylvania want a Governor who shall administer the laws of the
                  State faithfully: but they want something besides this. They demand that our next
                  Governor shall be one in whom the whole Republic will recognize an exemplar of the
                  principles of the Republican party, for the simple but sufficient reason, that
                  these principles demand that the sure and irrevocable results of the war for
                  freedom and perpetual union, shall become fixed and unalterable as the policy of
                  our government.</p>

               <p>Endowing a college is not in point. Possessing $20,000,000 has nothing to do with
                  the subject. If a candidate were as poor as Lazarus and a Patriot, he would do. If
                  he were as rich as Dives and countenanced the Rebellion, he is inadmissible. And
                  it is just here that the people will inquire most sternly and searchingly into the
                  antecedents of the rival candidates. The Republicans court the investigation, and
                  so do their candidates.</p>

               <p>Nearly a generation ago Geary and Packer were both Democrats. The Democratic party
                  embroiled the country in the Mexican war, that additional territory might be
                  secured for slavery. Packer, a cold, scheming, money-getting man, supported the
                  war for that reason. Geary, young, brave, enthusiastic, and patriotic, led his
                  command against a hostile army without inquiring into the aims and motives of the
                  war. It was enough for him to know that his country was waging war, and like a
                  soldier, he inquired very little beyond the fact that the flag should be upheld.
                  Years after when slavery demanded that Kansas should have the accursed institution
                  forced upon her against her will. Packer favored the execrable project, while
                  Geary, sent out as Governor, did his best to thwart the villainy. Afterwards when
                  the shock engendered by the Kansas-Nebraska iniquity, was about to tear the
                  Nation, Packer sympathized with secession, while Geary again drew his sword
                  against the heresy and crime. Geary held out country to be a nation with the
                  rightful power to defend its life; Packer insisted that it was a rope of sand, and
                  that "coercion" was treason. Geary believed that South Carolina committed treason
                  by firing upon the American flag; Packer that Massachusetts committed treason by
                  being in favor of liberty. While Geary was drilling the regiment for the field,
                  Packer was whining about "making war on our Southern brethren." When Geary was
                  driven back defeated and reinforcements were demanded, Packer was hand-in-glove
                  with the copperheads in preventing enlistments. When volunteering was well nigh
                  stopped by Packer and his party, and Geary was in sore need of men, the party who
                  now honor Packer, as their candidate, were doing all they could to obstruct the
                  draft, even to the shooting his country with his blood; Packer was doing
                  everything to thwart and defeat her.</p>

               <p>And now that the fearful conflict has passed, the difference between these two men
                  and their supporters remains, and these two have become representatives of the
                  policy and the principles now animating their followers. Geary insists that the
                  party that sent the Provost Marshal to enforce the draft should rule; Packer, that
                  the party that shot them is the fittest to govern. Geary and his party demand,
                  that the victory shall inure to the benefit of posterity; Packer and his party,
                  that it should be abandoned now. Geary insists that the debt, contracted in good
                  faith for a good purpose, shall be paid in good time with good money. Packer, that
                  the debt which represents the victory over treason should be obliterated by
                  repudiation at the same time that the victory of the union is thrown away. Both
                  are earnest, and both consistent, and between them Pennsylvania must choose.</p>

               <p>On that choice rests the future welfare, and the present fame of our State.
                  Arguments bearing on the subject should be made and patiently listened to. But
                  anything foreign to the subject should be discarded, for the issue is too
                  momentous. Endowing a college with $500,000 has nothing to do with the subject;
                  and least of all the endowment of a college under the control of a church that
                  never gave one word of comfort or encouragement to our cause in its darkest days.
                  The colossal fortune of Packer has nothing to do with this issue. His liberality
                  has nothing to do with it. Marc Anthony was the ablest orator who ever used the
                  arguments of the Democratic party of to-day. But not all his eloquence and
                  sophistry could make the Romans believe in Caesar's patriotism, nor forget, that
                  with all his wealth and his gifts, Caesar was the enemy of his country. - <emph

            <transcript>

               <p>The Democratic party enter into the campaign with an unquestioning assurance of
                  success. Strangely oblivious of the great <orig reg="offenses">offences</orig>
                  which they have committed within the past few years, they still more strangely
                  suppose the people have forgotten them. What new hope gives ardor to their
                  efforts? Certainly not that the country has grown indifferent already to the
                  heroes who saved it on the battlefield, or to the statesmen who have kept its
                  honor untarnished by wise legislation, by preserving its fair fame, in keeping
                  faith with its creditors, by sustaining good order within its borders, and by
                  faithfully collecting its revenues and diminishing rapidly the mountain of public
                  debt, which the crimes of the Democratic party piled upon our shoulders. Not at
                  all. They know better than this. They do not hope to be forgiven so soon for
                  bringing on the rebellion, and for actively sympathizing with its armed troops,
                  and its treacherous abettors. They have not acknowledged their iniquities
                  contritely in sack cloth and ashes. No new born love for the brave men who saved
                  the government by their toils and blood has awakened in their breasts, that they
                  can come forth manly and ask for pardon. The soldier is no dearer to them now,
                  than when he stood front to front with the enemy in the enemy's land. General
                  Hancock failed to arouse their enthusiasm, when false friends sought to sully his
                  record by placing him before the country as the standard bearer of those whose
                  hearts were with Pickett's brigade. General M'Candless, a gallant officer whose
                  sword was mightier than his pen, and whose only infidelity to the constituents of
                  the Harrisburg Convention of July 14, was that he was on the Union side of the
                  lines in many hard battles, just received enough of support to show that they had
                  noticed his presumption in offering to lead them against a brother in arms in a
                  political campaign. General Cass, a West Point graduate, who Achilles-like simply
                  kept his great military talent in abeyance during the war, for this very reason
                  came nearer suiting them. But they apprehended, perhaps, that the very name of
                  General, however disgraceful under the circumstances, would arouse the animosity
                  of their radical followers, and they tossed him out of the ring, after he had won
                  a majority of the delegates fairly.</p>

               <p>They have repented of none of their follies and sins; the people, have lost none
                  of their gratitude for their defenders. Whence, then, the bright hopes of the
                  Democracy? With shame be it spoken, they trust to the money-bags of their
                  candidate. They propose to pave their way to the Gubernatorial chair with gold.
                  This is a new proposition, and wants but one factor to ensure its success - a
                  corruptible people. Bold and bad is this flagrant attempt, but it will meet with
                  the reprobation of the voters of the Keystone State, and its perpetrators will
                  receive one lesson more.</p>

               <p>In this county a prodigious effort will be made. As the Democracy here were among
                  the first to bring the golden calf before the public, they expect to share largely
                  in the spoils of the victory it is expected to achieve. Hence their zeal. They are
                  wise in their generation. But a virtuous community will understand their motives,
                  and will prefer to keep the government in the hands of an honest poor man, who has
                  served the State, instead of intrusting it to the care of an ambitious aspirant
                  who seeks to buy honors with his gold.</p>

               <p>Has John W. Geary ever said anything, in any of his messages, in favor of the
                  payment of the losses sustained by the people of Chambersburg and of Franklin
                  county during the war? Elect Asa Packer and see whether he don't say something
                  about it. - <emph rend="italics">Spirit</emph></p>

               <p>The contingency is entirely too trifling for the sacrifice. Elect Packer Governor,

                  about our losses. Why of course he would. Words are cheap and empty. We want

                  any rate for our votes. Neighbor, can't you do better. Our losses are not over
                  three millions. Packer is worth twenty millions. Let him make good our losses and
                  we will guarantee him a solid Republican vote in Franklin County. Three millions
                  out of his twenty will still leave him a moderate competency, and the honor of
                  being Governor of Pennsylvania thrown in. Now neighbor, if you are authorized to
                  negotiate for Packer just tell him he must do better. If it were words we wanted,
                  we would prefer them before the election instead of after, but we don't believe
                  that Packer's word is of much account either before or after elections on this
                  subject. Let us here from you again.</p>

               <p>REPORT OF THE RESOLUTIONS.</p>

               <p><emph rend="italics">Resolved,</emph> That we endorse the platform of principles
                  enunciated by the late Republican State Convention at Philadelphia, and the
                  candidates there placed in nomination.</p>

               <p>2d. That the principles and policy of President Grant's administration; and the
                  sentiments of his inauguration address, are thoroughly Republican, wise and
                  statesmanlike, and the settled peace of the nation, and the splendid management of
                  the finances of the country by his Secretary of the Treasury are the first fruits
                  of the national victory of 1868.</p>

               <p>3d. That the prudent pure and economical administration of the affairs of the
                  Commonwealth by Gov. John W. Geary justified, and in connection with his eminent
                  military services and patriotic devotion in the dark days of the Republic,
                  demanded his renomination.</p>

               <p>4th. That Hon. Henry W. Williams, our candidate for the Supreme Bench, is a Judge
                  learned, upright and independent, adorning the position he now fills as he long
                  adorned the seat he vacated.</p>

               <p>5th. That we enshrine in our hearts the gallant dead who died for their country in
                  a just war, and renew our pledge to their widows and orphans. We pride in the
                  beneficent care a Republican administration has taken of their children; we
                  remember the services and sacrifices of the survivors and their claims upon us.</p>

               <p>6th. That the duties of allegiance on the part of the people and protection on the
                  part of the government are reciprocal. That whereas the Border counties, lying
                  open and exposed to the sudden incursions of the enemy, were depleted of their
                  strength in furnishing the equal quotas to the army, and were left by the State
                  unprovided with organization or means of defence, and thereby suffered burdens and
                  losses unequal with the rest of the people of the Commonwealth, it becomes the
                  Stat as a whole to repair their injuries from the common treasury, and we instruct
                  our candidate for Assembly, if elected, to insist upon such reparation.</p>

               <p>7th. That we rejoice in the removal from the arena of politics of dangerous and
                  distracting "Negro Question," by the adoption of the 15th Amendment - now rendered
                  certain - whereby the integrity and internal peace of the nation are relieved from
                  jeopardy for all time, and the constitution is put in accord with the Declaration
                  of Independence and the sentiments of the liberal world.</p>

               <p>8th. That we commend to the cordial and united support of the Republicans of
                  Franklin county the ticket this day placed in nomination.</p>

               <p>Resolutions were unanimously adopted.</p>

            <summary>The Chambersburg Academy begins its second year under the charge of Prof. J. H.
               Shumaker. The paper praises Shumaker for the success of the academy which has become
               a "source of pride and satisfaction to our town." Shumaker, an experienced teacher,
               took charge of the school after it had been rebuilt in wake of the fire. Attendance
               has been filled to capacity ever since. His program of education is "plain, solid,
               substantial" with nothing "light" or "frivolous."</summary>
