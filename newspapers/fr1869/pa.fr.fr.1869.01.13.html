</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The message of Gov. Geary is a good one. His statements in relation to the
                        finances of the State will be gratifying to taxpayers. In two years the
                        State debt has been reduced $4,209,336. The balance of debt is $33,286,946.
                        We can almost see to the beginning of the time when the entire State debt
                        will be wiped out, as that time is sure to come before many years, if the
                        economical administration inaugurated and carried on by Republican Governors
                        be continued.</p>

                    <p>The school affairs of the State receive their share of attention from the
                        Governor, who declares them to be in excellent condition. 800,000 pupils are
                        taught in Common Schools at an average cost for each pupil of but $7 74 1/2.
                        Teachers receive an average salary of $195.17 1/2.--Wouldn't it be more to
                        the credit of the State if the cost were a little greater and the average
                        salaries of teachers about twice as much? Isn't there great danger of its
                        being true that this cheap teaching is due chiefly to the fact that its
                        quality is very indifferent? and that the expenses of the school system is
                        kept down to this minimum rate at a heavy expense to the intelligence of the
                        pupils?</p>

                    <p>Surely no person who has the necessary intelligence and ability for a first
                        class Common School teacher can afford to teach five or six months of the
                        year for $195 17 when brain power can command the price it does in other
                        departments.</p>

                    <p>A good Registry Law is insisted upon. The experience of the last general
                        election is too fresh in the memory of all to make it necessary to argue
                        this matter.--We need a stringent Registry Law to prevent frauds, and
                        protect the purity of the ballot box, we mean what is left of its purity.
                        But let it be simple in its provisions, and not so loosely framed as that an
                        ox-cart can be driven through it, as was the case with the one of last
                        winter. Skillful lawyers, if there be such in the present Legislature,
                        should prepare a Registry Law that will not conflict with any provision of
                        the Constitution, and while it will be sufficient to prevent the frauds
                        which have made our elections a shame and disgrace, it will not impose
                        complicated and unnecessary trouble upon voters.</p>

                    <p>Many other subjects of interest to the people were carefully reviewed in the
                        message, which will be found on the first page of to
                            day's papers.</p>

<b>The Gough Lecture and the Valley Spirit</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An anonymous contributor answers the criticisms of the Valley Spirit. The latter belittled a recent lecture given by Prof.
                    Wilson.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository
                    </p>

                    <p>As a member of the Ladies' Mite Society of the M.E. Church, I cannot permit
                        the criticism of the Valley Spirit upon the
                        exercises in our church on New Year's night, to pass without correcting some
                        of its mistakes. The article says "we were drawn to the church, by the
                        announcement that Prof. Wilson would deliver one of Gough's lectures in a
                        style that would surpass the delivery of the
                        great orator himself." No such announcement was made; nor was it claimed
                        that Prof. Wilson was "a second and improved edition of Mr. Gough," as was
                        said by a correspondent of the Valley Spirit of
                        the same issue. The editor continues:--"The delivery of the lecture was a
                        failure,--he failed to make his hearers feel that he felt what he was
                        uttering."</p>

                    <p>I respectfully differ from this sweeping denunciation. It was neither failure
                        to the size of the audience, the amount of money realized, nor the
                        impression made upon his hearers, excepting the critical editor of the Valley Spirit. On the contrary, many hearts were
                        thrilled by the scenes depicting the horrible effects of drunkenness, and
                        with many others, I was affected to tears. But then, the editor will say, it
                        don't take much to make a woman weep; but I saw men, too, who I know are
                        competent judges of such performances, deeply interested and affected, who
                        at the close of the lecture expressed their high admiration of the manner in
                        which Prof. Wilson gave the lecture, and hoped it might be repeated here at
                        some future time. The editor says "Prof. Wilson moves to and fro upon the
                        stage, and rants vehemently" I have had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Gough
                        frequently, and my recollection of him is, that he is full of action; in
                        many parts of his lcetures rapid and vehement;
                        and where is there a public speaker, that requires more range of platform
                        than Gough, or moves "too and fro" upon it more than he does? Prof. Wilson's
                        voice, action and gestures were natural, appropriate and effective. It was
                        neither expected, nor announced that we would have a perfect imitation of
                        Mr. Gough. We neither heard nor saw anything in the Prof's delivery to
                        offend correct taste,--however there is no accounting for the diversity of
                        tastes.</p>

                    <p>The servants of Mrs. Siddons, while she was rehearsing for her famous private
                        readings from Milton and Shakspeare thought
                        their mistress mad, and used to say, "there is the old lady making as much
                        noise as ever, how she rants and walks the floor." Again the critic says:
                        "Eleven years ago we heard Mr. Gough tell the story of the Atlantic with
                        such astounding power as to life his auditors to their
                            feet." Now it was not in the programme, that any such effect
                        would be produced, neither would the price of admission have justified so
                        difficult an undertaking, in the efforts of the ladies, to raise a little
                        money to help remodel the church. Prof. Wilson's failure to accomplish this
                        feat, seems to be one of the critic's principal
                        regrets, and his main reason for pitching
                        into this part of the exercises. Perhaps when the lecture is repeated next
                        month, some arrangement can be made to have the gentleman critic raised
                        (Mahomet-like) during the recital of the Atlantic story. The society would
                        have been pleased to have had Mr. Gough lecture for them, but not having
                        $250 on hand (which amount has been paid him by the enterprising men of the
                            Valley Spirit Prof. Wilson kindly volunteered
                        his services. Under these circumstances it was not clever in the gallant editor to try to underrate the efforts of
                        the ladies in so laudable an undertaking. A METHODIST LADY.</p>
