<b>Hens Come Home to Roost</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports on the recent rape of a black woman by white men. It
                         uses this episode to argue against the Democratic paper's attempts to use

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                         <p>A horrible, inhuman and nameless outrage committed on the person of a
                              colored woman, by a gang of lawless and devilish white persons, in the
                              Capitol Grounds, at Harrisburg, last week, bids us to remember that no
                              race is free from the commission of crime; and that they who fabricate
                              arguments for withholding his civil rights from the negro because of
                              his proneness to violate the laws of the land and of his unavoidable
                              ignorance, find the same reasons weigh a thousand fold stronger
                              against their own than the colored race. We Republicans deny the force
                              of argument in the one case, and of course it fails in the other. But
                              they who admit and use it in the one, cannot escape from its
                              legitimate conclusion in the other, with this condition added, which
                              makes it still stronger, that they cannot plead the mitigation of
                              ignorance. A report of the crime to which we refer will be found in
                              our local columns, taken from the Harrisburg Patriot, a Democratic journal not likely to step beyond
                              the truth in the account it gives.</p>

                         <p>This recalls to our recollection the outrages perpetrated by a colored
                              man upon several respectable white girls, in this neighborhood, a few
                              months ago, and the dishonest attempt of a Democratic journal in our
                              midst to shift the responsibility of his crimes upon the Republican
                              party. No man honestly believed that anything save the depravity of
                              his own nature incited the negro boy, Cain Norris, to the commission
                              of the crimes for which he was fairly tried and convicted, any more
                              than he believes that the Democratic party is responsible for the
                              outrages committed by persons of undisputed Caucasian blood at
                              Harrisburg, upon a defenceless colored girl. Yet the inference is just
                              as strong in the one case as in the other, and the conclusion just as
                              reasonable. It was the trick of a political demagogue to seize the
                              intense excitement which prevailed in the case of Cain Norris, when
                              the calm judgment of men was unsettled, and turn it from the real
                              offender, for the meanest sort of political effect; we know no words
                              sufficiently expressive to portray the meanness. Here is an outrage
                              with its changed circumstances perhaps as unmitigated in horror as
                              that. Let us see what this same journal has to say concerning it.
                              True, it affords the Democratic party no chance to make political
                              capital out of it. The victim was only one of a despised race, and the
                              criminal offenders were of unmistakable white blood. But that does not
                              mitigate the offence in the eyes of the law. Besides, there does not
                              seem to have been only one fiend here, but a dozen. The report says
                              that eight of the offenders were arrested, and warrants were out for
                              others concerned in it. Nor is there any excuse on the ground of
                              ignorance of right or of the law. Their extraction is so honorable
                              that their names are withheld from publication, on account of the
                              respectability of their connections. They did not have any revenge to
                              wreak upon the negro race, in the person of this woman, for fancied
                              injuries to the white race, because the injuries have all been on the
                              other side.</p>

                         <p>Perhaps, taking all the circumstances of these two cases, there is as
                              little to be said in extenuation of the one which occurred last week,
                              as of the other. Human nature is considerably lower than angelic
                              nature, and statutes have been framed to protect the innocent and
                              punish the guilty, not because we have negroes, or because the
                              Republican party has been instrumental in restoring them their rights,
                              but because crime has existed in every age and every land. We would
                              suggest to our neighbors the danger of constructing political theories
                              whose ghosts come back to haunt them. The example of the old fellow
                              who was "hoist with her own petard" is worthy of contemplation, old as
                              it is. The inventor of the guillotine was himself beheaded by it, and
                              an old and popular poet sang:</p>

                         <p>"O wad some power the giftie gie us<br> To see oursels as ithers see
                              us,<br> It would frae mony a blunder free us."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                         <p>The city election, in Washington last week, resulted in the choice of
                              the Republican candidates, by an overwhelming majority. With the
                              exception of riotous conduct on the part of colored voters at one of
                              the polls, the quiet and order of the city was not disturbed. The
                              prompt and energetic action of the police suppressed the disorder
                              before it had time to become serious, but not until several of the
                              rioters were wounded and some of the officers had received serious
                              hurts. It seems, the disturbance was caused by some colored
                              Republicans, who attacked another colored man voting the Democratic
                              ticket. This man, Stewart, it is said has a number of colored men in
                              his employ, whose wages he refused to pay unless they agreed to vote
                              his ticket, which they refused to do, and hence the feeling aroused
                              against him. Whether this is so or not we are unable to tell, and it
                              makes little difference if it is. It furnishes no justification for
                              the unlawful and riotous conduct of those who attacked him. The
                              attempt of men, either white or black, to interfere with the free
                              exercise of the right of suffrage should be severely put down. Too
                              many election riots have occurred, of late years, in our principal
                              cities, and all so far as we know by roughs voting the Democratic
                              ticket, except this one in Washington, and not a single one of the
                              offenders has been punished that we ever could learn. We hope they
                              will not be a precedent in this case. We don't want the Republican
                              party to encourage such disorders by allowing Republicans who
                              interfere with the rights of an opposing but lawful voter at the polls
                              to escape punishment. The voter who will use violence is no
                              Republican, and has mistaken the party with which he ought to
                              affiliate. He has failed to understand the first principle of
                              republicanism, which concedes to all persons the same rights it claims
                              for its own voters.</p>

                         <p>We protest, however, against the effrontery of those Democratic journals
                              which charge the negro's unfitness to vote, from this disorder in
                              Washington, and conveniently forget the commission of similar outrages
                              at the polls in Philadelphia and New York within the last year by
                              white Democrats.</p>

<b>Chase and Logan</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper denounces Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase who seems to be
                         positioning himself for nomination as the next Democratic candidate for
                         president. The paper asserts that he is "leaving nothing undone to court
                         favor with the rebels of the South. He has forfeited long since the respect
                         and love of loyal men, and adds but little to his disgrace when he asks
                         Union men to commemorate the heroism of traitors." The paper contrasts his
                         behavior to the patriot John Logan who founded the Grand Army of the
                         Republic.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                         <p>The Harrisburg Patriot and Union thinks that
                              the ratification of the 15th Amendment would be political industrial
                              suicide to Pennsylvania, because it would largely increase the number
                              of representatives in Congress from the Southern States.</p>

                         <p>How will enlarged representation in Congress from the South endanger
                              Pennsylvania? If the Southern States are entitled to representation on
                              the same basis with Pennsylvania and the other Northern States, what
                              right have we to object to their being increased in the same ratio?
                              Can it be wrong for Pennsylvania to do right, and if so, how?</p>

                         <p>This is the last argument of the Democracy against the 15th Amendment.
                              Don't pass it, gentlemen, because as it stands now a two-fifths of the
                              colored population of the Southern States is not represented, while
                              all of the North is If you pass it the entire population of the South
                              will be represented, just as that of the North, and though it is but
                              just and fair to do so, just so much of our power in Congress will be
                              taken away from us.</p>

                         <p>This is blowing hot and cold with a vengeance. We are surprised and
                              startled at the facility with which Democratic journals change their
                              positions. Accustomed as we have grown to hearing them cry out against
                              the injustice of the Radicals against the Southern States, we were not
                              prepared to find the Patriot take a new
                              departure, this time urging that the same Radicals have been conceding
                              entirely too much to the South. Well, which we have been forced to
                              hear so much, boiled down, resolves itself into hatred for the
                              Republican party, just what we always thought it was. Will the
                              Democracy of the Southern States please make a note of it?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                         <p>About nine o'clock on Tuesday evening, the 8th inst., a colored woman
                              named Lucy M'Gill was ruthlessly attacked and outraged by young
                              ruffians of this city. The heinous crime was enacted in the immediate
                              vicinity of the monument, where a number of roughs had congregated. As
                              the woman was passing in company with a colored female associate, one
                              of the ringleaders clutched her, while another, assisted by three of
                              his friends, succeeded in violating her person. Several others
                              subsequently attempted to perpetrate the same crime, but were deterred
                              from its accomplishment by the struggles and cries of the woman. The
                              other female in the meantime escaped. In addition to those
                              participating in the outrage, a number of their friends were in close
                              proximity viewing the affair. Two of the principals were yesterday
                              held in the sum of $800 to answer the charge preferred by the
                              prosecution. Five of the by-standers were also bound over as witnesses
                              in the same amount. Others are yet at large. The wretches implicated
                              by the evidence of the outraged woman are well known in this vicinity,
                              on account of their prominence in several disturbances that occurred a
                              few months since. Were it not for the humiliation it would bring to
                              their family connections, we would publish their names in conspicuous
                              characters, and let the people know the miscreants who have so
                              wantonly violated common decency. They are all
                                   white men, while the victim of their licentiousness is a black
                                   woman. It is hoped the guilty parties will be prosecuted
                              to the full extent of the law. Too much leniency has heretofore been
                              shown ruffians in this city, and it is high time that it give way to
                              justice. The peace and quiet of the community demand that an example
                              be made of those who have repeatedly instigated disturbances and
                              capped the climax of their infamy by committing a deed that should
                              mantle their cheeks with shame and cause them to welcome the walls of
                              a prison as a screen from the gaze of an indignant people. - Harrisburg Patriot.</p>
