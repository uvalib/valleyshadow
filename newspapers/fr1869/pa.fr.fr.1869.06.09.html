<b>The Border Counties</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository calls for damages to be paid to
               border county residents whose property was harmed during the war. The paper blames
               unsympathetic and insincere politicians in the legislature for the failure of
               previous efforts on behalf of the border claimants.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

               <p>Adams, Franklin, Fulton, Bedford, Cumberland, Perry and York counties were the
                  principal sufferers in property, in Pennsylvania, from the rebellion. Of these
                  Franklin county sustained much the heaviest loss. They represent a claim of
                  several millions dollars, in round numbers, against the State, expressed by the
                  term "Border Damages," for which they have vainly striven since the war to secure
                  compensation. The chief difficulty in the way of payment of this just claim by the
                  State to a portion of her loyal citizens, strange to say, lies with the
                  Legislature. All the efforts of the citizens of these counties to obtain from the
                  State a recognition of their right to be paid for these losses has resulted in
                  nothing more than the appointment of a commission by the Legislature of the winter
                  of '67 and '68, to ascertain their amount, with the avowed purpose of presenting
                  the bill to the general government for payment, but carefully disclaiming any
                  responsibility on the part of the State. Yet no person disputes the fact that
                  these losses fell upon the people of the border counties without any fault of
                  theirs. All admit that they then performed their whole duty to the State, and have
                  not failed to do so since. It is conceded by every one that the whole State should
                  equally sustain the losses which fell upon the border counties, through the
                  failure of the State authorities to protect the State against invasion, and if one
                  were to judge solely from the equity and justice of this claim, and the general
                  expression of opinion regarding it throughout the State, he would conclude that
                  its speedy and satisfactory settlement was certain beyond peradventure. This,
                  however, is by no means the true state of the case. The truth is, gratitude is not
                  the most lively emotion of the human heart, and those whose property escaped
                  because the border counties fed the fire brand and hungry stomachs of the rebels,
                  have no disposition to show their appreciation of their own good fortune by
                  putting their hands into their pockets and standing their share of the losses.
                  They object to paying at this late day, and trump up a lot of flimsy excuses. A
                  majority of the members of both houses of the Legislature is afraid to take a step
                  looking towards the payment of these claims, test their constituents will refuse
                  to return them. They have wriggled into the office of lawmakers heretofore not for
                  the public good, but for the sake of the spoils, and honest and just legislation
                  stands a sorry chance at their hands. As long as our Legislatures are composed
                  largely, as they have been for some years, of this corrupt material, it is idle to
                  expect any settlement of our border damages.</p>

               <p>The Republican State Convention will meet in Philadelphia on the 23d day of the
                  present month to nominate candidates for Governor, and Judge of the Supreme Court.
                  Let the delegates from the border counties demand of the Convention some
                  recognition of the justice of these claims, and of the obligation of the State to
                  pay them; and let the Convention pledge the party to their support. Let this be
                  done, and a Republican Legislature will no longer dare to refuse to make
                  compensation for our losses. We urge the journals of the border counties to
                  impress this measure upon their delegates, and upon the people generally. Let us
                  see if the Republican party, in convention assembled, is more just than a
                  Republican Legislature. It is time that the border counties be fairly treated, and
                  that political speculators be no longer allowed to misrepresent the State in this
                  matter.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Citizens" write to advocate the nomination of Capt. James C. Patton of

               Patton was a brave soldier, did good service in the cause of his country, and rose
               from a private to the rank of Captain purely by his merit. Since the close of the war
               he was, until lately, engaged in the mercantile business in Mercersburg, where his
               courageous efforts to bring to merited punishment a band of lawless marauders,
               thieves and counterfeiters, who infested that community, drew upon them their
               revenge. His life was repeatedly threatened by them, and twice his property was
               fired, resulting in serious loss both in the destruction of goods, and damage to his
               business. He was at length compelled to abandon his business." The letter especially
               stresses his military service, devotion to the party, and general competence as
               reasons for his nomination.<br>

                  Fulton, Bedford, Adams, Cumberland, York and Perry.</p>

               <p>The delegations from the adjoining counties reported what had been done in their
                  districts, and stated that they had come here for the purpose of acting in concert
                  with us. The Executive Committee of Franklin county, of which B. F. Nead is
                  Treasurer, reported that $195,23 had been collected. The sub-committees in the
                  different townships have been working successfully since the Convention in
                  February in securing signers to petitions to the next Legislature.</p>

               <p>On motion of Mr. M'Knight, a committee was appointed to draw up resolutions. The
                  committee consisted of Wm. C. M'Knight, Esq., Hon. C. M. Duncan, R. P. M'Farland,
                  Esq., of Franklin county; Hon. Henry Ruby, of Cumberland county, and Dr. Duffield,
                  of Fulton county, who reported the following resolutions:</p>

               <p>WHEREAS, We the representatives of the citizens of the countless of Bedford,
                  Fulton, Franklin, Adams, Cumberland, York and Perry, in Convention assembled,
                  feeling the necessity of some concerted action in regard to the payment of the
                  damages to and losses of property sustained in the counties aforesaid, by the
                  raids and incursions of the rebels, and losses and damages sustained by the Union
                  troops during the late war:</p>

               <p>And whereas, These losses and damages as aforesaid
                  were duly, fairly and justly adjudicated by able, honest and efficient
                  Commissioners, duly appointed in pursuance of the acts of Assembly; therefore</p>

               <p>Resolved, That is the unanimous opinion of this
                  Convention, that it is just and right that the Legislature of the Commonwealth of
                  Pennsylvania should pass a bill providing for the prompt payment of these claims,
                  as adjudicated and filed in the office of the Auditor General of the State.</p>

               <p>Resolved, That every sense of justice, equity and fair
                  dealing between citizens of the same Commonwealth, should prompt the members of
                  the State Legislature representing districts more favored by fortune; who suffered
                  less by the calamities of the late war, to aid and espouse our cause, which is
                  founded in justice and right, and in conformity with the obligations placed upon
                  them by the Constitution of our State.</p>

               <p>Resolved, That this Convention publicly proclaim its
                  thanks to all the members of the Legislature who have interested themselves and
                  sought to do justice by their influence and votes, to their suffering
                  fellow-citizens in the border counties.</p>

               <p>Resolved, That this Convention respectfully request
                  the newspapers of the State to give prominent publicity to the same.</p>

               <p>Resolved, That when this Convention adjourns, it
                  adjourns to meet on the 1st Monday in November next, at 10 o'clock, in
