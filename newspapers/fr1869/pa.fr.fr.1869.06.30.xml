                    <p>Our State Convention, which met in Philadelphia, on the 23d inst., nominated
                        for <orig reg="reelection">re-election</orig> Gen. Geary, and Hon. H. W.
                        Williams for Supreme Judge. No opposition appeared against Judge Williams,
                        and he was nominated by acclamation. The same can almost be said of Gov.
                        Geary, he having received one hundred and twenty-two votes out of one
                        hundred thirty-three on the first ballot. The resolutions passed appear in
                        another column, and will meet the hearty approval of every true Republican.
                        The proceedings of the Convention were singularly harmonious, and foreshow a
                        united and triumphant campaign.</p>

                    <p>We endorse the nominations cordially, and go into the canvass with cheerful
                        assurances of a happy issue. The people of Pennsylvania will ratify the
                        action of the Convention, which, by its unusual unanimity, reflected their
                        sentiments so truly. They have tried Gov. Geary, and have found him a "good
                        and faithful servant; who has done their will, and administered the affairs
                        of the State wisely and economically." They can't afford to do without him,
                        and won't. Under his administration they found their debt diminishing, a
                        rigid economy enforced, unwise legislation suppressed, corrupt influences
                        broken up, and political and moral purity reigning in the Executive
                        department. They have found their Governor as wise as a statesman as he was
                        brilliant as a soldier; and that the debt which they owed him for his
                        services in the field has been increased by his services "no less renowned"
                        in the chair of State. They are too generous and noble to let them go
                        unrewarded!</p>

                    <p>The short period which Judge Williams has served on the supreme bench has
                        been long enough to prove the qualities claimed for him by his many friends.
                        A purer citizen does not belong to the State; an abler Judge nowhere adorns
                        the bench. A member of the Republican party because he finds that party the
                        guardian of law, order and just progress, - the preserver of the nation, and
                        the champion of the rights of man; he will never prostrate himself in the
                        mire of partizanship, and dishonor his robes of office to serve the mere
                        interest of party. Men of all parties will respect such a Judge, and we
                        predict that he will become the most honored member of the Supreme Court.</p>

                    <p>The gentlemen composing the Convention are among the most worthy and able
                        citizens of the Commonwealth, and are familiar with the wishes and feelings
                        of our people. They discharged their duty well, and have put upon us the
                        obligation of performing our part of the good work. Let us be up and doing.
                        The struggle before us will be a hard one, the incentive to duty a noble
                        one. We have not only to reward honest public servants; but to take care of
                        ourselves as dependant upon wise and skilful rulers. The present State
                        Administration has placed the Commonwealth in a safe and prosperous
                        condition. Let us see to it that no unwise change be made! The loss of
                        Pennsylvania to the Republicans next election would be of national
                        detriment. It would be felt disastrously by the nation. Gen. Grant has begun
                        his Administration with wisdom and success. The confusion, corruption and
                        violence that characterized public affairs during the disgraceful term of
                        the vilest of rulers and men, who has passed from office amid the just
                        execrations of the people, have given way to order, honesty and peace. The
                        rights of the people are preserved - lawlessness is suppressed - the public
                        debt is dissolving under the strict economy enforced, and an honest
                        collection of the revenue. Stability and strength have taken the place of
                        inquietude and weakness, and confidence has revisited the breasts of our
                        people. In other lands our nation is regarded with reverence and awe. Its
                        majesty is acknowledged. We are recognized as a powerful government in
                        strong hands. All hopes of our dissolution perished with the overthrow of
                        the Democratic party, which, led by Johnson and linked with rebels, kept up
                        discord and defied law. Under Grant the Administration is loved at home, and
                        respected and feared abroad. It is the duty of every Republican to
                        strengthen his hands. Our defeat in this State would be a discouragement to
                        him, and would revive the hopes of the desponding and tamed Rebels and
                        Copperheads. No man can put off the responsibility of saving his country.
                        Every one is under moral obligation to support right. We dare not be
                        negligent and indifferent. We must work and vote. It matters not whether we
                        are sure of the State, or not. But we may as well confess that we are sure
                        of the State only in the event of strong effort. Our ticket is all that we
                        can desire - our platform commends itself to the approbation of all; but
                        these are not self-electing - they must be enforced by <emph rend="italics"
                            >work</emph>, WORK, <emph rend="bold">WORK</emph>! Come forward then,
                        brother Republicans, and begin the campaign in earnest! Rest only on the
                        field of victory. Our standard bearers are worthy of our cause, our cause
                        worthy of the prayers and labor of true men. For our leader's sake, for our
                        cause's sake, for the State's sake, for the nation's sake, for our own sake,
                        be up and doing, Men of Pennsylvania!</p>

                    <p>Enterprise is contagious. Apart from the zest which men feel in attacking
                        obstacles, they are incited to work by seeing others reaping the fruits of
                        their labors. With peace and the resumption of the arts under the fairest
                        auspices ever vouchsafed to any people has opened the era of the world's
                        greatest national progress. The meeting of the locomotives at Corinne, a
                        month ago, opened the highway to India and Japan: the Great Eastern's prow
                        is cutting a furrow for the cable, today, which, ten days hence, will join
                        the two continents, and make the Atlantic narrower than the Rhine.
                        Everywhere these great triumphs are stimulating inquiry.</p>

                    <p>What can we do to put ourselves in connection with this teeming, busy, brain
                        which is accomplishing such colossal labors? What toil shall we undertake to
                        make ourselves partakers of this progress? What advantages of position, of
                        endowment, have we, which, if developed will quicken our life and reward our
                        efforts? Such questions every community, great or small, is asking itself.
                        As journalists, we see that they are being asked by our readers, and that
                        the answers are rapidly rounding into shape. It is time to set them our
                        plainly, and follow their biddings to action, for we wager that few
                        localities have more to gain or more to lose by activity or the want of it
                        in the coming months than the county of Franklin. Nearly wholly
                        agricultural, <orig reg="today">to day</orig>, though fertile and populous,
                        its people are a generation behind the East in thrift, in wealth, in
                        intelligence and in comfort. They are so because their labor is of a single
                        kind, and they are largely cut off from markets. The young men of the county
                        leave it, as birds do the nest when they first find themselves able to fly:
                        they would fail if they did not. Their labor and their brains go to stock
                        the empty counties of the west. A distant market is a poor substitute for
                        one at the door. Tolls and freight are a farmer's bane; they, worse than the
                        weevil, eat up his substance and leave him the chaff. Can this emigration be
                        stopped - these hands be saved to increase our labor - can consumption of
                        our crops be brought about on our own soil and saving transportation, we be
                        enabled to return to the soil what we take from it? Sore evils now, they
                        will become worse presently if they can't. We think they can - that the
                        evils can be cured, and great blessings brought about in their stead. How?
                        By railroads. We want a railroad from Broad Top to Gettysburg - passing
                        through Chambersburg - and having branches to Mercersburg and to Waynesboro,
                        the junction of the latter being at Fayetteville. In this enterprise we see
                        an almost fabulous development of the riches of the whole county. Our
                        strength, it is plain now, is in iron. Of this, the most valuable of all the
                        materials - gold does not for a moment compare with it - the county has
                        limitless beds, their quality is of the best in the Union. Their localities
                        are known: many are partially developed; some have been largely worked for a
                        generation; most are fresh for the miner. Limestone and water-power abound.
                        Coal alone is wanting in proximity to the ore. At Broad Top, a day's walk
                        only, lies the missing coal. Were it accessible, the smoke of a score of
                        furnaces might becloud our mountains and the noise of trip hammers make the
                        whole valley echo. Without, it we may lament our dullness till Gabriel's
                        trump shall sound. It is true that the task of reaching Broad Top may be
                        considered too great for a single county. It is for most Pennsylvania
                        counties, perhaps, though in the West or in the East, they would build it in
                        a year; but, a beginning once made, aid could be enlisted from abroad. It is
                        proposed to reach the ore at the North and the South Mountains by building
                        the roads from the centre of the valley to Mercersburg and to Fayetteville.</p>

                    <p>Mercersburg is in earnest, it is said, and means to reach the Cumberland
                        Valley road at some point. Last year $185,000 were ready for a road, from
                        Waynesboro "to a market." This sum is still in the hands of the spirited men
                        who offered it then, and is ready for use now, with $100,000 more, when
                        called for in earnest. Suppose now that these beginnings were made, that the
                        locomotive could go from Chambersburg to Fayetteville, and thence by
                        Funkstown, Quincy and Mont Alto Furnace to Waynesboro, how long would the
                        "Tape-worm" lie idle? And if the track were at Mercersburg, how long would
                        the gap to Broad Top lie unfilled? What interest of the county would then be
                        undeveloped? What township, South of the pike, would not be enriched in men
                        and money and the good they bring? Our readers may consider the result for
                        themselves - to attempt to even sketch the results would expose us to the
                        charge of extravagance. On the other hand; if we delay, we think a severe
                        punishment awaits us. The Pine Grove road will go to Gettysburg with the
                        Western Maryland - Mercersburg will look southwards, Waynesboro join herself
                        to Hagerstown and Baltimore, and we be left on the sand high and dry for a
                        score of years to come. We will richly deserve it, if, while all things are
                        yet plastic, we do not mould them to suit our necessities. We trust our
                        readers will think of what we have only tried to suggest, and that they will
                        carry these hurried and imperfect considerations out into fuller shape, and
                        develop them in timely action.</p>

                    <p>The Waynesboro <emph rend="italics">Village Record,</emph> in an editorial on
                        the subject of a railroad to connect Waynesboro with Chambersburg, by way of
                        Quincy and Fayetteville, makes the following pertinent suggestions. If it
                        were but possible to arouse the citizens of Franklin county to a just
                        appreciation of the relative importance of her location and material wealth,
                        to the great danger there is that her immense opportunities may be lost
                        through supineness and indifference, we might indulge strong hopes of her
                        future. It is not yet too late:</p>

                    <p>"Chambersburg, our county seat, has advantages of location, which, if
                        improved, would conspire to raise her far above the level of a small inland
                        town, only known from having been martyred in her rebuilt condition by a
                        lack of enterprise among her citizens. Only 40 miles from Broad Top Coal,
                        and convenient to Cumberland, she should be surrounded in the county by
                        large Blast Furnaces, and should embrace within her limits Rolling Mills and
                        Factories. She should by her manufactories afford literally a home market
                        for the rich products of our county's soil. Let her be up and doing. If the
                        magnitude of an undertaking to connect with Gettysburg by rail at once,
                        causes her to shrink, she can build five or six miles of the line now, with

                        it, and secure great interests east and south-east of you, which will
                        finally and at no distant day, open the door to Broad Top."</p>

                <summary>The paper praises the exhibition held by the Chambersburg Academy students
                    under the direction of Dr. J. H. Shumaker. A large number of people attended
                    from Chambersburg and surrounding towns. The students delivered their speeches
                    to perfection. The executive committee seated the spectators. The Aeolian Circle
                    also participated and gave excellent musical performances. The paper praises Dr.

                <summary>The friends of Wilson College met on the grounds of "Norland," formerly
                    owned by A. K. McClure and now owned by the college. College officials led a
                    tour of the grounds, and a delegation of ladies from area Presbyterianc Churches
                    attended the guests. College officials addressed the crowd, and stated that
                    opening is still one year off to ensure that the school starts on a solid
                    foundation.</summary>

                <summary>The citizens of Mercersburg have raised $130,000 for their railroad
                    enterprise. They still need to raise $20,000 before construction can commence.
                    The paper urges Franklin citizens to assist the project. Chambersburg residents
                    will benefit from the growth accompanying the road, and the prject would help
                    county residents "develop the vast mineral resources that lie hidden in their
                    lands, increase the value of property, and have an easy access to market."</summary>

                <summary>John A. Seiders will take possession of the Post Office tomorrow. He
                    received the appointment "on account of having been a good soldier and a sound
                    Republican. He was the first man to volunteer from this town in the late war."
                    B. A. Fahnestock, "who also served his country as a soldier," and Mr. S. Miller
                    Shillito, "an active and useful member of the Republican party," have been
                    appointed clerks. The paper bids fond farewell to outgoing postmaster Matthew
                    Welsh, his daighter Leida, and Jacob N. Flinder.</summary>
