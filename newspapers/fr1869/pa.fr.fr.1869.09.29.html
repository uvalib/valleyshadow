<b>To the Republicans of Franklin County</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper urges Republicans to work hard for victory in the coming
                    election, and reminds voters that the Democrats represent the party of slavery,
                    treason, and rebellion.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The days of preparation for the great conflict are fading rapidly away, and
                        the question will soon be settled whether the government of this great and
                        influential Commonwealth shall remain in the hands of those who have been
                        loyal to the country and humanity, or pass over to those who are hostile to
                        both.</p>

                    <p>It were a calamity, State and National, that we shudder to contemplate,
                        should the old Keystone be recreant to her record and to herself, and suffer
                        the false Democracy to seize the reins of power. This can only happen if
                        Republicans falter in the discharge of duty. We have a safe majority and our
                        people are earnest enough in their convictions of right. But we are prone to
                        relax our efforts, and we trust too much to well ascertained strength. Such
                        confidence will not do now. We are pressed by desperate, hungry antagonists,
                        who are working with incredible zeal, and are backed by a candidate whose
                        fabulous wealth is lavished for the corruption of the ballot-box. His
                        political history is but the history of his party--no better, it could not
                        be worse. He carries their standard, not because he has endeared himself to
                        the people of Pennsylvania by any public service he rendered them--not
                        because he has any qualifications of statesmanship. Other distinguished
                        gentlemen were pressed in their nominating convention, who served gallantly
                        during the war, or had given evidence of fitness for the administration of
                        public affairs.</p>

                    <p>They were pushed aside; and why? Because Asa Packer counts his money by
                        millions, and is willing to buy his way to power. And upon this sole
                        qualification, it is expected that he is to win the place of a patriot who
                        has filled with honor many places of public trust; who has added to the
                        glory of our arms in two bloody wars, and has paid his
                            taxes, discharged all his obligations, and is inferior to the
                        Democratic candidate only in being poor. There may be corrupt and beggarly
                        creatures in our ranks in the cities, who can be had for the price the
                        ambitious millionaire may be willing to pay for gubernatorial honors; but we
                        feel such purchasable material is scarce in the pure moral atmosphere of the
                        country. We will not lose here from this source. If we lose at all, it will
                        be from lukewarmness; from a want of realization of the importance of the
                        occasion; from indifference and paltry dissatisfaction.</p>

                    <p>What new good has the Democratic party developed, that atones for its
                        atrocious treason that drenched our whole territory in fraternal blood, and
                        left us a crushing burden of debt, to bear down our prosperity, and make
                        foreign governments insolent towards us? Has it spoken one kind word of the
                        heroes who bled and died in the country's cause? Has it honored with its
                        applause one great soldier, who has won glory in the struggle, unless he has
                        repented of his service, like Blair and Hancock, and bowed his suppliant
                        knees, in their interests? Are not their papers, and speeches and hearts
                        full of admiration of Lee, and Jackson, and the red handed villains who
                        slaughtered our patriotic countrymen, who held up the flag now glorious the
                        wide world over? Are they not as openly favoring the depreciation of our
                        currency, and moving towards repudiation, as ever? Have they grown any more
                        fond of freedom? Do they not still mourn for the halycon days of slavery,
                        when it secured Democratic majorities, which gave the government and its
                        chief offices to the lords of the lash, and dispensed the pap in free States
                        to their sordid followers, thankful for small favors for which no service
                        was too mean for them to render in return? True! they profess to acquiesce
                        in the abolition of slavery, but they insist that the negro is a brute,
                        incapable of civilization, and fit only for bandage.</p>

                    <p>The war has taught them nothing. The repeated indignant repudiation of them
                        by the people, has profited them nothing. As they were aforetimes, so are
                        they now. They are, perhaps, more artful and discreet. The danger of their
                        success may be less apparent; it is but little less real. Their triumph
                        would bring back into power, the unsoftened rebels, with hearts embittered
                        by disappointment and defeat. These miscreants wait, with unsuppressed
                        impudence, their hoped-for day of restoration, when the loyal public will be
                        at their feet.</p>

                    <p>Voters of Franklin county, will you play into their hands? Will you forget
                        your fidelity, in the bloody and dark days that have passed? You have
                        allowed them to steal into power partially. They are entrenched in your alms
                        house. Do not pass the county offices into their possession. They will use
                        them for party purposes. Men who made it necessary for your sires and sons
                        to leave your peaceful, happy homes to go to the front of the battle, while
                        they speculated in the calamities of war, will fatten coils of copperheads
                        upon your taxes.</p>

                    <p>It is enough if you forget the great hurt they inflict upon you; it is full
                        enough if you forgive them their almost unpardonable crimes; it were too
                        much, if you rewarded them for their iniquity. You will not do so. Honest
                        and capable men, who are in full accord with you now, who stood shoulder to
                        shoulder with you, when you sacrificed every
                        thing, to save the nation from disgrace and dissolution, are offered
                        for your suffrages.</p>

                    <p>Give them a day of service! If you hesitate to go to the polls, remember how
                        unfairly you act, how unkind to your own associates in sorrow, in danger,
                        and at length in such great glory. Remember you are untrue to your
                        convictions, that you fail in your duty.</p>

                    <p>Next to a deserter to the enemy in obloquy is the man who is absent from his
                        place in the hour of battle.</p>

                    <p>Republicans of Franklin county, save yourselves from self-reproach, and be
                        early at the polls!</p>

<b>The Future of the South</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints excerpts from an article defending the white South, and
                    blasts it for making peaceful Reconstruction less likely.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The great struggle for the perpetuity of the Union has now been over for more
                        than four years, and high hopes have been, and still are entertained by the
                        best friends of the nation that a firm and stable peace will soon again be
                        vouchsafed to a united country.</p>

                    <p>Reconstruction, though much delayed by the
                        treachery of him who so recently occupied the highest place in the
                        government, is still believed to be quietly and surely being accomplished,
                        according to the declared will of the people,
                        notwithstanding those who are wedded to the ancient condition of things.</p>

                    <p>This result, we of the North, hope will be brought about mainly through the
                        influences first, of the abolition of human
                        slavery; secondly, of the introduction of a free
                        population from abroad, and thirdly, by the
                        removal and establishment of Northern people and Northern capital in the
                        Southern States.</p>

                    <p>But whilst we depend so largely upon the influences of these agents in
                        changing the condition of affairs in the South--altering the feelings and
                        removing the prejudices of the people, and securing the grand results so
                        aredently desired--it is well at the same time to become acquainted, if we
                        can, with the views entertained of them by those whom we expect to be
                        subjected to their influences. We can thus judge much better, and more
                        surely, whether the results we hope for are likely to be obtained either
                        speedily or remotely.</p>

                    <p>We have been led to these reflections by the perusal of an article entitled
                            "Chivalrous Southrons," published in the
                            New Eclectic Magazine for the month of
                        October, 1869, in answer to an article in Harper's
                            Magazine of January and February last. The New Eclectic is published at Baltimore, and is devoted to the
                        "Lost Cause," and in the article referred to the author goes lengthily into
                        the causes of the recent rebellion, and gives
                        freely and fully the Southern view of the
                        subjects from which we of the North hope so much.</p>

                    <p>These views we infer may be taken as a true exponent of the educated Southron opinion upon these great questions, and
                        therefore we think the people of the North should be made more fully
                        acquainted with them than they will likely ever be through the circulation
                        of the New Eclectic alone. This must therefore be
                        our excuse for the following extracts:</p>

                    <p>"Many a cause has been assigned for the late war. The Northerners say that
                        the cause was Slavery; and that they, therefore, are the grand vindicators of
                        liberty. Mr. Alex Stephens also endeavors to show that this was the real
                        cause of the war. He is right as far as he goes, but he has made the contest
                        too much a mere difference about the words of the
                        constitution. If every word of the constitution had been against us, we
                        ought to have seceded from the Union of the United States, because it had become a vile despotism. If he had
                        dug deeper in his search for causes, Mr. Stephens might have turned up
                        another cause--the cause which set aside the constitution itself--the faithfulness of the Northern people. No words
                        however clear could bind this people. If the right of secession had been
                        expressly reserved to the States in the Constitution, it would have made no
                        difference whatever in the result. They would have made war upon us, just as
                        their interests or passions dictated, without the least regard to their
                        covenants. The same faithlessness accompanied all the compromises their
                        usurpations produced. They violated every one of them. The violation of the
                        last--the California compromise--and the formation of a sectional party
                        consisting of the Whigs and Abolitionists combined, with the mean subterfuge
                        of squatter sovereignty, by the only party which professed to respect the
                        constitution, satisfied the Southern people that there was no hope for the
                        constitution, and none for their institutions, or the principles of free
                        government, in the good faith of the North. They therefore seceded from the
                        Union they had voluntarily made with them."</p>

                    <p>"To break down and abolish the characteristics of the Southern people, and
                        reduce them to an assimilation with the Northern people, these
                        instrumentalities are relied upon. First. The influence of the negroes no
                        longer slaves, and now free. Second. Foreign immigration. Third Northern
                        immigration.</p>

                    <p>"1st. The emancipation of the slaves of the South, according to Northern
                        logic, is to work a complete overthrow of the characterisitics and
                        civilization of the South."</p>

                    <p>"There would be some force in this expectation, if the negro could change his
                        nature and lift himself beyond an inferiority to the white race. But if he
                        is still to continue an inferior, how does his exemption from slavery
                        abolish the sense of superiority in the white race? Under the teachings and
                        excitations of Northern emisaries, and the government of the United States,
                        all sympathy between the white and the black race is rapidly disappearing.
                        The negro is deteriorating from the civilization he possessed as a slave,
                        and relapsing into his natural barbarism. While a slave there were two
                        powerful supports to the civilization of the negro. He was the best fed and
                        clothed laborer in the world, and the marital
                        relations were enforced upon him. He must now
                        labor or starve. He will starve."</p>

                    <p>2d. "But immigration from foreign nations will mould and abolish the
                        characteristics of the South."</p>

                    <p>"It appears to be a law of all immigration, that the immigrant sinks in o the habits and mode of thought of the people with
                        whom he seeks a home. He comes as a friend, and he wants friends. His
                        children grow up with the children of the country, and it becomes their
                        country. Let the immigrant from Europe come. Let him come, as he always has
                        come to the South, not as a revolutionist, and enemy to the country; a busy
                        fermenter of hate between races, but a lover of order and peace, a friend of
                        education and industry, a hater of oppression and barbarism, and the whole
                        South will open its arms and say to him--come!"</p>

                    <p>3d. "The least instrumentality for revolutionizing and improving the character and civilization of the South, is
                        Northern immigration."</p>

                    <p>"The last people on earth to influence and change the Southern people by
                        their emigrant population, is the people of the North. There has never been
                        much love or respect for them among the Southern people; but now they come
                        into the country the living symbols of hate and tyranny. It is vain to say
                        that the peaceful emigrant who comes to cultivate the land, is not the
                        soldier who desolated the country. He is of that race--that race which for
                        seventy years has been false to their constitutional compacts, and which by
                        war and blood has made the Southern people political slaves--the slaves of
                        slaves--slaves to the most ignominious despotism. By the blessings of our
                        past, lost liberties, we cannot follow or imitate our destroyers. But the
                        Northern emigrant comes to us with a still fouler pollution. He is the ally,
                        the patron, the leader, the instigator of the negro race to rule and plunder
                        the white race. Identified with negroes in all their moral squalor and weak
                        barbarity, how can he have the least influence upon the white race to change
                        their characteristics? Yet, although he cannot influence the characterisitcs
                        of the South, the Northern emigrant may better his condition by emigrating
                        to the South. Politically he is not worse; for in the North the despotism of
                        the United States alike prevails. He is safe from molestation, if he will
                        leave others unmolested. His industry will have its reward, and in two
                        generations his children will be as good Southern men as walk the land. He
                        will soon understand the negro, and know his capacity to rule him, or to
                        rule himself. He will understand also the government of the United States,
                        in its sectional despotism, when he also is its victim. Let him come
                        therefore, and we will freely welcome him, if neither a carpet bagger, nor a miscegenist nor a
                        white-man hater. It matters not, however, what he is, so far as the
                        characteristics of the south are concerned. We may adopt them--he cannot change them."</p>

                    <p>"The late war against the south has laid the
                        Constitution of the United States in the coffin of consolidation. Its lid is
                        held down by two screws, one black and the other
                            yellow. We have got negro emancipation, and
                        negro equality already--and the Pacific Railroad being now completed, the
                        United States will receive into its boson, by the operation of the last
                        constitutional amendment, all the yellow races of Asia to an equal
                        participation of power with the white race in the government of the United
                        States. The civil war in Rome, in which the slaves were emancipated and made
                        citizens, destroyed the liberties of Rome. The same means must produce the
                        same results in the United States. Despotism--not the mere Despotism of
                            factions, but the Despotism of a sectional
                        majority, fixed, heartless and insatiable rules the United States, and must
                        ever continue to rule them under the present condition of things."</p>

                    <p>That there are many errors, misstatements and falsehoods in these quotations
                        will be perceived by every unprejudiced reader, and we give them, not to
                        attempt their refutation, for we have not the time for that, but to show the
                            animus controlling the intelligent minds of
                        the South towards both the government of the nation and the measures adopted
                        for the pacification of the lately rebellious States. If such be the
                        sentiments of the masses of the Southern people,
                        a complete and cordial Reconstruction must assuredly be more distant and
                        difficult than the friends of the Union had hoped. Upon the good sense of
                        the people there must depend the result.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The colored citizens of Chambersburg, had a grand celebration of the
                        Emancipation Proclamation, on the 22nd inst. The colored men from this
                        vicinity had been working for several weeks past, to have the occasion they
                        celebrated well observed on the part of their race, and their efforts were
                        very successful. Delegations were present from various points in the valley.
                        At 11 A.M. the procession was formed and moved through our principal
                        streets. The men in the ranks kept good time and marched well.</p>

                    <p>The following were the officers of the day:--Chief Marshal, Edward Lowery;
                        Assistant Marshal, David Patterson; Aids, Alexander Lewis and Ashford
                        Collins. Col. Henson Turner was in command of the military, which consisted
                        of the Independent Blues of Chambersburg, Capt. Alfred Bradford; Grant's
                        Rough and Ready Boys, Capt. Elijah Hommet; Lincoln Guards, of Mercersburg,
                        Capt. H. H. Watson; Cavalry Company from Mt. Alto, Capt. Shadrick Campbell</p>

                    <p>An entertainment was held in Reside's woods, near town, in the afternoon,
                        where not only large numbers of colored men and women assembled, but also a
                        goodly proportion of white men, to hear the orator, Prof. D. D. Brown, of
                        New Jersey. The meeting was organized by electing Rev. Isaac Gassaway
                        President, Rev. J. D. Brooks and Levi Lee Vice Presidents. The speaker was
                        introduced by Rev. Hopkins.</p>

                    <p>Prof. Brown is a pure black man, without the least tint of amalgamation about
                        him. His remarks were spoken in an earnest and forcible manner. He said,
                        among other things, that he was not in favor of any party which did not fear
                        God and regard race, color or condition as a necessary element of
                        citizenship; that there was no natural inferiority in any race, and that God
                        had endowed all men with the right of life, liberty and independence; that
                        all the colored men needed was an opportunity to show those who had been
                        oppressing them for years that they had intellects and could cultivate them.
                        He further said that as a representative of a race that had been loyal to
                        the "Stars and Stripes" when traitors attacked it; that as the
                        representative of a race that had shown its manhood and courage under the
                        lamented Col. Shaw at Fort Wagner, under Gen. Banks at Port Hudson, under
                        Gen. Grant at Petersburg, and in many other engagements, that had its
                        patriotic dead and wounded, who suffered and died, he demanded protection
                        from the rebels and assassins of the South, and Justice from the North; that
                        if the colored men could be trusted with the bullet in order to save the
                        sons and brothers and fathers of the North from the deadly fire of Jeff
                        Davis' army, that it was but right that they should have the ballot to
                        protect themselves. He spoke for about an hour. His manner was easy and
                        natural and many parts of his speech were full of outbursts of true
                        eloquence. His audience listened attentively. His colored hearers seemed
                        proud of this, their representative.</p>

                    <p>In the evening a festival was held in Repository Hall, which was well
                        attended. The order during the day and evening was excellent. There was no
                        disturbance of any kind. Everything passed off exceedingly creditable to
                        those who has this movement in charge.</p>
