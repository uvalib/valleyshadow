                    <p>What will become of us all? Every thing is going to perdition as fast as it
                        can. The Democrats are all screaming "look out," but nobody looks out worth
                        a continental. Grant is a miserable failure; all the members of his Cabinet
                        are miserable failures; his foreign Ministers are miserable failures; his
                        home appointments are miserable failures, every one of them. Everything is
                        out of sorts and out of joint, just as everything used to be when the rebels
                        were badly whipped in a great battle.</p>

                    <p>Won't the dear good Democrats please stop the eternal rushing of the
                        Administration to everlasting perdition? Just think! Last month it
                        recklessly paid off six millions of principal of the national debt, and
                        about as much of the interest, and not even Boutwell gave the alarm. Next
                        month still greater extravagance is to be indulged than last. What will we
                        do? What will we do? At this rate, if it be not checked, the time may soon
                        come when we will have no public debt to talk about, just as it has happened
                        with the "nigger." What a jolly time we once had taking care of the
                        "nigger," Now the Radicals with their tinkering have set the "nigger" free,
                        and made him an American citizen of the African persuasion, in whom the
                        Democrats have not the slightest interest. They are trying to do the same
                        thing with the national debt. Won't somebody just please give the alarm?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Gilbert C. Walker, the Conservative Republican, or Conservative candidate for
                        Governor of Virginia, in opposition to H. H. Wells, the Radical nominee,
                        opened the campaign at Norfolk, the other day, by a speech, among other
                        things in which he said: The serious question to be considered was
                        antagonism between the white and black, and the proscriptive measures of the
                        constitution showed this fact. The way to remedy such antagonism was for the
                        white man and black man to step together upon the true Republican platform
                        of universal suffrage and universal amnesty, and vote down that clause which
                        threatened the rights of both.</p>

                    <p>Governor Wells, of Virginia, lately invited Mr. Walker, the opposing
                        candidate to meet him at several points where political gatherings had been
                        called by Mr. Walker, for joint discussion. Mr. Walker declined on the
                        ground that the proposition came too late, his own arrangements having been
                        made.</p>

<b>The Border Damages</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository.
                    </p>

                    <p>As the tune appointed for the meeting of those claiming damages, in repayment
                        of the losses suffered by them during the war, in this section of
                        Pennsylvania, approaches, perhaps you may think proper to give space in your
                        columns to a communication in reference to the validity of their
                        pretensions.</p>

                    <p>It will not be denied, by those conversant with the foundation and theory of
                        free government, that the protection of the individual in his rights is as
                        justly due to him, from the State, as obedience to the edicts of the
                        law-making power of the State is due from him. When, year by year, the
                        people of the border counties of Pennsylvania were required, by authority of
                        her laws, to pay their proportionate sums of money into the coffers of the
                        State, the hard earned dollars were not withheld from the common treasury.
                        It was right and proper that those taxes should be paid, and the people of
                        the border counties have no right to claim any especial honor or privilege
                        because they paid them. But throughout the dark days of the rebellion, they
                        had a right to expect from the State government protection, as far as the
                        power of the Commonwealth could afford protection to them, in the three
                        rights of law abiding citizens: "the right of personal security, the right
                        of personal liberty, and the right of private property." While the
                        slaveholders' war was raging so near the edge of the old Keystone, the men
                        at the head of affairs at Harrisburg knew that the border counties of the
                        State were, for several years, almost constantly within a few hours ride of
                        the rebel raiders' haunts, and that if no adequate military force were
                        stationed in those counties, to oppose the Southern horseman, a cavalry dash
                        across the line might be daily expected. They were aware also, that commands
                        of loyal troops, in such limited numbers as Pennsylvania could well afford
                        to organize and maintain, might be placed at different points near the
                        Southern boundary of the State, in such a manner as to prevent any rebel
                        foray over her soil. In willful supineness, the high State officials
                        neglected to provide these forces, except when for a brief period a few
                        militia were sent, to stand temporarily, in front of the foe. In consequence
                        of that neglect of duty on the part of the Commonwealth to protect them,
                        many citizens along her Southern line ask her to make good, as far as
                        repayment in money can, the losses which by her failure to defend her
                        territory, she permitted them to suffer at the hands of her enemies. They
                        have a right to claim from her payment for property so lost by them, and to
                        claim such payment not as an elemosynary
                        donation but as a debt due, at least equitably, from her to them. When her
                        tax-gatherer has come to demand of them the allotted per
                            cent, he has not assumed the mien and garb of a mendicant; and
                        when they call upon her, in return, to fulfill, as far as she now can, her
                        undertaking in the implied contract between government and individual, they
                        should not be met as beggars asking alms.</p>

                    <p>It is palpable sophistry to attempt to shift the responsibility of
                        reimbursing the border losses from the Commonwealth, to the United States
                        government. Men may argue that because it was the duty of the central
                        superior government, to protect the citizens of Pennsylvania in life and
                        property, therefore the State was relieved of the care of guarding the
                        rights of her people. Such special pleaders need only be referred to the
                        Constitution of the United States, to be reminded, that to each State was
                        reserved, in that great charter, the right, to "engage in war" when
                        "actually invaded or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay."
                        The inference is clear that the framers of the constitution intended to
                        leave remaining to each State the duty of protecting her inhabitants from
                        invasion, concurrent with the same duty resting upon the general government.
                        How far the United States authorities may have been culpable in leaving open
                        to Southern raiders, the avenues to towns and fields of Pennsylvania, it is
                        not now necessary to inquire. It has been stated in their vindication, that
                        the great struggle between the federal armies and the hosts of treason,
                        absorbing all the military power of the Union, rendered the central
                        government unable to leave more troops along the line of the border States.
                        We are told that because the general government failed to defend the
                        inhabitants of the Southern part of our State, therefore those people should
                        be paid from the vaults of the national treasury, for their property stolen
                        and destroyed. Appeals to men who should know the opinions held in Congress
                        on the subject, have been made, and the applicants have been led to believe
                        that payment of the border losses of our State, by the national government
                        at present, is out of the question. In justification of the refusal of the
                        Washington authorities to pay them, it is said, that if the United States
                        pay each claims to Pennsylvanians, they would be compelled to pay claims of
                        a similar character, amounting to many millions of dollars from other parts
                        of the Union; and that with the present heavy debt bearing upon the national
                        resources, it is impossible for the government
                        to reimburse, at this time at least, all the loyal citizens of the country,
                        for losses of the same nature which they may have suffered. "Necessity knows
                        no law."</p>

                    <p>Investigation of the merits of these or other pleas in vindication of the
                        neglect of the United States Government to repay the border claimants of our
                        State, is not material to the correct determination of the duty of the
                        Commonwealth. Even assuming that the National Government has been guilty of
                        injustice in its conduct toward these people, such fact could not be a
                        reasonable excuse which Pennsylvania might offer to her citizens, for her
                        neglect to fulfill her equitable obligations. Two wrongs never made a right.</p>

                    <p>It will not be gravely argued that our great Commonwealth is not able to pay
                        these claims. The losses of the Counties of Adams, Franklin, Fulton,
                        Bedford, Perry, York, and Cumberland as proved before the Commissioners, in
                        addition to those occasioned by the burning of Chambersburg, amount to
                        $1,693,351.52. Pennsylvania could well afford to pay ten times the sum,
                        rather than place a dark blot upon her escutcheon, emblazoning to the world
                        her injustice to her own people.</p>

                    <p>Were the wealth of the State a thousand fold greater than it is, she never
                        could by paying her gold to the inhabitants of her border districts, who
                        have been visited by the marauder, restore to them the property which was
                        ruthlessly wrested from them. The portrait of the sainted mother, the only
                        remaining picture of her loved face, which was stolen in wanton cruelty by
                        the traitor robber, cannot be reproduced, by money. The parting gift of
                        father, brother, sister or child committed to the living, as the dying one
                        bade farewell; the sad but dearly prized memento, which the flames
                        destroyed, when Chambersburg was burned, may not be brought forth from the
                        State treasury to-day. Fate has decreed there
                        should be losses suffered by the people of the Southern tier of counties
                        along the Keystone line, while they stood between the more Northern portions
                        of the State and the enemy, which are irreparable by human power. But there
                        are many stout hearted, industrious men and women in those border districts,
                        who have been laboring with unrelaxed energy and perseverance, during the
                        last few years, to support with difficulty themselves and those dependent on
                        them, and who have been long weighed down with debt, because Pennsylvania
                        will not repay them, for the property of which rebel soldiers robbed them.
                        There are widows and orphans, in straitened circumstances, who daily feel
                        the harsh injustice of the rich Commonwealth, withholding from them the
                        compensation which she owes to them, for the monetary loss resulting when
                        their homes were destroyed, by the torch sent to strike terror throughout
                        the whole State. May we hope there will be honor and honesty enough in our
                        future legislators, to lead them to pay the people of these counties, the
                        money due them from the State, and which many of those people so much need.
                        JUSTIFICUS.</p>
