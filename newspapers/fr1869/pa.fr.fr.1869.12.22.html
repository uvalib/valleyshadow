<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font> What of the Fifteenth Amendment, p 2, c 1 <p>There are no more
                        elections to be held in the South. Mississippi and Texas have both gone
                        Republican, the former overwhelmingly, the latter decisively, and they
                        complete the list of the States which held elections subject to conditions
                        imposed by Congress. Their Legislatures, as soon as convened, will vote to
                        ratify the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>
                    <p>It is a fit time to inquire what will be the fate of this important measure?
                        Will it become a part of the Constitution, or will it be defeated? Let us
                        see. The Secretary of State has submitted a report to Congress, representing
                        that twenty-one States have retified it through their Legislatures. They are
                        Missouri, Kansas, North Carolina, West Virginia, Massachusetts, Wisconsin,
                        Maine, Louisiana, Michigan, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arkansas,
                        Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, New York, New Hampshire, Nevada,
                        Vermont and Virginia. Two of these, Kansas and Missouri, have ratified
                        imperfectly, the second section of the Amendment being omitted in one case,
                        and its phraseology changed by accident in the other. These will correct the
                        imperfect ratification as soon as they conveniently can, which we may safely
                        assume will be so soon that they will cause no delay in securing the
                        requisite number of States, as they are both strongly Republican.</p>
                    <p>Since the report has been submitted, Alabama has also voted in favor of its
                        ratification, which makes twenty-two States. But it is alleged that New
                        York, since her Legislature is Democratic, will rescind the action of the
                        Legislature of last winter, again reducing the number to twenty-one. Whether
                        this can be done or not makes little difference so far as the result is
                        concerned. It is claimed that Ohio rejected the Amendment by her last
                        Legislature. Her present Legislature has a Republican majority. So if New
                        York has power to rescind her ratification, Ohio has the same power to
                        rescind her rejection, and record herself in favor of ratification, which
                        would still make the number twenty-two. Twenty-eight States are needed to
                        make three-fourths of the whole number--thirty-seven, and three-fourths of
                        the States are required to amend the Constitution. This still leaves six
                        States to be secured in its favor. Let us see if they can be had. We may
                        count on Georgia. This State violated her compact with the General
                        Government after a Republican Legislature had been elected, by expelling the
                        negro members of her Legislature, and retaining those who were disqualified
                        from acting as members by the test oath. The organic Legislature is to be
                        recalled. The expelled negroes will then get their seats, and those who
                        cannot take the test oath will take the places to which they had assigned
                        them, out in the cold. A bill is already before Congress to this effect, and
                        when that is done Georgia will be reconstructed on the basis of the
                        Fourteenth Amendment, she will have a loyal Legislature, and will adopt the
                        Fifteenth Amendment. She will make one of the six.</p>
                    <p>Mississippi and Texas will make two more, leaving still three States to be
                        secured. These must be had out of Rhode Island, Iowa, Minnesota and
                        Nebraska, and judging from their political standing it is safe to say that
                        they will all four ratify as soon as their Legislatures are in session. They
                        will swell the number to twenty nine, one more State than the number
                        required, admitting that the vote of the State of New York will be rescinded
                        as soon as her Legislature convenes in January next, and that her authority
                        to do so will be admitted at Washington, which we do not believe to be
                        probable.</p>
                    <p>As the matter stands then it is possible, nay extremely probable, that the
                        first month of the new year will witness the consummation of the great work,
                        without doubt the greatest work and the greatest boon which the century has
                        witnessed. The President is heart and soul in favor of its speedy
                        completion. A Republican Congress earnestly assists and encourages the
                        President. The four States last named are anxious to do their part toward
                        it, and Georgia, Mississippi and Texas could not prevent it if they would.
                        Such being the case, we may look for a proclamation declaring the supreme
                        law of the land amended by the addition of the Fifteenth Amendment within a
                        month, or two months at furthest.</p>
                    <p>If we are correct in what we have said, at the next State elections the
                        negroes will exercise the right of suffrage, as they did, in Pennsylvania
                        many years ago. In all of the Southern States which joined in the rebellion
                        they already do so, but so long as they were denied this right in the North
                        it was natural, though not wise, for the Democracy to contend against
                        conferring it upon them. If they had been wise, like some of their brethren
                        in the South, when they saw that universal suffrage was sure to come they
                        would have favored it, and by that means secured at least a share of the
                        colored voters. They did not abate a jot of their hostility, however, to the
                        measure, and have made themselves such a record that they can never hope to
                        win them to their side, for whenever the negroes are left free to vote as
                        they wish, which must always be the case in the North, they are not likely
                        to forget to which party they are indebted for the power to exercise the
                        rights of freemen, which were so long iniquitously withheld from them.</p>

                    <p>To the Editors of the Franklin Repository.</p>

                    <p>Although we have attained in this land to a political equality, or nearly so,
                        still there is almost as much social distinction in this country as in the
                        old world. Now so long as ignorance and vice exist, and prejudice of race
                        and color, can it be otherwise.</p>

                    <p>Though the progress of the arts, increase of wealth, education and
                        refinement, and spread of the Bible have raised a majority of the masses to
                        an equality to, if not a superiority over, the ruling class of olden times,
                        still in the nature of man and the organization of society, social
                        distinctions must always exist.</p>

                    <p>No doubt, however, in the "Good Times Coming" both
                        civil and social rank and station will be the reward of mental and moral
                        worth, not as too frequently now, the reward of cunning and duplicity.</p>

                    <p>One of the greatest and most preposterous evils connected with American
                        society, is the distinction conferred upon the mere possession of wealth.
                        Riches should confer no rank or station upon the possessor, except from
                        their benevolent, wise and judicious use in the advancement of general
                        interests, art, science and religion. Far better for us to enthrone mind,
                        genius, learning, statesmanship or military success; or even to have the
                        hereditary aristocracy, than an empire of money.</p>

                    <p>But letting all this pass; granting it right and proper for the shoe
                        merchant's wife to snub the cobbler's daughter, allowing an impropriety in
                        the family of the wholesale dealer and compounder of liquors associating
                        with the wife and children of the retailer of drinks, granting, I say the
                        lowest and meanest of earth's petty distinctions--the distinctions conferred
                        by riches--yet there is one place where all men should meet on an equal
                            footing--The Church of God. Assembled at the
                        shrine of the Most High, each soul humbly bowed before its Maker, and
                        putting up the petition "Lord have mercy upon us poor, miserable sinners,"
                        how can on thought of earthly pre-eminence or station obtrude. In the
                        observance of these petty, earthly distinctions at the temple of Divinity,
                        we make our prayers but a solemn mockery.</p>

                    <p>And yet throughout this land, this our beautiful heritage, (I say with
                        sorrow,) there is no place, not even the theatre, the ball-room or the
                        opera, where there is so much ostentation of dress and of fashion, and
                        display of arrogance and wealth, as in our Protestant churches. They are
                        become temples not for the worship of the Creator, but of the creature, and
                        to display bodily beauty and its splendid trappings in the pews; beauty of
                        voice in the galleries and beauty of voice and language in the pulpit.
                        Strong and sturdy oaks will grow and derive nourishment from the most
                        sterile and rocky soil. So, too, perhaps, the truly pious may draw spiritual
                        food from the meagre sermon, the unhallowed
                        garniture and accessories of fashionable churches. Fashionable churches, the very words, common though they are,
                        are a disgrace to our christianity. What
                        shall we have next? A fashionable ministry and a fashinable Bible?</p>

                    <p>But to the person of a merely religious nature, if I may be allowed the
                        expression, what an idle mockery does it seem to join a congregation
                        assembled seemingly for the purpose of displaying their dress and person. If
                        not a pewholder, you are treated, not as a guest, but as an intruder, put in
                        a back seat, without cushions or hymn book, in a church decorated with all
                        the gaudy frivolities of an opera house, to listen to a beautiful moral
                        essay. Even if you have the unusual good fortune to have your religious
                        nature roused up to action by a powerful gospel
                        minister, how those very religious emotions are shocked, grated and as it
                        were warped by the frivolous and worldly conversation of your fellow
                        church-goers crowding the pavement on their way home.</p>

                    <p>What plain laboring man could enjoy a levee at a Fifth Avenue palace? Could
                        all the delicacies under which the tables groan, make him at home? How many
                        are there of our town and our city churches in which a working man will be
                        any more at ease, be treated with any more consideration? It is not enough
                        that the pulpit furnishes a spiritual feast, the man must feel at home in
                        order to get the benefit of it.</p>

                    <p>Our Saviour makes his Gospel a feast to which all, even the poorest and
                        lowliest, are bidden. His professed followers at the present time, make His
                        worship an exclusive banquet, where the elite only are invited.</p>

                    <p>Think you, that if the Apostles walked down our pavement next Sabbath
                        morning, they would take for granted that the crowds of fashionably dressed
                        people moving churchward were the followers of "the meek and lowly Jesus,"
                        "He that was despised and rejected of men?"--what think you would be the
                        reception of the bluff Peter, the fishermen John and Mark, and the publican
                        Matthew, should they join the crowd, and enter one of the churches?--think
                        you they would be any more cordially treated by the fashionable clergymen of
                            to-day, than by the Pharisees and Saducees of
                        old?</p>

                    <p>No one has visited the churches of the old world, but has been struck by the
                        absence of ostentation and display, so revolting in the new. Even fashion
                        there, for once, puts on the semblance of decency, and enjoins plain colors,
                        and an unobtrusive style of dress, in the House of God.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the sternness of our forefathers, especially those of New England,
                        and also those of Scotch and Scotch-Irish extraction, in prohibiting all
                        places of amusement where the young and those fond of dress could wear their
                        holiday garments, has had much to do with transforming the interior of our
                        churches into advertisements of the principal clothing and millinery
                        establishments.</p>

                    <p>I am no apologist for Catholicism. Its images and madonnas, the swinging
                        incense, the rich vestments, the late prayers have no charms for me, but I
                        often stroll in an kneel among the throng; for there is to me a fascination
                        in thus kneeling down among the people; the rich, the poor, the beautiful,
                        the ugly, the refined, the filthy, the saint and the sinner, all on one
                        common level and putting up one common prayer to the Infinite, the Great
                        Unknown. No hired slips, no boughten pews, no distinction, or pride of place
                        to break the calm religious witchery of the hour. In this democratic use of
                        her church lies Rome's chiefest power, her mightiest hold upon the hearts of
                        her votaries.</p>

                    <p>Again the Catholic church is much more thorough in the training of her
                        clergy--they are more thoroughly trained, at least, in the wisdom of this
                        world, and are especially versed in human nature before becoming more than
                        mere novices in the priesthood. They must be true men of ripe experience,
                        and are carefully selected for their different spheres of action.</p>

                    <p>In every requisite of a successful ministry, except it be the crowning
                        requisite--Piety--they are far in advance of the Protestant clergy.--Why is
                        it that in a majority of our leading churches the hearer must have a young
                        "theologue" fresh from the seminary inflicted upon him?--or worse still,
                        when darkness and temptation beset you, and the depths roll over you, and
                        you seek your pastor, you find him utterly ignorant of the human soul, its
                        heights, or its depths, or the temptation and sin that do beset it--a novice
                        entirely unfitted either to do good or administer consolation to the man
                        who, buffetted and beat about by the world, bears the brand of remorse, and
                        scar of many sins on his soul?</p>

                    <p>Could not these unfledged striplings be better employed as aids to and under
                        aged, pious and experienced ministers, or be sent out to fight their way, as
                        most young men of other professions are compelled to do, learning human
                        nature as colpotures or as missionaries under the supervision of able and
                        tried men? In the other professions, in the law, medicine or the
                        counting-room, we seek for tried men. I allow that in this country young men
                        are pushed forward very rapidly in every department, but we do not make
                        judges of lawyers just admitted to the bar, the physician does not attain
                        eminence without long years spent in the hospital or in treating all classes
                        of people and diseases. The professor must first be a tutor, and the
                        political aspirant must at least have the qualifications of mature age
                        before he holds high office. Why is it then that only some youthful prodigy
                        is capable of saving souls at this time and age?</p>

                    <p>In every community there is a class of men, not large, perhaps, but of large
                        influence, laborious students of the Bible and earnest thinkers, but not
                        professedly pious, perhaps drifting about unsatisfied with themselves and
                        the world, and harrassed by many doubts. To such men mere pomp of diction
                        and display of words so common in many of our pulpits, excites only disgust,
                        and unless more substantial nourishment is provided, they forsake the
                        church.</p>

                    <p>I can only account for the fact that some youthful prodigy, as I said before,
                        is the one called of God to point the way to
                        heaven, is on the ground that the majority or our congregation are composed
                        of the frivilous and vain, who desire neither food for the mind or
                        nourishment for the soul, but only something to tickle the ear during the
                        intervals of the music.</p>

                    <p>Well, I have had my growl. Perhaps I had done better to have held my peace
                        and examined my own shortcomings and misdeeds instead. Still I have at least
                        relieved my mind and had my say, and the church will be none the worse for
                        knowing how she appears to an outsider.<br> WEB WOODMAN.</p>
