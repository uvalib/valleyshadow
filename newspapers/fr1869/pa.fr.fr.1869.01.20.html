<b>Border Damages Again</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor makes another plea to the state legislature to pay border damage
                    compensation to Franklin county as a just and necessary measure. Franklin county
                    farmers lost their produce and livestock many times to friend and foe while
                    keeping their dedication to the Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>If any apology were necessary for introducing this subject into our columns
                        again, an ample one would be found in the distressing financial condition of
                        many of the citizens of Franklin county, and especially of Chambersburg.
                        Though it is neither fashionable nor popular, as the world goes, to champion
                        the unfortunate, it is right, which is far better, especially if the
                        responsibility for these misfortunes rests somewhere else than on
                        themselves.</p>

                    <p>If the pecuniary suffering which pervades this community does not make public
                        journals, which have a knowledge of the facts, cry aloud and spare not, we
                        are not able to say what will. When the war closed the farmers of the border
                        counties had suffered heavily both from the raids of the enemy and our own
                        troops. No sooner had the rebels passed over their flourishing fields,
                        destroying their crops, burning their fences, and carrying off their horses,
                        cattle and hogs, than a spasm of watchfulness sent an army of State troops
                        among them, who being "emergency men" found their first great emergency in a
                        lack of supplies, and were compelled to take and use what little the poor
                        farmers had been able to conceal from the rebel jayhawkers. Before the
                        Commissary Department could be put into operation the immediate necessity
                        for troops was gone, and they were withdrawn, leaving lean larders behind.
                        This alternation of foes and friends was repeated several times, until the
                        agricultural community were in despair, and might well have been pardoned if
                        they had cried out, spare us from our friends, at least, if we must be
                        ravaged by our foes.</p>

                    <p>The frequent raids, and the constant apprehension of them made sudden flights
                        often necessary. Stock was run off, or captured, farms were neglected just
                        when crops were ripening, or when the seed should have been sown, entailing
                        heavy and serious losses in addition to those mentioned above.</p>

                    <p>We know that all these misfortunes, this neglect and mismanagement, on the
                        part of the State, resulting in destruction of houses, loss of property and
                        often extreme poverty, were borne with calmness and without complaint. The
                        taxes imposed by the Government to carry on the war were never remitted, but
                        were cheerfully paid. Quotas of troops were filled up with our young and
                        available men, and sent to the front while our own border was left
                        unprotected. When the crowning misfortune of the war, to us, came, which
                        destroyed two millions of property in a day and left half the population of
                        Chambersburg bankrupt, and the other half badly crippled there were but half
                        a company of Infantry and two pieces of artillery to defend against a whole
                        division of cavalry. Of course they could do nothing more than save
                        themselves.</p>

                    <p>Since the close of the war, which reduced the swollen streams of trade and
                        traffic to their original narrow channels, our people have been staggering
                        under the gigantic burden of their losses, hoping that better times would
                        soon dawn and relief would be found. These times have never come. An
                        unsettled financial policy, lack of confidence in the currency of the
                        Government, and a general falling off in the price of produce only made
                        their burdens heavier. Many, unable to meet their debts, have seen their
                        property sacrificed, and themselves cast pennyless on the world. Many others will soon be forced to see the
                        same thing unless relief from some quarter come soon.</p>

                    <p>There is but one quarter whence this relief can and should come. The
                        Commonwealth owes restitution to her suffering citizens to the extent of the
                        last dollar of loss, if she owes a farthing.--That she failed to protect and
                        defend her border citizens, during the war, whom she was bound, in the
                        nature of things to protect and defend, no one will undertake to deny. That
                        the sacrifice the border sustained in 1863 and 1864 was the salvation of the
                        interior of the State is equally undeniable. It is by no means just--we ask
                        not generosity but justice--that those who escaped loss and danger, now that
                        the danger is past, should refuse to make compensation. It is plain that the
                        whole State should suffer this loss, and not the border counties
                        alone.--They have not been released from the taxes and duties which the
                        Commonwealth exacts of her citizens, nor do they ask to be. But they do ask
                        that while they fulfill their duties, their rights, which are reciprocal,
                        shall not be ignored.</p>

                    <p>Now that the extent of the losses have been ascertained, let an appropriation
                        be made, and let the sufferers be taxed along with the rest of the State to
                        pay them.--The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is an empire in herself. Her
                        resources are developing, her wealth and strength growing, in a way that is
                        almost magical. Her population is four millions, and she is paying yearly
                        more than two millions of the State debt. In a few years she will be
                        entirely free of debt. Can such a State afford to be mean and niggardly? Can
                        she afford to come short of absolute justice to her loyal subjects? Surely
                        not, when it will not burden a single individual to make her suffering
                        citizens whole.</p>

                    <p>Our legislatures are not so economical that they cannot be just, if we read
                        aright their proceedings at Harrisburg.--Why, they squander on pasting and
                        folding, on Purdon's Digests and such other lumber, alone, what would in a
                        few years pay our losses. Let them stop these leaks, and turn their
                        attention to their legitimate duties, the wants of the people.</p>

                    <p>We do not believe there is a member whose constituents are unwilling to have
                        him do justice to the border counties, though we have heard that there are
                        such. If it be true, we remind him that he legislates for the whole State
                        and not for his immediate district, and he will find the whole State
                        approves his action whenever it is just, upright and honest.</p>
