				<transcript> Our County Poor House, p 2, c 1-2 <p>The expense of maintaining this
						institution is, undeniably, becoming a great charge to our taxpayers--much
						heavier indeed than they generally think. The cost has been gradually
						increasing year after year, while the number of paupers maintained has not
						increased in proportion. During the times of high prices caused by the war,
						there was a reason for this increase of cost; but now that the prices of
						everything entering into the support of the inmates of this institution have
						so greatly fallen, there ought to be a corresponding reduction of expenses,
						unless indeed there is some waste or mismanagement somewhere. That there is
						some such mismanagement we are forced to believe, and we are therefore
						impelled to call the attention of our people to it. The majority of the
						Directors are now, and have been since the first of last January, <emph
							rend="italic">Democratic</emph>, and therefore upon that party rests the
						responsibility of showing why these things are so.</p>
					<p>For the purpose of showing the cost of the maintenance of this institution in
						past years, we have prepared the following tables, showing the amount
						expended each year since 1854--the number of paupers in the institution on
						the first of January of each year--the average number maintained during the
						year--and the cost of keeping each pauper during each year. The value of the
						articles produced on the farm in 1868, was, in round numbers, about
						$3,000--taking them at their cash value in that year. They were all
						consumed, and their value must of course be added to the money expended in
						order to get at the cost of keeping up the institution.</p>
					<p>Prior to 1862, when prices were low, we estimate the produce of the farm at
						only <emph rend="italic">half</emph> this sum each year, viz: $1,500, and
						have added that amount annually to the money expended. This we think is not
						unreasonable, and the following is the result:</p>

					<p>These tables are made up from the published annual statements of the
						Directors of the Poor, and they show that the expenses of our Poor House are
						now <emph rend="italic">three times</emph> as much each year, as they were
						twelve years ago; and that whilst in 1856 it cost $50.00 to keep a pauper
						one year, it now costs over $150.00 to do the same thing. The greatest
						increase of cost was during the years 1864-5--the years of the war--and
						perhaps a like expenditure could not have been avoided during the high
						prices which prevailed in 1866-7-8. In the latter year the expenses of the
						institution were reduced about $2,000, under the management of that "good
						and faithful Steward" David Piper, to correspond with the fall of prices
						generally; but if under the present <emph rend="italic">Democratic</emph>
						management they go on increasing as they have since February last, when the
						Democracy got control of the Board, they will exceed $21,000 by the 1st of
						January, 1870.</p>

					<p>Beside this they have received some six hundred dollars, or more, from other

					<p>Now, tax payers of Franklin county, what do you think of this sample of <emph
							rend="italic">Democratic economy>?</emph> How do you like the way your
						Democratic Directors are making your money fly? In eight months time they
						have already drawn from the county treasury, and from other sources, more
						money than was expended by their Republican predecessors during the whole of
						the preceeding year; and at the same rate of expenditure for the unexpired
						three months of the year, including the proceeds of the poor house farm, the
						total cost of the institution will not be less than $21,000 or $22,000.
						Think of it fellow citizens! and if you desire to bring the expenses of this
						necessary and useful institution back to what they should be, and secure a
						certain future reduction in <orig reg="everything">every thing</orig> about
						it, go to the polls on Tuesday of next month and cast your votes for that
							<emph rend="italic">practical</emph> farmer, JOHN FREY, of Green
						township. If you elect him to a seat in your Board of Poor Directors you may
						rest assured there will be no waste or mismanagement of your funds during
						his term of office.</p>
					<p>We believe that the Poor House <emph rend="italic">farm</emph> has been a
						decided failure financially. The land is very broken, and hard to farm. Many
						years it has not produced the interest of <emph rend="italic">three</emph>
						<orig reg="percent">per cent</orig>, upon its cost; and year after year
						produce of every kind, both for the support of man and beast has been
						purchased at a heavy expense. At the present time, we are informed, that two
						farm hands are employed to work the land, in addition to the labor of the
						paupers, at a cost of $20.00 per month each, and their boarding. This we
						think is a useless and unnecessary expenditure, and one that the Directors
						are not justified in making. Certainly one such hand should, with the
						assistance of the able bodied paupers in the institution, be able to do all
						the work on the farm and thus save the $300 per year expended upon the other
						hand.</p>
					<p>The best interests of the county would, in our opinion, be subserved by
						selling all of the land attached to the Poor House, except about forty or
						fifty acres just around the buildings. There are, we are told, some 210 or
						220 acres in the tract. One hundred and seventy or eighty of these might be
						sold, at about $100 per acre, which would put some $17,000 or $18,000 into
						the County Treasury--and the balance 40 or 50 acres would be amply
						sufficient for all the wants of the institution, and could be worked by the
						labor of the paupers--thus saving much expense to the county. Besides, if
						this land were sold there would be no necessity to keep more than two
						horses, and all the balance of the live stock and farming implements not
						needed could be also disposed of--and there too a large <emph rend="italic"
							>leak hole</emph> would be stopped.</p>
					<p>We shall notice other matters connected with the management of our Poor
						House, in our next issue. In conclusion we would say that we have been
						informed, by authority we believe to be reliable, that the Poor House wagon
						has recently been seen delivering <emph rend="italic">hay after
						night</emph>, to at least two of our citizens of <emph rend="italic"
							>Democratic</emph> proclivities--and we would like to know why the
						Directors or their Steward are now selling hay when they must know that
						before next hay harvest they will be compelled, as in former years, to go
						into the market and purchase the same article. Let the people have a reason
						for this course of conduct, Messrs. Directors, if the fact be as stated to
						us.</p>

				<transcript>

					<p>The Democracy of still another State turn their backs on the fossils of
						Pennsylvania. Wisconsin, that portion of her population which is Democratic,
						has actually arrayed itself squarely against the Democracy of this State in
						the only vital position laid down in their platform, that of the Fifteenth
						Amendment and negro suffrage. A few weeks ago we mentioned the fact that our
						Democracy still cling desperately to the grinning skeleton of the defunct
						"nigger," while everywhere else, the fact of the existence of the negro in
						politics was rapidly finding recognition in the same party. Since then the
						action of the Wisconsin Democracy has given additional force to what we then
						published. In State Convention on Wednesday last, the following resolution,
						among others, was adopted.</p>

					<p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>. That the Democratic party of Wisconsin
						rejoice in the extinction of slavery, in the prompt and general acquiescence
						of the Southern people in the results of the war, in every well-directed
						effort for the enlightenment and elevation of oppressed humanity at home and
						abroad, and in every measure compatible with good government and public
						order to broaden the basis of suffrage, and extend the blessing of free
						institutions to all classes of people.</p>

					<p>This, of course, is a flat-footed endorsement of the Fifteenth Amendment, and
						negro suffrage, and puts a "right smart" distance between Wisconsin
						Democrats and Pennsylvania Democrats. The same liberal policy promises to be
						adopted by the Democracy of the other North-Western States. Massachusetts
						took the lead, some weeks ago, and nominated J. Quincy Adams for Governor,
						on a similar platform. In the South the recent conservative or Democratic
						successes were obtained by means of negro votes which were secured through
						the pledges of the Democracy that their right of suffrage should be
						maintained inviolate.</p>

					<p>It is easily perceived that this wonderful progress of the Democracy is no
						mere local spasm, but extends from the extreme South to the extreme North,
						and it becomes a question whether or not the Democracy of those few States,
						which still cling to the nigger, are in the party.</p>

					<p>For example the Democratic State Convention of Pennsylvania emphatically
						denied the right of Congress to submit the Fifteenth Amendment to the
						Legislatures of the States, denied the right of Congress to amend the
						Constitution in the manner provided by the Constitution, and declared "that
						the Democratic party of Pennsylvania is opposed to conferring upon the negro
						the right to vote." This is just what the Democracy of the other States, to
						which we have referred, not only admit Congress has a right to do, but
						recommend that the basis of suffrage be broadened, and that the blessings of
						free institutions be extended to all classes of the people. For advocating
						just these measures the Democratic journals of this State, and the <emph
							rend="italic">Spirit</emph> in our midst, never cease to denounce and
						condemn the Republican party in heated and bitter terms, and make them the
						ground of their appeals to the people for a restoration of the Democratic
						party to power. Even in politics such ridiculous inconsistency, to say
						nothing of the bald and manifest duplicity, is astounding, and we are glad
						to say rarely encountered. The readers of the <emph rend="italic"
						>Spirit</emph> and the Harrisburg <emph rend="italic">Patriot</emph>, the
						two Democratic papers most generally read in this county, will bear us out
						in the declaration that not a single issue of these papers is published
						which does not charge as the chief crime of the Republican party its
						advocacy of the rights of the negroes to citizenship and suffrage. At the
						same time their readers must admit that these papers would be searched in
						vain for a single word concerning the Democracy of the other States for
						advocating the same thing. Now if it be so awfully wicked in the one party,
						which we deny, ought it not be a little wicked in the other at least? If it
						be wholly wrong for Republicans, can it be wholly right for Democrats?</p>

					<p>This issue is a test of the sincerity of the Democracy of Pennsylvania. If
						they were sincere in their hostility to it they would fight it wherever
						found. But they do not. They are afraid to say aught against the Democratic
						party, and hope, by excluding from their journals the action of the
						Democracy of the other States, that their readers will remain ignorant, and
						accept their word for truth, that they oppose the Republican party because

					<p>Notwithstanding the moral inertia of the so-called Democracy, once in a while
						a faint glimmering of light breaks through the deep gloom in which it has
						enshrouded itself, and which it has been its boast to regard as impervious
						to all moral ideas. With what sneers have its organs, time and again, as
						though it were a stigma, denominated the Republican party "the party of
						great moral ideas." Who has not witnessed the deep solicitude which
						Democrats seemed to feel lest politics and religion should be mixed? But at
						length, no doubt from the reflex influence of the "party of moral ideas,"
						the Democray have been aroused from their sleep in regard to the interests
						of morality and religion, and they behold our whole social and religious
						fabric in danger from the proposed enfranchisement of all races. At once how
						dear to the hearts of our Democratic brethren are the interests of religion.
						Must the white population, their <emph rend="italic">religion</emph>, their
						civilization, be swamped in the flood of the heathen idol-worshippers, who,
						with the ballot, can take possession of the State? What a hopeful party this
						Democratic organization must be! They must have their social status
						protected against the advances of the negro, so as to guard them against
						negro equality, and now they are alarmed for the fate of <emph rend="italic"
							>their religion</emph>, in case the Chinaman should be invested with the
						right of suffrage. Be careful, Democrats, that the interests of religion be
						not damaged by thus lugging this great "moral question" into politics. Or
						perhaps you only intend to incite a little religious enthusiasm in the minds
						of some of the pious. Democrats, so as to secure their prompt action in the
						present campaign against that party that would mix religion with politics.</p>

					<p>Religion was first established in the heart of a pagan country, governed by
						pagan idolitry. Under the benign influence of the injunction of their
						Master, the ministers of the new religion defied the power and cruelty of a
						pagan dynasty, while proclaiming the doctrine "As ye would that men should
						do to you, do ye even so to them."</p>

					<p>At least, Democracy is not wholly lost to all sense of moral ideas, which
						their past course would seem to imply. Religion herself, i. e., in the
						abstract, should be guarded by political power. But for this high privilege
						at the hands of the Democracy, she must enter into bonds to keep the peace
						toward all Democratic allies, such as slavery, bad whiskey and sescession.
						Democracy says to religion, as long as you permit us to carry out all our
						corrupt political schemes, unrebuked, we will see to it that idolatrous
						Chinamen do not "swamp" you; but interpose any of your "moral ideas" between
						us and our purposes, and we denounce you at once as an innovator.</p>
