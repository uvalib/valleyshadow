                    <p>For the Franklin Repository.</p>

                    <p>WHAT WOMAN HAS BEEN IN THE PAST - THE PRESENT - THE UNCERTAINTY OF HER
                        POSITION - HER WRONGS - THE REMEDY.</p>

                    <p>Nearly four thousand years ago, a mighty swelling song of praise went up from
                        the banks of the Red Sea, the voice of a great host, just delivered alike
                        from the hungry waters and the hungrier Egyptians. Sweetest in that song of
                        praise were the notes of the dark-eyed and low-browed Hebrew women; and
                        loudest and clearest was the voice of Miriam, the prophetess, leader, alike
                        with Moses and Aaron, of that mighty host, God's chosen people, she of whom
                        the prophet Micah says, when speaking of God's merciful kindness to the
                        Israelites, "I sent before them Moses, Aaron and Miriam."</p>

                    <p>More than three thousand years ago Deborah was a ruler on the purple hills
                        and under the sunny skies of Palestine, and to her, sitting under the shade
                        of the stately palm, the Israelites came up for judgment. Again she is with
                        Barah leading on ten thousand mighty men of valor to conquest and to
                        victory: and yet again, in connection with him, in the presence of all
                        Israel, singing a magnificent song of praise to the most High God.</p>

                    <p>A little later and we see a formidable Queen, with a vast retinue of servants
                        and officers, and camels and horses ladened with spices, gold and precious
                        stones, on her way to visit the Hebrew court, there to take council with
                        earth's "wisest man."</p>

                    <p>In the New Testament we read of Candia, Queen of Ethiopia, and of the
                        prophets Anna, "which departed not from the temple, but served God with
                        fastings and prayers night and day."</p>

                    <p>In later times a woman led the armies of France to victory. And no better
                        ruler has ever sat upon the throne of Great Britian than sits there to-day in the
                        person of a woman and a mother.</p>

                    <p>In the history of our own country, woman's heroism and woman's intellect has
                        often been an anchor in its darkest and most perilous trials.</p>

                    <p>To day the civilized world rings with the praises of
                        Ida Lewis, as it did a few years since with the praises of Grace Darling,
                        for acts of heroism performed in what is called the peculiar province of
                        man.</p>

                    <p>Woman has taken command of the vessel at times of peril on the sea, and
                        steered it safely to port. She has planted, sowed and plowed, builded,
                        planned and invented, and has poured words of eloquence from the pulpit and
                        the forum.</p>

                    <p>History, sacred and profane, tells us that from the earliest times, and under
                        the most disadvantageous circumstances, there have been women who have held
                        places of political and religious power and trust, with credit to
                        themselves, their sex and their country.</p>

                    <p>Why is it then that in a government that gives to man the largest freedom and
                        greatest privileges of any government under Heaven, woman is totally
                        ignored? Why all this hue and cry from freemen, when any attempt is made to
                        give her an equality of political or business privileges?</p>

                    <p>If she violates a law she must suffer the penalty, but she must not take any
                        part in making that law. If she owns property she must pay taxes, but she
                        must not say how those taxes are to be applied, or by what men or party to
                        be reaped. In a land we are proud to call "a home for the oppressed," she
                        must do more work for less wages than a man, and even though God give her a
                        tongue as eloquent as that of Webster, or as persuasive as that of Clay,
                        "she must keep silence."</p>

                    <p>As regards woman's suffrage, I am aware that many of its advocates are
                        neither beautiful, pretty or of bewitching modesty. Faces too unlovely to be
                        bribed by a kiss, you are sure to find among its ranks. I am aware that
                        among its advocates are those whom we can neither love or reverence, persons
                        who gather into the ranks merely to hear or to teach some new thing.</p>

                    <p>But is it not so with every cause, especially with every new cause? Was it
                        not so with the slave cause, than which no purer cause ever had no
                        existence? Is it not so with many of the loudest declaimers in the cause of
                        professed christianity?</p>

                    <p>But, says Mr. Heavybrain, the ladies do not care to vote, most of them in
                        fact would not use the right of suffrage were it extended to them.</p>

                    <p>I am aware (and am thankful that it is so) that there is a class of women
                        among us that are so happy in their husbands, their homes and their children
                        - women so reverenced by their families, so surrounded by every comfort and
                        luxury of domestic life, that nothing but the severest sense of duty could
                        drive them to the ballot-box. These women are
                        the idols of our homes to-day; where they may be to-morrow
                        God alone knows - and thus is it that it is a
                        duty they owe to themselves, to claim and exercise the right of suffrage,
                        for, though rich to-day they may be poor to-morrow, though strong arms and living hearts
                        protect them to-day, they may be brotherless,
                        fatherless, widowed, indeed, to-morrow.</p>

                    <p>It is a duty owed to that sister who, mad with hunger, disappointment,
                        taunts, jeers and curses, is rushing frantically to the terrible refuge of
                        the "maison de joie," a sister to whom the words
                        "woman has a vote" would give hope to enable her to slave, starve, or beg
                        yet a little longer, and strength to flee with swiftly flying steps that
                        treacherous door. It is a duty owed to that frail sister who is even now
                        looking down into the black waters of the East river, preparatory to a final
                        plunge, that she trusts may bury alike her shame and remorse.</p>

                    <p>It is a duty we owe, petted, worshipped Queens of the drawing room, to
                        thousands of your less fortunate sisters. Sisters who are to-night wading the slums, threading the alleys,
                        gasping in the tenement house, blanching in the cellars, starving in the
                        attics, dying by inches in the slop-shops, of our great cities. Sisters to
                        whom cruel words and more cruel blows, fierce curses and fiercer kicks,
                        shame, fear and abuse are every day's portion. Sisters
                            to whom the proclamation of woman's suffrage would be the loosening of
                            bonds.</p>

                    <p>For do what we please, say what we may, beat about the bush as much as we
                        like, woman poor and unattractive must ever be overworked, underpaid and
                        denied of her just rights; while beautiful and unprotected she is subject to
                        treatment still more base, until she has the right to protect herself by the
                        ballot-box, and she thus becomes political power in the land.</p>

                    <p>Thousands of schemes there are, and have been for ameliorating the condition
                        of the poor women of our cities. But nothing can prove effectual without the
                        ballot box. Give them that, and they will right
                            themselves. But says Mr. Softhead, really, ah, the polls, ah, are
                        not fir, ah, for a lady, ah. You know, ah, filthy, ah, profane swearing,
                        drunkenness, ah, vulgarity, ah, and ah, men with their coats off. I grant it
                        all, even to the coats off, but is it not so with every place from which
                        woman is excluded? Is it not so with court
                        rooms, offices and stores where only men do gather. Yes, even more, take women from our churches, and in a few years
                        they would be unfit for her to enter.</p>

                    <p>Still another gentleman gets off some beautiful thoughts concerning "woman's
                        influence, her mission being at the hearthstone, the holiness of motherhood,
                        the mother doing a higher, nobler work, a work more pregnant with
                        consequences than that of greatest statesmen; the power the name of mother
                        has over the most profligate," &amp;c. While I do wish to gainsay all
                        this, it must be allowed that the majority of those men so anxious to do
                        woman poetical, are found sadly wanting in practical justice, and are
                        frequently those who do least credit to a mother's influence, and are most
                        seldom found within the influences of the mission they are so willing to
                        give to woman - the hearthstone.</p>

                    <p>Now I will grant that my ideal woman is not one that plows, sows, lectures,
                        preaches, or owns property and does business in her own name and person. My
                        ideal woman, and the ideal woman of every true masculine nature, is that of
                        a clinging, dependent creature, whose best safeguard is her very
                        helplessness and dependence upon man; her chiefest
                        attraction her purity and freedom from every
                        thing masculine. The oft repeated simile of the strong oak and the
                        clinging vine, best expresses our ideal man and woman. But why, when we
                        never call for our ideal man, should we always demand the ideal woman.</p>

                    <p>When man, instead of her protector is so often her tempter; when in place of
                        caresses he so often gives her blows; instead of giving her a support he is
                        so often a parasite, living upon her wages. In fine, is so often not the
                        loving brother, kind father and devoted husband, but the brutal master; not
                        the rugged oak, but only the rotten shell or broken reed; is is strange that
                        woman should strive to support and protect herself? The clinging vine is
                        beautiful, but when the oak is rotten or wanting, is it not best to prune
                        and train the vine to support itself?</p>

                    <p>When there are so many men whose chief aim in life is to cut and sew cloth,
                        make confectionery, or sell silks, ribbons and laces, is it strange that we
                        should have women who have a greater vocation for agriculture, business or
                        the pulpit than for wifehood or motherhood? And if we gratify the
                        white-handed "male woman" of the fancy store with his instincts, why deny
                        our more masculine sisters theirs?</p>

                    <p>Again, while man remains the selfish creature that harbors and treads in our
                        large cities, thousands of our women can never have the opportunity of
                        becoming wives or mothers. There are at a low calculation fifty thousand men
                        in the city of New York who do not intend or wish to get married. This one
                        city then cuts off fifty thousand women from the mission of the hearthstone.
                        And from this number, on an average, a trifle over one fresh victim is every
                        day in the year sacrificed to the brutal passions of these men, aside from a
                        large number who are daily forced by starvation prices to hover on the
                        borders of this vast army of fallen women. The numbers of these victims
                        would be greatly decreased, were the various avocations of business and
                        other pursuits open to them at a fair rate of compensation. This host of
                        unprotected starving, helpless and fallen women is every year increasing and
                        swelling to an alarming extent. Something must be done to relieve the army
                        of sin and destitution. I can see no hope except in equal rights and the
                            ballot-box Woman must hereafter work side by side with
                        man in the several pursuits of agriculture, commerce, trades and
                        manufactures, and in order to obtain a fair compensation and be protected in
                        her rights, she must be a political power. Although, as I have already
                        shown, there have been in every age women capable of holding the reins of
                        government, it is not possible that women will ever hold office in this
                        country. And if any woman ever holds office in this country, she will be
                        placed there by the votes of men, for the most of women prefer most
                        decidedly to be ruled by the opposite sex, and no woman, however must loved
                        and respected by them, could command their votes.</p>

                    <p>It is argued that the degraded women of our cities will avail themselves of
                        the ballot in case suffrage is granted to woman. I can see no force in this
                        argument, so long as we give to their partners in ignorance and crime of the
                        opposite sex that privilege, and so long as these women are but a "drop in
                        the bucket" in comparison to large numbers of virtuous and intelligent
                        voters that we would gain.</p>

                    <p>If every man was, as he should be, the chivalrous protector of woman, then we
                        might cast woman's rights and woman's suffrage to the dogs, and we should be
                        the last to advocate them. But we cannot hope for the ideal man or woman
                        before millennium, until then give them an equality of business and
                        political privileges, the right to protect themselves. WEB WOODMAN</p>

                        composed of good men. An event of so much importance requires a more
                        extended notice. The Convention met in Tuesday, the 3d inst., and its
                        proceedings were marked with deliberation, and the utmost harmony. Its
                        selections were received by the party with decided signs of approval. We do
                        not mean to imply, however, that the choice of the Convention satisfied
                        everybody. On the contrary, there being three our four applicants for each
                        of the important offices to be filled, the personal friends of each of the
                        defeated candidates naturally felt a greater or lesser degree of
                        disappointment, as well as did the candidates themselves. This was only
                        momentary, however, and already the ticket meets the approval of the whole
                        party. We predict for it a triumphant election.</p>

                    <p>William C. M'Knight, Esq., our candidate for Assembly, is well and favorably
                        known throughout the county, as a gentleman of intelligence, unbending
                        integrity, and positive Republicanism. He has been a resident of Franklin
                        county during the last twelve or fourteen years, and previous to that time
                        resided in Indiana county, which he represented in the Legislature, to the
                        satisfaction of his constituents, and with credit to himself. Though he has
                        never sought office or position in the Republican party, he had always been
                        an active and influential worker for its success. He is one of Antrim
                        township's most respected and worthy farmers, and his deserved popularity
                        will justly add to his strength. Such men as Mr. M'Knight are sadly needed
                        in our Legislature, and the Convention deserves the thanks of the Republican
                        party for his nomination.</p>

                    <p>John A. Hyssong, Esq., of Mercersburg, nominated for the office of
                        Prothonotary, has been a Justice of the Peace at that place for years, and
                        possesses excellent business qualifications. Within a year, after a
                        satisfactory examination, he was admitted to the practice of law in the
                        courts of our county. If elected, as, we have no doubt he will be, he will
                        make a prompt, obliging and efficient Prothonotary. He will be a popular
                        candidate, worthy of the office, and will receive the warm support of the
                        whole Republican party.</p>

                    <p>For Register and Recorder the Convention selected H. C. Greenawalt, Esq., of
                        Fayetteville, out of three unexceptionable candidates, all of whom were well
                        qualified to fill the office. Perhaps Mr. Greenawalt owes his nomination to
                        the fact alone that he had more personal friends in the Convention than
                        either of the others. He is a popular, genial, clever fellow, with a
                        superior education, and will make a capital officer. He will poll more than
                        his party vote.</p>

                    <p>Lewis W. Detrich, of Hamilton, was nominated for Clerk of the Courts. Mr.
                        Detrich is a young man who lost an arm in the services of his country, and
                        has always been an enthusiastic Republican. He is every way worthy of the
                        office for which is party has nominated him, and will be triumphantly
                        elected. But for the fact that he was partially disabled in the rebellion,
                        and was therefore entitled to the assistance of the Republican party, they
                        would be unwilling to remove his competitor, Thad. M. Mahon, who was also a
                        wounded soldier, and had given perfect satisfaction to every one by the
                        careful and attentive discharge of his duties in the same office.</p>

                    <p>Capt. James C. Patton, of Mercersburg, was nominated for the office of County
                        Treasurer. Capt. Patton is well known throughout the whole county, and
                        everywhere popular. Two years ago he was a candidate for the nomination for
                        the same office, when the Convention saw fit to nominate Samuel F.
                        Greenawalt, Esq. Again brought before the Convention he was nominated,
                        though the candidate for Prothonotary had already been taken from
                        Mercersburg. This certainly is the only thing which could be urged against
                        him, and this cannot relate to the man but only to the locality from which
                        he was taken. No better man could be chosen for the office than Capt.
                        Patton, and none more ardent in his devotion to Republican principles. We
                        bespeak for him an active campaign and a triumphant election.</p>

                    <p>For Commissioner, Capt. John Doebler, of Chambersburg, was chosen by
                        acclamation. As one of the gallant Captains of the 126th regiment, and
                        ex-Sheriff of the county, he is known and liked by every one. He is the only
                        nomination taken from Chambersburg, and was made without solicitation. In
                        his hands the important and responsible interests of Franklin county can be
                        safely trusted.</p>

                    <p>John Frey, of Guilford, was nominated for Director of the Poor. His is a
                        farmer of that township, and it is enough to say that no better farmer, no
                        better Republican, and no more popular man lives within its limits. His
                        nomination is equivalent to an election.</p>

                    <p>Isaac Miller, for Auditor, and Dr. J. A. Maclay, for Coroner, both of Green,
                        are men of stainless reputation and deserving of any office in the county.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The whole Republican ticket is now before the people, for their
                        consideration. It can be elected without a single exception, if the
                        Republicans but do their duty. Gov. Geary was elected three years ago by a
                        splendid majority, when the party had to take him on trust. They knew that
                        he was loyal, they knew that he was brave, but they did not know whether, if
                        elected, he would administer the affairs of the Commonwealth wisely,
                        economically and honestly. Now they know that he will do all of these, for
                        had he not given us the test of experience?</p>

                    <p>Judge Williams was defeated two years ago, when the Republican party was
                        paralyzed by the perfidy of their President, and despair and disgust had
                        usurped the place of hope. This condition of things no longer exists. The
                        power of the administration is not now wielded in the interests of the
                        Democracy, and the Registry Law, wisely passed by the last Legislature has
                        completely cut off a bountiful supply of Democratic votes. This alone will
                        reduce their aggregate vote by thousands. The importance the leaders of that
                        party attach to the Registry Law is apparent from the bitterness with which
                        they assail it, though they have thus far failed to show a single reason for
                        their opposition, except that it effectually prevents fraudulent voting, to
                        all honest voters an overwhelming argument in its favor.</p>

                    <p>It is evident from the nomination the Democracy have made, that they have no
                        hope of defeating Judge Williams for the Supreme Bench. That party is not
                        lacking in profound and able lawyers, or experienced and learned judges, yet
                        it has nominated Cyrus L. Pershing, a gentleman who is absolutely unknown as
                        a lawyer or jurist, for their candidate for this high office. Nor is he one
                        of that class of unobtrusive great men who shrink from notoriety, but whose
                        great merit is known and appreciated where they live.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Pershing was a respectable member of the Legislature for several years,
                        and is well known as a politician of that class, but is unknown, both at
                        home or abroad, even as a mediocre lawyer. The Democratic members of the bar
                        of our own county could have furnished four or five lawyers as well
                        qualified for the position of Supreme Judge as Mr. Pershing, and the
                        nomination of either J. M'Dowell Sharpe or Judge Kimmell would have been a
                        guaranty to the voters of the party that the convention had at least a hope
                        of electing whom they nominated Judge Williams deservedly ranks among the
                        first lawyers of the State, and he has won the position by the steady and
                        industrious application of a superior intellect to the study and practice of
                        law for many years. As a lawyer his practice was large and varied, and his
                        success as a Judge, and his high character as a man led to his nomination
                        two years ago, and now, as a fit person to take a place on the Supreme Bench
                        of the State.</p>

                    <p>The nomination of Packer for Governor has about as much fitness as that of
                        Pershing for Judge, but on the question of availability the comparison
                        ceases. He is a man, not of varied but of inexhaustible resources. His
                        nomination was made with a view to his election, and not for the mere
                        purpose of completing the ticket. He has made a gigantic fortune in
                        speculations, most of it out of the circumstances created by the rebellion,
                        and by means of this fortune he is to be made Governor.</p>

                    <p>The Democratic party, the assumed champion of the poor man, nominated the
                        prince of rich men for its candidate. He who has ground the faces of the
                        poor until his fortune is colossal, now asks the poor man to make him
                        Governor. The Democratic party is opposed to monopolists. A thousand times
                        has it declared itself so in conventions and on the stump. It is also the
                        avowed enemy of monied aristocracy. These were its strongholds upon the
                        masses, and when it raised its cry against them the people rallied to its
                        protection and defense. Alas! the completest monopolist, the most perfect
                        specimen of a monied aristocrat, is to-day the
                        vaunted champion of the Democracy, and their only boast is of his wealth,
                        and his railroads, and his coal fields. To what humiliating shifts is this
                        boasted poor man's party driven to.</p>

                    <p>Divest Packer of his money, and divest him of the immense power which it has
                        brought him; put him, in this respect, in the same position with Governor
                        Geary, and make him your candidate for Governor. He would stand before the
                        people as bald as a plucked chicken. Wipe out his wealth and you wipe out
                        his existence. Such is the poor man's candidate for Governor.</p>
