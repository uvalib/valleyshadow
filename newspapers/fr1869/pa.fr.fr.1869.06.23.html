<b>Flee For Your Lives</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>When the Democratic paper, the Spirit, claims
                    that the Republican government will break up marriages and make whites marry
                    blacks, the Repository responds, referring to this
                    and other accusations as "childish imbecility."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The fountains of the great deep of the Spirit's
                        sorrow were broken up by the news of the Washington election last week, and
                        torrents of tears, and frantic threats, and childish imbecility chased each
                        other through its columns in rapid succession. We are not sure, but think
                        that is about the order in which they came. The tears and prolonged howls we
                        will pass by. They have been so common of late years, as Heaven's relentless
                        iconoclast has shattered Democratic idol after idol, that no one is any
                        longer moved by them, unless it be to laughter. The threats only excite
                        contempt. They, too, have grown into an oft told tale, and rarely effected anything more serious than disguised
                        assistance to rebels during the active years of the rebellion, the murdering
                        of helpless negroes and their teachers, and the destruction of negro school
                        houses and asylums. Hence, when the Spirit
                        renews the oft repeated cry, "The war of races is coming," we feel
                        constrained to say, Gentlemen, wipe your weeping eyes. There will be no war
                        of races. The negroes want none. They would lose everything and gain nothing
                        by arraying themselves against the white population of this country. While
                        it is true that for all their unnumbered wrongs the white race is
                        responsible, it is equally true that white men have been instrumental in
                        undoing the wrongs inflicted upon them. It is only when laboring in harmony
                        with the whites, and not when in antagonism with them, that they can raise
                        themselves from the degradation which slavery and their own ignorance has
                        heaped upon them. Their elevation either in intelligence, wealth or
                        influence, or in civil and political rights, is not secured at the expense
                        of white degradation, as the Spirit would have
                        us believe. In a war of races, if one could be inaugurated, the negroes
                        would lose everything already guaranteed to them, and make their condition
                        even more deplorable than it was before the war, if that were possible. It
                        is not probably, then, that they would be guilty of anything so stupid and
                        insane; and certainly the white race have no occasion to war upon a handful
                        of colored people, as compared with themselves, who have proved themselves
                        long suffering, patient and submissive to the laws under the most trying
                        circumstances. There can be no war of races. The cry is but the Shiboleth of
                        the dying Democracy as it finds itself disintegrating under the powerful
                        action of a better and truer civilization.</p>

                    <p>We said something of childish imbecility, in connection with the Spirit's account of the Washington election.
                        Perhaps we were mistaken. Here is what it said. Our readers may tell whether
                        or not we have properly designated it:</p>

                    <p>"Under the temporary rule of the Devil and the Radical party, it seems we are
                        to be forced to submit to negro voters, negro printers, negro jurors, negro
                        councilmen, negro alderman, negro mayors, negro congressmen, and negro
                        Presidents. Those of us who are married may be forcibly divorced by the Act
                        of a Radical Legislature or Congress and compelled to intermarry with these
                        pets of "the party of great moral ideas." There is no extreme to which this
                        party will not go now for the elevation of its ebony idol."</p>

                    <p>From the beginning to the close of the war, and since the war until now, the
                        Republican party has drawn many of its ablest and best representatives and
                        champions from the ranks of the Democracy, but we deny that the great high
                        priest of that party has ever shown any sympathy with republicanism, nor is
                        it likely that he will so long as the Democracy yield such absolute
                        submission to his authority.</p>

                    <p>We beg, therefore, while we admit negroes have the right to be all things
                        which the Spirit charges and so bitterly
                        bewails, to be excused from accepting the only thing which the Democracy
                        possesses in its entirety, the rule of the Devil. Without principles and
                        without power, with an appetite, sharpened by a long and painful abstinence
                        for public plunder, we advise them to stick to this Prince of Evil.</p>

                    <p>But there is one class of Democrats who fears the Spirit has cruelly trifled with. We mean the married class. And it
                        is our duty as journalists to correct this. No doubt many worthy but
                        unsophisticated members of the Democratic fold, who live in the retired
                        places of the county, and read no newspapers but the Spirit, daily look with fear and trembling to see themselves
                        torn from the partners of their bosoms, and incontinently wedded to these
                        sweet scented Africans, by a cruel edict of a Radical Congress. This
                        statement is the less excusable for the reason that, as a party, the
                        Democracy have always cherished an abiding fear that a negroes highest
                        ambition has ever been to marry a white Democrat, and a corresponding doubt
                        as to their power to resist ebony blandishments. Why only those who are
                        already married are in danger of being subjected to the Radical outrage we
                        are not informed, and cannot tell. But if it be a Radical measure, we object
                        to it as unfair to the unmarried Democracy. Or rather we deny that it is a
                        Radical measure, because Radicals are in favor of equal rights to all.</p>

                    <p>Our mind is sometimes vexed with serious doubts whether the queer articles
                        which find their way into the columns of our neighbor, the Spirit, are intended as earnest arguments and
                        exhortations to sensible men, or whether they are written as caricatures and
                        burlesques upon the teachings and history of the Democratic party. Such
                        extravagant rhodomontade, such charges upon windmills, as the following, are
                        exquisite as satires, but seem like prodigious nonsense in any other view:</p>

                    <p>"We call upon all white men to join hands to
                        break the power of this terrible, destructive fanaticism. Open your eyes.
                        Look about you. Read in these signs of the times the total overthrow of the
                        republic and the fearful reign of anarchy, unless something be done and done
                        speedily to crush this party of but one idea. And seeing the danger, meet it
                        like men. Grapple with it and put it to flight. Redeem the country from the
                        thraldom of its negromania and proclaim to the world that 'white men must
                        rule America.'"</p>

                    <p>Who sees a great wave of destructive fanaticism rolling over the country? Why
                        when we open our eyes and look about us, we see the perpetuity of the Union
                        assured in the overthrow and defeat of a mighty rebellion, inaugurated
                        against it by the Democratic party. We see the area of the reign of anarchy
                        daily growing narrower and narrower. But a few short years ago it spread
                        over all the South, like a great ocean, and its turbulent waves dashed far
                        into the free States. That was the time to give the alarm. Then was the
                        moment to point to the threatening danger, and to appeal to men to strand up
                        for their country. Then men did grapple with it and not only put it to
                        flight but slew it. Why talk of such things now ? when the danger is past
                        and the country redeemed. Our neighbor is just awaking from a sleep, and
                        beholds things with distorted vision. Let him rub his eyes and wash the
                        blindness of prejudice from them, and these visions which so terrify his
                        imagination will all be gone.</p>

<b>Our Border Claims</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This letter to the editor advocates the creation of a Border Claims Party.
                    The author, disgruntled at both political parties for ignoring the plight of the
                    border claimants, argues that only a new political organization, specifically
                    for obtaining state reparations, may finally bring justice to those border
                    residents who suffered during the war.<br>

                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository.
                    </p>

                    <p>That those citizens of our border counties who sustained losses by the rebels
                        during the recent great civil war, have a fair, just and equitable claim
                        upon the State for remuneration, cannot with any show of reason be denied.
                            Protection was a duty the State owed to her
                        people; and the obligation has been admitted in the partial remuneration the citizens of Chambersburg received for
                        their losses, out of the State Treasury. And if it was just and right that
                        those who were so unfortunate as to live in Chambersburg, should have any
                        part of their losses made good by the State, why should not those who lived
                        in the other towns, and in the rural districts of the "Border" have equal
                        consideration extended to them. Many of our best, most loyal and law abiding
                        citizens in these towns and districts, lost their
                        all, and were reduced to penury by their losses, and yet to them not one dollar of aid has been extended.
                        The injustice of this all admit. Why then have
                        not these just and righteous claims been recognized and paid? They have been
                        estimated by fair, competent and impartial men, at least three times, and the result of their findings, and
                        the testimony they took in relation to them, are on file in the Departments
                        at Harrisburg. The aggregate of the claims, exclusive of the amount yet due
                        the people of Chambersburg, does not, I think, exceed the sum of $2,000,000.
                        With the amount due the citizens of Chambersburg yet, viz: $1,500,000, the
                        sum total unpaid to the sufferers would not exceed $3,500,000, a mere trifle
                        to so great and wealthy a Commonwealth as Pennsylvania.</p>

                    <p>It is idle to expect payment from the general government. The nation has as
                        much to pay as it can well get along with - and Congress cannot establish a
                        precedent acknowledging the national liability
                        for the losses caused by the war. To do so, would be ruinous to the national
                        credit, and would cause national bankruptcy at no distant day - for the
                        amount of claims of this character would be so enormous, were the national
                        liability once admitted, that no administration could bear up under it - and
                        none would dare assume it.</p>

                    <p>But with the State of Pennsylvania it is very different. She proved able to
                        pay all her war expenses, and yet at the same time reduce her State debt,
                        several millions. In truth she came out of the war richer than she went into it. Her ability therefore to repay her
                        citizens all that they lost by her inability or
                            neglect to protect them at the proper time,
                        is undenied, and undeniable. And were she to do, that which she should, none of her people would feel the
                        additional burden imposed upon them, so great is the extent of her resources
                        - so easy, and almost imperceptible might be the measures adopted for
                        payment.</p>

                    <p>Why then is not the obligation assumed at once? Why have not provisions been
                        made long ago for payment? Why has the Legislature year after year refused
                        to act upon the petitions of the sufferers? Simply because but a part of the
                        people of some six or seven counties along the border of the State are
                        interested pecuniarily in the matter, and they
                        send so few representatives to the Legislature that their wishes do not
                        impress the balance of their fellow members. They are not feared as a power in
                        the Legislature. They cannot, because of diversity of sentiment and feeling
                        among themselves, make their influence be felt, or essential to either of
                        the great parties in the Legislature, and therefore the claims of their
                        constituents are disregarded year after year, and will continue to be
                        disregarded, and remain unpaid, until these things are all changed.</p>

                    <p>I have, Messrs. Editors, been led to these thoughts, because of the recent
                        action had by the border claimants of Franklin and one or two of the
                        adjoining counties. They are again moving for payment of their losses; and
                        to secure that result have been holding Conventions, raising money, and
                        passing resolutions. I predict the same result to these efforts, as to those
                        of a similar character in the past. No satisfactory result will be reached -
                        nor what is more important - any MONEY secured by such measures. Many of
                        those who are losers have become discouraged, and don't feel disposed to
                        contribute, as they think it is throwing good money after that which is
                        already lost. It will therefore be impossible to raise money enough to put a
                        bill of such magnitude through the Legislature, and obtain its approval, and
                        I don't suppose that any one is foolish enough to contemplate the
                        undertaking. Those who oppose and defeat the payment of these claims come
                        from sections of the State where they never saw a rebel, unless he was a
                        prisoner or a fugitive. They know nothing personally of the horrors of the war, nor did their constituents
                        ever sustain a dollar of losses. Therefore they cannot, and do not feel any
                        interest favorable to those who did lose. They think that it was our misfortune to be here, and sustain losses, but
                        they do not believe themselves in any measure liable to make good those
                        losses. They forget that we were the breakwater
                        that prevented the devastating surges of the rebellion from rolling over
                        them, and they are therefore indisposed to tax themselves, through State
                        recognization, or assumption, to repay losses none of which they
                        participated in. Their representatives in the Legislature sympathize fully
                        with them and refuse to vote for these claim bills, because they say that
                        however right and just in principle, such votes would be their own political
                        destruction, no difference to which party they might belong.</p>

                    <p>In my opinion the border claimants will never have their losses secured, or
                        paid, until they make themselves felt as a POWER in the State; a power
                        strong enough to dictate terms to both Democrats and Republicans, and able
                        to control both the Legislature and the Executive. And there is but one way
                        to accomplish that, and that is through the organization of a BORDER CLAIMS
                        PARTY, whose members should be solemnly pledged to support no man for any office in the State who would not openly and
                        unreservedly pledge himself to work and vote for the payment, out of the
                        State Treasury, of all the war losses sustained by our citizens.</p>

                    <p>When the border claimants become a unit in their
                        votes, then they will make themselves felt and feared, and their
                        demands will be acknowledged and their losses paid.</p>

                    <p>It is too late now to take any action prior to the next Gubernatorial
                        election; but no more propitious time could be expected in other respects.
                        The nation is at peace, the national finances in a good condition, a
                        President and Congress in perfect accord, whose policy will not be changed for near four years to come. The
                        necessity, therefore, for an unwavering adherence to party ties, by either
                        of the great parties of the State, is not apparent. Therefore this is an
                        excellent time for border sufferers and their friends to prepare to sever
                        old party associations, and through a new "Border
                            Claims Party" organization fight for the redress of their own
                        great grievances.</p>

                    <p>You may, Messrs. Editors, smile and say that the plan is futile. But not so,
                        in my opinion. Look at it thus. There are fully five hundred voters in this
                        county (including the people of Chambersburg) who have a direct pecuniary
                        interest in the payment of these losses. And those five hundred could each
                        influence one other disinterested person, when it would come to voting, for
                        there are many who would sustain the payment of these claims from a belief
                        that the State is both morally and legally bound for them.</p>

                    <p>Now suppose that five hundred of the voters of this county unite together in
                        Border Claim Leagues or Associations, all over the county, and pledge
                        themselves one to the other that they will support
                        no man for any office, large or small,
                        who will not pledge himself to support the payment of these losses. Suppose
                        that they demand that the candidates offering for office in our county shall
                        each one, without respect to party, give a like pledge, on pain of being cut
                        by them at the polls. Suppose also that they demand that the several parties
                        of the county shall through their conventions pass resolutions demanding
                        payment of these claims. What candidate, what
                            party will dare refuse such a request,
                        coming from five hundred of our voters? None! To refuse would be sure
                        defeat; for a much less number than five hundred of our voters acting
                        together can carry our county just as they please.</p>

                    <p>The same result, upon the same kind of action, would follow in York, Adams,
                        Cumberland, Perry, Fulton, Bedford and Somerset counties. All that is
                        necessary is that those who are interested should be true to themselves until their wrongs are redressed.</p>

                    <p>Now carry the proposition a little further. Suppose that under action of this
                        character the counties named shall have elected Senators and Representatives
                            all pledged to the payment of border claims.
                        We would then have four Senators and seven Representatives who would be
                        pledged to act together as a unit, and who could by so acting, and making
                        use of the power in their hands, control the organization and action of the
                        Legislature upon all important measures - and make themselves so respected
                        as a power among the powers, as to secure
                        anything they might desire.</p>

                    <p>It is not to be expected that this result can be secured this year - nor
                        perhaps next - nor even perhaps the year after. It will require time, and
                        united and energetic action. The initiatory steps must be taken in the
                        border counties. The claimants must associate themselves together, and by
                        their position and action show both great parties that they are in "dead
                        earnest." When it is seen that as they go so these counties will go - and
                        that those only whom they support can be elected; then the politicians will begin to fear them, and when their power
                        is feared, and felt,
                        all parties will be found seeking to secure its aid by pledging their
                        candidates to support its requests.</p>

                    <p>These border counties at the last Presidential election cast 51,591 votes.
                        Less than one-half that number of votes will at all elections carry the
                        State, for whatever party they may be cast in favor - and let it be once
                        known that there is a Border Claims Party in existence numbering even 10,000
                        voters, whose members will support no man for any State office who will not
                        pledge himself to advocate their demands, and long before the Gubernatorial
                        election of 1872, we will see both the great parties of the State seeking
                        that vote, and through their State Conventions, resolving that the State
                        must do justice to her loyal people who suffered in the war. And when that
                        time comes, then the day of payment is near; and when justice has been done
                        to those who suffered for the "common weal" then the Border Claims Party may
                        be disbanded and remembered only as among the things that have been. But
                        until then there is little reason why those who have suffered so much, and
                        lost so largely, should continue to pay fealty to either of the present
                        political parties who have so contemptuously disregarded their petitions for
                        redress.</p>

                    <p>ONE WHO IS NO CLAIMANT.</p>
