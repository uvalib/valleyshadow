                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> in its last issue has attempted to
                        reply to our article of the 6th inst., in relation to the management of this
                        institution and the <emph rend="italic">mismanagement</emph> of those now
                        controlling its affairs. Mr. Piper, the late Steward, has to bear the brunt
                        of the reply, but as "Davy" has heretofore received many a hard shot and was
                        not "kilt," we suppose he will survive this one.</p>

                    <p>The first item of our charges referred to by the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Spirit</emph> is "fence making" done and performed by the present Steward,
                        Mr. Brandt. We had said that these posts and rails "had been bought, hauled
                        and <emph rend="italic">paid for</emph> before Mr. Brandt became Steward."
                        In this we may be in error. They had been <emph rend="italic">bought and
                            hauled</emph> in March, but were not actually <emph rend="italic">paid
                            for</emph> until the meeting of the Directors on the 5th of April,
                        whilst Mr. Brandt assumed the position of Steward on the <emph rend="italic"
                            >first</emph> of April. We were correct, however, in saying that "during
                        the twelve months that Mr. Piper was Steward, <emph rend="italic"
                        >from</emph> April 1st, 1868, up to and including April, 1869, the Directors
                        had received $13,527.84, and with this, and the proceeds of the land, Mr.
                        Piper had carried on the institution for his year, and <emph rend="italic"
                            >left no debts that were not paid out of this money</emph>." So much for
                        the posts and rails; but how about the <emph rend="italic">hay</emph>, the
                            <emph rend="italic">pigs</emph>, and the <emph rend="italic"
                        >potatoes?</emph></p>

                    <p>We are glad that the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> did not dare deny the
                        correctness of our list of "Provisions and Groceries" left by Mr. Piper when
                        he removed from this <emph rend="italic">Poor</emph> House on the 1st of
                        April last, except in relation to the quantity of <emph rend="italic"
                        >lard</emph>; and then the effort is made more to show that such a quantity
                            <emph rend="italic">could not</emph> have been left, than to deny that
                        it <emph rend="italic">had been</emph> left. The <emph rend="italic"
                        >Spirit</emph> evidently did not know that the <emph rend="italic"
                        >last</emph> butchering at the Poor House was on the 14th of January last,
                        when 160 pounds of clean lard were added to the 250 pounds on hand at the
                        settlement on the 1st of January, 1869. So there was plenty to make even
                            <emph rend="italic">six fifty pound cans</emph>. But how about the <emph
                            rend="italic">hay</emph>, the <emph rend="italic">pigs</emph>, and the
                            <emph rend="italic">potatoes?</emph></p>

                    <p>As to the truth of our statement about the crippling of the horse the night
                        Mr. Brandt took possession of the Poor House, and which necessitated his
                        being killed, and a loss of $200 caused the county, we would refer the <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph> to the hired men, at the Poor House who had
                        charge of the horses for a long time before--knew their dispositions
                        well--had charge of them <emph rend="italic">then</emph>, and have charge of
                        them <emph rend="italic">yet</emph>. Mr. Piper had nothing to do with them,
                        as they had gone into Mr. Brandt's care. So much for the "<emph
                            rend="italic">dead horse</emph>," but how about the <emph rend="italic"
                            >hay</emph>, the <emph rend="italic">pigs</emph>, and the <emph
                            rend="italic">potatoes?</emph></p>

                    <p>The "horse contracts" get a full laudation from the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Spirit</emph>, but some how or other the <emph rend="italic">sum
                            expended</emph> is always varying. In the article published in the <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph> on the 29th of September, the amount paid
                        out for horses since the Democracy got control of the Poor House, was given
                        at $997.50. In our issue of the 6th instant we charged, and showed, that it
                        was nearer $1,250, and now in its last article the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Spirit</emph> says it was only $879. Now which, even of the <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit's</emph> statements, is true? We don't care which,
                        for either sum was too great an expenditure under the circumstances. But not
                        content with this expenditure of $879.00--$997.50 or $1,250, which ever it
                        may be--the Directors, or Steward, have, as we are informed, actually bought
                            <emph rend="italic">another</emph> horse since our last article was
                        published.</p>

                    <p>But says the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> the horses sold were "old,
                        worn out, crippled, and blind." One mare was <emph rend="italic"
                        >blind</emph>, but she was <emph rend="italic">good</emph>, and suitable for
                        all purposes, another horse was <emph rend="italic">crippled</emph>, under
                        Brandt's management, as above stated--but the remaining five were from three
                        to ten years old, and as good as farmers horses are usually--and certainly
                        good enough for <emph rend="italic">Poor</emph> House purposes. It is not
                        necessary, in our opinion, that our <emph rend="italic">Paupers</emph>
                        should have $250 horses to look at, and use, or that our Poor House team
                        should be among the <emph rend="italic">fancy</emph> teams of the county. We
                        would advise the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> to get Mr. Brandt's
                        receipt for buying <emph rend="italic">cheap</emph> horses, and publiush it
                        for the benefit of our farmers. It would certainly be more advantage to the
                        public than even Mr. Piper's receipt for making "lard," about which they
                        speak so much. But how about the <emph rend="italic">hay</emph>, the <emph
                            rend="italic">pigs</emph>, and the <emph rend="italic">potatoes?</emph></p>

                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> man should not fault the Republican
                        officers at the Poor House for desiring to "hold on" to their little places,
                        considering how long she has held on to his little "posish" of District
                        Attorney. The desire to get money easily and surely is natural to an
                        American, and not <emph rend="italic">unconstitutional</emph> as we know
                        of--and the desire of the Democratic appointees to get hold of the Poor
                        House <emph rend="italic">teat</emph>, was so extreme, so itching, and so
                        uncontrolable that the majority of the Board actually paid the Republican
                        Clerk and Attorney $50 to "git," and let their man in--and also put out the
                        Republican Treasurer, contrary to law, and inducted a Democratic successor,
                        to the end that the handling of money, the making of contracts, and the
                        emoluments of the offices might be kept among the hungry faithful. But how
                        about the <emph rend="italic">hay</emph>, the <emph rend="italic"
                        >pigs</emph>, and the <emph rend="italic">potatoes?</emph></p>

                    <p>We think we have fully answered the <emph rend="italic">Spirit's</emph> two
                        column article, but before we close we wish to refer to another glaring
                        abuse at the Poor House, one that has existed for many years past, and under
                        all administrations, and one that we think in all candor should be <emph
                            rend="italic">abolished</emph>. We refer to the <emph rend="italic"
                            >large and costly</emph> DINNERS served up to everybody who will or can
                        come to the monthly meetings of the Directors. The preparation of these
                            <emph rend="italic">feasts</emph>, we have been informed, often occupies
                        the family of the Steward, and the cooks in the institution, the greater
                        part of the day preceding the monthly meetings of the Directors, (which is
                        always <emph rend="italic">Sunday</emph>,) and also the fore part of the day
                        following, to the great worry, disgust and annoyance of those who have to
                        prepare them. Cakes, and pies, and other delicacies have to be baked on the
                        Sabbath, when every thing about the place should be at rest, and the inmates
                        at church, or employed in reading and meditation. There is perhaps no <emph
                            rend="italic">great</emph> objection to the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Directors</emph> and <emph rend="italic">officers</emph> of the
                        institution getting a dinner once a month at the <emph rend="italic"
                        >public</emph> expense, but they should take "pot luck" along with the
                        Steward's family--but even this is a custom that would be more honored in
                        the breach than the observance. The County Commissioners, Jurors, Road
                        Viewers and <emph rend="italic">all other</emph> public officers on duty pay
                        for their own dinners and horse feed, and why should not the Directors of
                        the Poor do the same thing?</p>

                    <p>But if, as we said before, the Directors be allowed to sponge a dinner and
                        horse feed out of the public funds, once a month, that is no reason why the
                        hordes of hungry money seekers who go there at each meeting to get pay for
                        their "little bills"--nor the dozens of others who go there without any
                        business, should have <emph rend="italic">their</emph> dinners at the <emph
                            rend="italic">public expense</emph>. Parties having claims upon the
                        public usually make them large enough to cover the expense of going after
                        their "monish," and they should pay their own travelling expenses and
                        board-bills. There is no sense or reason for the county feeding such people.
                        The cost of each meal thus given away cannot be less than fifty cents--the
                            <emph rend="italic">number</emph> of them must be hundreds per year--and
                        the total cost to the people not less than two or three hundred dollars,
                        which could easily be used for much more worthy purposes. Now if the
                        Democratic majority really wish to inaugurate a creditable reform at the
                        Poor House, let them <emph rend="italic">at once</emph> determine hereafter
                        to pay their own expenses, and abolish peremptorily all free dinners at
                        their meetings. The public will sustain them in the act, and thank them too,
                        for the reform--and perhaps then they may have leisure to tell us all about
                        the <emph rend="italic">hay</emph>, <emph rend="italic">pigs</emph> and
                            <emph rend="italic">potatoes</emph>.</p>

                        Kyner, vs. Alexander Kyner. Summon in ejectment, for all that certain

                        county, containing 146 acres, more or less, being the mansion farm of George

                        containing 12 acres, more or less; also for a tract of mountain land, in
                        said township, containing 52 acres, more or less, the right of possession
                        and title to which plaintiffs aver to be in them and not in defendent. 20
                        Sept. 1869. At the instance of J. McD. Sharpe, Esq., the Prothonotary enters
                        plea of not guilty. Sharpe, Kimmel and Stewart for plffs; Cessna, Brewer and
                        Orr, for deft. The following gentlemen were sworn as jurors; John Hawk,
                        Joseph Price, Elias Shearer, John Snyder, William A. Ott, Rudolph Spielman,
                        John Davison, Franklin Besore, John P. Ebersole, George Finefrock, George
                        Jarret, E. D. Weaver. As the regular list of jurors failed to fill the box,
                        the court was compelled to resort to talesmen to complete the number.
                        Several gentlemen were taken by surprise as their names were called by
                        Deputy Sheriff Brown, and were compelled to send word home that
                        "circumstances over which they had no control" compelled their presence at
                        court.</p>

                    <p>This suit was brought for the purpose of testing the title of Alex Kyner to
                        the land above described. The defendant claimed his title to the land on the
                        ground that it was devised to him by his father, George Kyner, dec'd, who
                        died in July, 1867, in a will made in the year 1855. The witnesses to the
                        document were Hon. James L. Black, of Chambersburg, and James Ross, Esq.,
                        dec'd, a former member of the bar. The plaintiffs alleged that the testator
                        being 80 years of age at the date of the instrument, was incompetent to make
                        a will from a want of mental capacity and was under the improper control and
                        influence of his son Alex W. Kyner at the time of making the will. The
                        defendant denied the allegations of the plaintiffs. The single question in
                        dispute was the validity or invalidity of the will of George Kyner, dec'd.</p>

                    <p>This case was tried, as a feigned issue, at the January Term, 1868, and
                        nearly the same facts brought forward then, as now. The jurors at that time,
                        were John D. Spear, Jacob Haulman, D. K. Wunderlich, Jacob Shank, John H.
                        Thompson, Michael Reid, Abraham Hassler, Joseph Palmer, J. Widney, James
                        Long, John C. Cook, and David R. Miller. The verdict was in favor of the
                        validity of the will. The following are the contents of the will: The
                        testator directed the payment of his debts as soon as convenient after his
                        decease; he gave to his wife one third of his personal property, after the
                        payment of his debts, and the interest, rent, or income of one-third of his
                        real estate, for and during her natural life, the above legacies to be in
                        lieu of her dower-thirds, or other portion of and in all his estate; to his
                        daughter Mary, intermarried with Samuel Thompson, the sum of $400, to be
                        paid to her without interest, four years after his decease; to his daughter
                        Margaret, intermarried with Joseph Kyner, $400, to be paid without interest
                        five years after his decease; to his daughter Catharine, intermarried with
                        John Coldsmith, $400, without interest, to be paid six years after his
                        decease; to his daughter Jane Ann, intermarried with Thomas Marshall, the
                        sum of $400, to be paid seven years after his decease, without interest; to
                        his daughter Euphemia C., intermarried with Alex Duncan, the sum of $400, to
                        be paid without interest, eight years after his decease; to his daughter
                        Georgiana, the sum of $400, to be paid without interest, nine years after
                        his decease; to his son David, $400, to be paid, without interest, ten years
                        after his decease; to his son Alexander, (the deft. in this case), the land
                        above described, subject to the annual payment of the widow's portion, and
                        the legacies of the other children, and after the death of the widow,
                        Alexander was to receive the remainder of the estate, and he further
                        appointed Alexander to be his Executor.</p>

                    <p>On Tuesday morning the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant in
                        the above case.</p>
