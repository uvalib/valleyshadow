<b>The New Amendment</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article announces the passage of the introduction of the Fifteenth
                    Amendment by the House of Representatives. The paper argues that individual
                    states should have amended their own constitutions for this matter, but accepts
                    that it is a beneficial resolution overall.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The House of Representatives, on Saturday last, passed the joint resolution
                        reported from Committee on the Judiciary, by Mr. Boutwell, submitting to the
                        State Legislatures an amendment to the Constitution providing for universal
                        suffrage.</p>

                    <p>The following is the resolution:</p>

                    <p>By it resolved, etc., Two-thirds of both Houses
                            concuring, that the following article be
                        proposed to the Legislature of the several States, as an amendment to the
                        Constitution of the United States, which when ratified by three-fourths of
                        said Legislatures, shall be held as part of said Constitution namely.</p>

                    <p>ARTICLE. - Section 1. The right of any citizen of the United States to vote
                        shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason
                        of race, color or previous condition of slavery of any citizen or class of
                        citizens of the United States.</p>

                    <p>SECT. 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation
                        the provisions of this article.</p>

                    <p>All the Republicans voted for its passage except Bingham of Ohio, Baker of
                        Illinois, and Halsey of West Virginia.</p>

                    <p>Congress, or rather the Republicans of the House, have at length taken the
                        step, if true to the principles they have always advocated, they dared no
                        longer refuse. We certainly are in favor of universal suffrage, and believe
                        there never was a time when it was rightfully withheld. We believe further,
                        that the great mass of the people who fought the war to overthrow the
                        rebellion, and exterminate slavery, are unwilling to make the slaves free
                        and yet withhold from them that which protects them in their freedom.</p>

                    <p>As a question of policy, if policy has a place in upright and conscientious
                        statesmanship, this measure may be wrong. Weak and timid Republicans may be
                        driven off. It would be surprising if some were not. But the measure finds
                        its justification on a far higher ground than that of policy. It proclaims
                        the rights of man, no matter what be his race, and it will triumph, so sure
                        as Truth and Right are ordained by God to triumph over Error and Wrong.</p>

                    <p>If the Senate adopt the resolution, and we have no doubt it will, it will
                        then be submitted to the Legislatures of the States for approval. If
                        approved by three-fourths of them it becomes a part of the Constitution.
                        Whether this can be done is only for the future to tell, but this is
                        certain, that though it be defeated now it will eventually triumph, and
                        triumph through the instrumentality of those who withheld suffrage, and not
                        of those who were unjustly deprived of it.</p>

                    <p>We would rather have seen each State, which denies any of its citizens the
                        right of suffrage, amend its Constitution so as to grant the right, and
                        believe it would have been prudent for the Republican party to do so. But
                        this does not effect the principle in the least, and if such an amendment to
                        the Constitution can be carried, the result is the same.</p>
