<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>A year ago the survivors of the war to suppress the rebellion conceived and
                        carried into effect the beautiful idea of collecting together in bodies all
                        over the country, on the same day, and devoting it to decorating the graves
                        of their fallen comrades with fresh flowers. It was contemplated by the
                        originators that each succeeding year, when flowers were in bloom, and
                        nature was loveliest, and the hearts of men expanded with the beauty of
                        Spring, this sacred ceremony should be repeated until it grew into a custom,
                        in the perpetual observance of which might be kept green and fresh the
                        precious memory of those who fell victims to the rebellion. We notice in the
                        journals, throughout the country, that preparations are being made
                        everywhere, and that the observance of Saturday the 29th day of May will be
                        general, the 30th, the day which was last year observed, coming on Sunday.</p>

                    <p>The ceremony was inaugurated and carried into effect by the Grand Army of the
                        Republic, and organization composed of soldiers, extending throughout all
                        the States, with a Post in almost every town of prominence, and Major
                        General John A Logan, for its Commander. But many soldiers, perhaps the
                        majority of them, are not members of the Grand Army of the Republic, nor is
                        there a Post at this place. The ceremony here at least, cannot be conducted
                        under its auspices, and its successful observance will require that the
                        soldiers meet, regardless of secret or political organizations, and appoint
                        committees to obtain flowers and make all necessary provisions for its
                        observance. There should not be left a single Union Soldier's grave, on that
                        day, within the county, that is not visited by warm loving hearts, and
                        decked with sweet and fragrant flowers. Some lie in country graveyards, and
                        unfrequented places, but there must be sons or brothers or friends whose
                        hearts warm towards their dust, and whose hands will gladly perform this
                        sacred duty. We hope therefore that there will be but one sentiment among
                        the people on that day, and that all, whether they have mingled in the
                        scenes of carnage and blood and strife, where fell so many of our noble
                        heroes, or whether they labored in more gentle scenes for the safety and
                        perpetuity of their Government, will aid to make the solemn ceremonies of
                        this day successful and impressive. The ladies who responded bountifully to
                        the former call for flowers should again give their aid. If a personal
                        application is not made to every one they should not hesitate to do so
                        voluntarily. If needed, Repository Hall will again be opened as a place for
                        arranging and storing flowers.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository reports that Virginia will soon
                    vote on a new state constitution, one resisted by conservative factions within
                    the state. A test oath clause will also be up for a separate vote.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The President has issued a proclamation directing that the new Constitution
                        of Virginia be submitted to the voters of the State for approval or
                        rejection, on the 6th day of July. On two clauses of the Constitution, that
                        relating to the test oath, and that disfranchising certain classes of
                        residents, a separate vote has been ordered. All the other parts of the
                        instrument will be voted on solid. An effort was made by the conservatives
                        to secure a separate vote on other sections, but it is thought that his
                        refusal will create much opposition among that class, against the whole
                        instrument. The Richmond Inquirer of last week,
                        commenting on the terms of submission which the President was then thought
                        to entertain, said if the township, county and school clause be not voted on
                        separately "nothing will be left to the white people of Virginia, but to
                        rally together as one man, and vote down the whole of the Constitution, and
                        they will do it." It is to be presumed, however, that the experience they
                        have undergone, of "hanging on the verge of the Union," has given them such
                        an appreciation of the advantages and comforts of being within it, that they
                        will hesitate to adopt that unsatisfactory sort of revenge which consists
                        mainly in biting off thier noses to spite their faces.</p>
