                    <p>In the future politics of our country the subject of protection to American
                        industry is destined to become vital and engrossing. We speak of the near
                        future, in this relation, and not of a distant, indistinct time in the next
                        hundred years. Of logical necessity the fact of the existence of our
                        government, at all, superseded the fact of its prosperity, and banished for
                        the time being all consideration of the questions of protection to American
                        Capital and Labor, and the free trade policy. This necessity exists no
                        longer, and the material, industrial and social problems of our rapidly
                        growing population, and the inexhaustible natural resources of our country,
                        awakened to life and activity by what was accomplished when all our means
                        were directed to the suppression of the rebellion, are impatient for
                        solution.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps the most important revolutions wrought by the war, are those which
                        scarcely received a thought during its progress. They were not the
                        affirmation of the question of the perpetuity of governments by the people,
                        or the practical realization of the theory that all men are equal, secured
                        in the destruction of slavery, though these are the conditions of their
                        success. The war has made the population of the United States one people,
                        one in interest, one in aim and destiny. It has made them homogeneous, and
                        forever banished the distinctions of North, South, East and West, except as
                        geographical points. When slave labor was swallowed up in the war, the only
                        real antagonism which existed in the country between labor and capital came
                        to an end. The power of a class was broken, and logical hostility to the
                        protection of American industry ceased. Whatever advocates and disciples the
                        doctrine of free trade has <orig reg="today">to-day</orig>, they are to be
                        found among those whose commercial relations with Europe put them in
                        hostility to the best interests of the masses of the people, and those whom
                        their sophistries have deceived.</p>

                    <p>The experience of the two great political parties may soon be that of all
                        those which have preceded them. The work which the Republican party set out
                        to do is well nigh completed. Perhaps but one thing yet remains for it to
                        do, and its accomplishment is not even doubtful; we refer to the adoption of
                        the Fifteenth Amendment. Opposition on the part of the Democracy to this
                        measure would be powerless to prevent its adoption, if made, but the signs
                        of the times clearly show that their resistance from this time forth will be
                        slight and unimportant. The negroes are soon destined to exercise the right
                        of suffrage in Pennsylvania and all the free States, as well as in Virginia
                        and the other States of the South. Many of them will vote with the
                        Democratic party, doubtless, as well as with the Republican, when their
                        right to vote is no longer imperilled by Democratic opposition. In the
                        recent Virginia election many negroes voted with the Democrats against that
                        clause of the Constitution disfranchising ex-rebels, though the radical
                        Republicans were united in its favor. The opposition of the Democratic party
                        to negro suffrage was genuine, but only so far as their belief that it would
                        be used against themselves carried them. All else about the inferior and
                        half savage negro exercising the same rights which white men do was the
                        purest buncombe and balderdash, to be discarded whenever it was no longer
                        needed. If the Democracy accept the situation, as these brief sentences have
                        stated it, there is no longer any conflict between them and the Republicans
                        upon any of the issues which have divided them since the election of Lincoln
                        to the Presidency. Slavery is dead, secession is dead. All men are free and
                        equal under the law without regard to color, race or previous condition.</p>

                    <p>Already both political parties see and feel the changed relations, and are
                        adapting themselves to them. Naturally the Republican party are the
                        champions of American labor and industry, and naturally free trade falls to
                        the lot of the Democracy, who, as always in the past, follow with reluctant
                        steps, the path opened by their more liberal opponents. Republican State
                        Conventions declare in favor of protection. Those of Democratic faith
                        reiterate their adherence to the old free trade dogma, with the same
                        blindness which characterized their party during the war. As for example,
                        two weeks ago the Democratic State Convention of Ohio pledged the party to
                        the policy of striking down her most important productions by removing the
                        fostering protection which had built them up. About the same time the
                        National Convention of adopted Irish citizens;, at Chicago, pledged their
                        influence among our Irish population to aid and encourage American industry,
                        and denounced the free trade policy of the Democratic party, which, they
                        declared, tended to enrich Great Britain, and impoverish their adopted
                        country. The action of this Convention is significant, and shows clearly
                        that our Irish population will no longer aid the prosperity of England by
                        bigoted adherence to the Democratic party, when that party is inimical to
                        the best interests of their adopted country.</p>

                    to Democratic free trade policies. It also mentions a belief that the Civil War

                    <p>The people of this country have had another instance of Spanish cruelty, in
                        the late execution of one hundred Americans, by order of the Spanish
                        authorities in Cuba. We know nothing of many of these men, not the
                        circumstances attending their capture, but the fact that they have been shot
                        down like dogs, without having committed any crime, arouses just indignation
                        in the heart of every citizen of our Republic. Among those murdered was
                        Albert Wyeth, aged about nineteen years, son of John Wyeth, Esq., of
                        Chambersburg. The REPOSITORY a few weeks since, upon the authority of a
                        member of the Cuban Junta of New York, and a dispatch from the Associated
                        Press, announced the death of this young man. It appears, however, that an
                        error had been made, for during the past ten days Mr. Wyeth, much to the joy
                        of his family and friends, received a letter from his son, stating that he
                        was a prisoner and as well treated as could be expected. He asked that
                        summer clothing might be sent him, and expressed hopes of release from
                        confinement. A second letter was received on Thursday evening of similar
                        purport. On Saturday evening, however, an official dispatch from Washington
                        brought the sad information that Albert Wyeth had been executed by his
                        heartless captors. This young man had not intentionally violated any
                        international laws, and was prepared to prove that he did not leave New York
                        for the purpose of fillibustering. The Spaniards knew this and promised that
                        he should have an opportunity of showing his innocence. The next day they
                        murdered him without cause, and only to gratify their hellish thirst for
                        blood and brutality which has characterized their vain effort to suppress
                        the present revolution. Such fiendish acts as this will and ought to damn
                        any cause. We hope the day may soon come when these deaths may be avenged,
                        but in the meantime it will be the duty of the State Department at
                        Washington to have these butcheries of American citizens thoroughly
                        investigated.</p>

                <transcript>

                    <p>The country is greatly in need of a new political dictionary. Old things have
                        passed away, and the new departure in Virginia politics requires new
                        definitions for the proper understanding of its terms. Once a
                        "carpet-bagger," as defined by Southern newspapers, meant an individual who
                        settled in the South from any of the States which remained true to the
                        Union. This we could understand. It was broad and distinctive. It made no
                        confusion whatever, and though first applied as a term of reproach and
                        abuse, it won a share of respectability from its application to many good
                        and patriotic men, who were doing far more for the South than its own people
                        were willing to do for themselves. Now we are taught differently. All
                        Northern men who go South to live are not carpet-baggers, even though they
                        take no trunk with them. A single plunge in the pool of Democratic politics,
                        can wash "all his sins away" from the most odious Northerner, and make him
                        white as Democratic <emph rend="italics">wool.</emph> This creates
                        confusion, and will until it becomes understood. The true rule is this. Only
                        a Republican going South is a carpet-bagger now. Democrats never are;
                        turncoats are not. So too with scalawags, who, we are happy to learn, are
                        not necessarily wholly given up to the bad. The vilest sinner of them all
                        may become a saint. Hunnicut, the Prince of Scalawags, is now a very Bayard
                        of gentlemen and the purest and prettiest of politicians. But Hunnicut, from
                        a dirty nigger worshipper has been transformed into a Democratic candidate
                        for Congress. Hence Hunnicut, is no longer a scalawag. The Richmond <emph
                            rend="italics">Whig</emph> is our authority for saying that his standing
                        in the Democratic party is as good as the best. How lovely are they whose
                        feet walk in Democratic paths. Aye, even though still rank with the odor
                        contracted by association with niggers.</p>

                    <p>The New York <emph rend="italics">World</emph> - Democratic is engaged in the
                        laudable but well nigh impossible task of reconciling the Caucassian
                        Democrats to the necessity of swallowing some nigger with their Democracy,
                        and advises them to disguise the dose, until they become strong enough to
                        take it "plain." The <orig reg="advice">advise</orig> sounds like the
                        compromise the temperance lecturer made with principle, who thought that if
                        his friends could introduce some gin into his glass "unbeknownst" to him,
                        whilst he was lecturing, he might drink it with good effect to himself, and
                        without prejudice to the cause. It says:</p>

                    <p>"In the election, on Tuesday, which resulted in the signal overthrow of the
                        Radical party in part which may expose them to the censure of such of their
                        brethren elsewhere as think in an abandonment, or, at least, a compromise,
                        of principle, to forego a vigorous opposition to the negro voting. The
                        Virginia Democrats formed an alliance, for this election, with a bolting
                        section of the Republicans. For the sake of accomplishing other objects,
                        deemed of more importance, they acquiesced in the bestowal of suffrage upon
                        the negroes, at a time when that very question as to be decided by the
                        adoption or rejection of a State Constitution proposing to confer the
                        privilege. The Democrats of Virginia might, had they so chosen, have acted
                        by themselves, and have recorded their indignant protest against the
                        participation of the negroes in politics of the State. Instead of this, they
                        judged it wiser to withdraw all further opposition to negro suffrage while
                        the question was yet undecided, and cooperate with the Conservative
                        Republicans in rescuing the State from the control of the Radicals. Whether
                        this action was wise and sagacious is a question which challenges the
                        consideration of Democrats in all parts of the country.</p>

                    <p>"We do not understand that the Democrats of Virginia intended to abandon any
                        principle, or to renounce any opinion, which they have heretofore held. They
                        think of negro suffrage as they have always thought - deeming it unwise,
                        inexpedient, and fraught with danger to the State. But, on the other hand,
                        they knew that, do what they would, they could not prevent it; and they
                        asked themselves what they would gain by a futile and impotent protest of
                        which the only effect would be to surrender the State to the control of the
                        Radicals and negroes. Without professing any change of opinion, they
                        consented to waive the question of negro suffrage, to accept a State
                        Constitution which made the negroes all voters, and nullify, at least for
                        the present the calamitous consequences of negro voting. The coalition <emph
                            rend="italics">has</emph> been successful, and the government of the
                        State is rescued from the Radicals and negroes and placed in Conservative
                        hands. Negro suffrage can work no great evil so long as the negroes and
                        their Radical confederates are outvoted. The important question is not, Who
                        vote ? but, Who are a majority? If the negroes and their allies were a
                        majority, they would control the Government of the State; but, the Democrats
                        and <emph rend="italics">their</emph> allies being a majority, <emph
                            rend="italics">they</emph> control the State, and the negroes have no
                        more effective power than if they did not vote at all.<lb/></p>

                    <p>This is very shrewd of the <emph rend="italics">World,</emph> which sees the
                        inevitable, but dare not brave the fury of its party by telling it plainly,
                        what is the truth, that Impartial Suffrage is a fixed fact. In time, all in
                        good time, the Democracy will learn it. It took the party a long time, and
                        gave it many melancholy visages, before it learned that emancipation had
                        been accomplished, but it believes it now. So it will believe this, at least
                        some years after it has been in active force.</p>

                    <p>The Harrisburg <emph rend="italics">Patriot,</emph> the leading Democratic
                        paper of Pennsylvania, has already made one step forward, and has withdrawn
                        all its objections to the XVth Amendment, urged on the ground that it gives
                        negroes the right of suffrage, but still keeps up a show of opposition,
                        because, as it says, it violates the reserved rights of the States.</p>

                    <p>Wouldn't it be as well to drop the whole thing at once?</p>
