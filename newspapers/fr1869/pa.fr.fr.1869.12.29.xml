                <transcript>

                    <p>At the moment of going to press last week the news was received that Edwin M.
                        Stanton had been confirmed by the Senate one of the Associate Justices of
                        the Supreme Court. His nomination by the President and his prompt
                        confirmation by the Senate called forth approving comments from all quarters
                        of the land, for the great War Minister was revered by every patriotic
                        heart. Three or four days after his confirmation, and before he had assumed
                        his place on the Supreme Bench he died. It is pleasant for his countrymen to
                        reflect, while they mourn the death of him who stood almost alone in the
                        sublimity of patriotism since the death of Abraham Lincoln, that his last
                        moments witnessed an act which demonstrated his high esteem in which he was
                        held.</p>

                    <p>Our country and government furnish unusual opportunities for calling forth
                        great and remarkable qualities. The rebellion was such an occasion, and
                        although Stanton was already famous in his profession, it was this which
                        tried his patriotism, and made known to his countrymen his intellectual and
                        moral greatness. If there was a man among the American people to whom the
                        term grandeur could be applied, that man was Stanton. His mental and moral
                        greatness were undisputed, and his patriotism was too pure and high for the
                        exercise of ambition. All the power in the man was used solely to one end,
                        and that end his country. He was the enemy of everything which stood in the
                        way of his country's triumph over its foes, whether it was ambition,
                        avarice, or imbecility in our own army, or armed men in the ranks of the
                        confederacy. His career as War Minister made him famous throughout the
                        civilized world, but it did not always cause him to be loved. He was stern
                        and relentless, and unhesitatingly trod down everything which stood in the
                        way of the success of our arms. Cromwell was not more stern and cruel than
                        he in saving a nation's life. There was nothing too costly to be given for
                        the triumph and salvation of his country. If it took men and means, men and
                        means must be given, and given lavishly. He took no delight in war, but if
                        war it must be that peace might be attained, by all means let it be war. All
                        this made him enemies of the great army of those who sought to use the
                        misfortunes of the government for their own wicked and selfish purposes. To
                        them he was a cold, cruel, hard and terrible enemy, but to the patriot,
                        honest and true, no matter what his position, he was fair, just and
                        courteous.</p>

                    <p>Justice may be sure, but it is not always prompt. It was at least slow in the
                        case of Secretary Stanton. His death will remind his countrymen of this. He
                        died at the age of fifty-five years, while yet a comparatively young man.
                        And though possessed of a wonderfully vigorous constitution, it is well
                        known that the awful responsibility, the cares and duties which his office
                        of War Minister imposed on him undermined his health, bowed his frame and
                        slowly but surely wrought his death. He gave his life for his country as
                        fully as ever did the soldier who fell fighting for her enemies. And he gave
                        it freely, without reluctance and without complaint. Four years of unmatched
                        thought, and labor, and responsibility he gave, and when all was done, and
                        the country smiled again in peace and joy, he retired to private life,
                        himself a wreck, his fortune wasted, and the necessity imperative to renew
                        his professional labor.</p>

                    <p>When the President invited him to accept the position of Associate Justice of
                        the Supreme Court of the United States, he gave expression to the nation's
                        wish; not that it would be a reward for his great services, but a
                        recognition of them, and an expression of gratitude. As soon as the
                        nomination was made the Senate, without waiting to submit the nomination to
                        the appropriate committee, as is the usual custom, confirmed it at once.</p>

                    <p>The deeds of Mr. Stanton cannot be stated here. He and they belong to his
                        country's history. As a War Minister he won a place among the highest, and
                        it was then that the greatness of his intellect and the purity of his
                        patriotism shone <orig reg="preeminent">pre-eminent</orig>. Many who won
                        splendid reputations in the war but for him would still be unknown. Now that
                        his eventful and useful life is ended, let us cherish his name in grateful
                        and loving recollection. Though his life on earth is done, his deeds can
                        never die so long as genuine patriotism has a votary, and the greatness of
                        human intellect and will an admirer.</p>

                    <p>We take the following extracts from the annual report of the Cumberland
                        Valley Railroad. President Watts, in his report to the stockholders says:</p>

                    <p>* * * The large increase in the manufacture of iron, and the consequent
                        demand for iron ore, has served to <orig reg="develop">develope</orig>
                        immense deposits of it in the vicinity of our road, not only along the base
                        of the South Mountain, but in the Valley, and in the North Mountain. Hence
                        there is being surveyed and located a road from Chambersburg to Mont Alto, a
                        distance of about 12 miles, which reaches a deposit of hematite ore, which
                        in quality is excellent, and in quantity apparently inexhaustible. This road
                        will doubtless be built during the coming year.</p>

                    <p>The South Penna. Iron and Railroad Company also contemplate to build, during
                        the coming year, a road to their mines near Loudon, in Franklin county,
                        starting from our road at a point about six miles above Chambersburg, near
                        Marion Station, and to erect two anthracite furnaces at their mines. It will
                        be the policy of our Company to encourage both these roads by all the
                        legitimate means in our power, for each will greatly contribute to increase
                        the business of our road, and promote the interest of the people of the
                        entire valley. The resolutions of the Board to extend their road from
                        Hagerstown to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, have been already communicated
                        to you, and since August last the work was let to a contractor upon terms
                        which were satisfactory, and he is now engaged in constructing it; the
                        grading and making the road-bed ready for the superstructure will cost about
                        $96,000, and the rails, ties, water stations, &amp;c. about $90,000, and
                        we expect to have the same completed and in a running order by the 1st of
                        July next. This extension has been located to terminate at Powell's Bend of
                        the Potomac river, with a branch to Williamsport, a distance of about two
                        miles. But since the location, a movement has been made by the people of
                        Virginia for a further extension of the road up through the valley of their
                        State, by the way of Martisnburg and Winchester, or by the way of
                        Charlestown and the Luray valley. Our action, therefore, as to the terminus
                        on the Potomac will be suspended a few weeks to meet this exigency, and
                        until they shall have determined the route for the further extension of the
                        road; for each of the proposed routes demands a different point of crossing
                        the Potomac river.</p>

                    <p>It has been the policy of the Board to put and keep our road in the highest
                        state of perfection, hence our expenditures in the past year have been
                        great; the entire track has been raised upon stone ballast, and there have
                        been put into it five hundred and thirty-five tons of new iron, twenty-five
                        thousand nine hundred and seventy-two oak cross ties, and two thousand three
                        hundred and eighteen chairs. There have been laid sixteen hundred feet of
                        new siding at Mechanicsburg, ten hundred and eighteen feet at Middlesex, two
                        thousand feet at the junction of the South Mountain railroad, five hundred
                        and ninety two feet at the Carlisle freight house, fourteen hundred and
                        fifty feet at Greason station, two hundred and thirty-one feet at Alterton,
                        four hundred and nineteen feet at Newville, and five hundred and
                        ninety-three feet at Greencastle, making a total of one and a half miles and
                        all of which cost six thousand one hundred and forty-one dollars and thirty
                        cents. Seventeen wooden bridges over wagon roads and water courses have been
                        taken out, and replaced with wrought iron girder bridges, which cost,
                        including masonry, four thousand four hundred and eighty-six dollars and
                        five cents. Six eight wheeled freight cars have also been built, six eight
                        wheeled and one four wheeled car purchased, which cost five thousand six
                        hundred and seventy-one dollars and eighty four cents; there has been
                        expended for a new locomotive engine, which will be finished in a few weeks,
                        seven thousand eight hundred and seven dollars and forty-three cents. Thus
                        it will be seen that the expenditures of the year, which do not properly
                        belong to working expenses, have been:</p>

                    <p>Anticipating a largely increased trade upon our road during the coming year,
                        we will require the freight engine which we proposed to purchase last year,
                        but did not, because of our heavy expenditures for other purposes. We will
                        also need some additional tools in the shop; eight hundred tons of new and
                        re-rolled iron and twenty-five thousand cross ties. At Shippensburg, an
                        important point of shipment of iron ore, additional siding is required, and
                        every facility should be furnished to cheapen the transportation of this
                        article, which will be a most important item of revenue.</p>

                    <p>If it be deemed expedient to change the point of the terminus of the
                        extension to the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, this work may be completed by
                        the 1st July next, when provision must be made for the increased trade which
                        it will produce. Reaching with our road that important point, we must be
                        prepared to carry anthracite coal for the supply of furnaces upon the
                        Potomac, lumber to that extensive agricultural region, and bring back the
                        semi-bituminous coal of the Cumberland mines to supply the engines and shops
                        in the East. For this work we must now get ready, and it will require at
                        least seventy-five new eight-wheeled freight cars. We propose to build one
                        new passenger car this year. It does not require much foresight to enable us
                        to predict that before many years, the business to be done on our road will
                        require a double track, and a prudent management suggests that this should
                        be attained out of the profits of the load, and that the work should be done
                        gradually without interfering with the usual dividends to stockholders. And
                        for this purpose it is suggested that we should now begin to double track
                        the road from Mechanicsburg to Whitehall, a distance of four and seven-eigth
                        miles, a point to which the road is already double tracked--from Bridgeport.
                        The expense of this would be:</p>

                    <p>This addition to our road would greatly facilitate even our present business;
                        but when we contemplate the increase which the South Mountain Iron Company
                        will in the next year bring to our road, such a facility for passing trains
                        seems to be indispensible. The coming year will doubtless find both the Mont
