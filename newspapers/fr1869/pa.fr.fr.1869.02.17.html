<b>Negro Suffrage</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor heartily endorses the movement towards black suffrage, either
                    through state legislatures or by Constitutional amendment.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The proposition to confer suffrage upon the black citizens of the republic,
                        is a measure of justice due to that recently enfranchised class and a most
                        natural result of our recent civil war. Whether this right be established as
                        Mr. Sumner and some others propose by legislative enactment or the safer and
                        surer plan of constitutional amendment, it is clear that until the decree
                        shall in some manner have gone forth, there remains for the American people
                        a period of trouble and unrest. Nor should this seem strange upon
                        contemplation of the recent past.</p>

                    <p>Exasperated at the efforts of an aristocracy to blight our entire domain with
                        the curse of human slavery, the people arose eight years ago and declared in
                        tones not to be misunderstood that its encroachments must cease. The masters
                        and their minions resented this determination by rebelling against lawful
                        authority. As long as the nation endeavored to assert its authority and at
                        the same time allow slavery to remain intact, the issue of the conflict was
                        doubtful; when it loosed those that were bound and allowed the oppressed to
                        go free, victory perched upon its standards.</p>

                    <p>Just as the Bull Run of 1861 pointed the way to the physical enfranchisement
                        of the blacks, so do the complications of the present indicate their
                        political disenthrallment. Until this be
                        accomplished, we can have no enduring repose. We could not make it different
                        if we would. The great ruler of men and nations will make us just whether we
                        will or not. He may not send down to us by some chosen messenger fresh from
                        His presence on the quaking mount the tablet of the law inscribed as he
                        would have it, but he will convulse us as with the thunders of Sinai, or
                        confuse us as at Babel, or overwhelm us as at the Red Sea, unless we execute
                        His purposes - and this the more because we have His revealed will and
                        therefore we know our duty.</p>

                    <p>All arguments advanced against this act of justice to the black citizen
                        disappear in the light of truth. It is said that it would be dangerous to
                        entrust the blacks with political power because of a different race that may
                        some day assume control of the whites? Andy Johnson's twaddle about a war of
                        races was received with a shout of derision and showed the popular
                        appreciation of such a suggestion. The Anglo Saxon race can never be
                        dominated over by another until it has so far degenerated as to fear
                        competition and refuse a chance in that race for political immunities that
                        has been the crowning glory of its civilization.</p>

                    <p>It is said that the black man has not earned his right to the enjoyment of
                        the elective franchise? Can any man remember his long years of patient,
                        unrequited toil, and deny him? When his master rebelled, he remained loyal.
                        When master and sons went to the insurgent camp, he remained on the
                        plantation. When upon disloyal territory the master's wife and daughters
                        spit upon the soldier of the republic, the salve along remained to welcome
                        him and salute the flag he bore. When the spy was sent forward by our
                        generals to search out information, he usually obtained it from the slave.
                        When the captured soldier escaped from his prison pen, it was the slave, not
                        the rebel, who fed and piloted him. When an opportunity was afforded the
                        slaves to enlist in our armies, they went, not in pairs or in dozens, but in
                        thousands, to be enrolled. When in the loyal States compulsory military
                        service was exacted, the blacks equally with the whites were drawn from the
                        wheel, and uncomplainingly went to perform the behests of a blind fate. And
                        shall it now be said after their physical disenthrallment - the only bar heretofore to their political
                        enfranchisement - that they are to remain outcasts in the land of their
                        nativity, pariahs in the country they helped to save? Nor will we be
                        relieved from our obligation on the score of gratitude by pointing to the
                        proclamation of emancipation and the amendment of the constitution
                        confirmatory of it. We freed the slaves because we had to do it. If we ever
                        owed them anything we owe it yet.</p>

                    <p>The arguments against negro suffrage drawn from prejudice and hate scarcely
                        deserve refutation. The man who hates his fellow will scarcely listen to
                        reason. He that would ostracize the black man because of his color, to be
                        consistent should at the same time express his belief in the monarchical
                        dogma of the divine right of kings. Where do even the native white class in
                        this country obtain their charter to govern? Clearly from their birthright,
                        participation in the government being a privilege conferred upon aliens
                        under the forms of law. Has not the negro this birthright? In what code,
                        civil, natural or revealed, do the whites obtain the right to hold the
                        blacks in perpetual political subserviency and debar them from the
                        franchises of American citizens? We are told that to adopt a constitutional
                        amendment against the wishes of a portion of the States, would be arbitrary
                        and in derogation of their sovereign rights. We thought the doctrine of the
                        sovereignty of the States had been pretty well exploded, but the enemies of
                        human progress do not hesitate to revive it when it suits their purposes. A
                        State cannot carry a letter, coin a penny or make a treaty - where then its
                        sovereignty?</p>

                    <p>But the movement to confer the suffrage upon the blacks has a practical
                        aspect in which it were well Republicans should view it. As in war the
                        negroes were their allies, so will they in peace. As they directed their
                        bullets in a way that told for the cause of their country, so will they
                        their ballots. To suppose that they will do differently is to suppose them
                        outside the pale of humanity. Their enfranchisement would bring an accession
                        of at least seventeen thousand voters to the Republicans in Pennsylvania
                        alone, enough to insure perpetual ascendancy to the party of progress. Is
                        not this a consideration worth being set over against any repugnance to the
                        measure arising out of an unworthy prejudice, albeit one that is difficult
                        to be divested? Has it ever occurred to apathetic or hesitating Republicans
                        who sometimes feel like striking hands with the wary Democrats in opposing
                        so just and beneficent a measure as negro suffrage, that our opponents play
                        upon our prejudices for the purpose of strengthening ourselves and enabling
                        themselves to regain ascendancy?</p>

<b>Our Common Schools and the Colored People</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An anonymous contributor reports an incident at the local schools wherein a
                    previously home-schooled black girl was entered into local public schools.
                    Because she was ahead of her classmates, she was put at the head of the class,
                    but because parents complained about her "trapping" their children, she was
                    placed at the bottom of the class again. The contributor strongly condemns this
                    and demands an explanation from the School Board.<br>

                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository.
                    </p>

                    <p>Our Common School System is justly the pride and boast of our noble old
                        Commonwealth. For many years its introduction and establishment as the law of the land was fought with all the bitterness
                        and prejudice that ignorance could develop. But at last Justice and Right triumphed, and the
                        people in the Constitution of 1838 decreed that "the Legislature should
                        provide by law for the establishment of schools throughout the State in such
                        manner that the poor may be taught gratis," and
                        the first article of the 23d section of the school law of 8th of May, 1854,
                        provides "that the Directors of every School District shall establish a
                        sufficient number of Common Schools for the education of every individual
                        above the age of five and under twenty-one years, in their respective
                        district, who may apply for admission and instruction, either in person, or
                        by parent, guardian or next friend." The 24th section of the same act also
                        provides that "the Directors of every school district shall be required to
                        establish separate schools for the tuition of Negro and
                            Mulatto children wherever such schools can be so located as to
                        accommodate twenty or more of such pupils - "and when such separate schools
                        are established and kept open four months in any year, the Directors shall not be compelled to admit such pupils into any
                            other school of the District."</p>

                    <p>The evident purpose of the people by the adoption of the Constitutional provision for general education, and the
                        Legislature by the passage of the law just referred to, was that the
                        children of the Commonwealth should be all
                        educated at the public cost, without regard to color or race; and when thrown together by the failure of the
                        Directors of any school district to provide separate
                            schools for the tuition of the race apart, that those thus thrown
                        together should have equal rights, privileges and
                            treatment. The law is no respecter of persons, the lives liberty
                        and privileges of all, are esteemed equally sacred before it. White and black are entitled to the same
                        opportunities for advancement, and the same incentive to study, and the like
                        opportunities to excel are open to all of every
                        class and condition, and he who attempts to restrict either, or to allow one
                        child those incentives and opportunities, and refuse them to another because
                        of race or color is
                        recreant to his duties as an officer of the law and is acting contrary to
                        both the spirit and the letter of the Constitution.</p>

                    <p>I have been induced to make this reference to the law, and these remarks upon
                        its purpose, because of a most flagrant
                        violation of its spirit, which I have been informed has recently occurred in
                        one of the school districts of our county, to the everlasting disgrace of
                        the school board of the district, if the statement
                            reported be true.</p>

                    <p>The account as given to me is thus: Joseph R. Winters, a former resident of
                        the Borough of Chambersburg - a mulatto in color, but an honest, industrious
                        and well behaved citizen and an ingenious mechanic, the possessor of some
                        property, which he has earned by his own industry - a short time ago removed
                        with his family to the St. Thomas School
                        District, where he purchased a farm of about seventy acres of land,
                        which he has greatly improved, and which is worth some $4,000, and is nearly
                        paid for. He has a young and interesting family of children, and being
                        himself a man of considerable education, made it his business to teach his children at home, and they therefore are
                        far in advance of many others who have had far greater opportunities to
                        acquire knowledge. After becoming settled in his new home, his children were
                        allowed, without objection, to enter the district schools, with the children
                        of his white neighbors - the Directors of the
                        district not having provided separate schools as authorized by the law.</p>

                    <p>One of these mulatto children, a girl some twelve
                        or thirteen years of age, as I am informed, and who had never before gone to
                        school, was entered as a pupil in one of the St. Thomas Districts Schools
                        for white children, and placed in classes appropriate to her acquirements.
                        The story runs that this poor child was so unfortunate as to excell all the companions of her
                        class in study, and in retaining what she did acquire, and committed the
                            unpardonable sin of "trapping" her white class-mates down and getting to the head of her classes, which position she was so
                        presumptuous as to retain.</p>

                    <p>The Democratic Directors of the district could
                        not stand this specimen of "nigger superiority and insolence," and as their
                        children could not eject their copper-colored associate from her fairly
                        earned pre-eminence by intellectual superiority, the reserved powers and
                        authority of the Board were called into requisition, according to my
                        information, and the teacher of the school was directed
                            to put the offender to the foot of her classes and now allow her to
                            wound the feelings of her associates by "trapping" any more.</p>

                    <p>Now, if this statement be true, those Directors, whoever they be (and we know
                        them not) have grossly exceeded their powers, and have committed an offence
                        against the law, and against public sentiment, that should cause them to
                        hang their heads in shame forever hereafter. I trust that the facts are not
                        as they have been represented to me. But if they are, I also trust that this
                        specimen of official misconduct will at once be reconsidered ere the law be
                        appealed to for redress of so gross an outrage upon the rights of one whom
                        the Father of us all has created of a different color from our own. I call
                        upon the School Directors of St. Thomas township to know if this story be
                        true or false. EQUAL RIGHTS.</p>

                    <p>We would call the attention of our readers to the communication from "Equal
                        Rights," which appears in another column. It presents a statement of facts
                        that make us ashamed of the prejudice and inhumanity of some of our
                        citizens. It is outrageous that six men, composing a school board of a
                        township, in this age of advancement, in Franklin county, six pure blooded,
                        noble, high-minded Anglo-Saxons, should persecute a poor little colored
                        girl, because, forsooth, she excels their own children in intellect. It will
                        call a blush to the cheek of every man who believes that God is the common
                        father of all, to know that in a free State, such a narrow minded and
                        degrading pride can have an existence. Joseph R. Winters is the peer of any
                        member of this board, and if he has devoted time and attention to the
                        education of his little ones, and these haughty men have neglected their
                        duty, it is but just that he should be encouraged in so doing. Just think of
                        it. Six School Directors, elected by the people of St. Thomas township, in
                        meeting assembled, solemnly discuss and debate how to prevent the
                        advancement of a little girl of about twelve years of age, who surpassed her
                        school mates in learning. How grave their proceedings must have been, how
                        eloquent their discussion. Nasby's letters no doubt were read and re-read.
                        They must have felt the vital importance of their action on this momentous
                        occasion, and certainly took into consideration the great influence it would
                        have upon the country at large. And then when they come to select the
                        individual who should bear to the father of the child, the intelligence that
                        they had resolved to publicly confess, that his daughter was the superior in
                        intellect of any of her companions, and that she must be suppressed and
                        humbled, how overwhelming must have been that ambassador's feelings. His
                        bearing no doubt was lofty and proud, and when his duty was discharged his
                        conscience (if he had any) must have whispered approvingly. Our
                        correspondent does not know these men, we do. We
                        have their names. We demand of them what is right and just, that they at once
                        reconsider their action in this manner, and give this child an equal
                        opportunity of promotion with others who attend the school.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Democratic Committee of Franklin county, met on Saturday last, and
                        elected J. Orr. Esq. as Senatorial and Col. B. F. Winger as Representative
                        delegates to the next State Convention. It will be remembered that a few
                        weeks since Messrs. M'Lellan, Sharpe, Brewer, Stenger and others, who are
                        regarded as the leaders of the Democracy of this county, wrote a letter to
                        Hon. Asa Packer, asking him to be a candidate for Governor. Mr. Packer
                        replied in substance that should the State Convention confer that honor on
                        him, he would not feel at liberty to decline. This was the first notice the
                        public had of this gentleman being a candidate. He doubtless supposed the
                        above named gentleman would have considerable influence in the furtherance
                        of his ambitious plans, and they no doubt imagined themselves as the
                        influential men of the next (?) administration. It was not supposed for a
                        moment that any humble Democrat whose name was not signed to the letter
                        would have the audacity to favor another candidate. The neighboring counties
                        having instructed for Gen. Cass his friends determined to rally for him.
                        They worked quietly and astonished the Packer men on the 14th inst., by
                        determining to send to the next State Convention two warm friends of Gen.
                        Cass. There was no little dissatisfaction at these proceedings, but Orr, and
                        Crisswell, of Cumberland county, were masters of the situation. Mr. Packer's
                        friends are in a rather ludicrous position, and don't know how to extricate
                        themselves. Mr. Packer will transfer the management of his wire pulling to
                        shrewder politicians, and Gen. Cass will hold in grateful remembrance
                        Messrs. M'Lellan, Brewer, Sharpe, and Stenger.</p>
