                    <p>To-DAY (Tuesday) closes the political campaign, and determines not only who
                        shall be Governor of Pennsylvania, who fill the vacancy in the Supreme
                        Court, who shall fill our Legislative and our County offices, but whether
                        the Commonwealth which sent three hundred and fifty thousand of her sons
                        forth to battle against slavery and oppression, and in favor of human
                        freedom will be true to herself and her glorious record. In view of the
                        gravity of this question, the triumph of any man as an individual sinks into
                        insignificance. The success of Geary or the election of Packer will
                        certainly gratify the self esteem of the individual who wins, but only as
                        the representative of principles can the election of either concern the body
                        of voters.</p>

                    <p>As yet, which of the candidates will be elected we do not care to predict,
                        but before the paper goes to press will try to furnish as full returns as
                        possible. If Geary be <orig reg="reelected">re-elected</orig> Governor, we
                        do not regard the result so much a proof of the strength of the man as that
                        of the fixed and determined adherence of the loyal voters of the State to
                        the progressive and liberal ideas of Republicanism, and opposition to the
                        exploded slave theories of the Democracy. On the part of the latter party
                        the contest has been waged without making a single step forward, as it has
                        done in many of the States, and that delapidated institution, the "nigger,"
                        has furnished food for all the small bore politicians and journalists in the
                        State.</p>

                    <p>With one exception the Democratic campaign was conducted without developing a
                        single live issue. The exception is worthy of note. The party boasted loudly
                        when Packer was nominated that his immense wealth should be employed to
                        secure his election. Whether or not he is elected the boast was not made
                        without his approval. Though acknowledging the weakness of their cause by
                        refusing to debate the grounds upon which they claimed the suffrage of the
                        people, they flooded the State from one extreme to the other, with Packer's
                        illgotten wealth; they strove to succeed by pandering to the cupidity, and
                        the need of the people. We earnestly hope and confidently believe that the
                        honest impulses of our voters will prompt them to spurn the bribe and reject
                        with scorn the miserable tools who bring them, but if they do not, the
                        Republicans can cherish the consolation that though defeated at the polls,
                        they have not befouled the proud and honorable record of their party. If
                        defeated they are not disgraced. If successful the honorable men in the
                        Democratic party must hang their heads in shame.</p>

                <summary>The paper asserts that the results of today's election will uphold or
                    besmirch Pennsylvania's record of loyalty and human freedom. The editors
                    criticize Democrats for appealing to racism as a campaign tactic.</summary>

                <summary>The Franklin County Fair closed last week and was generally pronounced a
                    failure. The farmers seemed to have little interest in exhibiting, citing the
                    low premiums. There were few agricultural implements, and small crowds examined
                    the building for fancy articles, including quilts, crochet work, etc. The one
                    are that drew great interest was the horse racing. "We found Presbyterians,
                    Methodists, Lutherans and members of all churches, and in some instances
                    ministers, enjoying these trials of speed as much as those who say 'hoss'
                    instead of horse." The editors suggest eliminating the races at future fairs in
                    order to keep the attention on the agricultural exhibitions.</summary>

                <summary>The regular meeting of the Franklin County Horticultural Society was held
                    on Tuesday. A number of persons were elected to membership. A committee was
                    formed to audit all claims against the society. Thanks were tendered to the
                    ladies for donations of cake and other goods for the fair and festival. The
                    society is seeking out larger meeting rooms, since it now numbers more than 60
                    members. It has also been decided to admit lady members.</summary>
