                <transcript>

                    <p>In the articles recently published in this paper in relation to the Poor
                        House, we said that "we wished to misstate nothing, and our remarks upon
                        this subject are not intended to subserve the interests of any particular
                        party. We are looking to the <emph rend="italic">public good</emph> alone.
                        Both political parties have had charge of the Poor House and farm, and under
                        both we believe it (the farm) has been a failure."</p>

                    <p>We desired particularly to call the attention of our taxpayers to the fact
                        that the expenses of the Poor House had been steadily increasing, year after
                        year--that the <emph rend="italic">farm</emph> had never <emph rend="italic"
                            >paid</emph>, as a farm--and that their best interests would, in our
                        opinion, be advanced by the sale of the greater part of the land attached to
                        the Poor House.</p>

                    <p>We well knew, as does everybody, that during much of the greater part of the
                        time to which we referred, our party had control of the Poor House. We knew
                        also that during <emph rend="italic">three</emph> of those years--viz:
                        1857-58-59, the <emph rend="italic">Democratic</emph> party had the majority
                        in the Board, and that under the management of <emph rend="italic"
                        >their</emph> Steward, Mr. William Shinafield, the cost of keeping the
                        paupers, had run up from $50.00 to $90.00 apiece, per year. But about <emph
                            rend="italic">that</emph> we said nothing, as we supposed all had been
                        fair and right.</p>

                    <p>We knew too, as does everybody else, that during the years of the war--and
                        particularly during the latter part of the war, and for most of the time
                        since, the prices of all kinds of articles necessary for life, as well as
                        the cost of labor, had advanced to nearly <emph rend="italic">three</emph>
                        times their cost when the war commenced. We therefore found no fault with
                        the expenses of those years, large as they were. But when we found that the
                        expenses of the institution, under the present <emph rend="italic"
                            >Democratic</emph> management, when the prices of everything have been
                        greatly reduced, and when there are no more persons supported than in former
                        years, were destined to exceed greatly those of the war times, then we
                        raised our voice in condemnation. We could see no reason for such an
                        increase of expenses, and we desired that the attention of the public should
                        be called to their <emph rend="italic">Sinking Fund</emph>.</p>

                    <p>We are glad that the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> has come to the rescue
                        of its party friends. We were afraid that it would not have the courage to
                        speak out. For ourselves, we do not fear any evil that our party will suffer
                        by what we have said. We court investigation. If our party friends have been
                        acting the rascal, at the Poor House or elsewhere, let the people know it,
                        and if proved upon them, let the culprits bear the consequences. So too, if
                        it be found that the <emph rend="italic">Spirit's</emph> friends have been
                        doing that which they should not have done, let the people know it also, and
                        let them shoulder the responsibility.</p>

                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> is in error when it supposes that our
                        articles were written at the suggestion, or for the gratification of Mr.
                        David Piper. He knew nothing of them until he saw them in print. If he
                        yearns after the "flesh pots" of the Poor House, we know it not. That he
                        managed matters, whilst Steward, in an economical and creditable way, cannot
                        be denied. He went to the Poor House on the 1st of April, 1868, and left the
                        1st of April, 1869. During these twelve months the Commissioners paid the
                        Directors $12,975, up to and including <emph rend="italic">April</emph>,
                        1869, and they received $552.84 through their Attorney, from what sources we
                        know not. These sums made a total of $13,527.84. With this money, and the
                        proceeds of the land, Mr. Piper carried on the institution for his year, and
                            <emph rend="italic">left no debts that were not paid out of this
                        money</emph>.</p>

                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> says that<lb/> "The house, when the
                        present Steward, Mr. Brandt, took possession, was stripped of everything in
                        the way of provisions and household and kitchen furniture and had to be
                        supplied."</p>

                    <p>Are we to understand from this that the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>
                        charges Mr. Piper with having carried away with him any of the "provisions,
                        and household and kitchen furniture" belonging to the county? We can put no
                        other construction upon the language used--unless indeed, the <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph> was speaking of a "Pickwickian sense"--or
                            <emph rend="italic">knew itself to be lying</emph>. Verily Davy Piper
                        must be an adroit thief to "clear out" those great houses so bare--and not
                        even the <emph rend="italic">paupers</emph> know it, for they never
                        complained of a want of <orig reg="anything">any thing</orig>. But how
                        completely the <emph rend="italic">truth</emph> will put at rest this <emph
                            rend="italic">Democratic lie</emph>. All the "household furniture" that
                        the county owned, in the Steward's part of the Poor House, was a cooking
                        stove and apparatus, two beds, and dishes and knives and forks for sixteen
                        persons, and they were left there by Mr. Piper, and are there yet. Each
                        Steward furnishes, of his own, whatever other household articles he may need
                        for his family, and takes them away when he leaves.</p>

                    <p>That things were not so bad as the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> would
                        have the people believe, even in the "Provision and Grocery line," is
                        evidenced by the fact that the following articles, among others, were <emph
                            rend="italic">left</emph> at the Poor House, by Mr. Piper, when he
                        removed, on the first of April last, <emph rend="italic">as can be
                        proven</emph>, viz: 32 hams, 46 shoulders, 43 sides, 153 pounds dried beef,
                        2 hogsheads of salt beef, 6 cans lard, 1 barrel tallow, 60 pounds candles, 3
                        barrels soft soap, 1 1/2 barrels pickels, 200 bushels potatoes, 250 bushels
                        corn, 90 heads cabbage, 4 barrels flour, (in the mill), turnips, onions,
                        &amp;c.</p>

                    <p>With such a supply even Mr. Brandt might get along for a short time. But
                        likely the "old things" were not good enough for their present "dainty"
                        Steward, and hence <emph rend="italic">new</emph> furniture and more
                        palatable provisions had to be procured at the <emph rend="italic">public
                            cost</emph>.</p>

                    <p>But when the editor of the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> was pitching in
                        for his <emph rend="italic">Democratic</emph> friends at the Poor House, why
                        did he not clear up the "hay transaction" to which he referred in our former
                        article? Why was he totally silent on that subject? The inference is clear.
                        He could not deny it. There had been <emph rend="italic">hay</emph> removed
                        from the Poor House, and that <emph rend="italic">at night</emph>, too. Why
                        haul it <emph rend="italic">at night</emph> if it was an <emph rend="italic"
                            >honest</emph> transaction?</p>

                    <p>Nor did the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> say any thing about those <emph
                            rend="italic">two</emph> hired men at $20.00 per month and found. <emph
                            rend="italic">That</emph>, then, is <emph rend="italic">true</emph>
                        also, and where will we find another farmer giving such wages? The <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph> says, however, that<lb/> "The farm had gone
                        down--the fences dilapidated--the stock inefficient and worthless, and the
                        main building and outhouses had to undergo extensive repairs. Everything
                        about the premises had been allowed to run to destruction--it was
                        emphatically a <emph rend="italic">poor house</emph>."</p>

                    <p>If this be true, it <emph rend="italic">proves</emph> the truth of what we
                        have already said about the propriety and necessity of selling the greater
                        part of the land. But we are assured that it is not <emph rend="italic"
                        >all</emph> true. Some repairs were needed to the buildings, and fences; but
                        the rails and posts for those fences had been bought, hauled and paid for
                        before Mr. Brandt became Steward. The expenditures for these purposes, by
                        the present Democratic management, the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>
                        says were:</p>

                    <p>According to the last published report of the Directors, there were on hand,
                        on the 1st of January, 1867, 7 horses, 13 cows, 8 young cattle, 25 stock
                        hogs and 2 sows. The necessity for more <emph rend="italic">cattle</emph> or
                        hogs we cannot see, unless it might be to furnish stock with which to trade
                        with neighbors of <emph rend="italic">Democratic</emph> proclivites for pigs
                        of an inferior quality. Nor can we see why the large sum of $997.50 should
                        have been expended since April last for <emph rend="italic">horses</emph>,
                        considering the fact that there were seven on hand when the present Steward
                        moved to the Poor House. It is true, one of these, a good horse, worth $200,
                        had to be killed the day after Mr. Brandt took possession, from injuries
                        received through mismanagement in putting him near a vicious horse, at a
                        time when the new Steward and his friends were dancing and frolicking in
                        celebration of his entry into his new position.</p>

                    <p>Two other horses, worth $150, were sold by one of the Directors for $117.50,
                        and yet two others--one the best horse on the farm, and worth fully
                        $200--was sold by Mr. Brandt, without any authority, as we are informed, for
                        $96.50. Another worth $150 was sold in the same way, but the price obtained
                        we have not learned.</p>

                        expenditures, give the <emph rend="italic">whole</emph> truth? Why say that
                        $997.50 were expended for horses, when he knew that $1,247 had been paid out
                        for that purpose? <emph rend="italic">Five</emph> new horses were bought,
                        and one was traded for. Two of these were furnished by Mr. Gillan, one of
                        the Directors, at $225 each. For another $250 were paid, for a fourth $225
                        were paid, for a fifth $222, and $100 boot money was paid on the trade for
                        the sixth. The present Steward is a <emph rend="italic">fancy</emph> man. He
                        will have nothing but <emph rend="italic">blacks</emph> in his teams. We did
                        not know that he was so strongly attached to that <emph rend="italic"
                        >color</emph> as appears to be. Now we are informed that the horses on hand
                        when the Democracy got control of the institution were amply good for all
                        farming purposes, and if such be the case, we think the expenditure of near
                        $1,247 for new ones was wholly unjustifiable, and shows a case of
                        mismanagement and waste of the public funds that the people should know of.
                        Surely the Republican party are not to be charged with these transactions,
                        all of which took place since they lost control of affairs at the Poor
                        House.</p>

                    <p>There are other things which we might animadvert upon--such as the "Parties,
                        Suppers and Dancing" held at the Poor House, under the present management,
                        the sale of potatoes, &amp;c.--but we think a mere mention of them will
                        perhaps be sufficient to secure their abolition in the future.</p>

                    <p>We think it should, and for two good reasons, if not more. It has fulfilled
                        all of its promises, and has ever striven for, as it has largely advanced,
                        the best interests of the people.</p>

                    <p>It assumed power in March, 1861, amidst the flames and turmoil of a great
                        Democratic civil war. it resolved to save the land from anarchy and division
                        and ultimate ruin. It waged a Titanic contest of four years duration by sea
                        and land, and came out the victor with not only a saved, but a redeemed and
                        disenthralled land. Wiping out <orig reg="forever">for ever</orig> the
                        blistering stain and reproach of human slavery, it freed four millions of
                        bondsmen, and emancipated ten millions more of poor white men from the rule
                        of the same masters. It would, in 1865, have continued its beneficent course
                        and conferred upon the country the still greater blessings of peaceful
                        restoration to law and order, it would at once have started the nation in an
                        upward and onward line of material progress which would, before <orig
                            reg="today">to-day</orig>, have obliterated nearly every evidence of the
                        terrible war and its desolations, and given earnest of our speedy attaining
                        the leadership of nations. That it did not fully compass this end, is fairly
                        to be ascribed to but a single fact--the substitution of Andrew Johnson and
                        Abraham Lincoln, and the shameful conduct of Johnson. How this wretched man
                        perverted his power to evil, deeming the interests of a disloyal party of
                        greater moment than those of a suffering country, putting Democracy before
                        the nation--we need not recount. He was able to impede, despite the best
                        efforts of the people, though he failed to wholly turn. In 1869 we got rid
                        of him, and the Republican party for the first time in its history obtained
                        an opportunity to enforce its policy, unengrossed by a war or obstructed by
                        a President.</p>

                    <p>Since March last, under the leadership of Grant, and following the line
                        marked out by a loyal Congress, the Republican party has enforced its will.
                        What has it done? It has filled full to the brim the measure of its
                        promises. It has rapidly and effectively pacified the greater portion of the
                        South, and is about to bring the remainder into harmonious accord with the
                        Government and the Union. Murder no longer is rife in the land; persecution
                        for opinion's sake, keener than any that ever disgraced religious annals, no
                        longer renders immigration impossible; distrust between employer and
                        employed, between labor and capital no longer exists; the laboring thousands
                        no longer despair of bread and a home; the land owner no longer surveys his
                        desolate acres with a heavy eye; but activity, peace, industry, progress,
                        thrift and comfort have come to the land, making it to bloom and to whiten
                        with the richest and most valuable of crops, and to resound with the hum and
                        the din of busy, satisfied, labor, and to become thronged with the inrush of
                        an eager and diligent population. All this has been done for the South in
                        six short months of unchecked Republican rule. Let every grumbler be pointed
                        to the peaceful, settled South of the day, let him be asked to contrast it
                        with the murderous section he knows it was last year; rent with strife,
                        drenched with blood, repellant of immigration, of capital, poverty-stricken
                        and bordering on famine, and let him be asked if the marvellous change thus
                        wrought, in a single summer, is not crown enough to adorn the party which
                        has made it, and praise-worthy enough to entitle the party to the lasting
                        confidence of the American people? If there was nothing else we would be
                        content to abide the people's verdict on this showing. But, as it promised
                        to pacify the South, so also, the Republican party promised, last year, to
                        pay the debt if continued in power. What has it done? With the rarest of
                        financial prudence, it has carried on this work also. Discarding fine-spun
                        theories, impracticable because unfounded on aught save fancies, the
                        Republicans have sought to collect the revenues and to pay them out again in
                        discharge of the debt. That is all there is in the matter it is true--all
                        that there is to do. But Andrew Johnson and his ministers did neither. They
                        did not collect the revenues nor attempt it. They wasted a part on their
                        favorites, permitting them to batten, like kites, on the spoil; they let
                        part go uncollected that want and need and distress might go from the
                        government to the people, and that discontent might be bred, and the
                        Republicans be overthrown at the ballot-box; they wilfully refused to obey
                        the laws and set apart any sum for the payment of the debt for the same and
                        like reasons.</p>

                    <p>That the Republicans have sought to faithfully collect the revenues is simply
                        the discharge of their duty it may be said: true, but they have done it and
                        a Democratic President and his corrupt Cabinet did not! Relatively, there is
                        no room for praise. They have done more, they have paid the debt. In five
                        months forty-nine millions of debt have been cancelled. September will
                        sponge out ten millions more, and New Year will see the last of one hundred
                        millions dissolving to ashes in Secretary Boutwell's furnace fires.</p>

                    <p>Andrew Johnson was bound by a law of the land--passed before he was ever
                        unhappily dreamed of for a President, and which he swore to see executed
                        when he became Executive--to devote, yearly, a large sum to the discharge of
                        this debt: he was allowed no discretion by the termination of the law. For
                        three years he wilfully violated as well the law of his coronation oath. His
                        example here was a beacon, as it is everywhere, to avoid the dangers and
                        shame which lie hidden beneath. A Republican Secretary, with the sanction
                        and advice of a Republican President, has obeyed the law and has sacredly
                        devoted the means which he has laboriously collected to carrying out its
                        purposes. The result is that the debt is diminishing and the promise of the
                        party, in this regard, is redeemed.</p>

                    <p>Now these two were the chief of the promises made in the last campaign, when
                        the voters of the North were urged to cling to the standard of the party
                        which had led them to a victory on the field. Their redemption, bright,
                        full, complete, wonderful if the brief period of uncontrolled sway may be
                        remembered, entitles the party who made and have kept them to the heartiest
                        thanks of the people they have served so well. Let every man who is glad to
                        see a pacified and united South, and who rejoices to see our debt in process
                        of speedy and sure extinguishment, and who believes that the faithful
                        servant is entitled to his reward, render the only reward he can give the
                        servant by voting for the party whose conduct he applauds. He will thus best
                        benefit himself.</p>

                <summary>The paper urges a full turnout of Republicans for the meeting at the Court
                    House on Friday. "Maj. Calhoun, who is to address the meeting, was a gallant
                    officer in the Union Army during the war, and lost a limb while fighting for his
                    country. He also endured the horrid treatment received by union soldiers in
                    rebel prisons, and knows from experience what it cost to save this union." Mr.
                    Vanderslice is also highly recommended.</summary>
