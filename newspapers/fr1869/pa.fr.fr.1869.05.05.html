<b>Courage, Sisters</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article reports on and subtly mocks a speech by a female Dr. Lydia,
                    who, after reading that Grant had refused to see a woman unless she was wearing
                    a full dress, gave a speech in Washington arguing that women should be able to
                    wear pantaloons and blouses. This attribution to Grant turns out to be false,
                    however. The Repository compares the idea of a woman
                    in pantaloons and blouses to a donkey in a lion's skin - as soon as the donkey
                    opens its mouth the illusion is broken. Indeed, the author continually portrays
                    women in such an outfit as pretending to be men.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>There is a good time coming for you and all your sex. You shall be
                        emancipated from the thraldom of petticoats, right speedily. Crinoline and
                        trailing skirts and huge bustles shall no longer weigh and drag you to the
                        earth. You shall disport yourselves in pantaloons and blouses. You shall
                        climb fences, leap ditches, skim the plains and scale mountains, if so be
                        that you want to do any of these things; aye, you shall mount the panting
                        steed, his nostrils breathing fire, his limbs trembling with impatient
                        desire to fly over the ground, and ride him as does the tawny spouse of
                        Hole-in-the-Day, or Little Wolf, because you shall wear pantaloons and
                        blouses. So says the great National Dress Reform and Equal Rights
                        Association, which held a meeting in Union League Hall, in Washington City,
                        a few days ago.</p>

                    <p>But who is to accomplish this astonishing reformation ? and by what magic
                        will volumnous and expansive skirts contract to the narrow dimensions of
                        pantaloons, and the close-fitting bodice expand to a loose and
                        easily-fitting blouse?</p>

                    <p>We answer, two Doctresses, whose warrant of sincerity, to use the language of
                        one of them, is the fact that they have worked their way to the full
                        fruition of their ideas in dress, and whose warrant of success is the fact
                        that they have dares to assail the conqueror of the rebellion, the
                        impregnable occupant of the White House himself, Doctress Mary Walker, of
                        Washington, and Doctress Lydia Sayre Hasbrouck, of Syracuse, N.Y.</p>

                    <p>The indignant Doctress Lydia, at her quiet home in New York, had noticed in a
                        newspaper that her worthy associate, Doctress Mary, had been honored with a
                        message by President Grant, "that he would receive her when she came dressed
                        in garments suitable to her sex." But for this offensive paragraph Doctress
                        Lydia would not have been present at the petticoat-a-the National Dress
                        Reform Convention, and President Grant would have escaped this most terrible
                        hackling. But that determined her. She came to Washington, and in the very
                        atmosphere of the White House, shook her fist and wagged her tongue at the
                        high and mighty representative of all the pantaloons and coat wearing
                        citizens of these United States. Gen. Grant, she said, aspires to fashion
                        woman's dress as well as to appoint the office
                            holders of the land. He should have a cabinet member to determine
                        the length of skirt that woman should wear to be respectable; and then she
                        called him a Grand Mogul, which was very hard on Grant, indeed, and made her
                        audience of boys shout "Go it, old gal, go it." And then she did "go it,"
                        and told them how that she was that person, spoken of in the New York Tribune, who had first nominated the Grant Mogul
                        for the Presidency, and that this fact should have been recognized in the
                        organization of the new cabinet. Properly under way, now, the eloquent
                        Medical Doctress told the audience how "we sneer at the idea, that the women
                        of America cannot appear before the crowned heads of Europe without donning
                        the trappings of court, but here we find our republican President, but
                        lately a hauler of logs and a tanner of skins, with his few weeks of
                        Presidential honors, reported as dictating court suits to women." It wasn't
                        quite the fair thing to drag those Missouri logs, and parade those Illinois
                        calf-skins before the funny boys, and neglect to say that Grant's last
                        tanning contract had been more successful than the first, and that he had
                        tanned some of the finest stock in the South; but it was all the same to
                        them, and they hurrahed for the tanner lustily and long. But Doctress Mary
                        Walker, who had been starved and imprisoned in Libby, had been snubbed by
                        the President, even while he was nominating prominent rebel officers to
                        lucrative official positions, and that was not to be borne. She would say
                        that the President was recognizing personal favors in making these
                        nominations, because he could not have reached the Presidency but for this
                        rebellion, and that he showed his appreciation of the deeds of the leaders
                        of the "lost cause" "by feeding them on the richest pap in the Presidential
                        nursery." We do think that women who wear pantaloons and blouses should be
                        careful not to use figures and illustrations drawn from the nursery. It
                        shows that the illusion is not perfect, that the emancipation is not
                        complete. It reminds one of the fable of the donkey in the lion's skin. They
                        no sooner open their mouth than the fraud is discovered. Then that vehement
                        assault upon the President's favorite vanity, his cigar, was wholly
                        unbecoming pantaloons and blouses. Who ever heard of the legitimate
                        occupants of pantaloons and blouses cry out against "the tobacco poluted atmosphere that surrounds the inhabitant
                        of the White House?" Why no one ever did, of course. But Mrs. Dr. Hasbrouck
                        did, and therein she did a very unmanly act, and subjected herself to the
                        ridicule of a very large and respectable part of the human family, whom she
                        was unsuccessfully attempting to imitate.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Dr. Walker, we cannot help thinking a little ungenerously, slightly
                        damaged the speech, which the good Doctress had come all the way from New
                        York to deliver, by getting up and announcing that she felt bound in justice
                        to President Grant to state that the incident related by her had never
                        occurred. President Grant's reputation for gallantry, we are glad to say,
                        still stands as high as that for courage, which is unimpeachable, and we
                        feel sure, in spite of his fondness for cigars, and horses too, he would not
                        damage it by discourtesy to any woman, especially to such an excellent woman
                        as Mrs. Dr. Walker, even though she affects pantaloons and blouses.</p>

<b>Virginia Conservative Convention</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository reports on a recent convention
                    of conservatives in Virginia. At the convention 'negro suffrage' was left open
                    to voters to decide, while the group recommended working against the
                    constitutional amendments.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The anti-deluvians of Virginia, the conservatives, met in State Convention at
                        Richmond on the 28th, and took a look at things. The Committee on Business,
                        a pretty comprehensive committee, read a report; accepting the resignations
                        of the conservative candidates of 1867, and complimenting them for their
                        zeal in the cause, and urging conservative voters to consolidate to defeat
                        the obnoxious provisions of the constitution. The convention declined to
                        make any recommendation to voters regarding negro suffrage. The report was
                        signed by Oulds, Baldwin, Edwards, M'Mullen, Sutherlin, Cameron, Moseby and
                        others.</p>

                    <p>Oulds made a speech in favor of the report explaining that it was a
                        compromise of different opinions, and left conservative voters free to vote
                        for or against negro suffrage, against the constitution as a whole, or for
                        it as expurgated.</p>

                    <p>A minority report signed by three of the committee was also read, advocating
                        such startling innovations as the control of the State by the white race,
                        reasserting the principles of the last conservative convention, and
                        declaring that this convention has no right to abandon the same. It also
                        declared the law of congress, requiring the adoption of the fifteenth
                        amendment by Virginia as a condition of its admission into the Union to be
                        unconstitutional. It preferred the military rule of a white man to an
                        irresponsible government by negroes, and calls on the white people of the
                        State to vote down the constitution.</p>

                    <p>A resolution was adopted to admit only representatives of the conservative
                        press of the State.</p>

                    <p>There is nothing of consequence in the convention that we can see, unless it
                        be the venerable antiquity of the concern. There used to be old, very old
                        fellows in the North who occasionally entertained themselves by getting
                        together and talking very much in the same way, but that was before the war.
                        They don't do it any more, and even Virginia Conservatism, though it follows
                        a great way off, nevertheless follows. Why this convention is willing to
                        allow voters to vote for or against negro suffrage just as they may see fit.
                        Of course they are following. It need not be wondered at, if, in the course
                        of two or three hundred years, they admit representatives of the press to
                        witness their deliberations, no matter what their political sentiments. The
                        world does move. Galileo was right.</p>
