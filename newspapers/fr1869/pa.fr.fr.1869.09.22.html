<b>Our County Poor House</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article is part of the Repository's
                    ongoing expose on the county poor house. The editors include statistics on the
                    production of the public farm for the past decade.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>We stated in our last issue that we believed our Poor House farm to be a failure financially, and that we
                        thought the best interests of our people would be subserved by selling all
                        of the land except perhaps forty or fifty acres immediately around the
                        buildings, and that the land thus retained could be worked almost entirely
                        by the labor of the inmates of the institution, and would be amply
                        sufficient for all their wants, thus saving a large sum of money each year.
                        Reflection and an examination of the results of the operations of past years
                        have confirmed us in the truth of our opinions. We say it without fear of
                        contradiction, that no one of our prudent, practical farmers, would be
                        satisfied if he knew that his farm, of equal cost and value with the Poor
                        House farm, were not producing a better yield than has been gotten from the
                        latter. He would quit farming at once--sell off his land, and put his money
                        where it would yield him a larger profit.</p>

                    <p>We wish to misstate nothing, and our remarks upon this subject, are not
                        intended to subserve the interests of any particular party. We are looking
                        to the public good alone. Both political parties
                        have had charge of the Poor House and farm, and under both we believe it has
                        been a failure. To show that such has been the case, we give the principal
                        products of the farm each year, commencing with 1855, but leaving out of
                        consideration the pork, beef, veal, &amp;c., raised and killed, and the
                        small vegetables produced--as they could as well be raised upon 50 as upon
                        220 acres of land.</p>

                    <p>Any one of you, fellow citizens, can estimate the value of these products,
                        year by year, and if you do, we feel satisfied that you will agree with us,
                        that our public farm has not been doing as well
                        as it might. The production during Mr. Chariton's time as Steward was the
                        best for the last fourteen years, but even that was not near what it should
                        have been, and it has since fallen off nearly one-half. And when the cost of producing
                        these results is considered, we think you will agree with us that our county
                        had better stop farming on so expensive a scale, as it will be much cheaper
                        to purchase for cash every thing that may be wanted at the Poor House, that
                        cannot be raised upon forty or fifty acres of land.</p>

                    <p>There are several provisions in the Act of Assembly incorporating our Poor
                        House which have been so long unobserved and neglected that we suppose their
                        very existence is unknown generally. One of them makes it the duty of the
                        Directors, on or before the first of November of each year, to furnish to
                        the County Commissioners a statement of the probable expense of the Poor
                        House for the next year, which amount the Commissioners are directed to
                        assess and collect for the use of the Poor House. Heretofore the Directors
                        have been supplied out of the County Treasury just as they called for money,
                        and they appear to have acted as if they had a right to whatever sum they
                        might call for. In truth they are not now
                        entitled by law to any money, as none has been assessed or collected for
                        their use; and we think it would be wise to require this statement from them
                        in the future and then hold them to their own estimate. If they spent all
                        their money before the year is out let them do without for the balance of
                        the year. This would insure economy, because the Directors would know that
                        the public would be made acquainted with their estimate, and they would
                        further know that no more money could be spent by them than was assessed and
                        collected for their use.</p>

                    <p>The same law requires the Directors, at least once in every year, to lay
                        before the Court of Quarter Sessions and Grand Jury "a list of the number,
                        ages, and sexes of the persons maintained and
                            employed in the said Poor House, or supported
                        or assisted by them elsewhere, and of the children bound out to them to
                        apprenticeship, with the names of the masters or mistresses, and their
                        trade, occupation or calling." Neither of these provisions have ever been
                        observed, and yet the information provided for in them would be of great
                        interest to the public. If furnished, the greater part of it would of course
                        be published by the newspapers of the county, and the people could thus
                        learn whether too many persons were employed
                        about their Poor House, and whether persons were receiving out-door aid who
                        should not get it--and they would take measures to correct the evil if any
                        existed.</p>

                    <p>Another provision of the law--and a most important one too--is that which
                        provides for the appointment by the Court of Quarter Sessions, of visitors to examine the books and accounts of the
                        Poor House--and all accounts of sales and purchases made by, or under authority of the
                        Directors--and of the monies received and expended by them. This provision, if ever it was
                        carried into practice, has been abandoned for many years. And yet how
                        important it is. We know that the Grand Jury visit the Poor House every
                        three months, and make a report; but their visits are always made at the
                        heels of the Court, when the jury are tired out and want to get home, and
                        are therefore of no real benefit because the jurors have neither the time
                        nor inclination to look into the workings of the institution as they should.
                        The time of their visit is always known before
                        hand, and the "best face" is put upon both building and paupers, in order
                        that no unfavorable impressions or reports may be made.</p>

                    <p>But if visitors were appointed Court after Court,
                        to go to the Poor House, inspect the books, examine all the purchases and sales
                        made, and report thereon--as well as upon the condition of the house and
                        paupers--the number of employees who ought to be kept, &amp;c.,
                        &amp;c.--such visitors would most likely go there when they would not be
                        expected, and would consequently see the institution in its "every day"
                        dress--and be able to report more understandingly than are those the times
                        of whose coming are known beforehand. Besides such visitors would have time to inspect all the books, and the purchases
                        and sales; and they would be able to determine what favoritism was
                        used--whether useless or too high priced articles were purchased--whether
                        too many hired hands were employed, and whether the wages paid them were too
                        great--and in short what mismanagement, if any, was going on about the
                        institution, and what reforms should be made. Such visits are provided for
                        by the law creating the Poor House, and any unprejudiced man can see at a
                        glance that they could not fail of being of vast benefit to our burdened tax
                        payers, however unsatisfactory, or inquisitorial they might appear to the
                        Directors, Steward, or other interested parties.</p>

                    <p>There is one other matter which attracted our attention whilst examining the
                        Poor House accounts as published, for the years referred to in the first
                        part of this article, and that is the unsatisfactory condition of the debit side of those accounts, in not setting out
                        specially the sources from which the various sums
                        of money are received. Often articles are sold by the Steward, we are
                        informed, and others are brought with the money thus received, without the
                        money going into the Treasurer's hands at all. That in our opinion, is all
                        wrong. All monies received should be paid to the Treasurer of the House, and
                        drawn out again on orders from the Directors. Thus an account of them would appear on the books of the house and the
                        books of the Treasurer, and the one would be a check upon the other, and all
                        grounds for animadversion and ill-natured suspicions and remarks would be
                        removed.</p>

                    <p>Taxpayers of Franklin county, we call upon you to reflect upon what we have
                        written upon this subject, and if your views of it correspond with ours, see
                        to it that the LAW is enforced in every respect. This institution is
                        becoming a greater burden to you year after year. It now costs you nearly
                        one-fifth as much as your whole county expenses, and we feel convinced if
                        you take the matter in hand and have greater part of the land sold, and the
                        other expenses reduced, you can accomplish reforms that will be greatly to
                        your ease and benefit.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Packer is a great man. If there had been any doubt of it before, that doubt
                        is now dissipated. He has been interviewed by the New York Sun correspondent. Whenever a man is done by a great New York daily his greatness is a
                        settled fact. Few men can boast of it, but the happy few are ever after
                        indisputably great. Chase, on a time, was interviewed, so was Moses Johnson, so was Ben Butler, and a few others,
                        and now Packer. Most men say something when interviewed. Our Moses always
                        did. It wasn't new nor strange, but it was something. The Sun thinks in the matter of saying something
                        Pennsylvania's great man isn't a success, and we think that those who read
                        the report will endorse the Sun. Perhaps he has
                        no opinions, or if he has he very unskillfully evaded expressing them, for
                        to the reader the report looks exactly like the conversation of a man who
                        has no fixed convictions upon the subject he is discussing. Indeed he
                        prefaces his interview with a plea of ignorance of political subjects
                        generally, and if he makes his election as good as he has made his plea he
                        will be more than satisfied. Packer expresses it as his idea that the
                        leading issue in the present campaign is the financial policy of the State,
                        and thinks that the financial policy of the Republican State administration
                        has not tended to strengthen the credit of the State as it might have done.
                        Pressed by the reporter he thinks of two other features, which would be
                        improved by his election. They are the indiscriminate use of the pardoning
                        power and class legislation. One may be allowed to differ from him with
                        reason as to the success of the State financially under Republican rule,
                        when he compares it with that of other Democratic Governors. The loose
                        exercise of the pardoning power and special legislation are as much
                        deprecated by Republicans as by Democrats, and under Geary's administration
                        fewer pardons were granted, and more special legislation was vetoed, than
                        under any Democratic Governor in thirty years.</p>

                    <p>When asked whether the vast railroads of the State did not create a powerful
                        monopoly, and whether this monopoly did not exert an undue influence upon
                        the legislation of the State, Packer, who is a railroad king himself, talked
                        about the State fostering and encouraging the construction and completion of
                        new lines; about as pertinent to the question as if he had given his views
                        on the Fifteenth Amendment. He tells enough to satisfy us that the Democrat
                        who expects him to oppose monopolies, the means by which he made his great
                        wealth, is a fool now, and will admit his folly hereafter if Packer should
                        be elected. On the question of protection of State industry, or a tariff, he
                        had no opinion, telling the reporter that he might believe what he pleased.
                        Evidently he regards it a critical question for a candidate to handle. How
                        the people must despise a man who is afraid to express his views lest he
                        might loose a vote, especially on a subject so vital to Pennsylvania
                        industry. In trying how not to say anything to the reporters question as to
                        whether the Fifteenth Amendmet was in issue in the State contest, he
                        intimated that the Southern States had adopted the Amendment under coercion,
                        whereupon he was asked if he believed that the negroes of those States
                        should be deprived of the ballot. His answer to this is such a clear case of
                        coming out of the same hole at which he went in, and of going in at the
                        wrong hole, that we give it in his own words:</p>

                    <p>Reporter.--The Southern States having adopted this
                        Amendment, as you intimate, under coercion, ought the negroes in those
                        States to be deprived of the ballot?</p>

                    <p>Judge Packer.--The question of suffrage, as I have
                        said, belongs to the people of the States respectively; and while Alabama
                        has no right to interfere with Pennsylvania in determining this matter,
                        Pennsylvania has no more right to interfere with Alabama. One State has no
                        right to coerce another into the adoption or the rejection of such a
                        measure, either by the opinion of its people or the votes of its Senators
                        and representatives in Congress.</p>

                    <p>When asked if he favored the Eight Hour Labor law, instead of replying either
                        yes or no, he did neither, and indulged in the following bit of flunkeysim,
                        as much like Andy Johnson's as if Andy had said it himself:</p>

                    <p>Judge Packer.--I favor all movements that tend to
                        the amelioration of the condition of the laboring man, and they have my most
                        cordial co-operation. As I said in my letter of acceptance, "having earned
                        my bread by the labor of my hands during many, and I may add, the happiest
                        years of my life, and owing whatever I possess (under the providence of God)
                        to patient and honest toil; I can never be unmindful of the interests of
                        those with whom my entire life has been associated."</p>

                    <p>This is an interesting story of his rise and progress from poverty and
                        obscurity to wealth and fame, but not a word about the law. Laboring men
                        need not look to Packer in their efforts to alleviate their condition. The
                        man who equivocates so magnificently on a question so simple, evidently
                        lacks sincerity and truthfulness.</p>

                    <p>To the questions put to him on the subject of our national finances, he asks
                        the reporter to copy some extracts, generalities, they are, from the
                        writings of Jackson and Jefferson. They express no opinion and give no clue
                        to his personal opinions. Throughout, the interview is a series of evasions.
                        There is not a single candid, straight forward reply in it. Perhaps the most
                        sincere part of it it that wherein he admits his ignorance of politics. The
                        voters of the State will accept his own estimate of himself, and allow him
                        to remain where he can devote himself uninterruptedly to his great personal
                        enterprises.</p>
