<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We certainly did misunderstand the "spirit of the remarks" of the Spectator
                        of the 8th, and answered under that misunderstanding, but since he disclaims
                        any offensive construction, we freely retract anything in our article in
                        reply, which may be construed so as to hurt the feelings of the gentlemen of
                        the Spectator. We are heartily glad that our neighbor has at last consented
                        to answer our question in reference to his political position. He "takes
                        pleasure in saying that he has never repudiated, but still adheres to the
                        sentiments which he advocated in 1855." Now, we know that the Spectator was
                        a know nothing journal, and advocated know nothing principles in 1855, and
                        we know that the know nothing principles of '55 were religious intolerance,
                        bitter opposition to foreigners, and secrecy. And the Spectator "still
                        adheres" to those principles. How, then, does that paper support Mr. Goggin,
                        who declares he is not and never was a know nothing? How does that paper get
                        its own consent to support a man who is blarnying the Irish and angling
                        for Irish votes in Richmond, while it entertains the bitterest feelings of
                        opposition to all foreigners in Staunton, and holds the opinion that
                        foreigners of all kinds ought to be deprived altogether of the elective
                        franchise?</p>
