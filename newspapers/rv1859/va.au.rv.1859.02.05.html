<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The revenue arising from the present rates of postage having been found
                        greatly inadequate to the support of that important department of
                        Government, the question of raising the postage is being agitated, and is
                        creating considerable excitement throughout the country. We are decidedly of
                        the opinion that this department ought, if possible, to be a self-sustaining
                        one, but before an y such measure as increase in the postage is reported to,
                        we think that searching inquiry should be made into the expenditures of the
                        post office department, and retrenchment and reform should be the maxim
                        whenever such is possible. The people will never and ought never to consent
                        to an increase in the postage, until this is done. The system of extending
                        indiscriminately and by wholesale the franking privilege and many other
                        obviously unnecessary and extravagant expenditures, ought immediately to be
                        discontinued and when, after a fair trial of the retrenchment policy, it is
                        found that the department is inadequate with all possible economy, to the
                        support of itself under the present rates of postage, it will then be time
                        to taken into consideration the wisdom of an increased postage. As is well
                        remarked by the Enquirer, "the post office is emphatically the poor man's
                        Department of the Federal Government." In its numerous ramifications it
                        reaches the interest of every man, woman and child of the Union, and it is
                        of the utmost importance that it should be carried on with as much economy,
                        and with as little expense as possible, so we hope our worthy
                        representatives will go to work in earnest to bring the outlay of the Post
                        Office, inside of its income. This the people are certain can be done, and
                        they will never believe the contrary unless it be proved by something
                        infinitely more to the point than long heavy speeches on the subject, and
                        resolutions which are never acted upon.</p>
