                    <p>We call attention to the advertisement announcing another one of those fine
                        Concerts by Turner's Silver Concert Band, the Orchestra and Glee Club. These
                        Concerts have always heretofore drawn crowded houses, and now that the Band
                        is possessed of new instruments, pronounced by the best judges to be of the
                        first order, we anticipate for them a largely increased patronage. Besides
                        the favor and help which our citizens are willing to extend, and the members
                        of the Band have a right to expect, we feel confident that the intrinsic
                        merit of the music will ensure to the Concert an abundant success.</p>

                    <p>--We are pleased to find the following just and 
                        truthful acknowledgements in the columns of a northern contemporary.</p> 
                    <p>The South is in a thriving condition, if we may credit the remarks of 
                        dealers in exchange in this direction.  The planters, who used so 
                        frequently to be compelled to mortgage their crops in advance, are in a 
                        condition to draw on New York direct, and thus to realize their funds at 
                        maturity, without all the exhausting deduction made by discounters, 
                        bankers and their auxiliaries.  this is a state of things to inspire 
                        national exultation, for we hold that the producer from the soil is our 
                        primary capitalist, and when he flourishes, all the other attendants 
                        upon trade and commerce flourish with him.  The South with its cotton;  
                        the North with its manufactories;  the East with its food, how dependent 
                        are they all upon each other's support for each other's welfare!  And 
                        how sincerely should a mutual interest unite them in mutual 
                        affection.</p>
