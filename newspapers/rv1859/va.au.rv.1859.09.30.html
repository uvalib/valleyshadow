<b>The Harmonious Opposition</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Opposition press has delighted in the wrangling within the Democratic
                    camp. However, the Vindicator notes with sarcasm that the Opposition ranks are
                    not terribly harmonious either, as is indicated by a fight going on between
                    Botts and the Richmond Whig.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr.  Wise, Mr.  Douglas, Mr.  Stuart, Mr.  Botts, Mr.  Rives)</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    
                    <p>The monotony of our town was delightfully disturbed on last Tuesday 
                        by the ceremonies attending the laying of the Corner Stone of the new 
                        Methodist Church. The Masonic Fraternity, the Odd Fellows, the Sons of 
                        Temperance, the Military and Fire Association, turned out and added much 
                        to the occasion.  "Turner's Silver Cornet Band" was also "out," and with 
                        delightful "concord of sweet sounds" entertained at frequent intervals 
                        the large assembly.</p>
                    <p> But the event of the day was certainly the Oration of the Rev. Dr. 
                        Riley.  We regret much that we were no in a position to hear the whole 
                        of his eloquent discourse, but his clear, ringing voice, assisted by an 
                        eager and rapt attention, could be heard when aroused by the excitement 
                        of his theme, and when embodying his most energetic thoughts, even at 
                        the outskirts of the large crowd.  His review of the History of France 
                        for the last century, was as a specimen of genuine and lofty oratory, 
                        equal to anything we have ever heard;  while his masterly vindication of 
                        the present age from the charge of degeneracy, as compared with ancient 
                        times was most apropos and eloquent, and his reputation of those 
                        beautiful lines of Tennyson on the brave six hundred who charged on 
                        certain death at Balaclava, was the most splendid piece of declamation 
                        we ever heard.</p>
                    <p> Mr. Riley was formerly a resident of Staunton, and has many warm 
                        friends in this place;  long may he live in the enjoyment of his fine 
                        talents and of the good which must result from the efforts of such a 
                        mind devoted as is his, to the holy mission of Christ.</p>
                    <p> After the oration had been delivered and the collection taken up the 
                        procession formed and proceeded to the site of the old church where the 
                        ceremony of laying the corner stone was performed according to the forms 
                        of the Masonic Fraternity.  On the whole the day passed off pleasantly 
                        and agreeably to every one.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday last, about three miles from Staunton, a fatal affray (sic) took place - between Wm. 
                        Farrar and Michael Vance, which resulted in the death of the latter, his neck having been broken 
                        by blows received from the fist of the former.  We learn that Farrar alleges that his wife had 
                        been insulted by Vance.  An inquest was held upon the body and a verdict returned that he came 
                        to his death in accordance with the above facts.  Farrar was arrested, and and fully committed 
                        by Justice Bickle. - The examining trial will be had at the next Court.</p>
