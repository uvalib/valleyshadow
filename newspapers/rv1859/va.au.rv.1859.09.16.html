<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Virginia Index</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A friend not long since remarked to us that he had attended several 
                        National Conventions of the Democratic party, and that in every instance 
                        he had witnessed with pleasure and pride the deference shown to the 
                        Virginia delegation.  It appeared to him that this State, with an 
                        electoral vote never exceeding seventeen, within the period to which he 
                        referred, had during that time carried more influence in Convention than 
                        New York or Pennsylvania, and on some important occasions more influence 
                        than all the States combined.  He felt proud of a State that could 
                        accomplish such important results through its moral power alone.</p>
                    <p> Our friend fully understood and appreciated the cause of the great 
                        influence of Virginia in the councils of the party.  He knows that it 
                        was attributable entirely to the prevalence of the impression that the 
                        Democracy of Virginia are honestly devoted to principles--broad, 
                        defined, legible principles--that they go in Convention not for the 
                        purpose of securing merely selfish ends through bargains and intrigues 
                        with political sharpers, but for the patriotic purpose of co-operating 
                        in the selection of candidates for the highest offices of the Republic, 
                        who are faithful and true to its best interests.--Heretofore Virginia 
                        has indeed occupied an enviable position in our National Conventions.  
                        Since 1836, she has said to her brethren in Convention, "Virginia asks 
                        nothing for herself.  She only asks that the first offices of the 
                        government shall be filled by men who rightly understand and who will 
                        faithfully carry out its true principles."  And it must be admitted that 
                        these professions of Virginia have been well illustrated in her 
                        acts.</p>
                    <p> It should surely be an object near the heart of every true Democrat 
                        of Virginia, to support and maintain the proud character which his party 
                        in the State has acquired by its liberal, patriotic and disinterested 
                        course in Convention.  We sincerely hope that the Virginia Democracy 
                        will not suffer in numerical or moral force, by the disputes that have 
                        unfortunately arisen amon
                        g them in consequence of the appearance of rival Presidential candidates 
                        in their ranks.  We hope their hitherto proud flag will not be lowered 
                        before the Charleston Convention. Such must and will be the case, 
                        however, if we have a protracted war between the rivals here, and then 
                        take it for final decision to the Convention at Charleston.  In that 
                        event, "the rest of mankind" will come to the conclusion that we are, 
                        after all, just as selfish and just as bad in every respect as they are. 
                        Even the hards and softs of New York will rise up in judgement against 
                        us!</p>
