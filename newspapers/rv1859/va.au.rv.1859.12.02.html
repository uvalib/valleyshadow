<b>Then, Now, and What?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes Northerners, particularly New Englanders, for supporting
                    abolitionists and expressing sympathy for John Brown. These Northern views have
                    caused the Vindicator to state that "We have not entirely despaired of the
                    republic, but there is everything in the signs of the times to shake our

<b>Movements of Military</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The cadets of the Military Institute were called to Charlestown, but
                    arrived in Staunton too late for the cars. Before they proceeded by special
                    train, they "went through the battalion drill, to the admiration of a large
                    crowd who had assembled to witness the spectacle." The West Augusta Guards and
                    the Mountain Guards were also called to Charlestown, and they responded
                rapidly.<br>(Names in announcement: Maj.  Gilliam, Capt.  Bushong)</blockquote>
<b>Meeting of Citizens</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A meeting of Staunton citizens took place at the Courthouse on Saturday
                    night and a similar meeting for county residents occurred on Monday. In these
                    meetings, the citizens expressed their support for the actions of Gov. Wise in
                    the Harper's Ferry crisis and promised to uphold the governor in any actions
                    that he may think necessary "for the protection of Virginia's soil and
                    Virginia's honor." These professions of support are "doubly significant"
                    according to the Vindicator because they show that "the people of Virginia are
                    divided by no party lines in reference to the late outrage against its
                    sovereignty."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since our last issue, two primary meetings of Citizens have been held at the Courthouse; on 
                        Saturday night, of the Citizens of the town exclusively; and on Monday, in which a large number 
                        of the people of the country took part.  By referring to another column, our readers will 
                        perceive a synopsis of the action of both.</p>
                    <p>There are two facts which appear on the face of these 
                        proceedings as published, and stood out prominently in the manner and tone of the meetings, to 
                        which we wish to draw particular attention, because these facts are clothed with peculiar 
                        significance when the politics, and well known conservatism, of Augusta county are remembered.  
                        We refer to the endorsation of the action of Gov. Wise, from the beginning of the troubles at 
                        Harper's Ferry, to the present time, and the expressed willingness of the people of Augusta, to 
                        support and uphold the Executive of Virginia in any policy which he may think necessary for the 
                        protection of Virginia's soil and Virginia's honor.  We say when the politics and conservatism 
                        of Augusta are remembered, the action of these meetings is doubly significant; for it shows that 
                        the people of Virginia are divided by no party lines in reference to the late outrage against 
                        its sovereignty; and that the conservatives and patriots of all parties unite in denouncing it, 
                        and recommending preparation for the prevention or resenting of like outrages.</p>

<b>Capt. Harper's Speech</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator editor was "peculiarly struck and interested" by Capt.
                    Kenton Harper's speech, in which he acknowledged that the recent occurrences had
                    shaken his confidence in the Union. "When such men and patriots as Kenton Harper

                    <p>We were peculiarly struck and interested by the speech of this 
                        gallant Whig veteran on last Monday.  The conservative and Union 
                        sentiments of Capt. Kenton Harper are well known, and those sentiments 
                        he did not fail to express on Monday; but he acknowledged that the 
                        occurrences of the last month or two had for the first time shaken his 
                        confidence in the Union of these States, and for the first time made him 
                        entertain the thought that a possible contingency might arise when a 
                        dissolution might be expedient.</p>
                    <p> When such men and patriots as Kenton Harper express such views, the 
                        emergency must indeed be imminent, and the outrage which has brought on 
                        that emergency must indeed be gross.</p>

                    <p>At a meeting of the citizens of Staunton, on Saturday evening, the 
                        26th inst., N.K. Trout, Esq., Mayor of the town, was called to the 
                        Chair, and the editors of the two papers of the town, appointed 
                        Secretaries.  The object of the meeting having been explained, on motion 
                        of Gen. Harman, a Committee of five was appointed to prepare resolutions 
                        for the consideration of the meeting.  The Committee consisted of Gen.

                        which were adopted:</p>
                    <p> Whereas, the people of Staunton being solemnly impressed with the 
                        alarming condition of public affairs, feel called upon, as good citizens 
                        and ardent lovers of their State, its Constitution and laws, to assemble 
                        and give expression to their feelings and firm resolve in the present 
                        crisis. This crisis, which has been brought about by a mockish and 
                        sacrilegious sentiment, fostered and encouraged among a large number of 
                        the citizens of the non-slaveholding States of this Confederacy, under 
                        the false name of philanthropy, it becomes our duty, as loyal citizens 
                        of Virginia, to meet without shrinking and with manly courage.</p> 
                    <p>The foray upon our border at Harper's Ferry, we recognize as the 
                        legitimate result of the fanatical teachings of Wm. H. Seward and his 
                        party, and whilst we claim to be "order loving and law abiding 
                        citizens," we are yet prepared to say to the non-slaveholding States, 
                        with the determination of freemen, thus far you have gone, but you shall 
                        go no farther!"</p>
                    <p> 1st. Resolved, That we applaud the Governor of this time-honored 
                        Commonwealth, for the patriotic zeal and vigilance with which he has 
                        taken "care that the laws be faithfully executed."</p>
                    <p>2d. Resolved, That in his preparations to maintain the majesty of the

                        given proof of this patriotic fidelity to that Commonwealth whose 
                        dignity and honor were outraged by the thieves and assassins who invaded 
                        her borders at Harper's Ferry. </p>
                    <p>3d. Resolved, that now, or hereafter, whenever our chief magistrate 
                        calls upon us to assist him in the defense of Virginia institutions, 
                        Virginia homes and Virginia laws, we will respond with the offer of our

                        county, to lend 'material aid' in the way of pecuniary contributions to

                        such as will insure their preparation and readiness for every emergency. 
                        On motion of M.G. Harman,</p> 
                    <p>6th. Resolved, That there be raised $500 forthwith, to carry out in 
                        part the purpose of the above resolutions.</p> 
                    <p>7th. Resolved, That the proceedings of this meeting be published in 
                        the newspapers of the town.</p>
