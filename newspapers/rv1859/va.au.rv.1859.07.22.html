                    <p>Nothing to us appears a surer guarantee of the stability and probable 
                        permanence of the institution of slavery, than the revolution--radical 
                        in some places, partial everywhere--which has taken place in its favor.  
                        Men are now living who can remember when, throughout the world, even 
                        here in the Southern States of America, it was looked upon as a great, 
                        but necessary evil, and a casual glance at the writings and speeches of 
                        the founders of our Republic, will not fail to make apparent the fact, 
                        that all those great men considered slavery an evil, and its 
                        emancipation a desirable and certain consummation.</p>
                    <p> But soon the revolution which had commenced in its favor, and the 
                        disastrous result of emancipation in the West Indies, convinced the 
                        South that, evil or good, it was something which they must be content to 
                        endure.  Since then, the change in the sentiment of the people has been 
                        so sure and speedy, that now, the world, with the exception of a few 
                        fanatics, has come to look upon the institution with leniency, and the 
                        people of the Southern States with affection and reverence.  So decided 
                        has been the revolution in reference to this question, that the penal 
                        law making the prosecution of the African Slave Trade piracy, is the 
                        only remaining vestige of the ancient prejudice.  We have never been 
                        able to appreciate the consistency of those who, believing slavery, as 
                        it exists in the South, to be morally right, yet denounce the slave 
                        trade--the mode in which that existence was created--as an infamous 
                        traffic.  We have never been able to see anything but nonsense and 
                        fallacy in the distinction drawn between the morality of purchasing a 
                        slave in Virginia to transport to Alabama, and the morality of buying a 
                        slave on the coast of Africa to bring to the United States, where he 
                        will be better fed, better clothed, and humanized and christianized.  
                        Therefore;  conscientiously and devoutly believing the institution of 
                        slavery to be the most noble, humane and christian institution with 
                        which the creator ever blessed a favored people, we are forced to the 
                        logical conclusion, that the slave trade, far from being an infamous 
                        traffic, is, on the other hand, all perfectly right, moral and proper.  
                        We would not be understood as an advocate of the slave trade, for 
                        although our moral and christian duty would prompt us to favor the 
                        extension of slavery at any risk or cost, still we would not be willing 
                        to sacrifice the interests of the South to effect such an end;  
                        consequently, as we are not as yet convinced of the expediency we are 
                        opposed to the immediate re- opening of the slave trade.</p>
                    <p> But it was not our intention in this article to discuss the 
                        expediency or inexpediency, the right or wrong of re-opening the slave 
                        trade, but to add or voice to swell the cry of the aroused and outraged 
                        people of the South, for the repeal of that unjust, unconstitutional, 
                        and infamous law, which declares the slave trade piracy. The reasons for 
                        the repeal of this law are two-fold.  First, it cannot be enforced, for 
                        it is constantly trampled upon with scorn and impunity, and as a general 
                        rule, it is pernicious for any Legislature or Government to pass laws 
                        which, conflicting with public sentiment, are wholly disregarded and 
                        daily broken.  And, secondly, its passage and its maintenance is an 
                        infamous injustice to the South.  The Southern people have long enough 
                        borne with patience a law which stamps with the brand of piracy and 
                        outlawry the actions of their forefathers, and holds up to the scorn of 
                        the civilized world Southern slavery as an institution whose very 
                        inception was attended with a crime worthy of the gallows.</p>

<b>Abstractions</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Slavery is not an abstraction, the article asserts, and the issues arising
                    from it should be taken very seriously.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>People have been in the habit so long of settling to their own 
                        satisfaction every difficult question rising out of the slavery issue by 
                        pronouncing it an "empty abstraction," until at length the expression 
                        has passed into a common phrase of stereotyped wisdom, lulling the South 
                        to an unnatural and dangerous repose.</p>
                    <p> Did the good people who, on every occasion, are so eager thus to lay 
                        at rest a question which many men, great and small, have considered both 
                        substantial and vital, ever ask themselves what an abstraction is?  Do 
                        they remember that they have but an abstract right to life, until it is 
                        assailed?--Do they not forget that they hold their property, of any 
                        kind, only by an abstract right until it is interfered with by some 
                        person or persons?  In a word, are they not aware that they enjoy life, 
                        liberty and property only as an abstract right, until, being interfered 
                        with, it becomes a living, substantial claim?  Apply this principle to 
                        the question which now agitates the political world, and the myth which 
                        mystifying compromisers have thrown around this issue is at once 
                        dispelled.  We have, as we contend and the compromisers acknowledge, the 
                        same abstract right to protection for our slave property in the 
                        territories which we have to protection for our lives, liberty and 
                        property here in Virginia.  As long as this fact is conceded by the 
                        world, we are content to let the thing rest as an abstraction;  but when 
                        a powerful party, like the combined Black Republicans and squatter 
                        sovereignty advocates, deny that right, and threaten to follow up their 
                        denial by an open and fatal attack upon it, then that which was before 
                        an abstraction is converted into a living, substantial, all-absorbing 
                        principle, for which its advocates ought and will contend to the bitter 
                        end.</p>

                        for Staunton, but we think a very good one. Mr. Guy is well known in the
                        county as an honorable gentleman, and we can assure any one who may wish to
                        place their business in his hands, that it will be promptly and well
                        attended to. Mr. Waddell is well known as the junior editor of the
                        "Spectator." We feel great hesitation in recommending a Know Nothing editor
                        to the public, but we will venture the assertion that the one in question
                        has reached the highest stage of honesty and intelligence to which Know
                        Nothingism is capable. We do hope the prevailing prejudice again his calling

<b>The Staunton Steam Mill</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    <p>This mill, which has been in operation but a short time, promises to be a
                        prosperous and useful enterprise, both to the stockholders and the people of
                        this and the surrounding counties. A Steam Mill at this central point,
                        situated on the Railroad, which will eventually extend to the Ohio, thus
                        bringing all the produce of Western Virginia, on its way to market, through
                        Staunton, will prove a powerful rival to the Richmond Mills, if the
                        stockholders could find it in their power to compete in prices with
                        Richmond. We were informed by one of the proprietors that out of sixty-five
                        bushels of wheat deposited at this mill, fourteen barrels of extra-
                        superfine flour, or a fraction over 4 1/2 bushels to the barrel were
                        produced to the customer, after deducting the miller a toll. This speaks
                        well both for the excellence of the mill and the wheat.</p>
