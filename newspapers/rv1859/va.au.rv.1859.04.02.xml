                    <p>The spring is a most important season to the farmer.  Much depends 
                        upon getting our summer crops in, in good season, and in good order.  
                        The land should be well tilled, and the surface well pulverized, so as 
                        to give the roots of the young plants a healthful and vigorous growth in 
                        the early part of the season.  This enables them to stand either too 
                        much wet or too much dry weather, and the attacks of worms, much better 
                        than if got in late in the season or in bad order.  The straw of grain 
                        sown early, is not as subject to rust or lodge, as that sown late;  and 
                        grain which is forward, and ripens early, is usually much better and 
                        heavier than that which is late.  The farmer who gets his crops in well 
                        and in good season is most sure of a good yield;  besides, if he gets 
                        his spring's work done early, he will be most likely to do the whole 
                        work of the season in good time, and will have time to do it well; while 
                        if he gets behind time in the spring, he will be most likely to get behind time through the whole season;  and being driven with his work will 
                        not be likely to do it well;  and if he keeps an account of outgoes and 
                        incomes, will be most likely to find his profits much less than they 
                        would have been, had his spring's work been done in season.</p>
                    <p> The spring is also important in another point of view.  Almost all 
                        of our domestic animals drop their young at season;  and the same rule 
                        that applies to the vegetable, applies with equal force to the animal 
                        kingdom, viz: that we pay particular attention to them while young, so 
                        as to give them a healthful and vigorous growth in the stare.  All 
                        experience has shown that if we would rear good stock, we must give them 
                        good keeping while young.  All animals intended to be reared, should be 
                        dropped as early as the climate and season would admit.--This enables 
                        them, with good keeping, to become so large and hardy, as to stand the 
                        first winter well;  while if dropped late in the season, and poorly 
                        attended to, their size,-- slender and feeble constitution, illy fits them to stand 
                        our severe winters.  The first of March is the best time for 
                        calves.--This enables them to make good use of the early grasses as soon 
                        as they start and gives them the benefit of the whole season of 
                        pasturage.  And further, the dams of all young animal, require 
                        particular attention and good keeping at this season, or they will run 
                        down and become poor.  Dairy cows especially, should have the best of 
                        care, if we expect a good yield from them during the season.  The milk 
                        drawn from the cow is a monstrous draft, and if she is suffered to get 
                        poor in the spring, she will remain so during the season, and the yield 
                        of milk will be small, particularly during the latter part of the 
                        season.</p>
                    <p> There are many other important matters to be looked to during the 
                        spring.  Do your old meadows need harrowing and manuring and additional 
                        grass seed?  If so, now is the time to attend to it.</p>
                    <p> Have you a sufficient number of fruit trees, and of the different 
                        kinds best suited to your soil and climate? If not, this is the time to 
                        plant them.</p>
                    <p>Have you a sufficiency of shade trees and shrubbery to make your 
                        situation pleasant?  If not, now is the time to plant them.  It will 
                        cost you but little labor. Plant them, keep cattle from them, and 
                        natural agents will do the rest.</p>
                    <p> Although we would not encourage extravagance of style in our common 
                        farmers, still, we can see no good reason why they should not practice 
                        and encourage correct taste, as well as those engaged in other pursuits. 
                        It is believed that those farmers who are the most particular in all 
                        their operations, are the most prosperous, provided they avoid what may 
                        (as applied to farmers) be justly termed extravagance.</p>
                    <p> The time when a particular job is done may not be of much importance 
                        to the manufacturer or mechanic, but to the farmer it is all important 
                        that he does almost everything at the right time.  He has to depend upon 
                        natural agents for success;  and they will not come to his aid unless he 
                        accommodates them as to time.  Nature does not alter her laws or rules, 
                        to suit either the ignorance, misjudgment or slackness of the farmer.  
                        If he plants his corn too late in the spring, she will not stay the 
                        frost in the fall to give it time to ripen.  If then, we would be 
                        benefitted by natural agents, we must so observe their laws as that they 
                        come most readily to our aid;  and there is no season of the year when 
                        this observance is more important that the spring.</p>

                    <p>As will be seen by reference to the published proceedings of the 
                        Democratic District Convention, James H. Skinner, Esq., of this place, 
                        is the nominee of the Democratic party, for the vacant seat of Hon. John 
                        Letcher in the next Congress.  Mr. Skinner, received an overwhelming 
                        majority on the first ballot, and before the vote was announced, Capt. 
                        John A. Harman, of Augusta, rose and expressed his belief that Mr. 
                        Skinner was the nominee of the Convention, and proposed to make the 
                        nomination unanimous, which was done amid loud and enthusiastic cheers. 
                        Everybody whom we have seen, seems perfectly satisfied with the 
                        candidate whom the Convention has presented to Democrats of the 
                        District, and we haven't the slightest doubt of his triumphant election 
                        on the 26th day of May.  Mr. Skinner was then informed of his 
                        nomination, and requested to address the meeting which he did in an 
                        eloquent speech of about fifteen minutes, and his manly and graceful 
                        appeal to the Opposition, was singularly happy.</p> 
                    <p>He told them he would be thankful to receive their votes, but at the 
                        same time informed them that he was the candidate of the Democratic 
                        party, and would never consent to sacrifice one principle of his party 
                        for the purpose of securing votes from any quarter, whatever.  He 
                        appealed to them for their support, but at the same time hoped that the 
                        appeal was made in a spirit which scorns to"flatter Neptune for his 
                        trident, or Jove for his thunder."</p>
