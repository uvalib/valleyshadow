<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> We publish in another column, at the request of one of the State managers of
                        the "Mount Vernon Association," for this County, the "appeal to the Ladies
                        of Virginia for the purchase of Mount Vernon," from the gifted pen of Mrs.
                        Anna Cora Ritchie, Vice-Regent for this State. We trust this appeal will not
                        be in vain. Each subscriber of one dollar and upwards, becomes a member of
                        the Association; the name and residence of each subscriber will be carefully
                        recorded and preserved in the archives of the Association of Mt. Vernon. It
                        is confidently expected that if proper efforts are made throughout the
                        country, the entire balance due on the purchase will be paid by the 22d of
                        February next. It is hoped that the Ladies of this County will co-operate
                        with each other in their respective vicinities, in enlarging the list of
                        subscribers, so that the State Manager's Record Book, which is to be
                        returned to the Vice-Regent on or before the first of March next, may bear
                        ample testimony to the fact, that nowhere are the name and memory of
                        Washington more warmly loved and cherished than in old Augusta. The
                        gentlemen named below are requested to transmit the subscription lists made

<b>The Case of the "Wanderer"</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A vessel named the "Wanderer" was captured landing a cargo of slaves in
                    Georgia and South Carolina. Many planters have hailed the renewal of the slave
                    trade because they feel that there is a need for more slave labor in the South
                    and in the new Western territories.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It has already been announced that a vessel, the "Wanderer," had been
                        captured on suspicion of having landed a cargo of slaves in South Carolina
                        and Georgia, and that it was hailed as a good omen by many of the planters.
                        Indeed, it is and should be a cause of rejoicing to every right thinking
                        Southern man. It is a question which has been but recently revived, but no
                        question of national policy has been so generally discussed and approved
                        since its second advent. The most potent argument in its favor is, that we
                        need negro labor. Negroes at the present prices are too high to cultivate
                        the soil by them to any advantage, and the Southern and Western section of
                        our Republic being better adapted to such products as require slave labor,
                        we will be compelled to increase our stock as we increase our territory. It
                        may be argued that Congress has legislated against it, but Congress has
                        passed laws prohibiting other things, yet when necessity demanded it she has
                        promptly repealed them, and such we conceive to be her duty under the
                        present circumstances; or at least to give such encouragement that the
                        traffic may be protected. It may be argued again, that it is our duty to
                        elevate this fallen race, instead of keeping them in a state of bondage, but
                        has not experience taught us that this is the surest and most speedy way of
                        civilizing and converting them to Christianity? Should the opposition of our
                        neighbor across the water, who connives at and encourages the French system
                        of apprenticing, be any object in our way? Then better give up every
                        cherished principle for which we have fought, and submit ourselves to her
                        dominion at once. But we think that several laws would be repealed by
                        Congress rather than this should come to pass.</p>
