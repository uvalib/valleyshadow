<b>The 22d</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes the wonderful celebration of the 22nd, complete with a parade
                    that included the West Augusta Guards, accompanied by the Mountain Sax-horn

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The morning of the 22d was ushered in by the beating of drums and the firing of rifles,--and 
                        here we would remark that no one can form an idea of the pleasing sensations one experiences 
                        when awakened by the noise of drum and fife, about three o' clock in the morning; first the 
                        delightful impression that you are in a city about to be stormed, with floating visions of 
                        hideous grenadiers and armed caveliers, then an undefined but exquisite feeling of doubt and 
                        uncertainty as to "what's the row," and then comes the crowning pleasure of knowing you are 
                        wide- awake, past redemption;  oh! it is glorious.  But to return to the 22d.  The day was 
                        enlivened by the parading of the gallant West Augusta Guards, accompanied by the Mountain 
                        Sax-horn Band, which the while, electrified with martial music the warlike souls of the gallant 
                        soldiery. The celebration of the day was concluded by a fair given at the Town Hall, by the 
                        ladies of the town, for the benefit of the "Guard."  A beautiful b!
                        anner was presented to the company in an eloquent and appropriate address by Mr. James H. 
                        Skinner, and received by Capt. Wm. H. Baylor, in a speech marked by elegance and grace.  We 
                        regret very much that we cannot adorn this issue of our paper with the graceful addresses of the 
                        two gentlemen above named.  We were happy to hear that the fair succeeded beyond the 
                        expectations of all, and the proceeds will be amply sufficient to meet all the purposes for 
                        which it was given.</p>
