<b>The Democratic Imbroglio</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    party over issues of squatter sovereignty and slavery expansion into the

                    fundamentally differ with Douglas over these issues, Douglas should not be the
                    Democrats' choice for President.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--It seems to me that the Common Council of Staunton 
                        has overlooked the interest of its citizens by permitting a Toll-gate to 
                        be erected on the East of the Cemetery, when the privilege was granted 
                        by the Council to put it West of the Cemetery.  Being a large 
                        wood-hauler I protest against the toll-gate.  In the first place, the 
                        Common Council of Staunton has no right to improve their streets at the 
                        expense of the country people.  In the second place I don't believe that 
                        the Superintendent of the road has a legal right to put up this gate at 
                        all;  which right I intend to have fully investigated.</p>
                    <p> Now I would say to the people of Staunton that to improve their 
                        streets at the expense of the country people is poor economy, for we 
                        will of course raise the prices of all kinds of produce and wood, or 
                        else we will export it to other markets from Swoope's Depot.</p>
                    <p> I propose to all who are interested in this matter (West of 
                        Staunton,") to meet at Swoope's Depot, on Saturday the 15th of this month, to consult together as to what would be the 
                        best course to pursue in relation to the matter in question.</p>
