                    <p>We are requested to call attention to the notice of Mr. C. A. Smith, a graduate of the 
                        University, who intends as early in 1860 as possible to open a classical School in Staunton, 
                        which will be "equal in grade to any school in Virginia."  He will have with him a distinguished 
                        Major of Arts, of the University of Va.  From what we have learned of Mr. Smith's character as a 
                        high-toned gentleman, and his supporting qualifications, we can predict for him a decided 
                        success, and for our citizens, a classical institution worthy of support.</p>
