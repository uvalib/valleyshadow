<b>To the People of North Western Virginia</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This letter, written by leaders of northwestern Virginia, communicates the
                    assurance that the South will emerge victorious and that northwestern Virginia
                    will remain with the rest of the state and thus with the South, where its
                    loyalties and identity lie.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Letter from Brigadier General J. D. Imboden to the "Loyal and Patriotic
                    Young Men of North Western Virginia," dated March 1, 1863. Imboden calls
                    attention to the previous letter, written by leaders from that part of the
                    state, and asks the loyal citizens from there to rid themselves of their
                    traitorous government and to join the many others from their area in the
                    Confederate military. They should be aware, he warns, that the North's goal of
                    making the South acknowledge African Americans as social and political equals
                    will begin there if they do not act hastily.<br>(Names in announcement:  J. D. ImbodenBrigadier General, Commanding)</blockquote>
