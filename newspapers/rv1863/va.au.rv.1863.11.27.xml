                <summary>Dr. Elliot, the Bishop of Georgia, preached a sermon in Savannah recently
                    in which he said that the South had no alternative but to move forward toward
                    total victory or else submit unconditionally. A year ago, he asserts, the South
                    could have gone backward, had it been willing to humiliate itself in such a way.
                    However, that choice is no longer available because the Union soldiers will be
                    unrestrained in their victory. Freed slaves and Union soldiers will overrun the
                    South, and conservative and Christian people in the North will not be able to
                    control them.</summary>
