<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Encourages farmers to plant large crops of foodstuffs, both for profit and
                    for patriotism. In peace or war, these products are profitable. In case of
                    peace, the Confederacy will want to have enough of its own products in order not
                    to need federal goods.<br>

                    be distracted by offers of mediation from France or by the trouble in the
                    northwest and should instead remain focused on fulfilling its destiny.<br>

                    would hurt the C.S.A. Peace, or conciliation, at the cost of hurting the
