<b>Deserters</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor attributes all the "ill success" the Confederates have had in
                    battle to the number of men absent without leave. He asserts that these men
                    would scorn the idea of being classified as deserters, even though their anxiety
                    about family and friends caused them to act as if they were deserters. The
                    reluctance for citizens and government to call them deserters has resulted in an
                    increase in their numbers, to the point that the cause of the Confederacy has
                    been affected. The Senate has passed a bill that is before the House and that
                    addresses the punishment of these men. The editor calls for their return to duty
                    before they are labeled deserters under this bill. The text of the senate bill
                    is reprinted here.<br>

<b>Dr. F. T. Stribling</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

<b>A Good Example--Who Will Follow It?</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Praises Jeremiah K. Pitzer of Roanoke County for furnishing his entire crop
                    of flour to the government at fifteen dollars per barrel, except for the ten
                    barrels he donated to the County Committee of Supply for soldiers' families.
                    This act of liberality and patriotism should be an example to others.<br>
