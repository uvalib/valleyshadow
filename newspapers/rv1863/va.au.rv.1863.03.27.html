<b>The System of Impressment</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprint of letter from Honorable John B. Baldwin to Honorable James A.
                    Seddon, Secretary of War and of reply from J. A. Campbell, on behalf of Seddon,
                    on the issue of impressment. Baldwin complains about the "repeated seizures of
                    private property" in his district and argues that the acts have no legal basis.
                    Further, he calls for just compensation. Campbell's reply states that the War
                    Department does not deem a discussion of the legality of impressments or of just
                    compensations important, in light of "the extraordinary and anamolous [sic]
                    conditions that now exist." He hopes Congress will address the situation.<br>(Names in announcement: Honorable John B. Baldwin)</blockquote>
<b>Impressments</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor accuses the Secretary of War and the Commissary Department of
                    usurpation by practicing impressment without legal backing and of taking it upon
                    themselves to make laws. Only Congress has the power to enact legislation, as
                    stated by the attorney general.<br>

<b>Market Price of a Grievance</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor wonders where the "widespread and bitter dissatisfaction"
                    Baldwin refers to may be found regarding impressment and states that the only
                    hateful government is the Northern one.<br>

<b>A Good Hotel Story</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Relates the story of a military officer who stayed at an Atlanta hotel and
                    thought his bill at the end was too high. His complaint made the owner so mad
                    that he whipped three African-American minors to vent his hostility.<br>

<b>To Our People</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor notes that he has become aware of families that, no matter their
                    hard work, are not able to supply their families sufficiently and may be too
                    proud to ask for assistance. He calls on farmers to distribute their crops at
                    reduced rates or free to these people and on all people to look out for one
                    another so that husbands and fathers in the field may know their loved ones are
                    not suffering unnecessarily.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor reports that General W. H. Harman read a letter from General
                    Imboden at the adjournment of county court on Monday night. The letter relayed
                    the news of ten destitute families in Pendleton County. The few people in
                    attendance contributed $350 and provisions, and Samuel H. Bell offered to buy
                    enough wheat to supply the families.<br>(Names in announcement: Genl. W. H. Harman, Genl.  Imboden, Mr. Samuel H. Bell)</blockquote>
<b>Our Neighbor</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor chastises the editor of the Spectator for criticisms of the
                    Vindicator. The editor of the Spectator had accused the editor of the Vindicator
                    of silence on issues such as war bonds and impressment and had faulted him for
                    his positions on reunification and northwestern Virginia. The editor of the
                    Vindicator responds to each of these criticisms.<br>
