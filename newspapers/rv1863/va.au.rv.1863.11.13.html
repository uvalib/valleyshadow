<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A recruiting officer for African-American soldiers was killed in St. Mary's
                    County, Maryland. Lieutenant White, the officer killed, had heard that prominent

                    enlist. White visited Sotheron, who refused to release the slaves and who, with
                    his son, threatened to attack White. White proceeded to a field where some of
                    Sotheron's slaves were working and announced that he was willing to enlist
                    anyone so interested. He was then killed by the two Sotherons.<br>
