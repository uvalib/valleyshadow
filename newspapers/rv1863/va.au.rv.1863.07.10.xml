                <summary>The editor writes a brief column about Lee's early victory at Gettysburg
                    and the rumor that Vicksburg surrendered recently. The rumor is that 19,000
                    Confederate soldiers surrendered, which seems doubtful to the editor, as surely
                    that number would not surrender without trying "to cut their way out." Even if
                    the Yankees now have possession of Vicksburg, they do not have control of the
                    Mississippi.</summary>

                <summary>R. T. Massie, son of Nathaniel Massie of Augusta, died. A graduate of the
                    University of Virginia, he was assistant professor of mathematics there before
                    becoming full professor at Randolph Macon College and at the University of
                    Virginia. The editor credits him with being perhaps the finest mathematician his
                    age in the Confederacy.</summary>

                    deception of a female spy and warns that others might be more easily taken in by

                <summary>Rev. Mr. Harvy, Chaplain of the 110th Ohio Regiment, was taken at
                    Winchester. Evidence reveals that he helped slaves run away, in one case aiding
                    in the escape of Sarah Jenkins, a slave of W. J. Shumate of Augusta County. The
                    Richmond Enquirer requests that he be handed over to state civil authorities at
                    once in order to be prosecuted.</summary>
