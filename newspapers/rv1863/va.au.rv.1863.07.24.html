<b>Burglary</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>On Saturday night between eleven and twelve o'clock, the store of Gabriel
                    Hirsh was burglarized. Two gold watches, several silver watches, cloth,
                    handkerchiefs, and other articles, valued between $3000 and $4000, were stolen.
                    A slave boy belonging to Mrs. Tap and working for Mr. Hirsh was arrested and
                    jailed. He confessed and tried to implicate a free man, Tom Champ, who had a
                    legitimate alibi.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr. Gabriel Hirsh, Mrs.  Tap,  Tom Champ)</blockquote>

<b>The Raid on Wytheville</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes a Yankee raid on Wytheville, the losses on both sides, and the
                    supposition that the forces that raided Wytheville were part of a larger force
                    that would attack again.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Tired of the War</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor writes about some citizens who take advantage of the opportunity
                    to talk to Yankee prisoners on their way to Richmond. In some cases, the
                    citizens tell the prisoners they are tired of the war. The editor recognizes
                    that all may be tired of the deprivations war brings but hopes that the message
                    of the citizens is not that they are tired enough of the war to take peace at
                    any cost. The editor wants to ensure that Yankee soldiers do not get the idea
                    that the people of the South are losing their resolve. The editor then
                    criticizes a prominent Virginian who has said that "'there are some who believe
                    this war should never have been begun'" and reiterates the patriotism and
                    commitment of the people of Augusta County.<br>

<b>Riot in New York</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
