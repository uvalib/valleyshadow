                    from the 11th Congressional District, stating that he has no political

<b>War News</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Yankee troops raided in the Valley as far as Woodstock. They initially
                    overpowered troops led by Major Myers, only to have Myers attack the next day
                    more successfully. Rumors say that three columns of the enemy have crossed the
                    Rappahannock, with one column having 10,000 troops. However, the editor cannot
                    confirm or deny the rumors.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor notes that General J. D. Imboden has consented to become a
                    candidate for Lieutenant Governor. He believes that Imboden is in his element in
                    whatever he does, thus making the editor certain Imboden would do well in that
                    position.<br>(Names in announcement: General J. D. Imboden)</blockquote>
<b>Northern and Local News</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor has learned that two editors from Cecil and St. Mary's counties
                    in Maryland are in Staunton, having been driven away because of their comments
                    "on the usurpations of the Northern Dictator." The editor notes the irony of the
                    situation--the men were driven from the land where life, liberty, and freedom of
                    speech were guaranteed its citizens. The editors from Maryland initially
                    believed that the North was conducting its war in "the style generally adopted
                    by Christian Nations" but have since seen enough to know that it was acting
                    barbarically. The editor reports several incidents in the Valley that prove the
                    Yankees are savage and uncivilized.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Congressional Election</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator's editor criticizes the Spectator's editor for denouncing
                    anyone who opposes Baldwin. The Spectator endorsed Col. Baldwin for
                    representative and claimed that any who are against him have axes to grind. The
                    editor of the Vindicator argues that these people have the freedom of choice and
                    do not necessarily have anything against Baldwin. The editor of the Vindicator
                    hopes the campaign will be between two worthy candidates rather than two
                    political parties.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Meeting of the Voters of the "Stonewall Brigade"</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Voters of the Stonewall Brigade from the 11th Congressional District met to
                    select a candidate to represent them in the next Confederate Congress. Major
                    James W. Newton of the 5th Virginia Infantry served as chairman of the meeting,
                    and Colonel H. J. Williams stated the purpose of the meeting. The men nominated
                    Colonels William H. Harman and John B. Baldwin. Walter Monteiro, Esq., of the
                    5th Virginia Infantry spoke on Harman's behalf. The men selected Harman as their
                    candidate and appointed a committee of Captains Curtis, Gibson, and Trevy to
                    inform Colonel Harman of his nomination and call upon him to be a candidate for
                    Congress from the district.<br>(Names in announcement: Colonel William H. Harman, Colonel John B. Baldwin)</blockquote>
<b>Correspondence</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>E. L. Curtis, J. W. Trevy, and James W. Gibson wrote General William H.
                    Harman on April 20, 1863 to ask him to be a candidate for Congress from the 11th
                    District. They informed Harman that members of their brigade met on April 18 and
                    selected him as their candidate. The soldiers chose him because of his "worth as
                    a statesman and soldier."<br>

                    candidate for the Virginia House of Delegates from Augusta County and thus must
                    decline the opportunity to run for the Confederate Congress from the 11th
                    District. He expressed much gratitude for the endorsement from the men who
                    encouraged him to run.<br>(Names in announcement:  W. H. Harman)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Colonel John B. Baldwin responded to criticism of him that is intended to
                    diminish his chances for election. He has commanded the 52nd Virginia Regiment
                    for eight months and is confident the members of that brigade will speak on his
                    behalf. He assures readers that he voted to abolish flogging of soldiers and to
                    increase soldiers' pay.<br>(Names in announcement:  John B. Baldwin)</blockquote>
