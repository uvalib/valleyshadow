<b>A Patriotic Spirit Shows</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>On last Friday, the day of fasting, word reached the Commandant of the Post
                    that an enemy force was contemplating a raid on Staunton. General Imboden
                    immediately moved his forces from Rockingham to just a few miles from Staunton.
                    On Sunday night, the enemy crossed the mountains at Buffalo Gap, about twelve
                    miles from Staunton. Everything was readied for the raid, including the citizens
                    volunteer units. All citizens were eager to participate and help. The editor
                    praises the turnout and states that the event demonstrates that the hearts of
                    the citizens support the cause of the war. He claims that the county was ready
                    in case there had been an attack.<br>(Names in announcement: General  Imboden, Colonel W. H. Harman)</blockquote>
