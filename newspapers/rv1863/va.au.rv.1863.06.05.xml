                <summary>The writer for the London Saturday Review states that the South was in a
                    good position when the war broke out by having a statesman at the head of its
                    government who was enough of a soldier to select generals and then let them do
                    they jobs for which they had been selected. The article then goes on to assess
                    and praise various Confederate military leaders.</summary>

                    never plunder private property or appropriate it for his private use.</summary>

                <summary>The editor notes that the Enquirer, Sentinel, and Dispatch often copy news
                    articles from western Virginia from the Vindicator but either credit them to the
                    Spectator or do not credit them at all. The Sentinel and Enquirer have made the
                    omission once, but the Dispatch frequently fails to credit the articles. The
                    editor calls the situation to the attention of his colleagues at these papers.</summary>
