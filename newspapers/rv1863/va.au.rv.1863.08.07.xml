                <summary>The editor points the attention of the readers to President Davis's
                    proclamation calling for the return of all soldiers absent without leave and
                    promising amnesty to them. The editor accounts for numerous reasons why the
                    soldiers might have deserted in the first place and comments on the sad
                    spectacle of seeing them as prisoners in ball and chain.</summary>

                <summary>Frequent complaints compel the editor to implore the mayor and town council
                    to enforce the ordinance against riding on the sidewalks and to call upon the
                    police to ticket such violators. Poor drainage on Beverly Street near the
                    residence of W. B. Crawford, Esquire, causes such a backup in wet weather that
                    riders come up on the sidewalk instead of wading through the water.</summary>

                    over smoking lard. By holding the body part as close to the smoking lard as
