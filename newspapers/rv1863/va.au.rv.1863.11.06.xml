                <summary>This long story relates the experience of an African-American barber from
                    Richmond who supposedly cut the hair of prominent Confederate leaders, escaped
                    to New York, related his insights to an audience there, and sold locks of hair
                    to them.</summary>

                    military feat. Imboden surrounded Charlestown and captured nearly the whole
                    Yankee force there. Imboden captured 2436 prisoners, including 41 commissioned
                    officers.</summary>

                    should be "confined where it properly belongs--among the Yankees."</summary>
