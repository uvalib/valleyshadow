                <summary>George W. Summers of Kanawha has announced that he is a candidate for the
                    next United States Congress from northwestern Virginia. The editor calls him "an
                    able and talented statesman" who once would have been a good prospect for the
                    governorship of Virginia. His action in aligning himself with the traitorous
                    government of the breakaway section of Virginia, however, disappoints the editor
                    and proves that Summers's true allegiance is not to Virginia.</summary>
