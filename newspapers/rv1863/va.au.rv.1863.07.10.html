<b>War News</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor writes a brief column about Lee's early victory at Gettysburg
                    and the rumor that Vicksburg surrendered recently. The rumor is that 19,000
                    Confederate soldiers surrendered, which seems doubtful to the editor, as surely
                    that number would not surrender without trying "to cut their way out." Even if
                    the Yankees now have possession of Vicksburg, they do not have control of the
                    Mississippi.<br>
