<b>Speaking as a Christian</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This excerpt, reprinted in the Richmond Enquirer from the Philadelphia
                    Inquirer, tells of a preacher in Kentucky who spoke at a Union League meeting in
                    Philadelphia. He fears the insurrection that may come from arming
                    African-American troops but still would rather "see every woman and child in the
                    South perish rather than that the Southern Confederacy should succeed in
                    attaining the objects of its leaders." The Richmond paper noted that the
                    applause that followed this speech reaffirms the deep hostility between the two
                    nations.<br>

                    It asserts that the waiting in suspense is the worst part, that once the

<b>Negro Exclusion from New Jersey</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

<b>Returned From The Yankees</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Joe, a slave of a man who lives in Charleston, South Carolina, had been
                    gone from his master for eighteen months and had been working for the
                    abolitionists on St. Helena and other islands. He returned recently and reported
                    on the destitute condition of the African Americans on the island. He said many
