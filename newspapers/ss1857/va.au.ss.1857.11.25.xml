                <excerpt>Two entire columns of the last "Lexington Gazette" are devoted to a
                    description of Staunton. The editor attempts to sketch a ludicrous picture, and
                    like all artists, draws pretty large on his imagination... The "Gazette" says
                    that Staunton is "one of the most pleasant places to leave that can be found
                    anwhere."...It is our decided opinion, however, that no man who pronounces the
                    Lexington water good, into which one dead dog is regularly pitched per season,
                    and in which the little niggers bathe every Sunday, ought to turn up his nose at
                    mean whiskey.</excerpt>

                <summary>Northern and western delegates to the general conference of the Methodist
                    Church have reportedly decided not to meet in Staunton during following May as
                    previously planned. They claim that the issue of slavery will not only prove
                    divisive, but will also prevent a meeting on equal terms.</summary>
