                    <p> From all we can learn the recent Convention which assembled in the town of
                        Harrisonburg, on the 13th ultimo, for the purpose of nominating a standard
                        bearer on the approaching contest for Congressional honors, was a legitimate
                        and regularly organized body of untrammeled freemen, fairly appointed by the
                        people to represent them in that Convention. With one or two exceptions, all
                        of the counties in the District were represented by delegates properly
                        elected by public meeting, held in the various Townships of the different
                        counties composing the Sixth Congressional District; and they went into that
                        Convention with the avowed determination to select the most available
                        standard-bearer of the several candidates presented and put in nomination
                        their friends, in <emph rend="italic">that regularly constituted
                        body.</emph> Now, did they not resolve that--whoever he might be--the
                        candidate who received the requisite number of votes of the body should be
                        the nominee of the Convention? And did not they resolve and swear to abide
                        by and support the nominee, be he their own or somebody else's favorite?
                        They all knew that each one could not obtain or secure the coveted
                        nomination for his particular friend; and in bringing the names of the
                        respective candidates forward and putting them in nomination, they pledged
                        themselves and their favorites to abide by the decision of the
                        Convention--nominated or not nominated. </p>
                    <p> It was an old aphorism in <emph rend="italic">ante bellum</emph> days, with
                        the unterrified Democracy, that "to nominate was to elect." We hope the same
                        wise action will govern the great Conservative party of the present day. Let
                        no bickering or disaffected spirits create dissention in its ranks. All its
                        members are banded together for one good and noble cause, the overthrow of
                        Radicalism, <sic>villany</sic> and corruption in high places. Let not, then,
                        the few, the very few malcontents swerve the independent voters from casting
                        their suffrage for the nominee of the Convention. All admire the calm
                        dignity and grace with which the majority of the defeated candidates bowed
                        in the decision and fiat of the Convention. It would have been uncourteous
                        and unbecoming in them to have done otherwise. We have no confidence in, nor
                        can we trust the conservative who would "bolt" from the nominee. And it
                        would be and is unpardonable in the defeated conservative candidates to run
                        counter or do otherwise than uphold the nominee of the Convention. To act
                        differently evinces a selfish and unmanly principle, and we hope to see this
                        bad spirit summarily rebuked at the polls on the day of election.--To do
                        otherwise would be setting and holding out a mischievous precedent. </p>
                    <p> On Tuesday next we hope the voters will remember principles and not men.
                        Judge Harris was not the first choice of this journal, but as he has
                        received the Conservative nomination we mean to give him our unqualified
                        support. He may be unpopular in some quarters, and his past course not in
                        accordance with our views, but we have nothing to do with the dead past;
                        ours is the living present and to treat of the future now so auspiciously
                        bright for the invincible Conservatives. John T. Harris may have enemies; we
                        doubt not he has; who is without them? We don't intend to "go back" on a man
                        on that account, or ignore his platform or principles. Every man has
                        enemies, backbiters and slanders, let him be ever so good or popular. No man
                        has ever entered the portals of Heaven without them; and it is very certain
                        that John T. Harris, or any other man will not make his <emph rend="italic"
                            >entree</emph> into the halls of Congress without them, bless
                        their--coffins! We do not <emph rend="italic">hope</emph> Judge Harris will
                        be elected; we do not feel he will be elected; but we <emph rend="italic"
                            >know</emph> he will be elected as sure as the sun rises next Tuesday
                        morning. </p>
                    <p>And now, having said this much, we end as we commenced--No bolting!</p>

                <summary>This article instructs all members of the Conservative party to give their
                    unqualified support to judge Harris in the upcoming election for Congress. The
                    author understands that a great many people supported various other candidates
                    in the Nominating Convention held prior. However, since the result of the
                    Convention was the nomination of Harris, the author, who did not support Harris,
                    nevertheless offers his support now and suggests that all who "bolt" will only
                    be hurting the Conservative party platform.</summary>

                    alternative to John T. Harris. It is not necessary to support Harris out of fear
                    of a radical victory. Reynolds is a viable alternative.</summary>

                    <p> Under this caption a bolter from the Conservative party and an aider of the
                        Radicals, appears in the last <emph rend="italic">Spectator.</emph> It is
                        evident that he does not care what becomes of the Conservative party, so
                        that he defeats its nominee. He seeks to justify himself by saying that
                        Harris once beat Jas. H. Skinner, a nominee. "Augusta" knows the cases are
                        entirely different. In 1857 the Whigs of Augusta held a meeting at their
                        January court and by resolution declared they would <emph rend="italic"
                        >not</emph> run a <emph rend="italic">candidate.</emph> Every Democratic
                        paper in the District came out <emph rend="italic">against</emph> a
                        Convention and invited aspirants to <emph rend="italic">pitch in.</emph> Mr.
                        Skinner and the lamented General Harman announced themselves. Harris
                        followed and after the canvass had been made in every county in the District
                        and it became certain that Harris would be elected--the upper end being
                        divided between Skinner and Harman and the lower end for Harris, then the
                        friends of Skinner began to call for a Convention. Rockingham and Shenandoah
                        then representing a majority of the whole Democratic vote of the District,
                        by large public meetings, said <sic>their</sic> was no necessity for a
                        Convention. Then, "the <emph rend="italic">friends</emph> of a Convention,"
                        not the people held a Convention and nominated Skinner. Harris and the party
                        generally said before the Convention, we will have nothing to do with it.
                        Harris said in a speech in Staunton, that Skinner might go to the <emph
                            rend="italic">Convention,</emph> he would go to <emph rend="italic"
                            >Congress.</emph> In this, Rockingham and Shenandoah, the large
                        Democratic counties, sustained him two to one. </p>
                    <p>Now, how about the late Convention? It was called by Hon. J.B. Baldwin and
                        J.H. Williams, Esq., District Committee. Every County acquiesced and
                        appointed delegates. All hands agreed to have the Convention and abide by
                        it. It was held and the fullest and largest ever held in the District. Every
                        gentleman whose name was before it (except Reynolds and Woodson) says abide
                        by it. The scholar and soldier, Col. Moore, of Clarke, says, "good faith
                        requires all to support the nominee." N.K. Trout, the sterling gentleman and
                        patriot, writes "we must support the nominee." Col. Ward, of Botetourt says
                        the same and so on through the whole list.</p>
                    <p> If it were "treachery" in Harris to run against a Convention not called by a
                        majority of the party with which he said he would have nothing to do, it
                        must be "rank <emph rend="italic">treason"</emph> in Augusta to oppose a
                        Convention, regularly call and demanded by every body in the party. But this
                        is not a question of Harris and Skinner. That matter was settled years ago
                        and ought to have been forgotten and not <emph rend="italic">taken to
                        heart.</emph> But it is a question now of life or death to the Conservative
                        party and if Skinner was its nominee Harris would be found on the stump
                        advocating his claims as the Conservative nominee. </p>
                    <p>A Radical is in the field. He will poll every vote of his party. Let the
                        Conservative party divide--part stay at home and my word for it, Gray will
                        be elected. We cannot count now on Walker's vote, Lewis with all his white
                        Republicans voted for Walker.--They have all gone back to Gray--thus making
                        our vote less and theirs larger.</p>
                    <p>Let the party not look to little things, but to the common cause and rally as
                        one man for its nominee.</p>

                <summary>This article demands that conservative voters put differences aside and
                    support Harris for election to Congress. It seems that the party has divided
                    between two candidates, Harris and Skinner. The problem is a discrepancy within
                    the nominating process--both can make claim to the nomination. The author warns
                    that these divisions will kill the party. Gray, the Radical nominee, will surely
                    win without a rally to the common cause.</summary>

                        solicitation made to him, to become an independent candidate for Congress,
                        and with it the reply of Col. Baldwin to Messrs. Baylor and others card,
                        inviting an expression of his opinion as Superintendent of the Conservative
                        organization. The views of such men carry with them their claims to the
                        earnest attention of the voters of this Congressional District, and
                        constitute in themselves a sufficient rebuke to those who are trying to
                        impair the strength of the Conservative party by useless bickering and
                        unprovoked assaults upon the action of its State Convention.</p>

                    <p> Gents:--I have your kind letter. The complementary manner in which you are
                        pleased to address me, and the highly respectable names subscribed to your
                        communication, demand from me a prompt and candid reply. I have been
                        repeatedly urged to run for Congress and have invariably replied that, in my
                        opinion, I would not be the "right man in the right place," and that, it
                        would not suit me. My name was, without my wish or solicitation, put before
                        the nominating Convention, and I will ever greatly appreciate the very large
                        vote voluntarily cast, in my favor; and were I now at all ambitious to
                        occupy the honorable seat so many are seeking I could not consent to run for
                        it as you propose without <emph rend="italic">violating a covenant</emph>
                        which my friends entered into when they nominated and supported me in the
                        Convention. </p>
                    <p> I trust you will concur with me that I am in "honor bound," under the
                        circumstances to <emph rend="italic">abide</emph> by and <emph rend="italic"
                            >stand to</emph> the nomination. </p>

                    <p>Dear Sir--We feel a deep interest in the preservation of the organization of
                        the Conservative party of the State, and especially in this Congressional
                        District. Being one of its highest officers, we would like to have your
                        views upon the duty of the party, in regard thereto. Hoping a prompt reply,</p>
                    <p>We are respectfully yours, <lb/>George Baylor, <lb/>John Crawford, <lb/> Wm.

                    <p>Gentlemen:--I have just received your note of this date:</p>
                    <p>As superintendent of organization for the Conservative party in Augusta
                        county, and as a member of the State Conservative committee for this
                        Congressional District, I admit your right to call for my opinion as to the
                        duty of the Conservatives of this county and District in the pending
                        Congressional election and I therefore reply: That in my opinion, the
                        preservation of our Conservative organization is too important to be
                        hazarded by any division among ourselves and that it is alike our duty and
                        our policy to stand by the party organization and the party nomination.</p>

                    election as an independent, he responds by stating he was not the "right man in
                    the right place." Further, he vows loyalty to the party by offering support for
                    the Committee's nominee. Several high-ranking Conservatives solicit the opinion
                    of John B. Baldwin, who in turn suggests any divisions within the party will
                    only cause difficulties for the future. He likewise supports the Committee's
                    nominee.</summary>

                    <p>Harrisonburg, Va., Oct., 31, 1870.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Fellow-Citizens:--</emph> A few days since I announced
                        myself an independent candidate for Congress. Since I issued my first
                        address I have visited various portions of the District and have been
                        received with the warmest manifestations of favor by the people. Gentlemen,
                        I have but little more to say to you. I have already told you that I am not
                        a politician and have never worn political harness. I have offered myself as
                        a candidate because of the outrageous frauds perpetrated on the people by
                        the <emph rend="italic">so-called</emph> Convention, held at Harrisonburg on
                        the 18th inst. That body admitted representatives without authority from the
                        people and manufactured delegates who had no authority to bind the people. </p>
                    <p> In Botetourt, my own county, the wishes of my people were outrageously
                        misrepresented and the representative men of the county were prevented by
                        the flood from attending the Convention. I believe that the farming laboring
                        and practical interests of the District have a right to representation, and
                        I know that it is their wish to disregard <emph rend="italic">broken down
                            professional politicians.</emph> I refer to my record as a Southern man
                        as a guarantee for my conduct, should you elect me as your representative.
                        The people have a right to choose and to them I appeal! I have always been
                        true to my people and section and have "no recantations to make or palinodes
                        to sing." I neither ask, or expect Radical support and the enormous
                        Conservative majority in the District--nearly 12000--precludes the
                        possibility of the election of an OPEN Radical candidate with but three
                        candidates in the field. </p>
                    <p>I come before you as an out and out Conservative, and as such am willing to
                        stand or fall.</p>
                    <p>I am of Virginia, with Virginia, for Virginia, first, last and all the time.</p>
                    <p> If I cannot be elected as a true and uncompromising representative of the
                        best interests of our native State, I do not desire to be elected at
                        all.<lb/> C.M. Reynolds </p>

                <summary>This article announces the candidacy of C.M. Reynolds for the Congressional
                    election. Reynolds insists that he is not a politician but has decided to run
                    for Congress as an independent because the nominating Convention was not a true
                    representation of the people. Although not affiliated with a party in this
                    election, Reynolds declares himself of Conservative principles.</summary>

                <summary>Josie B. Richardson, wife of Charles A. Richardson, died on October 13th.
                    She was 18 years old. "A few short months ago she was the blushing bride,
                    but...has gone to her reward of rest, beyond the reach of disease and decline.
                    Mrs. R. was left motherless at quite a tender age but was raised by her aunt
                    Miss Henrietta Brooks, in the way she should go, consequently she was religious
                    in her feelings and life, but did not make a public profession until 1868.
                    Uniting with the Presbyterian Church she lived a consistent life and fell asleep
                    in Jesus." A poem of mourning accompanies the notice.</summary>
