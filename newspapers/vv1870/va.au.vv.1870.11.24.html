<b>For What Have We to be Thankful?</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article discusses the charitable events that surround the Thanksgiving
                    holiday, as well as all the things to be thankful for. While Radicals continue
                    to impose harsh treatment, the author nevertheless points out a number of things
                    that are changing for the better, including, Democratic ascendancy and the
                    "health and plenty" of the land. Thus the author suggests that Virginians return
                    to the "old-time-honored" practice of providing for the poor and needy.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>No where in the world is Thanksgiving Day more duly observed or celebrated
                        with greater zest, or in a more commendable spirit than in New England
                        homes. To day there was a terrible slaughter in the ranks of the feathery
                        tribe, up "few hum," among the Northern blue lights. And among the most
                        commendable acts of charity and benevolence, is that every poor man, woman
                        and child within her realms is treated to roast turkey for dinner, and all
                        are made to feel thankful for once, at least, in the year. The Yankee that
                        would palm off to day a wooden ham or goose on friend or foe, is beyond the
                        redemption even of the old witches of Salem or the saving grace of boneless
                        codfish.</p>
                    <p> From time immemorial it was the custom among all civilized nations to set
                        apart some day during the year, as a day of public thanksgiving, for the
                        abundant fruits which the God of nature and the Seasons vouchsafed to his
                        creature, man.--Thanksgiving was not always rendered up to the Throne of
                        Grace for the fruits of the earth alone, but for the various other
                        manifestations of Divine favor; such as escape from pestilence, victory in
                        battle, deliverance, &amp;c., as set forth by Meriam when the hosts of
                        Israel walked safely through the Dead Sea, and escaped from their enemies
                        and oppressors, the Egyptians. Many precedents can be cited to prove the
                        ancientness of this established custom and its appropriateness. But under
                        the present order of things it's unnecessary and superfluous. The order came
                        under Washington to offer up thanks--for the clemency, doubtless, that we
                        are no worse off, and that we are allowed to breathe, at least--if nothing
                        better--God's free air without interference of
                        Radical bayonets, in this sweet land of liberty (!). Heaven save the mark! </p>
                    <p> For what have we to be thankful? For the
                        enormous, grinding, public debt as a "public blessing!" for the army of tax
                        gatherers devouring our substances that bloated bankholders may revel in
                        luxury and drunkenness? for the hordes of thieving revenue assessors that
                        pollute the land and public decency? for the privilege of being allowed to
                        make laws for our own government according to our way of thinking of right
                        and justice? This is what the Radical satraps require us to be thankful for! </p>
                    <p>But we have many things to return thanks for. That barn-burning, Swearing
                        Phi'l Sheridan is not here, but blind drunk in Germany; that the sword of
                        Cut Throat Hunter hangs palsied and powerless; that Grant's soldiers and
                        bayonets inaugurated a glorious Democratic victory throughout the whole
                        country; that hydra headed Radicalism is on its last legs; that the ladies
                        and gentlemen of the South are not mean Radicals, (for which the Lord be
                        praised!) that health and plenty reign over the length and breadth of the
                        land; that the "skies are bright and brightening," for liberty and
                        prosperity; that our men are brave and chivalrous, our ladies are lovely,
                        virtuous and beautiful, and that our babies are the biggest and best in the
                        world; for those and every other blessing, good Lord make us deeply
                        thankful!</p>
                    <p> Let us, then, duly observe the old-time-honored, custom of the day; let us
                        visit the poor and needy with full hearts and open pockets, and "give to him
                        who has not;" let nothing but pleasant memories cluster round the day, and
                        let it be a charitable as well as a thanksgiving
                        day; as the best half of the year is wasted away in useless grumbling, let
                        us devote one day in the year to thanksgiving and praise. </p>
                    <p> "Teach us to feel another's woe, <br> To hide the fault we see; <br> That
                        mercy I to others show, <br> That mercy show to me. </p>
