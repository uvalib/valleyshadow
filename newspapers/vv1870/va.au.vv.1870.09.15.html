                    <p>
                        Messrs. Jos. A Waddell, John Paris, Leigh R Waddell,
                            D.S. Young, C.T. Cochran and others:
                    </p>
                    <p>Gentleman--I have had the honor to receive your favor on the 9th instant, in
                        which you request me to allow you to announce me as a candidate for election
                        to a seat in the next House of Representatives of the Congress of the United
                        States, subject to the decision of the District Convention, proposed to be
                        held in Harrisonburg, on the 5th proximo.</p>
                    <p>In reply, I beg to say, that if it shall be ascertained that your invitation
                        is in harmony with the general wish of the people of the District, I will
                        not feel at liberty to withhold such service as I may be able to render.</p>
                    <p>In the fall of 1865, I was elected by a District, composed in a large part,
                        of the Counties which constitute the present District, to a seat in the
                        House of Representatives, but was not allowed to qualify. Since that time,
                        my political disabilities, under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of
                        the United States, have been removed, by act of Congress, and in the event
                        of my election now, there would be no legal obstacle to my taking my seat.</p>
                    <p>It may be proper to add that if the voters of the District should honor me
                        with their suffrages, I should labor assiduously to accomplish the
                        following, among other important objects:</p>
                    <p> 1. The immediate removal of all disabilities, resulting from the civil war,
                        and the restoration of harmony and fraternal fellowship between all sections
                        of the country, which the abuses and usurpations of partisan
                        power have hitherto tended to prevent. </p>
                    <p>A tariff for revenue, to cover the expenses of an economical administration,
                        and to meet the just obligations of the Government, as opposed to the
                        existing system of exorbitant protection for special monopolies, and
                        undisguised partially for favored interests.</p>
                    <p>3. Reduction of the present odious and oppressive scale of taxation, both as
                        applied to imports and internal revenue.</p>
                    <p>4. Rigid economy in every department of the Government, and retrenchment of
                        expenses.</p>
                    <p>5. Reform of the public services in all its branches, civil military and
                        naval.</p>
                    <p>6. A sound National Currency, equally distributed among the States, and
                        protected against speculation.</p>
                    <p>7. The rights of intelligent labor against all selfish combinations to
                        degrade and deprecate it.</p>
                    <p>8. Legislation by which the public lands will be received for actual settlers
                        and as a resource of national credit, in opposition to the Radical policy of
                        enormous grants to speculators and corrupt schemes of approximation for the
                        benefit of one portion of the country at the expense of the other.</p>
                    <p>9. Aid from the Government of the U.S. in the most available form, to
                        complete the line of Water Communication between the Chesapeake and Ohio.</p>
                    <p>10. Strict and impartial neutrality in the contests between other nations,
                        cultivating friendship with all and entangling alliances with none.</p>
                    <p> In conclusion, Gentlemen, I pray you to accept my profound acknowledgements
                        for the confidence which you have shown to me, and for the very flattering
                        terms in which you have been pleased to convey your invitation.<br> Very
                        respectfully, <br> Your ob't servant, <br> Alex H.H. Stuart </p>
                <br>
