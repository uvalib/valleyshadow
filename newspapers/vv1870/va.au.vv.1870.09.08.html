<b>Nomination for Congress</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article advocates the election of A.H.H. Stuart to represent Augusta
                    County in Congress. While he had previously been elected, he was disallowed his
                    seat because he neither could nor would take the iron-clad oath. Now, however,
                    his political disabilities have been removed by an act of Congress, therefore,
                    the author states that it is Stuart's duty to attempt reelection. He hopes that
                    the Harrison Convention delegates cast their votes for Stuart, one of the few
                    who possess the qualifications necessary to represent the District.<br>(Names in announcement:  A. H. H. Stuart)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As we stated last week, the choice of Congressmen is restricted to two
                        classes, to wit. Those who can take the iron clad oath, and those whose
                        disabilities have been removed, and who consequently, are not required to
                        take it. There are not, in this District at least, a great many of either
                        class who possess the other requisite qualifications to make suitable
                        representatives in the National Legislature. We should be represented by the
                        very best that can be selected from the few who possess the requisite
                        qualifications.</p>
                    <p> Without any discouragement to others in other portions of the District, we
                        think we are justified in saying that Augusta county can present in the
                        person of one of her sons, whose disabilities have been removed, the peer,
                        in talents, character, public service, legislative experience, and claims to
                        popular support, of any that can be presented by any county in the District.
                        As the reader has no doubt anticipated, we allude to Hon. A.H.H. Stuart, who
                        was a few years ago elected, by a triumphant majority, to represent this
                        District in Congress, but was refused admittance because he could not and
                        would not take the iron clad oath. This would not be required of him now, as
                        his political disabilities have been removed by act of Congress. We suppose
                        the delegates to the Harrisonburg Convention from this county, will vote to
                        secure the nomination of Mr. Stuart, if he be willing to accept it. [We
                        write in ignorance of his wishes upon this subject.] He was elected, but was
                        prevented from serving by a cause which did him honor--it was because his
                        sentiments were in accordance with those of the great mass of citizens of
                        the District--because he was a true exponent of the people whom he was
                        elected to represent. The fact that he would, in truth, represent the people of this district, was the reason why he
                        was, by Radical policy, prevented at that time from acting as their
                        Representative. Besides his indisputable qualifications to make an able and
                        faithful representative, the fact that he was prevented from serving, for
                        the reason we have stated, gives him special
                        claims to the support of the people--such as no other in the District can
                        present. </p>
                    <p>It seems to us that it is due to themselves that the voters of the District
                        should re elect Mr. Stuart. The right which was wrongfully denied them, they
                        now have an opportunity to exercise, and we think it is their duty to do so.
                        The right to be represented in Congress by the person of their choice was
                        then denied the voters of the District. That right, if their choice be the
                        same, cannot be denied them now. If elected, he must be admitted, and that,
                        too, without taking the oath. This would be a victory over the body which
                        had violated the rights of the people of the District--"a consummation
                        devoutly to be wished."</p>
                    <p> The above is taken from the last issue "of the Staunton Spectator, and heartily endorsed by us. We hope it may be the
                        pleasure of the Harrisonburg Convention to do themselves the honor of
                        nominating the honorable gentleman, who possesses, in a pre-eminent degree,
                        all the necessary qualifications, to faithfully and efficiently represent
                        us. </p>
