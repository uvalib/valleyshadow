<b>Croakers and Croaking</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article begins by describing local "croakers" who cast a gloomy shadow
                    on events of the day. These croakers epitomize pessimism. They see only the
                    negative aspects of political activity and bemoan current agricultural
                    deficiencies in an exaggerated manner. Yet, with all this croaking, the author
                    reassures his readers that times are soon to improve. He suggests, rather, a
                    spirit of optimism and enumerates the many ways, such as new railroads, mineral
                    resources, and an influx of enterprising men, that guarantees a prosperous
                    Virginia.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are in every community, a set of men who may be called the Ravens of
                        society. They are always discontented. They see every object through a dark
                        medium--They never look at the bright side of things. To them, everything
                        wears a somber aspect. They predict the failure of every enterprise, and
                        seem unhappy if their prophesies are not fulfilled. With such men money is
                        always scarce, and going to be scarce--a financial crisis is always at hand,
                        and certain ruin just a little way ahead. In their view, property has
                        attained a fictitious value, and is destined, very soon, to suffer a serious
                        decline. Growing crops are always unpromising and the price of the grain on
                        hand is steadily falling! If their counsels were heeded, no new enterprises
                        would be undertaken; no new houses built, no new stores opened, no new
                        factories set on foot!</p>
                    <p>Two weeks ago they were ready to prove to you, by irresistible logic, that
                        Virginia would not be admitted into the Union without the iron-clad--and now
                        they are equally confident that the Federal Government is going, with
                        railway speed, to the ______ bad! and that nobody will get their ice houses
                        filled this winter!</p>
                    <p>We might fill a column, with details of the subjects of croaking, and another
                        with a description of the manner in which they croak! But in mercy to our
                        readers we forbear.</p>
                    <p>We beg to say to our readers that mid winter is the carnival of croakers. The
                        weather has almost as much influence on men of this stamp as it has on trees
                        and flowers. Amidst the frosts and ice of winter the spirits of the masses
                        become depressed. The sap goes down in men, as it does in the vegetable
                        world, and animation is, to some extent, suspended, in both. During this
                        season, men take gloomy views of things. They sympathize with the dreary
                        scenes by which they are surrounded. They see everything stagnant, locked up
                        in icy fetters, and their hearts become chilled within them. Approach some
                        classes of men, at this season, with a proposition for a new venture in
                        business, which promises a most bountiful return, and they see in it nothing
                        but failure and disaster!</p>
                    <p>But wait until the winter breaks! Wait until the mantle of snow melts from
                        the earth, under the soft breath of Spring! Wait until verdure clothes the
                        hills, and the birds begin to chirp among the budding trees, and the flowers
                        to spring up in the sunny vales, and you will find a corresponding man who
                        had looked so distrustfully on all your propositions!--You will find that
                        the sap has risen in him as well as in the trees and shrubs! He too begins
                        to bud and blossom, under the genial influence of the vernal sun! All things
                        now wear a new aspect in his eyes--cheerfulness has taken place of
                        despondency. Hope like a rainbow spans and paints with its brilliant hues,
                        the murky clouds that had overshadowed his horizons! Confidence--that plant,
                        which is, ordinarily, of such slow growth,--springs full grown, like Minerva
                        from the brain of Jove--in his breast!--He is ready to enter with vigor and
                        alacrity upon any new enterprise which presents a reasonable prospect of
                        success.</p>
                    <p>We are led to make these remarks because we often hear people croaking on our
                        streets. They say money is scarce--trade is dull, the value of property is
                        declining--business is overdone--too many houses have been built, too much
                        money has been wasted in bricks and mortar--ruin is imminent--the stay-law
                        is about to expire--and we are all bound to--Deny Jones'!</p>
                    <p>My dear friend! It is the frost and the ice that speak through your lips!
                        Just wait till the spring opens, and you will see things in a very different
                        light. When the genuine frogs begin to croak, their human compeers will
                        cease their dolorous notes!</p>
                    <p>In surveying "the situation" we must acknowledge we see little to croak
                        about.--Everything seems to promise to Virginia and Virginians a bright a
                        cheering future. The state has now been restored to her position in the
                        Union. We are relieved from military rule, and we have every reason to
                        expect a fair and stable government, administered by officers of our own
                        choice. True, the terms on which we have been received, have not been such
                        as would have been most acceptable to us. But although they are distasteful,
                        they are not, practically, very hurtful. They amount to very little, and we
                        can almost afford to laugh at the impotent malice of Sumner, Drake &amp;
                        Co., which imposed them on us.</p>
                    <p>The restoration of the State will be followed by a restoration of confidence
                        and a revival of credit. A new impulse will be given to business. Immigrants
                        will flock to Virginia to occupy and improve our exhaustive lands.
                        Intelligent and thrifty white labor will take the place of the slovenly and
                        spiritless operators who are daily wending their way to the cotton States.
                        Our mines and coal fields will be opened, our agriculture improved and
                        diversified. Manufactures will spring up at our water-falls and prosperity
                        will spread through all our borders.</p>
                    <p>The best barometer by which to measure the condition of a country is the
                        stock-market. Applying this test, we find that Virginia State bonds have
                        advanced in a few weeks from $36 to $50, a rise of 14 per cent. This is but
                        the beginning of the end. As wealth and population seek a domicile here new
                        confidence will be inspired not only in the tax paying capacity of our
                        State, but in its willingness to redeem in good faith, all its obligations.
                        The apprehended predominance of the negro vote in the State naturally
                        created distrust in the minds of capitalists. But the raped exodus of that
                        class of our population, and the influx of men of industry and means, have
                        dissipated all apprehensions of repudiation, or inability to pay.</p>
                    <p>Looking nearer home, we see that the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio R.R., that
                        great improvement--that highway of wealth and prosperity, which is to empty
                        into the lap of Virginia, not merely the treasures of our own mountains, but
                        the accumulated stores of the West, and of the countries beyond the Pacific,
                        is now on the eve of completion. In little more than a month the contracts
                        for the work will be let out. Between the Ohio and the falls of Kanawha
                        probably five or ten thousand hands will be at work within the year. And at
                        the eastern base of the Alleghany between Millborough and the White Sulphur,
                        we shall in less than three months, have two thousand men with a full
                        complement of mules and horses, employed on Lewis Tunnel, and the great
                        falls at Millborough and Jerry's run.</p>
                    <p>The employment of such a large number of men and animals, will open an
                        extensive market for our agricultural supplies. Staunton will be the base of
                        supply and Augusta and Rockbridge must furnish the grain, the meat, the
                        flour, the hay, the potatoes and everything for their support and comfort.</p>
                    <p>Let our farmers then be of good cheer! Let them put out large crops of oats
                        and corn. Let them raise all the hogs they can. Let them out and bale all
                        the hay their farms will produce. All will be needed and more than they can
                        supply. The railroad gives ready means of transporting all we have to sell.
                        The new company proposes to deal on cash principles. It has boundless means,
                        and it will pay as it goes. The old picayune style of doing business under
                        the auspices of the old Central road will be repudiated. The purchase of
                        horses, mules, provisions and supplies of implements of all kinds will throw
                        vast amounts of money into circulation. This will infuse new life and energy
                        into our community. Business of all kinds will be more active and
                        cheerfulness will take the place of gloom.</p>
                    <p>Nor is this all. In two years from this date the entire work will be done.
                        And what then? Who can venture to tell! We venture to predict that within
                        three years from the completion of the road we will have not less than 50
                        trains per day passing along the line, freighted with passengers and with
                        the wealth not merely of the great West, but of "Ormus and of Ind!"</p>
                    <p>By that time the iron works west of us will be in the full tide of successful
                        operations and will be pouring their rich tributes into the Eastern
                        cities--our coal fields will be opened furnishing the power which is to
                        operate hundreds of factories along the line of the improvement. Our own
                        town will be the centre of a great iron and coal interest, and the site of
                        rolling mills and other manufactories. A large coal trade will spring up
                        here and a way side traffic in all the commodities brought along the line.</p>
                    <p>Now there is time to prepare for this trade. Now is the time to erect the
                        necessary buildings and be ready to catch the trade as it flies.</p>
                    <p>But we feel that it is hardly necessary to say anything on this subject. A
                        word to the wise is sufficient. We have an enterprising and a live
                        population. Their past history proves it. What community has displayed so
                        much energy and industry and keen intelligence as ours? what people have
                        made such good use of their means, or done so much to improve the advantages
                        of their position? Where have so many buildings been erected and so many
                        improvements accomplished? Where can be found better churches, better
                        schools, better public institutions, better buildings, better society,
                        better people?</p>
                    <p>But we must stop. Our citizens will doubtless understand the future, that is
                        before them, and will not fail to improve every opportunity of adding to
                        their wealth and prosperity.</p>
