<b>The Coming Issue</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author outlines the coming issue in this article and suggests that it
                    will bring about an end to Radicalism. The issue of revenue reform, supported by
                    Democrats in the West, has caused a split in the Republican party. Assuredly,
                    the author predicts, more and more Republican reformers will unite with the
                    conservatives to undermine Radical plans toward protectionist tariffs. This new
                    issue, he says, "will change the entire complexion of the House."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> Since the judgment of the country, says the Hagerstown Mail, has been so distinctly recorded against negro suffrage,
                        expectation is naturally directed towards the coming issue, which is, in
                        itself, easily solved and determined. The "coming issue" is that issue which
                        springs out of Revenue and Taxation, and is involved in the most insidious
                        of all description of taxation--the Tariff. The coming issue is virtually
                        between Free Trade and Protection, but Free Trade is now known as Revenge
                        Reform in the Great West, and it is in favor of "Revenue Reform" that a new
                        party is fast being formed in that region out of the Republican party which
                        is now in a state of dissolution. It was under this new banner, with the
                        enfranchisement of white men superadded, that Gratz Brown, a Republican, was
                        elected Governor of Missouri by forty-thousand majority. And it was as
                        advocates of Revenue Reform (that is, antagonism to Protection) that the
                        heavy gain of Democratic Congressmen in the West was achieved. It is now
                        announced, and a more glorious announcement has not been made for ten years,
                        that in the next Congress the Democratic Conservatives united with the
                        Revenue Reformers of the late Republican party, will be in the majority;
                        and, consequently, will control the action of that body. This is synonymous
                        to the death of the Radical Party, and that organization will, thereupon,
                        sink as rapidly into oblivion as did its predecessor--the Know Nothing
                        Party. Such men as Cessna, who, having been repudiated by the people at the
                        polls, expect to obtain seats in Congress through the numerical strength of
                        party, will thus find themselves sadly mistaken, as the new issue will have
                        produced as entire change in the complexion of the House--a change which
                        will be fatal to such acts to tyranny in the future. </p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article points to the importance of good roads in Augusta County. More
                    than any other improvement, including railway and canals, roads are beneficial
                    to the prosperity of the county. Good roads are the first things prospective
                    settlers look for when deciding on where to purchase property, and good roads,
                    open at all seasons, benefit farmers who must move their produce to market.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The value of good county roads, kept in a condition fit for travel at all
                        seasons of the year, is scarcely to be estimated. We contend that,
                        proportionately to their cost, they enhance the value of real estate as much
                        or more than railroads or canals; and that the neglect to keep them in
                        proper condition results in an actual loss to the general community, in each
                        and every year that they are suffered to remain unrepaired. A stranger
                        coming into a particular neighborhood or section of the county, with a view
                        to purchase a farm, for instance, is first impressed with the fact of the
                        good or bad condition, as the case may be, of the public road by which he is
                        taken to view the particular property, and that condition influences him,
                        most frequently to a great extent, in his ultimate decision in regard to a
                        purchase. We venture the assertion that the experience of every land agent
                        in the State will bear us out in citing such an example. And it is, of
                        course, evident to the most casual observation, that every land owner in the
                        State is a loser, every year, if he has not a highway open at all seasons,
                        by which his produce can be readily and easily placed in a market, at such
                        times when the best prices are to be obtained. One of the chief advantages
                        we expect to see realized from the construction of a railroad through the
                        central portion of our county, will be the improved condition of the
                        highways conducting thereto, from every neighborhood, as the necessity of
                        convenient access to it will most certainly compel this improvement.</p>
