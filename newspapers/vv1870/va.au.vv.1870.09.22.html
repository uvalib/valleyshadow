<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Staunton, VA. Sept. 20th, 1870.<br>Mr. G. P. Fitzgerald</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir:--Your favor of the 16th just received, and it gives us pleasure to
                        respond. The class of settlers in behalf of whom your inquiries are made, is
                        just the sort we want among us. As for the character of inducements offered
                        to immigrants--we Valley people are vain enough to think that the sun of
                        Heaven never shone upon a country combining more natural advantages. With a
                        delightful climate, a generous soil, inexhaustible store of minerals,
                        abundant water power, and, just here particularly, a geographical position
                        most fortunate, in view of the rival railroads approaching from the North,
                        and to intersect here with the great trunk line of the West. All we want for
                        the development of our country is more of the right sort of people. This
                        section is rallying fast from the general prostration which followed the
                        war. There is a greater demand for skilled labor--especially house-builders
                        and machinists, than ever before.</p>
                    <p>Staunton is a live town, population some five thousand, exclusive of the
                        large number of strangers from all quarters brought here by our Female
                        schools, now at six in number, and all first-class. Within a few hours ride
                        we have Washington College and the University of Virginia. So you see we do
                        not lack educational advantages. Our bar is inferior to none in the State,
                        and numbers some forty practitioners. Of course, no professional man of
                        standing would associate himself with a stranger, without opportunity to
                        judge of his capacity and merits, but if your son should come he will find
                        among them none but courteous antagonists. We have also some twenty
                        practicing physicians, but room for more.</p>
                    <p>Honest, well meaning, and industrious men are always welcome among us,
                        whatever be their country or calling. The people here are decedents of the
                        old Scotch-Irish stock--frugal and industrious themselves. They have not
                        been so active in politics as our neighbors East of the Blue Ridge--they
                        recognize the right of every man to entertain his own opinions, so he does
                        not thrust them down the threats of the "Klu Klux spirit prevailing," that
                        is all stuff and nonsense, and serves for a jest with our northern friends
                        who have taken the trouble to inform themselves. The men who fought with
                        Stonewall Jackson are not the sort to become midnight marauders; and now
                        that we are suffered to govern ourselves, no occasion ever arises for the
                        strong arm of the Law to put down any such disturbances.</p>
                    <p>Hoping that any of you who think of moving to Virginia will just come and see
                        for themselves, we are</p>
                    <p> Very Respectively, &amp;c, <br>Editors Valley Virginian. </p>
