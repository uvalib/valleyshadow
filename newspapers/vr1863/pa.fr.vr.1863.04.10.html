<b>Indignant</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article castigates those females who have voiced outrage at the Village
                    Record's use of the term "copperhead" to describe rebel sympathizers.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Indignant.--We learn that some of the female
                        sympathizers with the rebels in this place are very indignant at us for
                        employing the term "copperhead." It is all right for persons to cheer for
                        Jeff Davis and Stonewall Jackson on the streets after night, and swear that
                        they are ready to shoulder their guns to oppose the Government, under the
                        pretence of driving, as they term them, the abolitionists from power. This
                        and more has been done, but it is wrong in the estimation of these
                        shallow-pated creatures, to term such, "tories" or "copperheads." The emblem
                        is appropriate, and we would advise all such to adopt the "copperhead"
                        breast-pin.</p>

                    Legislature adopted a series of resolutions that denounced Lincoln and his

                    called for a "General Convention" of the states to meet in order to amend the
                    Constitution to suit the interests of the South.<br>
