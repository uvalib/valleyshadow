                <transcript>
                    <p>Nine gentlemen, all residents of Whitfield county, North Georgia, arrived in
                        this city last evening, having fled from Rebel oppression. They crossed the
                        Tennessee river at a point near the mouth of the Hiawassee, and from thence
                        crossed the mountains into Kentucky. They gave a fearful account of the
                        state of affairs in the South. The reign of terror is complete, and they
                        assure us that it is worth as much as a man's life to withhold his
                        sympathies from the rebellion. The actual necessities of life are beyond the
                        reach of families in ordinary circumstances, as the bill of current prices
                        will indicate. These gentlemen inform us that pork is selling in Northern
                        Georgia at 30 cents per lb., salt at $1.75 per lb., corn at $2 to $3 per
                        bushel, wheat at $6 per bushel, sugar at 75 cents per lb., shoes at $10 per
                        pair, and boots at $75, eggs at $1 per dozen, chickens at $1 each, and other
                        articles in proportion. The scarcity of salt is so great that many persons
                        make use of the dirt in their smoke-houses which has been saturated with
                        salt, extracting the saline matter from it, wherewith to cure their meat.
                        There is also great suffering in the Rebel army, and the Augusta Chronicle
                        asserted recently that a body of two thousand six hundred troops marched
                        into Richmond without shoes. Commissions have been appointed in some
                        districts to take an account of the amount of corn and other produce in the
                        possession of the residents, who are not permitted in any case to hold more
                        than is necessary for their subsistence until the next crop shall have
                        matured, and if a family should be found tinctured with loyalty to the
                        Federal Government, all their means of subsistence is seized and
                        confiscated. These refugees, in their flight from rebel oppression,
                        travelled in the by-ways night and day, sometimes paying guides as much as
                        thirty dollars for their services for a single night.</p>

                <summary>A report that "nine gentlemen" from Whitfield County, Georgia, arrived in
                    Louisville after fleeing from "Rebel oppression." According to their accounts, a
                    "state of terror" reins in the region; absolute support for the Confederacy and
                    its war aims is expected and required of all who live there. Additionally
                    oppressive, they say, is the economic situation which continues to deteriorate
                    under the weight of hyper-inflation.</summary>
