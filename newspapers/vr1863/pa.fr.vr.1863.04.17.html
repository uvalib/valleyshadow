<b>General Jackson and a Colored Soldiery</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A transcript of a speech reportedly delivered by Gen. Jackson to members of
                    the "colored" militia in 1814. In the address, Jackson referred to the soldiers
                    as "Americans," and urged them to fight the British as their patriotic duty.
                    Jackson also declared that the colored soldiers were to be compensated on the
                    same terms as their white counterparts.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Headquarters, 7th Military District, Mobile, September 21, 1814.</p>
                    <p>"To the Free Colored Inhabitants of Louisiana:
                        Through a mistaken policy you have heretofore been deprived of a
                        participation in the glorious struggle for national rights in which our
                        country is engaged. This no longer shall exist.</p>
                    <p>As sons of freedom, you are now called upon to defend our most inestimable
                        blessings,</p>
                    <p>"As Americans, your country looks with confidence to her adopted children for
                        a valorous support, as a faithful return for the advantages enjoyed under
                        her mild and equitable government. As fathers, husbands and brothers, you
                        are summoned to rally around the standard of the eagle, to defend all which
                        is dear in existence.</p>
                    <p>"Your country, although calling for your exertions, does not wish you to
                        engage in her cause without amply renumerating you for the services
                        rendered. Your intelligent minds are not to be led away by false
                        representations. Your love of honor would cause you to despise the man who
                        should attempt to deceive you. In the sincerity of a soldier and the
                        language of truth I address you.</p>
                    <p>"To every noble-hearted, generous, freeman of color, volunteering to serve
                        during the present contest with Great Britain, and no longer, there will be
                        paid the same bounty in money and lands, now received by the white soldiers
                        of the United States, viz: one hundred and twenty-four dollars in money, and
                        one hundred and sixty acres of land. The non-commissioned officers and
                        privates will also be entitled to the same monthly pay and daily rations and
                        clothes, furnished to any American citizen.</p>
                    <p>"On enrolling yourselves in companies, the Major-general commanding will
                        select officers for your government from your white fellow-citizens. Your
                        non-commissioned officers will be appointed from among yourselves.</p>
                    <p>"Due regard will be paid to the feelings of freemen and soldiers. You will
                        not, by being associated with white men in the same corps, be exposed to
                        improper comparisons or unjust sarcasm. As a distinct, independent battalion
                        or regiment, pursuing the path of glory, you will, undivided, receive the
                        applause and gratitude of your countrymen.</p>
                    <p>"To assure you of the sincerity of my intentions, and my anxiety to engage
                        your invaluable services to our country, I have communicated my wishes to
                        the Governor of Louisiana, who is fully informed as to the manner of
                        enrollment, and will give you every necessary information on the subject of
                        this address.</p>
                    <p>Andrew Jackson,<br> Major-General Commanding.</p>
                    <p>At the close of a review of the white and colored troops in New Orleans,
                        December 18, 1814, General Jackson's address to the troops was read by
                        Edward Livingston. A portion of it was particularly addressed to the colored
                        soldiers, which we append:</p>
                    <p>"To the Men of Color: Soldiers! From the shores of
                        Mobile I collected you to arms--I invited you to share in the perils and to
                        divide the glory of your white countrymen. I expected much from you, for I
                        was not uninformed of those qualities which must render you so formidable to
                        an invading foe.--I knew that you could endure hunger and thirst, and all
                        the hardships of war. I knew that you loved the land of your nativity, and
                        that, like ourselves, you had to defend all that is most dear to man. But
                        you surpass my hopes. I have found in you, united to those qualities, that
                        noble enthusiasm which impels to great deeds."</p>

<b>A Copperhead Corns Pinched</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A rebuttal to an article that appeared in the Chambersburg Valley Spirit,
                    assailing Capt. Barnitz, one of the Records's correspondents. The controversy
                    was sparked by the captain's "abolitionist" views and his declaration that
                    disloyal northerners should be "strung up to the telegraph poles along the

                    <p>A Copperhead's Corns Pinched.--The copperhead
                        organ, of this county, the Valley Spirit, this
                        week devotes almost a column of slang to Capt. Barnits, our New Berne
                        correspondent. It appears that the Transcript
                        recently published a letter from the Capt. in which he expressed the wish
                        that disloyal men North might be "strung up to the telegraph poles along the
                        railroad." This had the effect to raise the ire of the Spirit man, and hence his abuse of the Captain. The editor says
                        the Captain is a "blatant abolitionist," and "wrote dirty, contemptible
                        articles in the Village Record, assailing and
                        villifying many of the oldest and most highly respected inhabitants of that
                        vicinity." This is one of the many lies which the article in question
                        contains. Captain Barnitz at no time assailed through our columns any person
                        or persons, except "copperheads," like the editor of the Spirit--men who cheer for Jeff. Davis, declare that they are
                        ready to shoulder their guns to fight against the government, swear that
                        Jeff. Davis is a better Union man than President Lincoln, that Jeff. Davis'
                        constitution is "shust the zame" as ours, that our government is a "tam
                        tyranical government and ought to be proken up," and who have in various
                        other ways given the most convincing evidence of disloyalty. These therefore
                        are the parties whom the "copperhead" editor terms "most highly respected
                        inhabitants."</p>

                            played out!--Things here away.
                    </p>
                    <p>Like the tocsin-peal of victory, the news of the resurrection of Northern
                        patriots, broke upon us a few days ago; and oh, the enthusiasm that burst
                        out in every camp! every face beamed with gladness, every heart was
                        lightened of its despairing weight; no victory, however great and splendid,
                        even to the taking of Richmond, could have occasioned such universal joy and
                        mutual good feeling among the patriot soldiers. Here and there, to be sure,
                        some sneaking whelp, having foisted himself upon the government, in order to
                        have the opportunity of breeding discontent among the soldiers, but more
                        especially to get his rations, would skulk along, with hang-dog look and
                        sullen mien; discovering his vicious heart and traitorous feelings; but
                        generally there was joy, open beaming joy, and from ten thousand hearts went
                        up a thankful prayer for the final awakening of the Patriots so long
                        dormant, or who had been looking on with a morbid indifference, while the
                        fabric of the Union was shaking on its foundation, and almost ready to
                        totter to ruins. Since Beauregard's proclamation exhorting his hosts to call
                        all Union men abolitionists, his allies in the North, seeing that thus they
                        could deceive the masses and array them against the government, spreading
                        discontent and sewing disaffection, broadcast, took up the cry, and every
                        true patriot, every one who dared to raise his voice in behalf of the
                        government, every one who favored the vigorous prosecution of the war, the
                        confiscation of Rebel property or the subjugation of the Rebels, the only
                        means of crushing the Rebellion was trumpeted forth an abolitionist, and
                        execrated as an enemy to liberty. Indeed, so utterly blinded were many of
                        their followers, so utterly and hellishly deceived and betrayed and belied,
                        that they would have seen our armies annihilated, and rejoiced; and would
                        have thrown their garments in the way, for that arch-traitor, Jeff. Davis to
                        ride over in his triumphal entry to our Capitol!</p>
                    <p>But thank God, the film has fallen from their eyes, in good time, the bubble
                        of black corruption has burst, and clearer, brighter skies glow around us,
                        and was it not wonderful, that men of substance, self-deluded, tarried so
                        long upon the mine, that threatened every day to explode and engulf them and
                        their all in an abyss so deep that all the energies of posterity for ten
                        centuries could not resurrect them! We do not realize the terrors and
                        calamities that Anarchy spreads, when a nation falls under her rule; neither
                        can we appreciate the difficulties attendant upon the organizations of new
                        institutions, else these hell-begotten miscreants who are plotting the
                        destruction of this fabric of liberty established and defended by our
                        illustrious forefathers, would now be hanging from tree-tops, objects for
                        the execration and loathing of patriots all over the civilized world!</p>
                    <p>Let the fires of Liberty, re-enkindled, be kept steadily burning; let that
                        patriotic association, the Union League, be established in every city, town
                        and township, throughout the North, gathering together men of every name and
                        party, where sentiments fresh from the fountains of truth and loyalty may be
                        interchanged, and, where, like Murius, they may renew their oaths of
                        allegiance, and swear to live or die for their country. Then may the
                        traitor-demons howl and plot, and lie and hiss, as they see their hopes of
                        agrarianism, dissolution and anarchy scattered to the winds; the army of the
                        Union; inspirited, encouraged, increased, jubilant, will march on from
                        victory to victory, annihilate the last stronghold of Rebellion, and show to
                        the world that a Republic has within itself a
                        self-sustaining power, that princes were not born
                        to rule and nations only to obey.</p>
                    <p>Last night our pickets were again driven in; our brave boys dashed off after
                        the Rebs; but, inasmuch, as we have heard no firing, we presume they have
                        vamosed as usual.</p>
                    <p>There are about 8000 contrabands here, working on the R--R--cutting wood for
                        the government, and raising a regiment. Schools are established for the
                        youth, and it is surprising to see the avidity and ease with which they
                        study and learn; how their eyes glitter with every new [unclear], with what
                        satisfaction they enter the school-room, how attentive, as if they feared
                        they might miss something; it makes one feel humble to see the efforts these
                        youth put forth to attain knowledge, and it is a grand omen for the
                        amelioration of the race. As soldiers, they evince the same traits,
                        attentive, active, quick to learn, ambitious, and above all courageous; and
                        I will guarantee when put upon the field they will surprise even the
                        cowardly copperheads! The Union is safe! The Rebellion will be crushed in
                        six months! and these unchained people, fierce under the stings of recent
                        goads, will dash down before them the nabobs, who would have kept them in
                        eternal bondage, ignorance and degradation, for their own gratification, to
                        administer to their own selfish wants. What a fearful retribution will be
                        visited upon these traitors who, like Satan, dissatisfied with prosperity,
                        with a government the most benignant ever known, with evil immunities and
                        privileges, unknown to the people of other nations, and with an enslaved
                        race to produce the necessaries of life, to jump at their bidding, to fan
                        them while they sleep and tremble when they wake,--who thus favored, thus
                        pampered, attempted at one fell blow, to dash down the government, and
                        establish one, exclusive as China, proscriptive as Spain with nigger heads
                        for foundation--stone, pillar and dome!</p>
                    <p>Our regiment the 158th, is in high good spirits and health, though deploring
                        the absence of our gallant Col. D. B. McKibben, who on the night of our
                        search for the Rebels, near White Oak river, while riding through the forest
                        broke the fibula of his right ankle; his horse having gotten his leg into a
                        post-hole, and fallen upon him.</p>

                    its time of need. While Bittner was away "putting down" the rebellion, tragedy
                    struck his family when his wife and children contracted a fatal illness. Having
                    spent thirty days recovering from his grievous losses, Bittner relates that he
                    will be returning to his unit to continue the fight to preserve the country.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>When I was drafted to assist in putting down this Rebellion, I left my wife
                        and little ones in your care; and went forth to do battle for my country,
                        relying upon your benevolence and generosity.</p>
                    <p>I have not been deceived. While enduring the scorching rays of a Southern sun
                        by day, and the damp dews of heaven by night, the weary march, the lonely
                        post, and drenching rains, Death,--the King of Terrors--visited my
                        fatherless household, and bore the partner of my bosom and two of my little
                        ones, unresisting captives to the Spirit land. Upon receipt of this
                        heart-rending news, I went to my commanding officer and obtained a furlough
                        for thirty days; to visit my death-stricken family. I arrived just in time
                        to witness the last moments, and kiss the fevered brow, of my oldest child,
                        who has gone to keep her mother company, amid the shining spheres of
                        deathless glory.</p>
                    <p>To you, I return my heartfelt thanks, for your unbounded kindness and
                        sympathy, manifested toward my family during their illness, and my absence;
                        and I shall ever remember with a grateful and thankful heart, your noble,
                        self sacrificing, and philanthropic exertions in behalf of my family. I am
                        now about to rejoin my regiment and come weal or woe, I will cling to the
                        flag of my country. That flag torn by Treason's bullets, baptized by the
                        blood of patriots, and kissed by every breeze of heaven; shall be my flag still! I am amazed to find men in your
                        midst who claim to be Union men, abusing the country that has fed them, and
                        fondled them in her lap of ease. They will not fight to "free the negro,"
                        they say, but they will fight to fasten the fetters of thraldom upon their
                        own limbs, and like cringing spaniels, follow the bull dog of
                        Treason--Jefferson Davis--to his very kennel! Loyal men of the North! Beware
                        lest "Peace men" and "Copperheads," ruin the cause in which we are embarked,
                        and rivet the shackles of slavery upon us all.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully yours,<br> Solomon Bittner<br> Private, Co. E. 158th Reg't P.
                        I.</p>
                <br>
