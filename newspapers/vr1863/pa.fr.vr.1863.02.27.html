<b>It Surpasses Uncle Tom's Cabinet</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An extract from a speech delivered by Gen. Butler in which the commander
                    recounts several anecdotes that reveal the depth of depravity occasioned by the
                    institution slavery.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In one of Gen. Butler's late speeches at the East, he said:</p>
                    <p>He had on reading Mrs. Stowe's book--"Uncle Tom's Cabin,"--believed it to be
                        an overdrawn, highly-wrought picture of Southern life, but he had seen with
                        his own eyes, and heard with his own ears many things which go beyond her
                        book as much as her book does beyond an ordinary school-girl's novel. He
                        related an instance of shocking demoralization of society at New Orleans.
                        There came into his office a woman, 27 years of age, perfectly white, who
                        asked him in proper language if he would put her in one of her father's
                        houses. Her history was this: Her father had educated her in the city of New
                        York, until she was between 17 and 18 years of age, and taken her to one of
                        the metropolitan hotels, where he kept her as his mistress. Not relishing
                        the connection, and desiring to get away from him, she went to New
                        Orleans--he followed her, but she refused to live with him, at which he
                        whipped her in the public street, and made her marry a slave. She afterwards
                        resumed the unnatural relation, and went to Cincinnati, but was brought back
                        by her husband, or father, with a child, belonging to somebody. Her father
                        fled from the city at the time of its occupation by the United States
                        forces, leaving her in a state of destitution. She wanted to live in one of
                        her father's houses, but her story was not credible, and he determined to
                        investigate it. To his surprise it was found to be well known, and testimony
                        of its truth was obtained from A, B and C without difficulty.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding this fact, widely known as it was, this man could be elected
                        in Louisiana, in the city of New Orleans, a Judge of one of the Courts. On
                        one occasion, one of his aids brought before him a young woman almost white,
                        who had been brutally whipped and turned out of the house of her father. For
                        this outrage the man had been made to pay a fine of $1,000 and give the
                        woman a deed for emancipation. [Applause.] These were the kind of charges
                        which had been brought against him. [Cheers; and cries of [unclear].] Yes,
                        no right minded man could be sent to New Orleans without returning an
                        unconditional Anti Slavery man, even though the roofs of the houses were not
                        taken off and the full extent of the corruption exposed. All the lower class
                        of the people of New Orleans were loyal. During the first fourteen days
                        after the Union forces entered the city, 14,600 took the oath of allegiance
                        and, when he went on board the steamer, on his return to the North, at least
                        one thousand laboring men came down upon the levee, and uttered no words
                        except those of good will to him as the representative of the Government.
                        General Butler continued by saying that the war could only be successfully
                        prosecuted by the destruction of slavery, which was made the cornerstone of
                        the Confederacy.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article contends that, despite their opposition to the war, common
                    whites in the South are forced to support the Confederacy. "If the power of a
                    wealthy and almost unanimous consolidated slaveholding minority were broken," it
                    argues, "a large majority of the citizens of the south would to-day be for the
                    Union." It is only out of the "fear of the dungeon, the halter, and the sword"
                    that "the voice of southern loyalty" has been silenced.<br>

                        guerilla chiefs with armed bands of desperadoes, had not recruited the rebel
                        armies; if a military tyranny, more terrible than Austrian despotism, did
                        not stamp out the first symptoms of resistance; if it were not high treason
                        to hinder the circulation of confederate notes; if the power of a wealthy
                        and a most unanimous consolidated slaveholding minority were broken, a large

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Emancipation Bill. The Senate on Thursday week
                        passed the bill to aid Missouri to emancipate her slaves by 28 Yeas to 18
                        Nays. This is purely a measure of national defence against a great and
                        imminent peril. Slavery in Missouri has already put the Nation to an expense
                        of at least One Hundred Millions within the last two years and is certain to
                        cost much more unless eradicated. If it was right to buy Louisiana in order
                        to secure the West to the Union, it is clearly so to purchase the slaves of
                        Missouri in order thereby to protect the National existence against an
                        instant and deadly peril. In no possible contingency must Missouri be lost,
                        and her loyalty in this crisis may save the Union. If this bill be passed,
                        she is with us evermore.--New York Tribune.</p>
