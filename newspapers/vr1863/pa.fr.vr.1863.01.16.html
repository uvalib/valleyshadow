<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Election of U. S. Senator.--The election of Mr.
                        Buckalew by the Legislature of Pennsylvania as U. S. Senator, over such a
                        man as Hughs, Randall and others of like ilk, must prove gratifying to all
                        loyalists. His election certainly affords sympathisers with treason no
                        grounds for exultation. We doubt not some persons in this town who threw up
                        their hats at the announcement of his election, will find that their little demonstration was premature by the time they
                        shall have digested the following paragraph which we extract from Mr. B's
                        address on being conducted to the Chair:</p>
                    <p>"While the heart sickens at this loss of life and expenditure of treasure,
                        let no loyal man hesitate as to our future course. The Union should, and I
                        trust, will be preserved. The Constitution respected and the laws enforced,
                        at whatever expenditure of life and money; the interest involved demands the
                        sacrifice. It should be the ardent prayer of all just men that the cause of
                        this unhappy strife, which is plainly apparent should be stricken down.
                        Christians, patriots and philanthropists throughout the world, will approve
                        this course, and peace when conquered, will be perpetual. Let the
                        administration rise to a higher appreciation of its duties to the people.
                        Let there be no jealousies, no exhibition of party strife, no sympathy with
                        rebels. Opposition to the constitutional authorities in
                            this struggle to maintain and preserve the Government by all legitimate
                            means, whether by force of arms or by proclamations calculated to weaken
                            and destroy the power of the government, and to remove the cause of the
                            strife forever, is little short of TREASON. Let us, then, in our
                        action here on the question at least, as may be
                        presented, show our devotion to the government, to the interest of our
                        children, and to the cause of civil liberty throughout the world."</p>

<b>The Small Pox</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Several "mild" cases of small pox have been reported in Chambersburg, but,
                    as yet, the "loathsome and terrible disease" has failed to make an appearance in

<b>Election of U. S. Senator</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Lauding the election of Buckalew as "gratifying to all loyalists," the
                    article contends that the new Senator will not relent in prosecuting the war to
                    its end. The piece employs an extract from Buckalew's victory speech to validate
                    its position.<br>
