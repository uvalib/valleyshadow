                <commentary>"Below we give the proceedings of the brave soldiers of Illinois who are
                    now in the field battling for their country, and we commend it to the attention
                    of the secession sympathizers in Pennsylvania. It may not be long before the
                    patriotic soldiers of the old Keystone State, who are pouring out their blood in
                    defence of their country, will speak also, in tones that cannot be
                    misunderstood, their views and their feelings in reference to traitors at home,
                    who are striving to weaken our own Government, and strengthen the rebels in
                    their hellish assault upon the liberty of our country. It is too much to suppose
                    that the brave hearts who have left their houses and families to fight the
                    traitors of their country, will allow traitors at home to stab them in the back
                    while they are fighting to defend the homes and firesides. These traitors at
                    home will learn that the patriotic soldiers of Pennsylvania, like the brave boys
                    of Illinois, "despise a sneaking traitor in the rear, much more than an open
                    rebel in front." We say, therefore, to these traitors at home who are trying to
                    weaken the hands of the government, and thus strengthening the rebels against
                    whom our brave boys are contending, BEWARE, or you will hear a voice from those
                    brave hearts who are in the army of Pennsylvania, that will make your teeth
                    chatter with fear, for your cowardly and treasonable conduct -- Read the
                    proceedings of the brave boys of Illinois:"</commentary>

                <summary>A copy of a set of resolutions drafted by officers from Illinois. The
                    resolutions are designed to illustrate the troops' continued support for "the
                    vigorous prosecution of the war" and the "President and Government in all their
                    efforts to put down this rebellion." The decision to issue the declaration was
                    largely motivated by the officers' disdain for "the bitter partisan spirit" that
                    has divided their state legislature as growing numbers of "traitorous"
                    representatives join the chorus of those calling for the cessation of the war.</summary>

                    <p>"I've got tired fighting for the niggers," said a discharged soldier, coming
                        up from the Portsmouth Grove Hospital, on the steamer Ferry the other day.
                        "I've done enough of that business, and I have a brother in the army, who I
                        wish was out of it. I am not going to fight beside <emph rend="italic"
                            >niggers</emph>. I consider myself a good deal "above them." He seemed a
                        smart, likely fellow, quite free to express himself on almost any subject,
                        and especially free to censure those above him. He spoke of drunken officers
                        and grinding quarter-masters in depriving the men of their rations, and was
                        very free in condemning the head officers of the hospital; complained loudly
                        of the poor living and would like to shoot a number of men. After listening
                        awhile to him, I inquired what he meant by fighting for niggers, as he
                        called it. 'Why' said he, "the President's proclamation shows that's all
                        we're fighting for."</p>
                    <p>Are you not mistaken? The President is only detaching from the rebel army and
                        rebel sympathizers, that body of men and women who raise their provisions,
                        tend their farms and plantations, look after their stock and provide for
                        their families, and earn the money by which they can carry on the war;
                        which, if the slaves did not do, the white men would have to do the things
                        now done by the niggers. That would take so much from their fighting
                        material and thus weaken their strength. Most of them, too, are loyal, and
                        are forced into the trenches against their will. Now the President, in
                        proclaiming emancipation is only detaching these loyal men from the rebels
                        and bringing them over to our side, and by that means aids in putting down
                        the rebellion. Suppose the rebels were using a great many oxen, by which
                        they successfully carried on their operations against us, and the President
                        found out some means by which he could detach the oxen from them and make
                        them serviceable to him in putting down the rebellion, would you refuse to
                        fight on the plea that you were only fighting for oxen?</p>
                    <p>The soldier admitted at once the argument and said, why don't some one show
                        it in its true light? We have been told we were fighting for the niggers,
                        and no one intimated the contrary. I intimated that was the way the <emph
                            rend="italic">N. Y. Herald</emph> and papers of that class represented
                        the matter, not because they did not know, but because it was for their
                        interest to deceive.</p>

                <summary>An anecdote about a discharged soldier who was overheard voicing
                    indignation at the prospect of white soldiers fighting to free slaves. Upon
                    being confronted by the writer of the article about this opinion, and informed
                    of the justification behind Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation
                    Proclamation -- to deprive the South and the Confederate Army of its primary
                    labor force -- the soldier tempered his stand. The writer then explained that
                    the root of the ex-soldier's erroneous belief lay with the "N. Y. Herald and
                    papers of that class," which have misrepresented the matter, "not because they
                    did not know, but because it was for their interest to deceive."</summary>
