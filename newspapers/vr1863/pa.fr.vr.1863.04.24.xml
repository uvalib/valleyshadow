                    <p>When this rebellion shall have been suppressed--and it cannot last long at
                            longest--<emph rend="italic">every actor in it</emph> will receive honor
                        or dishonor. Every American, high or low, <emph rend="italic">is</emph> an
                        actor in it. He can't escape it if he would for neutrality is in itself
                        defection and disloyalty. It will be known and remembered how every man bore
                        himself in this crisis of the nation's life--every man from ocean to ocean.
                        With men in general it will not be written on the page of history; but it
                        will be written on a tablet yet more distinct, the living memory. Ten,
                        twenty, thirty, fifty years hence it will be inquired about, and it will be
                        known how every American who was on the stage in the Great Rebellion then
                        acted, whether he took sides for or against the Government; and every man,
                        woman and child in the country will understand it. The honor and dishonor of
                        it will cleave not only to the individual himself, but to his children.</p>
                    <p>There are those living who remember the odium which, after the Revolution,
                        clung to every Tory to his latest breath. No intellectual accomplishment,
                        nor any moral worth could exempt them from it. But more than that, it was
                        transmitted to his children and his children's children. Even to this day
                        the American whose ancestor at that time was known as a Tory, hears of it
                        with burning shame. Similar contempt was entailed upon the blue-light
                        Federalists of the last war. So far as regards the private character of its
                        members, the Hartford Convention of 1814 was probably equal to any political
                        assembly ever held in this country; but after the war closed every man of
                        them to his dying day was held in dishonor. He could no more obtain a public
                        office than if he had been positively disqualified by law. The ban of public
                        opinion was upon him. Though it was very clearly shown in subsequent years
                        that the majority of the Convention had no such treasonable intentions as
                        imputed to it, yet it is enough that it was a peace assemblage calculated to
                        embarrass the Government. To this day the Hartford Convention is a by-word
                        and reproach. There were Federalists who did not approve of the Convention,
                        and yet even they do not fully escape. It is still everywhere a reproach to
                        have been at that time an opponent of the Administration at all.</p>
                    <p>What hath been will be--only in greater measure. The revolutionary Tory at
                        least had the apology of retaining his <emph rend="italic">original</emph>
                        loyalty. The peace Federalists of the last war acted against the Government
                        only in its external relations, and the peace they sought involved no vital
                        injury to the nation itself. But the copperhead of the present day proves
                        false to all loyalty, and is recreant in a sense which the Tory was not. He
                        is traitorous, too, in a sense in which the last war Federalists was not;
                        for his peace policy inevitably carries with it the disruption and
                        destruction of the Republic, while the other peace policy would not have
                        affected the unity and perpetuity of the Republic at all. There has been in
                        American history no public treachery so unqualified, and so utterly
                        incapable of extenuation, as that of the Copperhead of '63; and which was
                        followed with such a terrible reckoning as will be hereafter exacted for
                        this.</p>
                    <p>So far as regards the judgement of the next generation, a man of the present
                        day had better commit almost any crime in the calendar, than be guilty of
                        furthering the ends of the rebellion by advocating peace, or in any other
                        manner. He might better leave his children without a dollar than entail upon
                        them the scandal of a father who turned against his country in the day of
                        her extremity.</p>

                <summary>History, promises the editors, will not look kindly upon northerners who
                    were sympathetic to the Confederate cause. Like the Tories who supported the
                    British during the War of Independence, they are on the wrong side of history;
                    yet, the editors concede, at least the Tories could account for their behavior
                    by claiming to have "the apology of retaining" their "original loyalty."</summary>

                    <p>Copperhead papers every where (says the <emph rend="italic">Hanover
                        Spectator</emph>) are making bitter and malignant attacks upon the Union
                        Leagues and charge among other things that they are <emph rend="italic"
                            >secret oath bound associations</emph> intended to "suppress public
                        sentiment by <emph rend="italic">the sword and bayonet</emph>."</p>
                    <p>As for the "Loyal Union Leagues" we know that the best and purest men of the
                        country of <emph rend="italic">all parties</emph> belong to them. We know
                        that General Scott is President of one in New York, and Edward Everett of
                        another in Boston. We know that they are as open as the noonday sun in all
                        their transactions, that they have neither signs; oaths, nor any secret
                        machinery belonging to them, and that the only pledge asked, which is a
                        tacit pledge of honor, is the following;</p>
                    <p>"We pledge ourselves to an unconditional loyalty to the Government of the
                        United States, to an unwavering support of its efforts to suppress the
                        rebellion, and to spare no endeavor to maintain, unimpaired, the National
                        Unity, both in principle and territorial boundary. The primary object of
                        this League is, and shall be, to bind together all loyal men, of all trades
                        and professions, and all parties, in a common union to maintain the power,
                        integrity and glory of the Nation."</p>
                    <p>Now, we want to know if any loyal man can object to subscribe that pledge? We
                        think not, and we advise all loyal men in every township and borough of the
                        country to organize a League on this basis. If it accomplishes nothing else
                        it will draw the line between the loyal and disloyal, and will be a useful
                        record to preserve until this war is ended.</p>

                        Maryland, but near the line of this county, was in this place on business
                        during Court week. On Saturday evening, after having attended to his
                        business, he was arrested by the Provost Guard for disloyalty to the
                        Government of the United States, and sent to Fort McHenry. His son has also
                        been arrested on a like charge.--<emph rend="italic">Repository &amp;
                            Transcript</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Since the above arrest was made we have had an opportunity to converse with a
                        reliable gentleman from Helser's vicinity who represents him as one of the
                        most violent "copperheads" of that section; and who has done more to poison
                        the minds and breed disloyalty among the people of his neighborhood than all
                        the disloyal there put together. Yet the <emph rend="italic">Valley
                        Spirit</emph>, the "copperhead organ," pronounces the arrest "Another
                        Outrage," and even goes so far as to indulge threats of resistance to future
                        arrests. The editor must have recently been on a visit to the Berks' "Barn
                        Association." The recent discovery made in "auld Berks," of several hundred
                        conspirators, <emph rend="italic">in arms</emph>, to resist the authorities
                        of the government, he calls "an immense Mare's Nest." One of his apologies
                        for these oath-bound traitors is, that they "were <emph rend="italic"
                            >honestly</emph> opposed to the conscription bill," and "were determined
                        to test its constitutionality in the courts."--Consistency for once! Give
                        the fellow credit.</p>
                    <p>The publication of a disloyal sheet, in Franklin county, violent enough to
                        eminate from the heart of rebeldom, is certainly "an outrage" upon loyal
                        citizens, and hence it has long been a wonder why the government permits
                        such filthy rags to circulate.</p>

                <summary>The article notes the arrest of Solomon Helser for disloyalty, and
                    criticizes the reaction of the Valley Spirit, a Democratic organ, which
                    condemned his arrest as "Another Outrage." In contrast to the Spirit's benign
                    characterization of Helser, the piece relates that he is known throughout his
                    community as "one of the most violent 'copperheads'" in the region.</summary>

                    <p><emph rend="italic">More Bread Riots</emph>.--Petersburg, Va., papers give a
                        meager account of a bread riot which occurred in that city about ten days
                        since. They do not dwell on particulars, but there can be little question
                        that it was one of no small magnitude and significance. Deserters from the
                        rebel army at Savannah report disturbances there, which must soon break into
                        a serious revolt. The demand for bread is too imperious to be overlooked,
                        and the rebel authorities must heed it; but how? There is nothing in the
                        confederacy with which to give relief. Peace alone will bring low prices and
                        plenty, and that can only be purchased at their own humiliation, and they
                        are not willing to pay the price. But the people will soon compel them to
                        surrender. The plan of starving the south into submission, once so
                        ridiculed, is now deemed feasible; and all we have to do, is to administer
                        two or three more Murfreesboro' flagellations, and keep their ports
                        blockaded for six months, and we will have the peace which might have been
                        concluded ere now, had not the rebels been encouraged by the peace party of
                        the North, from whom they expected supplies, if not active assistance.</p>

                <summary>Lately, says the article, there have been several incidents of civil unrest
                    in the South. In addition to the tumult in Richmond, riots have occurred in
                    Petersburg and in Savannah, all of which were related to the scarcity food. "The
                    plan of starving the south into submission," the piece contends, though once
                    "ridiculed, is now deemed feasible."</summary>

                <summary>It is reported that Joe Hooker has finally been apprehended. Hooker, "who
                    so successfully carried on horse stealing in the region last winter," was
                    arrested after he sold a couple of horses to a black man in Washington city,
                    then stole them back the next day and sold them to another man. Hooker was
                    caught after his first victim became suspicious after he recognized the horses.
                    Hooker will be brought to Franklin county to stand trial for his criminal
                    activities, though his partner "Yank" managed to escape the authorities'
                    dragnet.</summary>

                        composed mainly of persons from distant parts [unclear] Counts was convened
                        in the Court House, in Chambersburg on Tuesday evening, the 14th inst., to
                        take measures for forming a <emph rend="italic">Union League:</emph> The
                        meeting was organized by placing Geo. W. Zeigler of Greencastle, in the
                        Chair. On taking the chair Mr. Zeigler made a few pertinent remarks, urging
                        the necessity of Union, and our duty at this crisis of forgetting party and
                        remembering country only. Robert Mahon, of Green, Col. John Shirtz, of
                        Mercersburg, John Riley, of Chambersburg, and Dr. C. T. McClay, of
                        Greenvillage, were made Vice Presidents, and Geo. O. Seilhamer and D. A.
                        Wertz, of Chambersburg, Secretaries.</p>
                    <p>On motion of C. S. Eyster, Esq., a committee of five was appointed by the
                        chair, to draft resolutions. That committee consisted of C. S. Eyster,
                        Snively Strickler, I. H. McCauley, John Ditzler and J. A. Hyssong, who
                        retired for a short time for that purpose. Meanwhile, Col. A. K. McClure
                        made a strong and eloquent appeal in behalf of the Union. The Committee
                        returning reported the following resolutions:</p>
                    <p>We the undersigned, citizens of Chambersburg, and its vicinity, do hereby
                        form ourselves into an association called <emph rend="italic">the Union
                            League of Chambersburg</emph>, for the purpose of co-operating with
                        similar associations throughout the State and county, upon the principles
                        embraced in the following Resolution, which has been adopted in other places
                        as a basis of action, for all true and earnest lovers of the Union
                        throughout the country, and we do earnestly urge upon all the friends of the
                        government throughout the different Districts of the county at once to go to
                        work, and form similar Leagues.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That we do hereby absolve ourselves from
                        all party, excepting that great party of American Freemen, who are
                        determined to stand by the question of National unity and Free Government.
                        To this great party we cordially tender the hand of fellowship and unity,
                        and we call upon all the Union loving citizens of Franklin county to stand
                        by the Government and the Administration with one accord, to aid in
                        maintaining it with all their might and power, and means and credit, and to
                        exhibit no hesitation or flattery until our arms are triumphant and peace
                        restored throughout the land.</p>
                    <p>On introducing the resolutions, I. H. McCauley, Esq., made a stirring and
                        patriotic speech which was responded to by loud cheers, and a long list of
                        names of the men who are willing to be known to be for their Country. On
                        motion of Judge Carson, the proceedings of this meeting be published in all
                        the loyal papers of the County. The League then adjourned to meet at the
                        house of Jacob S. Brown, on Saturday evening next, to perfect its
                        organization.</p>

                            Washington N.C.--Our boat stranded on Point Marsh Shoals, Pamlico
                            Sound,--a terrific storm--The terrors of the scene--issue of the
                            Expedition.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>My last letter closed with our starting out on a second expedition, and I
                        promised to give you details, but, inasmuch, as I have already sketched it
                        for the <emph rend="italic">Repository &amp; Transcript</emph>, and as
                        events are thickening so rapidly about us, fuller of interest, I must drop
                        that portion of our history, eager as I am to acquaint those interested in
                        us, with every incident of note. Our Brigade seems doomed to labors and
                        trials that fall to the lot of none other in this army corps; owing to the
                        fact, I am informed, that our term of service expires so soon; hence, the
                        next three months we will be a brigade mobile, for certain; or as our
                        inimically jolly Doctor expresses it, Hell will be to play and no one to
                        turn the wheel! Well, we had returned from our second expedition; had
                        enjoyed the mellow warblings of the birds, and the soft balmy sunshine,
                        several fine spring mornings; had innocently entertained the idea, that
                        several days, perhaps weeks, of uninterrupted repose, a delicious season to
                        expend in communicating with our loved ones at home, and the newspapers, the
                        only two sources of pleasure the soldier wots of--when a "solitary horseman"
                        came plunging over the bridge with an envelop half as long as his arm,
                        sticking out of his bosom; says I "Sam my the jig's up!" My neighbor, the
                        captain, scratches his head and takes a mouthful of--beard! I tell Dark to
                        stand as attention! "Fry mush and fish immediately!" <emph rend="italic"
                            >Things fry!</emph> Marching orders! Ten days rations! Start off at four
                        o'clock; this is Sunday of course. The streaming sun is fleeing through the
                        sky pursued by ravenously dark-looking clouds; there is no rain here
                        unaccompanied by howling storms. Rain begins to fall; the storm-king fairly
                        yells, as if maddened by our desecration of the Sabbath day. In the rains,
                        in the storm, and with gloomy feelings or savage desires to see the
                        cross-barred Gens in--in an unreasonably uncomfortable quarter for a short
                        time, we slide through the mud to the <emph rend="italic">wharf!</emph> Ah!
                        that will do! A splendid steamer the Thos. Collin, receives us on her
                        capacious decks. Our gallant Col. D. B. McKibben having been seriously
                        injured whilst deploying skirmishers near Pollacksville one very dark night,
                        his horse having fallen with him,--is, much to the regret of all not with
                        us; hence, my friend, the Lt. Col. is in command, with scaled orders in his
                        pockets. Off steams the taut steamer, spurning the descending torrents, the
                        heavy wafts of Notus, blowing defiance in her very jaws, and the lowering
                        heavens thick with dire portents. All went well till we reached the mouth of
                        the Neuse where Aeolus seems, by times to unloose all his rebellious
                        prisoners; and now they played the Devil without pitch--vide Dr.--Our good
                        ship heading northward, received the splashing waves tumbling inward from
                        the sea star-board, which set her to rolling violently.--I must here
                        mention, tis the <emph rend="italic">proper place</emph> that the Col.
                        unsealed his orders, and announced that we were to proceed immediately to
                        Washington N. C. to relieve Gen. Foster--well, the fury of the storm
                        increased with the descent of night--shadows, pitchy and thick, and
                        sheet-rain swept down with redoubled fury: the rolling of the boat began to
                        affect the men, and up came Jonah from every quarter; pale-faces, sighs and
                        groans were everywhere. Oh! horrid the feeling! Every roll of the boat is
                        like a fresh pill to the sick. Utterly reckless, you care little whether you
                        live or die; for there is no relief! The poor fellows lay stretched on
                        decks; indifferent whether under shelter, heedless of all orders or duties,
                        knowing only how miserable they were, and deploring their sad fates. Little
                        did they reck of the trials and terrors, leaping like sea-waifs, just now on
                        the very bow of their boat: for in the darkness; in the rain, in the general
                        distress, the ship had unaccountably gotten out of the channel, having
                        drifted several miles sea-ward, and now behold! the cry is heard the ship's
                        aground! In vain the engineer applies the steam, reverses motion, changes
                        position of the men, &amp;c. &amp;c.; hard and fast she sticks <emph
                            rend="italic">amidship</emph>, bow and stern, rocking! "Twas 9
                        0'clock--night, storm increasing and hurling wave after wave, upon the
                        doomed vessel. Finding it impossible to dislodge the ship, the Captain
                        commanded our rations to be cast overboard; and barrels of pork, beef,
                        coffee and sugar, their heads driven in, were given to the waves, and
                        thousands of pounds of hard Tack, candies, etc. were scattered on the
                        waters, which, by day-dawn, we saw ravenously snatched up by the huge flocks
                        of sea-gulls, gathering around us from all quarters, warbling in mockery of
                        our terrible condition. Thirty tons of coal were now cast overboard; the
                        boiler pipes were opened, the last hope, and all the water, about twenty
                        tons, drawn off,--and yet there was no relief. With every blow of the
                        fast-striking waves, the timbers of the vessel creaked, and gave way; and
                        the flooring of the cabin would raise as much as four inches. Signal-guns
                        were fired from the dock, schooners would come in sight, but fearing to
                        approach the treacherous shoals, would sail away. At noon, the Captain
                        declared that if not relieved in eight hours, the ship would fall to pieces!
                        The Col. asked for volunteers to attempt a return in a small boat to New
                        Berne, for assistance, Lt. Stover, Company G. and Lt. Beaver Comp. I offered
                        themselves. At two o'clock, with the pilot and several other men, they gave
                        themselves to the waves. With an extemporised sail, the little boat fairly
                        flew before the storm. With what anxiety we watched her, as she danced from
                        crest to crest, by time, scarcely visible through the mist. We had great
                        confidence in the cool bravery of the Lieuts; and our only hope of escape
                        from the perils environing us, being in their success, we never doubted
                        their safe arrival at New Berne. By 9 o'clock P. M. they presented their
                        dispatch to A. A. G. Col. Hoffman at head-quarters! having accomplished the
                        distance, about fifty miles in seven hours! Meanwhile we lay sick and
                        suffering on the Collier, still rolling and receiving the stoutest blows of
                        Neptune infuriate. Another night of terrors and apprehensions is passed;
                        here a few are praying earnestly for deliverance, thinking doubtless of
                        Paul's troubles when shipwrecked; there a little crowd are singing hymns,
                        while others stand and look with unblanched brows, determined to meet their
                        fate like heroes. Amid the howlings of the storm signal guns were still
                        fired, and signal lights displayed all [section illegible] still saving the
                        rainy [illeg] committed with his own though [illeg] there was no [unclear]
                        every wave dashing against the ship, stirred the very heart's blood, for the
                        ship was expected to break asunder and bestow her living freight to the
                        naiads of the sound! Morning broke over us once more, thank God! exclaimed
                        many a one. Oh! how anxiously we looked toward Neuse river for the expected
                        succor! how wearily the hours passed! Night was again approaching! "Are they
                        not coming?" was asked, oh, how often! Now the storm begins to abate, "A
                        sail!" was now shouted. They are coming for us; she comes on, but, oh, she
                        passes on, hoarded with soldiers. But <emph rend="italic">there!</emph>
                        another comes in view; she stops, and receives us. Oh, what a weight of
                        suspense is removed. Now we sail toward our destination. We reach Palmico
                        river next morning, arriving within six miles of Washington we are suddenly
                        brought to, by the announcement that the Rebs, had placed batteries along
                        the shore that would destroy us. We cast anchor. The gun-boats were sent
                        for; they arrive next day; attack the batteries, but can make no impression
                        upon them. They fear to run the gauntlet; for while floundering about the
                        Rebs erected more and powerful batteries in such positions as to thoroughly
                        command the channel. It is determined finally to place our regiment upon two
                        schooners, and in tow of steamers, run us through the gauntlet, and had our
                        Col. not refused to bear the responsibility, the naval officer in command
                        would have sent us up, and the undersigned and 700 as good men as ever
                        carried a musket, would this moment afford a festival for some King and
                        Queen fishes! We got home this morning. Before we left <emph rend="italic"
