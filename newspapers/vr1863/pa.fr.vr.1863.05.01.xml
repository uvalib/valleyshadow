                <summary>The editors seek to clarify the misconception that they categorize all
                    Democrats as "copperheads." They assert that the term is used exclusively to
                    identify "TRAITORS," those men who "rejoice over the reverses in the Union army"
                    and "cheer for Jeff Davis." In fact, they "make no distinction" "between a loyal
                    democrat and a loyal man of any other party."</summary>

                    From there, the pair were escorted "beyond the Federal lines into Dixie." The
                    punishment was carried out on the order of Gen. Schneck.</summary>

                    printers of the county, but to the people at large." Moreover, it "compels men
                    to do that which is directly in opposition to their own interests."</summary>

                        This portion of the taxable interest of the people, it is anticipated, will
                        be among the most prolific sources of income yet resorted to by the
                        Government, as the income for salaries in various public positions were
                        never greater than now. The regulations of the law, among other things,
                        provide that every farmer or planter will be required to make a return of
                        the value of his produce, without deducting for the labor or services of
                        himself or family or for any portion of such produce consumed by himself or

                    <p>New Berne, N. C.<lb/> April 8, 1863.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">The 18th Army Corps in Motion--Flight on Bay river--The
                            march</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>On the 8th, I despatched you a communication in which a description of our
                        expedition to relieve Gen. Foster, and the issue thereof, was detailed. I
                        had not finished writing it, before an order was proclaimed. I believe I
                        stated that marching orders were issued before we got off the boat--that we
                        were to be at Foster's landing by one o'clock A. M., and as the subscriber
                        was still at work at 12 o'clock, he judged it wise not to go to bed at all,
                        but to prepare rations for the journey. The reveille now sounded through the
                        camps; the men were roused from their profound slumbers, for they had slept
                        but little for a week previous, and were surprised at the suddenness of our
                        starting; none but officers being informed. By the lambent light of a sweet
                        round moon, beaming, oh, how beautiful! upon us, we crossed the
                        R--R--Bridge, marched through New Berne, quiet in sleep, all unconscious of
                        our movements,--arrived at the landing, immediately embarked upon old rafts,
                        ferry-boats etc., and in tow of steamboats, crossed the Neuse, and encamped
                        on the opposite bank, until the whole army corps, consisting of about 12,000
                        men, got over. You cannot conceive the labor, trouble and expense of moving
                        12,000 men, with the horses, the artillery and caisons, the ambulances, the
                        quartermasters teams, surgeons carts, etc.; thirty six hours were consumed
                        in the crossing. A second time we were moving to relieve Gen. Foster, still
                        besieged by the Rebs in Little Washington. The enterprise was hazardous, as
                        we were leaving New Berne, comparatively without defenders, and the Rebs
                        threatening its capture. About two o'clock the column commenced to move, the
                        N. Y. V. Regiments, as usual, firing the pine forests as they proceeded so
                        that the left wing were compelled to march through a forest of fire; and
                        when you consider that every pine tree is covered with a coat of pitch from
                        one to three inches thick, you can conceive the fury of the conflagration,
                        the hissing, cracking and sweeping of the flames, the turpentine poured out
                        from the tall trunks in countless jets, looking like a shower of rain, and
                        these igniting before they reached the ground, made one general ocean of
                        flame as far as the eye could reach. The march through sweet water swamp
                        reminded us of our journey through the Dismal Swamp last January, the road
                        being often under water two feet deep; the chuck-holes being frequent, the
                        artillery, wagons, and ambulances, frequently stuck, horses fell,
                        precipitating their riders; then the shouts and oaths of riders and drivers,
                        the splashing and floundering and tumbling about in the mud, produced a most
                        ludicrous scene. It is wonderful how patient the horses have become under
                        the hard usage and neglect to which they are subject. When mired or fallen
                        they do not struggle and exert themselves, but lie quietly until everything
                        is prepared for their extrication. The march was maintained until eleven
                        o'clock P. M. when we encamped. Early in the morning we were again en route,
                        expecting to join battle with the Rebs on the west bank of the Pamlico by
                        noon; and we were not disappointed. The artillery being in the advance,
                        about four o'clock and suddenly, its thunders broke the stillness and
                        announced the commencement of the battle. The column halted, formed line of
                        battle, and prepared to move to the left of the artillery. I expected to see
                        uneasiness and trepidation depicted on many a face; but was surprised to
                        find the men all--excitement, busy conjecturing, filling their canteens or
                        eating their supper, Elden cross, because he was not to make fire and cook
                        his coffee; Emory dodged down and went to sleep; jokes were plied. "Down on
                        them! Pitch in lively! Let the dogs loose! Aye, aye, sir! Johnny, Hoover,
                        Tallhem, Shatzer, roll in for supper! How are you Rebs!" and other such
                        exclamations common among the boys, were heard along the line, as is usual
                        in camp! The Rebs had been expecting us; had planted a battery in easy range
                        of the road, and as soon as our advance came within it, they opened with
                        shell. At their first fire, made before Capt. Belger, had his battery in
                        position, two horses were killed and one man wounded! Captain Belger himself
                        at the same instant was fired upon by a sharp-shooter, and wounded in the
                        thigh. Now our artillery opened, and boom, boom, boom, away went the shells,
                        exploding over the Rebs, and filling the forests with reverberating thunder.
                        The 17th Massa. V. being in the front poured a volley across the slough, the
                        bridge over which had been destroyed, with what effect I have not learned.
                        The fight lasted an hour, when the Rebel battery was silenced. Our army
                        immediately started to return! a move we cannot yet understand; but if
                        reports are true, our gunboats, during the fight, stormed the batteries
                        along the river, and gained Washington; thus accomplishing the desired end;
                        our army immediately marched homeward in quick time, as our absence
                        imperilled New Berne! On our arrival at New Berne, we saw the large
                        transport steamer, Escort, receiving a regiment, doubtless for Washington.
                        Thus we have tricked the Rebs. "Three days rations to be cooked
                        immediately!" Mercy! Will we have no rest? Won't some one interested in the
                        success of our arms, let the authorities know that this army corps, is
                        cursed with boy aides, who are nuisances! that the 'cavenly face of the
                        Paymaster has not as yet shone about us?</p>
