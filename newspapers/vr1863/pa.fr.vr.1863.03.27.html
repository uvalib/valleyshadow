<b>The Voice of the Soldiers</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A copy of an appeal drafted by officers in the 44th New York Regiment,
                    affirming their commitment to the President's policies and their disdain for
                    northern "traitors" who continue to agitate against the war effort.<br>

<b>Look at This</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A transcript of the resolutions "unanimously adopted" by the 11th Penn.,
                    contradicting rumors that troops in the Army of the Potomac are demoralized. The
                    resolutions also condemn rebel sympathizers as the source of the misinformation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We take the following from the resolutions unanimously adopted by the 11th
                        Pa. regiment, and may be regarded as the universal sentiment of the army:</p>
                    <p>In view of the persistent efforts made to misrepresent our views and feelings
                        at home, while we are absent in the field, we deem it eminently fitting that
                        we declare to our countrymen and to the world our sentiments and
                        determinations.--Therefore,</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the reports so industriously
                        circulated by those who sympathize with the Rebels, that the Army of the
                        Potomac is demoralized, are an unjust reflection upon the officers and men
                        composing that noble command, and are, in themselves utterly and basely
                        false, and have their origin in the traitorous proclivities of those who
                        ignore their nationality and hate the Government that protects them.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That those who cast such imputations on
                        the loyalty, courage, and obedience of the soldiers engaged in this terrific
                        conflict, are guilty of inflicting a grievous wrong upon men who have
                        volunteered to fight their battles and defend their rights. They would rob
                        them of their noble traits, which are the boast and pride of the soldier,
                        his ardent love of country, his prompt and unquestionable obedience to
                        orders, his voluntary sacrifice of domestic comforts, his willing separation
                        from home and friends, his patient endurance on the march, and his heroic
                        courage on the field of battle. We hold these cowardly traitors in contempt,
                        and would infinitely prefer that they would openly join their fellow
                        conspirators in the South and meet face to face, rather than attempt to stab
                        our reputation, in a manner which allows us no means of redress.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"Only Poor Men to be Drafted.."--The frequent
                        allegations of the tory press throughout Pennsylvania, whose positions upon the question of Union or Disunion are perhaps not
                            yet fully determined, that the conscription law compels only poor men to
                            enter the army are ridiculous. It will be seen by reading the
                        clause in relation to substitutes, that the fine provided for exemption is
                        not fixed at any particular sum, but shall not
                        exceed three hundred dollars. The drafted man is allowed to procure
                        his own substitute, at any price he may agree upon, or, if he prefers, the
                        Government will provide one for him at a price not exceeding $300. Did not
                        the law contain this limitation, the price of substitutes would in all
                        probability range much higher than that sum. The rich, being able to pay,
                        would bid high, while the poor would be unable to pay the price to which
                        over-bidding would raise the substitute market. Thus, instead of being an
                        oppressive provision, the $300 restriction is actually for the benefit of
                        the poorer classes. The provision under which the Government undertakes to
                        furnish substitutes for a sum not to exceed $300, is in fact one of the best features of the bill.</p>

<b>Negro Troops</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>From the headquarters of the Army of the Republic, news has circulated that
                    the rebels are "eking out their strength" by mixing black and white soldiers.
                    Yet, the piece notes, there has been "no protest from the copperheads" against
                    the Confederacy's decision to employ black soldiers, despite the fact that they
                    have vehemently opposed Union plans to use black troops, even in segregated
                    regiments.<br>
