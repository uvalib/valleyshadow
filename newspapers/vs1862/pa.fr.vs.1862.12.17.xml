                    and around Washington not less than ninety thousand men, and within thirty days
                    fresh troops by the hundred thousand were pouring down the avenues to the

                <summary>The writer attacks General Halleck's report on the peninsular campaign as
                    self-serving and unfair to General McClellan. Had McClellan been given the
                    troops he requested, they assert, he would have been able to take Richmond.
                    Halleck's document, however, justifies his order to evacuate the peninsula and,
                    the writer claims, lays the blame for the subsequent defeats at the feet of
                    everybody else but himself. While they had praised Halleck the soldier in
                    earlier issues, this document, the writer states, makes Halleck sound more like
                    an "ingenious lawyer" or a "special pleader" than a soldier. McClellan's
                    movements in the east should be contrasted with Halleck's slowness in the west
                    before any judgement is made, they assert.</summary>

                    removal of General McClellan from the command of the Army of the Potomac. It was
                    only for the want of an extra 15,000 troops that McClellan was waiting to attack
                    Richmond, but those troops were not supplied by Lincoln or Halleck. It was their
                    failure which was pinned on McClellan, who was then relieved of command only to
                    be called on again after Second Bull Run. The taking of Richmond, they conclude,
                    was prevented only by "the cowardly administration."</summary>

                    <p>December 12.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Burnside's army has made a decisive and victorious movement. The city of
                        Fredericksburg is now occupied by his forces after a terrible bombardment,
                        which lasted nearly all day yesterday, and resulted in the partial
                        destruction of the city by the heavy fire of our artillery. During Wednesday
                        night the pontoons were conveyed to the river preparatory to the crossing of
                        the troops yesterday morning. At five o'clock A.M., three bridges were laid
                        down in front of the city, and when about half completed, the rebels opened
                        a murderous fire upon our engineers from the houses in the city and on the
                        river bank, driving them off. Our heavy guns, one hundred and forty-three in
                        number, were then opened upon the city, and continued to play on it with
                        tremendous force, crushing through the houses and setting them on fire.
                        Between thirty and forty homes were burned during the bombardment in the
                        business part of the city. The rebel artillery from the hills kept up a
                        steady fire, but did little damage, as they could not be used without
                        risking the safety of their own men, who were bolding the river front. Our
                        troops were all in order, awaiting the moment when the bridges should be
                        completed to cross over and take the city. It soon became evident that the
                        bridges could not be built except by a bold dash. Volunteers were called for
                        to cross in small boats. The order was no sooner given than hundreds of
                        brave fellows stepped forward. About one hundred men of the Eighth
                        Connecticut were selected. They were soon on their way, while the artillery
                        threw a perfect storm of iron hail on the opposite bank. They reached the
                        opposite shore, and with fixed bayonets, rushed upon the enemy, killing
                        several, and taking one hundred prisoners. At half-past four two bridges
                        were finished opposite the city, when the troops immediately began to cross
                        over. The enemy was soon driven from the city back to their line of works,
                        and Fredericksburg was in our possession.</p>
                    <p>Meantime General Franklin's division was crossing the Rappahannock three
                        miles below the city, over bridges which he had constructed, with little
                        opposition. A force strong enough to resist any attack from the enemy is now
                        on the south side of the Rappahannock.--Everything was quiet last night, but
                        affairs looked as if a battle to-day was inevitable.</p>
                    <p>While these proceedings were going on at Fredericksburg, our gunboats were
                        shelling the enemy fifteen miles down the river.</p>
                    <p>The news from Nashville indicates an immediate attack by the rebels, under
                        General Joe Johnston, upon that city. Our pickets were driven in on Tuesday
                        morning, at every point, by the appearance of an immense force in front
                        under Generals Bragg, Cheatham, Forrest and Morgan--Johnston commanding the
                        whole.--General Mitchell is in command at Nashville, and it is being rapidly
                        reinforced by order of General Rosecrans.</p>
                    <p>General Hovey came into collision with the enemy at three different points
                        during the progress of his expedition, and in each instance drove them back.
                        He has destroyed a portion of the Mississippi Central Railroad, and burned
                        several of the bridges.</p>
                    <p>Another chapter in the history of the rebel pirate ship Alabama has to be
                        recorded to-day. According to the news brought by the schooner Alice, which
                        arrived at this port yesterday from Point Petre, Gaudaloupe [sic], the
                        Alabama ran into port at Martinique, after robbing and destroying by fire
                        the ships Levi Starbuck, of New Bedford, and the T.B. Wales, of Boston. The
                        United States steamer San Jacinto, Commander Roukendorff, being off the port
                        went in pursuit, but, as far as known, without coming up to her.</p>
                    <p>The elections for members of Congress for the First and Second districts in
                        Louisiana, held on the 3d inst, have resulted in the choice of two
                        unconditional Union men, Messers. B. F. Flanders and Michael Hahn. Mr. Jacob
                        Barker, whom the New Orleans <emph rend="italic">Delta</emph> calls "the
                        negro worshipping and rebel candidate" was defeated, at which the <emph
                            rend="italic">Delta</emph> rejoices.</p>
                    <p>December 13.</p>
                    <p>The main body of General Burnside's army crossed the Rappahannock yesterday,
                        and now occupies the south side of the river. The enemy still maintain their
                        position on the hills, and exhibited no signs of evacuating it up to last
                        night. Nothing but a terrific battle can dislodge them if they are ready for
                        that issue. During the passage of our troops yesterday at the different
                        points, General Sherman's corps leading the way in front of the city of
                        Fredericksburg, the enemy poured a constant fire upon our troops in the city
                        and on the forces who were crossing on the two lower bridges, although they
                        did very little damage. General Bayard's cavalry, which crossed on the lower
                        bridge, had five men killed while endeavoring to ascertain the enemy's
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Our losses in all were very slight, considering the importance of the
                        movement and the danger to which our troops were necessarily exposed.</p>
                    <p>December 15, 1862.</p>
                    <p>The terrific battle of Saturday on the Rappahannock was not renewed
                        yesterday, as anticipated. The day was bright and cheerful. The fog which
                        obscured the scene of operations for the past two days was dispersed. Heavy
                        artillery firing took place in front of the divisions of Generals Hooker,
                        Sumner, and Franklin, from daylight until late in the forenoon, but no
                        general action occured [sic] up to the latest accounts last night. The
                        rebels were observed to be strengthening their works, and it was ascertained
                        by inspection through a powerful glass that there are tix [sic] distinct
                        lines of works behind the city. Whether some of these are rifled redoubts
                        simply, or have the double capacity of affording protection to light
                        infantry and having embrazures for light field guns, could not be
                        discovered. The appearance of the works would lead, however, to the latter
                        belief.</p>
                    <p>Our dead, who were killed in front of the enemy's works, still remain were
                        [sic] they fell.--When attempting their removal on Saturday night, the
                        rebels would fire with infantry; but the wounded have all been removed from
                        the field, and all the dead obtained have been since buried.</p>
                    <p>There were forty thousand of our troops engaged in the battle on Saturday.
                        What force the rebels brought against them it is impossible just now to
                        determine.</p>

                <summary>The editors caution against counterfeit fifty-cent postage stamps in
                    circulation in the community. The paper is thinner than the original, the five
                    faces of Washington vary considerably from the original, the linked letters of
                    the "U.S." under the center portrait of Washington do not show the lower end of
                    the "S" inside the "U", the bordering around the lettering and the "50" is dark
                    and crowded while in the genuine the border is open and there is a line of light
                    dots through the middle all the way around. In the counterfeit the middle line
                    is almost invisible, while on the original it catches your eye at once.</summary>

                    <p>From the Army of the Potomac. <lb/>The Battle Begun near Fredericksburg.
                        <lb/>A Rebel Cavalry Raid in Our Rear. <lb/>The Battle Near Fredericksburg.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters in the Field. <lb/>Saturday, 11, a.m.</p>
                    <p>The battle so long anticipated is now processing.</p>
                    <p>The morning opened with a dense fog, which has not yet entirely disappeared.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Reynolds' corps on the left advanced at an early hour, and at 9:15
                        engaged the enemy's infantry. Seven minutes after the rebels opened a heavy
                        fire of artillery, which has continued so for without interruption. Their
                        artillery fire must be at random as the fog obstructs all view.</p>
                    <p>Our heavy guns are answering them rapidly. As the sun gets high it is hoped
                        that the fog will lift. At this writing no results are known. Not much
                        infantry has as yet become engaged.</p>
                    <p>A portion of the enemy's cavalry crossed a ford above here, and yesterday
                        were found on our right rear. A sufficient force has been sent out to meet
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Second Dispatch.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters Army of the Potomac, <lb/>Saturday evening, Dec. 13.</p>
                    <p>The fog began to disappear at 7 o'clock this morning, affording an
                        unobstructed view of our own and the enemy's position.</p>
                    <p>It being evident that the first ridge of hills in the rear of the city, on
                        which the enemy had his guns posted behind earthworks, could not be carried
                        except by a charge of infantry. General Sumner assigned that duty to General
                        French's division, supported by general Howard's.</p>
                    <p>The troops advanced to the works at ten minutes before 12 o'clock at a brisk
                        run. The enemy's guns opened a rapid fire upon them. When within musket
                        range of the base of the ridge they were met by a terrible fire from the
                        rebel infantry, who were posted behind a stone rebel infantry, who were
                        posted behind a stone wall and some houses on the right of the line. This
                        checked their advance, and they fell back to a small ravine, but not out of
                        musket range.</p>
                    <p>At this time another body of troops moved to their assistance in splendid
                        style, notwithstanding the gaps made in their ranks by the fire of the rebel
                        artillery. When they arrived at the first line they advanced on double quick
                        time, and with a command of fixed bayonets, endeavored to dislodge the
                        rebels from their hiding places. The concentrated fire of artillery and
                        infantry which they were forced to face was too much, and the centre gave
                        way in disorder, but was afterward rallied and brought back.</p>
                    <p>From that time the firing was spiritedly continued, and never ceased until
                        sometime after darkness set in this evening.</p>
                    <p>General Franklin, who commanded the attack on the left, met with better
                        success. He succeeded, after a hard day's fight, in driving the enemy about
                        one mile. At one time the rebels advanced to attack, but they were
                        handsomely repulsed with terrible slaughter and a loss of between four and
                        five hundred prisoners, belonging to General A. P. Hill's command.</p>
                    <p>General Franklin's movement was directed down the river, and his troops are
                        encamped to-night not far from Massaponax creek.</p>
                    <p>Our troops sleep to-night where they fought to-day.</p>
                    <p>The dead and wounded are being carried from the field of battle to-night.</p>
                    <p>The following is a list of the officers killed and wounded, as far as known:</p>
                    <p>Gen. Jackson, of the Pennsylvania Reserves, killed;</p>
                    <p>Gen. Bayard was struck in the thigh by a shell, and afterwards died;</p>
                    <p>Gen. Vinton was wounded in the side, but not seriously;</p>
                    <p>Gen. Gibbons was wounded in the hands;</p>
                    <p>Gen. Kimball received a wound in the thigh;</p>
                    <p>Gen. Caldwell was wounded in two places, but not seriously;</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sinclair, of Pennsylvania, was dangerously wounded;</p>
                    <p>Capt. Hendricks, who was commanding the 9th New York militia, was wounded
                        seriously.</p>
                    <p>The following is the loss of officers in the 5th New Hampshire regiment,
                        which was actively engaged in the battle:</p>
                    <p>Col. Cross, wounded in the abdomen;</p>
                    <p>Maj. Sturdevant and Adjutant Dodd, killed.</p>
                    <p>The firing of musketry ceased at about 6 o'clock, but the rebels continued
                        throwing shell into the city until 8 o'clock this evening.</p>
                    <p>The Position of the rebel forces was as follows: Gen. Longstreet was on the
                        left, and held the main works of the enemy. Gen. A. P. Hill and Gen. Jackson
                        were in front of Gen. Franklin, with Jackson's right resting on the
                        Rappahannock. Gen. D. H. Hill's forces acted as a reserve.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Burnside will renew the battle at daylight in the morning.</p>
                    <p>The troops are in good spirits, and not in the least disheartened.</p>
                    <p>The losses cannot be accurately estimated at this hour.</p>
                    <p>Third Dispatch.</p>
                    <p>Washington, Dec. 14.</p>
                    <p>It is thought here that about 40,000 of our troops were engaged in
                        yesterday's battle.--From information received early this morning
                        preparations were making all night for the conflict to-day, General Burnside
                        remaining on the field, giving orders and looking to the position and
                        condition of his forces.</p>
                    <p>Additional surgeons and everything which the necessities of the wounded
                        require have been dispatched from Washington.</p>
                    <p>Fourth Dispatch.</p>
                    <p>Washington, Dec. 14.</p>
                    <p>It is proper to caution the public against hastily crediting the many
                        unsupported rumors concerning yesterday's battle. Some of them here
                        prevalent have no other basis than surmire [sic], or are mere inventions. In
                        the absence of facts, Rebel sympathizers are responsible for not a few of
                        these fictions. Gentlemen in high public position repeat the assertion as
                        coming from Burnside, that he has men enough and therefore desires no
                        further reinforcements.</p>
                    <p>The Latest from the Front.</p>
                    <p>Head-quarters, Sunday, Dec. 14--11:30 A. M.--There is no fog to-day, and the
                        sun is shining brightly, with a strong breeze. At daylight this morning
                        there was a heavy fire of artillery and infantry in front of the first line
                        of works, where General Sumner and Hooker were engaged yesterday.</p>
                    <p>The fire slackened about an hour afterwards, and then was heard only at
                        intervals until now. The same occurred in front of General Franklin's
                        position down the river.</p>
                    <p>The object of both parties was evidently to feel the position of the other.</p>
                    <p>During last night and this forenoon the Rebels have considerably extended
                        their works and strengthened their position. Large bodies of troops are now
                        to be seen where but few were found yesterday.</p>
                    <p>The indications are that no decisive battle will be fought to-day, unless the
                        Rebels should bring on the engagement, which they will probably not do.</p>

                <excerpt>"There is every prospect of an early forward movement. It is reported that
                    Gen. Sumner, commanding Right Grand Divison [sic] has already crossed the

                    <p>From 'the Army of the Potomac" <lb/>In Camp Near Fredericksburg,
                        <lb/>December 10, 1862.</p>
                    <p>The 126th Regiment P. V. were paid for nearly three months' services by Major
                        John M. Pomroy, Paymaster U.S.A., on Thursday last. He disbursed about
                        $45,000,00 and of this amount the men have forwarded nearly $30,000 to their
                        families and friends at home. I will endeavor to give you an accurate
                        statement of the amounts sent by the various companies in time for your next
                        week's issue.</p>
                    <p>A U. S. Disbursing Officer also appeared in Camp on Monday and paid three
                        Regiments of our Brigade their Bounty and Premium money, $27 to each man. A
                        good production of this will also be sent for distribution at home.</p>
                    <p>There is every prospect of an early forward movement. It is reported that
                        Gen. Sumner, commanding Right Grand Divison [sic] has already crossed the
                        Rappahanock with 80,000 men. Vast accessions have been made to the army from
                        the various sections within the last week. If the weather is at all
                        favorable we will all be on the other side of the river within a week. We
                        are looking hourly for marching orders. You will have the result of coming
                        operations spread before your readers before a letter from me can reach you.
                        I will give you such matters as come under my own observation or may be
                        obtained from reliable parties.</p>
