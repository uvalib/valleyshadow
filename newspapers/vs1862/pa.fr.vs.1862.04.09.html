<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the rapid advance now making by the National troops in every quarter a
                        policy will soon have to be carefully matured, undisfigured by the
                        millennial day-dreams of ultraism, and such as will be calculated most
                        speedily to bring back the disaffected States to a full appreciation of the
                        blessings of the Union. It ought to be equally removed from temporizing and
                        trivial conciliation on the one hand, and from undue severity on the other;
                        carefully distinguishing between the guilt of politicians and people; and,
                        above all, the mad abolitionists--the men whom all know as prominent in
                        precipitating public evils by their conduct in the loyal States--ought to be
                        compelled to stand as unfitted for the great and solemn responsibility. That
                        we are assured under certain contingencies of wise and firm counsels, of
                        unflinching conservatism, amongst the higher officers of the Government, the
                        past would seem to warrant; and were it not that we see them pressed to the
                        uttermost by the mad zealots who have been privileged of late to make the
                        seat of Government the theatre of their exploits, we should have little or
                        no uneasiness as to ultimate results. The fact that these extremists have
                        somehow obtained possession of the lecture-rooms of a National
                        establishment--the Smithsonian Institute--where the most mischievous of them
                        have had the opportunity afforded to ventilate the one mad idea that
                        possesses them--as intensely treasonable in its way as Secession in any of
                        its phases--is a bad omen; and a worse still may be found, perhaps, in the
                        fact that the wildest fanatic of the herd--Cheever--is permitted to occupy
                        the Capitol itself for the purpose of abusing the man relied upon by the
                        nation to carry the country safe through the manifold perils which beset it.
                        The "Territorial" proposition for the government of the rescued States is of
                        bad significance also, whilst the abuse levelled at General Halleck--an
                        officer whose policy in the West has been pre-eminently wise and fair, a
                        model Governor, indeed--and the correspondent elevation, of late, of his
                        incompetent predecessor, probably accomplished under a pressure hard to
                        withstand, all point to a condition of things not especially reassuring when
                        we look at the greatness and delicacy of the task soon to be imposed upon
                        the rulers of the nation. Treason is as offensive under one form as another,
                        and with the fact patent to all men that for years past the two extremes
                        have played into each other's hands, both doing their best to subvert or
                        destroy the Constitution--the only recognized citadel in the troubles that
                        nearly overwhelm us--and that both do this yet,
                        what alternative is left for the great mass of loyal and conservative
                        citizens but to band together against both? and why should not the
                        Government recognize treason and guilt in one case as well as in the other?
                        is treason less offensive in Boston or New York than in Charleston or
                        Savannah? Is the Charleston Mercury half as
                        formidable, at present, in its power for mischief, circumscribed as is its
                        field of action, as the New York Tribune, with
                        its strength unimpaired?</p>
                    <p>If there was any difficulty in detecting sham patriotism or incipient treason
                        in these times, the case would be different; but we need no special pleader
                        to define it. Here, in Maryland, for instance, every policeman is for the
                        time made the judge in the case of what threatens the public peace, the
                        cause of the Union, and finally the Constitution. A flag emblematic of
                        enmity to the Government, a shout, even, involves the necessity of arrest
                        and imprisonment under certain circumstances--and rightly too, because in
                        times so critical whatever tends to impair the respect due the power of the
                        Government is a direct assault upon it and the Constitution upon which it is
                        based. All that is easily understood here, or at St. Louis or Nashville;
                        because a peculiar condition of things--revolt and bloodshed--or impending
                        danger of these, have sharpened the senses of officials, and all are on the
                        alert. And yet, this being so, why should men be arrested at the points
                        named, for obnoxious shouts, when Wendell Phillips may shout treason until
                        he is hoarse in the Smithsonian Institute within eight miles of the camps of
                        the Potomac, and Cheever pollute the very Capitol with his ravings, because
                        both are from places that have the odor of loyalty about them?</p>
                    <p>The truth is, if the nation is in earnest about the maintenance of the
                        Constitution, if it goes for "reconstruction" on the basis of that
                        instrument, it has got to change its course materially on some of the points
                        considered.</p>
                    <p>Let it be understood right here, that we are not in any sense complaining of
                        the treatment experienced by our own city, or of that tendered to St. Louis
                        or Nashville. We believe that in each case it has been eminently wise, and
                        forbearing, and proper. We believe that it is utter folly to make terms with
                        treason anywhere; that weak conciliation is in most cases taken for fear,
                        and produces its natural fruit in this case--insolence and a persistence in
                        wrong doing. But we would have the policy that bears good fruits here and in
                        other of the Border States, made by evil fortune the battle-ground of this
                        rebellion, extended to Secession tendencies in States reputed more loyal;
                        nay, we would have a more impartial and stringent policy obtain in the
                        Capital of the nation itself, and even have it penetrate the halls of
                        Congress, if thereby treason in all its ugly forms might be eradicated, that
                        so the nation from the lakes to the gulf might
                        come to have undoubted faith in the impartiality
                        and justice of the Government. In this regard the
                        patriotic citizens of the Gulf States--for if late accounts are true,
                        Louisiana even has yet a fair representation of such--merely desire the
                        guarantees of the Constitution, and are not under the necessity of desiring
                        special favors. If all are treated alike, none anywhere will have cause for
                        just complaint.</p>
                    <p>It is such a policy as this--such and none other--as will not only restore
                        the Union, but will make it stronger than ever. The people of the South
                        cannot control the ultraism of the North, but the Government and the loyal
                        people of that section themselves can do it, and upon them devolves the
                        task. In performing it they must act with strict justice or be declared
                        infamous and ungenerous in all time to come. Demonstrating their power in a
                        most righteous cause, so far, they have done nothing that reflects seriously
                        upon the honesty for their reverence for the Constutian [sic], even upon
                        their generosity; but the unpleasant task devolves upon them now to protect
                        themselves and the beaten localities against their own fanatics, and the
                        world will hold them to the obligation.</p>
                    <p>We have said this much on a delicate subject, not as giving a Border State
                        view of the matter, but because true patriotism knows no special locality.
                        If it is true patriotism, it will not be found
                        making treason a convertible form--a term having one significance here,
                        another North or South. We wish to see the Union restored in all its
                        pristine magnificence and glory and upon such terms as will forever close
                        the mouths of demagogues, whether in Massachusetts or South Carolina. As of
                        old--before these troubles began--the negro still monopolizes the attention
                        of Congress, even whilst the nation is almost in the agonies of dissolution,
                        and if in the future he is not severely let alone, the curse upon the model
                        Republic has only half expended itself, even so far as seen in this civil
                        war. The greater curse impends right over our
                        heads--in the possible destruction, finally, of the Union element of the
                        South. As yet it maintains its confidence in the Government; it clings to
                        the old flag with a grasp which only mad fanaticism has the power to tear
                        away. As yet it has everything to appeal to in the stand taken by Congress
                        in the outset: that it was a war to "restore the Constitution." Fanaticism,
                        at that time beholding its wild work, shrank back from the evils it has
                        inaugurated, and became humble and retiring; but it has become emboldened of
                        late once more--as we have shown--and the patriotic of the nation are bound
                        to take cognizance of and rebuke it if they would indeed save the country by
                        giving us in the end a permanent peace.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we must not look to the politicians for a remedy. It is for the
                            people to rebuke the politicians. They must
                        see that it is madness and folly for them to go out to battle to rectify
                        public grievances when they leave behind them plagues more destructive to
                        the public peace than the Rebels in arms they go out to confront. They must
                        see that the blood and treasure so prodigally bestowed must have other
                        objects than to abet slavery or to set the negro free; that, in short, the
                        negro must be left where our fathers placed him--to the provisions of the
                        Constitution. Left to that, Ohio and Illinois need not pass laws to exclude
                        him from their bounds, and South Carolina need not continue in arms under
                        any false pretext that the safety of the negro is endangered.</p>
                    <p>For Maryland, let her steadily rebuke ultraism on both sides. A sufferer from
                        both extremes, she is abundantly able to discriminate as to what is safe not
                        only for herself, but for those on both sides of the field of controversy.
                        But whilst treason of the South Carolina school is rebuked in the most
                        wholesome way in Baltimore, let not the city of Washington be permitted to
                        countenance a species of treason in no wise more commendable.--Balt American</p>

                    <p>Of course not. Congress has no time to act upon anything but the nigger. The
                        dark-skinned individual occupies the attention of Congress to the exclusion

                        of the fratricidal strife by coercing the Government to proclaim the
                        emancipation of the slaves, to gratify their sectional hate. The grand
                        scheme of these slavery agitators is to destroy negro slavery or the
                        Union--they don't much care which. They care nothing for the Union and
                        disregard the Constitution--and regard still less the guaranteed right of
                        the devoted friends of the Union in the Border States. They must know that
                        their course and the success of the measures they advocate will result in
                        the destruction of the Union beyond any hope of reconstruction. We do
                        contend that the advocates of negro emancipation as a remedy for the war,
                        are as much traitors as are JEFF. DAVIS and his followers in the South. We
                        heartily wish that the whole batch could be disposed of in the manner
                        proposed by PARSON BROWNLOW in a late speech at Cincinnati. The Parson says:</p>
                    <p>"But, gentlemen of Ohio, I do not and cannot exonerate the North; and I say
                        in brief to you that if, fifty years ago, we had taken one hundred Southern
                        fire-eaters and one hundred Northern Abolitionists, and hanged them up, and
                        buried them in a common ditch, and sent their souls to hell, we should have
                        had none of this war."</p>
                    <p>The radical Republicans in Congress have thus far stood in the way of all
                        legislation calculated to restore the honor and integrity of our flag. They
                        have opposed every proposition for guaranteeing to the loyal citizens of the
                        Southern States their rights under the Constitution, and we are now just
                        where we were at the commencement of our difficulties so far as Congress is
                        concerned. It has shown a lack both of intelligence and courage to aid the
                        war or propose any legislative measure to rescue the Union, lest it be
                        compelled to surrender up the Chicago platform. The Democratic members in
                        Congress are powerless to accomplish anything. The Republican majority in
                        that body is overwhelming, consequently there are little grounds for hope
                        for the good or honor of the country. One would naturally suppose that the
                        present lamentable state of the country would be sufficient to convince even
                        the radical Republican members of Congress that there is serious business to
                        be attended to; but they have proved wholly unfit for the task entrusted to
                        them, and appear more anxious to ride their nigger hobby than to aid the
                        Government in putting down this wicked rebellion.</p>

<b>An April Fool</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors of the Valley Spirit played a trick on William Kennedy, the
                    editor of the Chambersburg Times, by hinting that he was to be called to testify
                    before the legislative committee investigating rumors of corruption in the
                    passage of the Tonnage Tax bill. Kennedy had been hinting that he knew that
                    William Boyle had been paid to advocate the passage of the bill and to influence
                    Col. A. K. McClure to vote in favor, and the Spirit hoped to reveal that his
                    accusations were not based on the common good but in the hope of damaging the
                    reputation of the Valley Spirit.<br>(Names in announcement:  William Kennedy,  William Boyle, Col. A. K. McClure)</blockquote>
<b>A Notice</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit begs pardon of its readers that it has descended into arguing
                    with the Times, but denies that Democrats have been complaining about the Valley
                    Spirit's behavior.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Union Democrats</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Quotes an article from the Dispatch, a Republican paper, which argues that
                    Republicans should organize pure parties and stay away from "union" efforts with
                    Democrats--in order to avoid "evil associations." The Valley Spirit calls this
                    to the attention of Democrats who joined Union parties in 1861 and uses it as
                    evidence that the Republicans had tricked them into joining for short-term gain.<br>
