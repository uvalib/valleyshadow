<b>Message from the President</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In a letter sent to Congress on March 6, President Lincoln asked Congress
                    to provide monetary aid for gradual emancipation of the slaves in the border
                    states. He justifies this proposal by arguing that if the border states become
                    free, it will sap the Confederacy of the hope of convincing border states to
                    come over to their cause, thus shortening the war. Lincoln makes clear that he
                    is not arguing for a federal right to interfere with slavery. Instead, he sees
                    such gradual emancipation as a device that he hopes will bring peace more
                    quickly.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The President today transmitted to Congress the following message:</p>
                    <p>Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of
                            Representatives: I recommend the adoption of a joint resolution
                        by your honorable bodies, which shall be substantially as follows:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the United States ought to
                        co-operate with any State which may adopt a gradual abolishment of slavery,
                        giving to such State pecuniary aid to be used by such State in its
                        discretion to compensate for the inconveniences, both public and private,
                        produced by such change of system.</p>
                    <p>If the proposition contained in the resolution does not meet the approval of
                        Congress and the country, there is the end, but if it does command such
                        approval, I deem it of importance that the State and people immediately
                        interested should be at once distinctly notified of the fact, so that they
                        may begin to consider whether to accept or reject it.</p>
                    <p>The Federable [sic] Government would find its highest interest in such a
                        measure as one of the most efficient means of self-preservation. The leaders
                        of the existing insurrection entertain the hope that this Government will
                        ultimately be forced to acknowledge the independence of some part of the
                        disaffected region, and that all the slave States north of such parts will
                        then say, the Union for which we have struggled being already gone, we now
                        choose to go with the Southern section. To deprive them of this hope,
                        substantially ends the rebellion, and the initiation of emancipation
                        completely deprives them of it as to all States initiating it. The point is
                        not that all the States tolerating slavery would very soon, if at all,
                        initiate emancipation, but that while the offer is equally made to all the
                        more Northern, shall, by such initiation, make it certain to the more
                        Southern that in no event will the former ever join the latter in their
                        proposed Confederacy. I say initiation because, in my judgment, gradual and
                        not sudden emancipation is better for all.</p>
                    <p>In the more financial or pecuniary view, any member of Congress, with the
                        census tables and treasury reports before him, can readily see for himself
                        how very soon the current expenditures of this war would purchase, at fair
                        valuation all the slaves in any named State. Such a proposition on the part
                        of the General Government sets up no claim of a right by Federal authority
                        to interfere with slavery within State limits, referring, as it does, the
                        absolute control of the subject in each case to the State and its people
                        immediately interested. It is proposed as a matter of perfectly free choice
                        with these.</p>
                    <p>In the annual message of last December, I thought fit to say, the Union must
                        be preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed. I said
                        this not hastily, but deliberately. War has been made, and continued to be
                        an indispensable means to this end. A practical reacknowledgment of the
                        national authority would render the war unnecessary, and it would at once
                        cease. If, however, resistance continues, the war must also continue, and it
                        is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend, and all the
                        ruin which may follow it.</p>
                    <p>Such as may seem indispensable, or may obviously promise great efficiency
                        towards ending the struggle must and will come--the proposition now made is
                        an offer only. I hope it may be esteemed no offence to ask whether the
                        pecuniary consideration tendered would not be of more value to the States
                        and private persons and property in it in the present aspect of affairs.</p>
                    <p>While it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be merely
                        initiatory, and not within itself a practical measure, it is recommended in
                        the hope that it would soon lead to important practical results. In full
                        view of my great responsibility to my God and to my country, I earnestly beg
                        the attention of Congress and the people to the subject.</p>
                    <p>(Signed) ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<b>The No-Party Movement Unmasked</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Observes that the Harrisburg Telegraph, a Republican paper, now advocates
                    abandoning the Union party label and going into the elections of 1862 as
                    Republicans. Since Republicans had attacked Democrats the previous year for
                    refusing to join Union parties in the spirit of non-partisanship, the Spirit
                    finds it ironic that the Republicans are now all for the idea of parties.<br>

<b>Change--What it Has Done and Would Yet Do</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the removal of Cameron from the Secretary of War position was
                    the best thing Lincoln could have done because it has empowered McClellan to
                    look ahead without any fear of attack from within the administration. The
                    article also advocates removing Secretary of State Seward and replacing him with
                    a "sound, national, constitutional, conservative man," preferably someone from
                    Maryland, Virginia or Kentucky.<br>

<b>From Fortress Monroe</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on the engagement of the Confederate ironclad Merrimack with the
                    Union ships guarding the mouth of the James River. The Merrimack reportedly sank
                    the sailing ship Cumberland and set fire to the sailing ship Congress after her
                    crew surrendered. The Merrimack seemed to have run aground. The reporter could
                    not confirm these facts, as they were being observed from eight miles away
                    through a telescope and supplemented by reports of "panick-stricken
                    non-combatants." A brief report from the next day indicated that the
                    "Erricson"--the Monitor, though not identified as such in the article--arrived
                    at the scene the next day and engaged the Merrimack, Jamestown and Yorktown,
                    with the Merrimack reported to be in sinking condition.<br>

<b>The President's Message</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An editorial which cautiously supports Lincoln's plan of buying slaves in
                    the border states while criticizing it for not addressing the matter of what
                    will happen to blacks once they are freed. The solution could not be equality,
                    say the editors, as the "law of nature" mandates that antagonistic races cannot
                    exist side by side without one holding the other in subjection.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In another column of our paper will be found an important special Message
                        sent into Congress by President LINCOLN.</p>
                    <p>The idea seems to have taken a tenacious hold of the minds of the President
                        and his party that this rebellion cannot be put down unless the freedom of
                        the slave is proclaimed in some manner or form.</p>
                    <p>If the president has hit upon the right plan, which is by no means a new one,
                        we feel no disposition to oppose it factiously on his account. We feel as
                        anxious as anybody living to get rid of the everlasting nigger, and if the
                        President's recommendation will effect that, to him be all mundane honor and
                        glory.</p>
                    <p>All the slave States have ever contended for was to be let alone, and
                        permitted to manage their domestic institutions in their own way. One good
                        feature about the Message is that the President expressly disclaims any
                        right to interfere with the "peculiar institution;" thus crushing out the
                        most important dogma in the Abolition creed, that "the General Government
                        has the right to interfere with slavery in the States."</p>
                    <p>On this point the President is explicit and we believe honest. He says "the
                        General Government sets up no claim of a right, by Federal authority, to
                        interfere with slavery within State limits, referring, as it does, the
                        absolute control of the subject in each case to the State and its people
                        immediately interested."</p>
                    <p>Mr. BUCHANAN in his last annual Message to Congress said--"How easy would it
                        be for the American people to settle the slavery question forever, and to
                        restore peace and harmony to this distracted country." We appear to be
                        approximating to a better understanding all round on this "vexed question,"
                        and as a result of this proper perception of right and wrong, may we not
                        hope soon to see it "settled forever" and "peace and harmony" reign where
                        now all is ruin, desolation and blood-shed--the legitimate fruits of slavery
                        agitation.</p>
                    <p>If Mr. LINCOLN cannot conciliate his party, or reconcile them in any other
                        way, to a cessation of hostility towards the South, than through the
                        abolition of slavery, we certainly like his plan of buying the negroes much
                        better than that of killing the white race to free the black.</p>
                    <p>As to the expenditure of money required to carry out this proposition we will
                        not stop to count the cost. Who would not rather see the money of the
                        Government laid out in buying negroes than purchasing salt-petre for the
                        destruction of the white man.</p>
                    <p>What is to become of the negro after the Government has purchased him Mr.
                        LINCOLN has not told us. This is the most momentous question to be decided,
                        and should have received the serious and kindly consideration of the
                        President in his Message. If it is intended to emancipate the negro, and
                        place him on an equality with the white man, we can tell Mr. LINCOLN in
                        advance that his scheme is a failure. It is a law of nature, which he cannot
                        change by any ukase he may issue, that two antagonistic races cannot exist
                        side by side without one holding the other in subjection. It must then
                        become a struggle between the white man and the black man for supremacy. Mr.
                        LINCOLN has very compassionately shut his eyes from a view of this picture,
                        and we too have no desire to contemplate the horrors of that struggle.</p>
                    <p>We do not wish to be understood as condemning Mr. LINCOLN's plan. He strongly
                        recommends it "as one of the most efficient means of self-preservation," and
                        as an imperative necessity, to get rid of the everlasting nigger, we accept
                        it "for better or worse."</p>

<b>An Important Distinction</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes supporters of Lincoln for trying to equate Lincoln's
                    administration with the entire government, and thus to make criticism of Lincoln
                    tantamount to criticism of the government in general. The editors argue that it
                    is their duty to denounce any malfeasance within the Lincoln administration.
                    Such disapproval does not make them traitors, however.<br>

<b>General McClellan</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Attacks critics of General McClellan, claiming than any commander who does
                    not support the expansion of the war to include abolition is open for attack
                    from the abolitionist press. The most recent offense, say the editors, was from
                    a Pennsylvania Republican paper which suggests that former Secretary of War
                    Cameron is more deserving of praise than McClellan is for "crushing the violence
                    of rebellion." The only thing Cameron crushed, says the Valley Spirit, was the

                    <p>An Encampment of this branch of the Order of Odd Fellows was established in
                        this place in July last. It is a re-organization of the old "Olive Branch
                        Encampment" that existed here a few years ago. Since it re-opened in July it
                        has flourished beyond all expectations and may now be regarded as
                        established on a permanent foundation. It already numbers between thirty and
                        forty members and its financial affairs are in a most gratifying condition.
                        Since the dissolution of all our Beneficial Societies we are glad to
                        announce the re-establishment of this in our midst. At a meeting of this
                        "Encampment" on Monday night last the following named gentlemen were elected
                        officers of the association: C. P.--A. J. White; H. P.--Jacob Spangler;
                        W.W.--Edward G. Etter; J. W.--Frank Henderson; Scribe--W. H. Boyle;
                        Treasurer--Benj. F. Nead. The meetings of the Encampment are held in the
                        Hall of Columbus Lodge on the Second and Fourth Monday evenings of each month.</p>

<b>The War Debt for one Year--Difficulty of Collecting the Taxes</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Senate Finance Committee reports that the public debt of the U.S. by
                    June 1862 would be near $750,000,000, with an annual interest of $45,000,000.
                    The article criticizes the Committee's plans for raising the funds, noting that
                    thus far only a fraction will be covered by new taxes proposed, and that a
                    proposed federal land tax may drive many people off the land.<br>
