                <summary>A speech given in Boston on the Fourth of July by George T. Curtis, which
                    lays out his defense of the Constitution and states' rights. Without either of
                    these, he argues, the republican form of government would be threatened--one by
                    losing the bounds within which the government operates, and the other by
                    weakening the local governments, which counter the tyranny of large governments.</summary>

                <summary>Endorses James P. Barr, editor of the Pittsburgh Post, a Democratic
                    newspaper, for the position of surveyor general. Though he lost in his bid for
                    the nomination for auditor general, his nomination for the surveyor post was a
                    testament of the gratitude of the party for his long years of service.</summary>

                    and the war must be fought solely to restore the Union. All those who argue that
                    the war should be a fight for abolition may be labeled a traitor.</summary>

                <summary>A letter from Company I, 9th Regiment of Pennsylvania Cavalry, stationed in
                    Mumfordsville, Kentucky. Several Franklin County men are soldiers in the
                    company, and the author writes to describe their exploits. In late May, on an
                    expedition to capture enemy raiders, several pickets, including C. J. Eckenrode
                    and F. A. Culberson of Franklin County encountered and engaged the enemy. The
                    company eventually defeated a Confederate force of twice its size, though the
                    skirmish resulted in the death of the company commander and the wounding of a
                    Franklin County soldier, James Woods. He was shot between the soldiers with the
                    ball coming out the other side. Franklin County men include a number of men from
                    the "upper school district in Amberson's Valley," (Conrad Eckenrode, J. S.
                    Eckenrode, Johnathan Shearer, Johnathan Piper, Martin Piper--who died in the
                    hospital at Gallatin, Kentucky, of typhoid on April 21--Smith V. Syock--who died
                    in the hospital at Louisville, Kentucky of typhoid on March 22--Joseph McVitry,
                    and James C. Shields), as well as men from Path Valley (James Wood and David
                    Clippinger), and men from Roxbury (Fred Culberson, Joseph Timmons, James
                    Laughlin).</summary>

                <summary>The Columbus Lodge of Odd Fellows have adopted a plan to raise funds for
                    sick and wounded soldiers, by having each of its members donate a certain amount
                    at the next meeting. Since the lodge has over 100 members, it is expected that
                    they will raise a considerable sum. A committee consisting of I. H. McCauly,
                    John Jeffries, D. M. Eiker, W. H. Boyle and A. C. McGrath will handle
                    contributions.</summary>

                    that 14,000 officers and soldiers are absent. All absentees must return to their

                    deserter.</summary>

                <summary>Calls attention to the letter written by the member of the 9th Pennsylvania
                    Cavalry, but notes that after the letter was written, the 9th was involved in a
                    major battle with Confederate guerrillas and that several companies were "badly
                    cut up." The editors ask to be notified with news of any Franklin County men
                    wounded or killed.</summary>

                    <p>A squad of Cavalry dashed into this place last week, and remained a few days
                        hunting up deserters. They captured several actual deserters, and arrested
                        quite a number of persons dressed in soldiers clothes, who have been keeping
                        up a military reputation on their three months shoddy that they were very
                        anxious to drop as soon as arrested. It would be a good idea if the
                        Government would prohibit the wearing of a soldiers uniform, or any part of
                        a uniform, by any one not in actual service. These stay-at-home patriots who
                        are so fond of aping the soldier, would have their vanity brought down a peg
                        by such a wholesome regulation.</p>

                    <p>The 77th Regiment Pa. Volunteers are now encamped at Indian Creek, near
                        Huntsville, Alabama. They will, perhaps, return into Tennessee or Kentucky,
