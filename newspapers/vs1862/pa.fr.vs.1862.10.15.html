<b>The Emancipation Proclamation--General Order Issued by Gen. McClellan</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A reprint of Gen. McClellan's order to the army relating President
                    Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. McClellan emphasizes that it is not the
                    army's place to criticize public policy, but notes that "The remedy for
                    political errors, if any are committed, is to be found only in the action of the
                    people at the polls." The editors applaud McClellan's gallantry and urge voters
                    to go to the polls and correct the errors of abolitionism.<br>

                    <p>General Order Issued by Gen. McClellan.</p>
                    <p>General Order No. 163.</p>
                    <p>Head-Quarters Army of the Potomac, Camp near Sharpsburg, October 7.--The
                        attention of the officers and soldiers of the Army of the Potomac is called
                        to General Order No. 132, War Department, September 29th, 1862, publishing
                        to the army the President's proclamation of September 22d.</p>
                    <p>A proclamation of such grave moment to the nation, officially communicated to
                        the army, affords the General Commanding an opportunity of defining
                        specifically to the officers and soldiers under his command, the relation
                        borne by all persons in the military service of the United States towards
                        the civil authorities of the Government.</p>
                    <p>The Constitution confides to the civil authorities legislative, judicial and
                        executive powers, and the duty of asking, expounding and executing the
                        Federal laws. Armed forces are raised and supported simply to sustain the
                        civil authorities, and are to be held in strict subordination thereto in all
                        respects. This fundamental rule of our political system is essential to the
                        security of our Republican institutions, and should be thoroughly understood
                        and observed by every soldier.</p>
                    <p>The principle upon which, and the objects for which armies shall be employed
                        in suppressing Rebellion, must be determined and declared by the civil
                        authorities, and the Chief Executive, who is charged with the administration
                        of the national affairs, is the proper and only source through which the
                        views and orders of the Government can be made known to the armies of the
                        nation.</p>
                    <p>Discussions by officers and soldiers concerning public measures determined
                        upon and declared by the Government, when carried out beyond the ordinary
                        temperate and respectful expression of opinion, tend greatly to impair and
                        destroy the discipline and efficiency of the troops by substituting the
                        spirit of political faction for that firm, steady and earnest support of the
                        authority of the Government which is the inherent duty of the American
                        soldier.</p>
                    <p>The remedy for political errors, if any are committed, is to be found only in
                        the action of the people at the polls. In thus calling the attention of this
                        army to the true relation between the soldiers and the Government, the
                        General Commanding merely adverts to an evil against which it has been
                        thought advisable during our whole history to guard the armies of the
                        Republic, and in so doing he will not be considered by any right minded
                        person as casting any reflection upon that loyalty and good conduct which
                        has been so fully illustrated upon so many battle-fields.</p>
                    <p>In carrying out all measures of public policy this army will, of course, be
                        guided by the same rules of mercy and Christianity that have ever controlled
                        its conduct towards the defenceless.</p>
                    <p>By command of Major General McClellan. <br>James A. Hardie. <br>Lieut. Col.
                        A.D.C., A. Assist. Adj. Gen.</p>
                    <p>This general order, says the Constitutional Union,
                        is characteristic of the gallant man who issued it. It assumes no
                        dictatorial tone; but, in temperate, respectful and conciliatory language,
                        counsels--not orders--submission; and deprecates discussions which might
                        possibly impair and destroy the discipline and efficiency of the troops. It
                        also points to the remedy!</p>
                    <p>"The remedy for political errors," (says the order) "if any are committed, is
                        to be found only in the action of the people at the polls." Well said, noble
                        "Little Mac!" That is the remedy, and the people are about to apply it to
                        the wounds which have been inflicted upon our country, our Constitution and
                        our laws. God be thanked, that while Abolition zealots would deny free
                        speech--imprison without cause and without hearing--set truth and justice at
                        defiance, that there is yet a remedy left us. The people yet remain. The
                        glorious privilege of the right of suffrage is, for a while at least,
                        guaranteed us, and that privilege will be exercised in its fullest, broadest
                        and most significant sense on Tuesday next. Prudential reasons may properly
                        draw forth General McClellan's order No. 163, and prudential reasons will
                        draw forth thousands on Tuesday next to vindicate the laws and the
                        Constitution of the Union.</p>

<b>Abolitionism Against Working White Men</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints an authorization by Secretary of War Stanton for black people
                    taking refuge in military bases to be sent on to Northern cities to be hired as

                    </p>
                    <p>General Grant is sending here a large lot of negro women and children, and
                        directs me to ask you what to do with them. Parties in Chicago and other
                        cities wish them for servants. Will I be allowed to turn them over to
                        responsible committees to be so employed? If so can I transport them at
                        Government expense?</p>

                    <p>
                        To Brigadier General Tuttle, Commanding:
                    </p>
                    <p>You are authorized to turn over to responsible committees negro women and
                        children who shall take them in charge and provide them with employment and
                        support in the Northern States, and you may furnish transportation at
                        Government expense.</p>
                    <p>Edwin M. Stanton, <br>Secretary of War.</p>
                    <p>This black labor movement of the
                        Abolition-Republican party should arrest the attention of white laborers in the North. That they are in
                        earnest cannot be doubted. If not, why should Secretary Stanton send negroes to the North at the expense of the Government; or the Reverend Dr. Tyng and his
                        Abolition associates propose to hold meetings in aid of the scheme? They
                        mean to antagonize white labor with cheap negro labor from the South, and if white men are opposed to this movement they must
                        act in concert at the polls. There only an they put a stop to this wicked
                        plot against the laboring men of the Northern States. If the Abolition
                        Republican party have control of the next Congress, they will bend all their
                        legislation in favor of negro labor, and in
                        opposition to the interests of white men. The
                        question now is, 'black against white labor.' The Abolition Republican party
                        has openly declared in favor of black labor, and
                            white men must defeat them at the polls by
                        voting for the Democratic party which is in favor of the Union, the
                        Constitution, and the interested white
                            men.--Fulton Democrat.</p>

                    <p>On Friday evening last, our citizens were much surprised and considerably
                        excited by reports of the advance of a large force of Rebel Cavalry by way
                        of Mercersburg. Men arrived on horseback who had been hotly pursued by them
                        to within three or four miles of Town.</p>
                    <p>About 7 o'clock a company of them appeared in the Public Square carrying a
                        flag of truce and demanding a surrender of the place. No military force
                        being here, able to resist, the town was surrendered on the terms that
                        private property would be respected and citizens be unmolested. They then
                        took full possession of the place, and on the next morning took their
                        departure to the direction of Gettysburg leaving a guard to fire the Depot

                        Cavalry and Artillery under Generals Stuart and Hampton. They have stolen
