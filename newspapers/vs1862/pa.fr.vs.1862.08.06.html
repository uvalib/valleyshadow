<b>The President's Appeal to the Border States</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Lincoln's address to the congressional delegations of the border states, in
                    which he emphasizes that while the abolition of slavery might interfere with
                    states' rights, the continuation of the war would destroy the institution of the
                    states altogether. In Lincoln's view, abolition and colonization would be enough
                    to end the war. The congressmen replied that the federal government had neither
                    the right nor the money to carry out Lincoln's plan.<br>

<b>Who is Responsible?</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Attacks Senator Zachariah Chandler, and the Congressional Committee on the
                    Conduct of the War, for their criticism of General McClellan. If this committee,
                    argues the editors, had not been fixed on retaking Manassass and if they had not
                    prodded McClellan to move before he was ready, Richmond might have fallen
                    easier. But meddling politicians got in the way of military prowess.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Zachariah Chandler, a lumber merchant of Michigan, who made enough money out
                        of the western squatters to enable him to get to the United States Senate on
                        the strength of his purse, made an assault on General McClellan on the 16th
                        inst. Zachariah is a member of the famous Congressional Committee on the
                        Conduct of the War." We take the following from his remarks in the Senate:</p>
                    <p>In December the nation began to clamor for a movement, and the Committee on
                        the Conduct of the War urged the necessity for such a movement. The
                        President and Cabinet were in favor of some forward movement, and they were
                        assured by Gen. McClellan that a move would be made very soon; that he never
                        intended to go into winter quarters. And he did not. Our brave men spent the
                        winter in canvas tents.</p>
                    <p>At last, in January, the President gave the order "forward!" and those
                        glorious events took place at Fort Donelson and Henry, Newburn, &amp;c.
                        The "do nothing strategy" seemed to give way, and the weeks and days of
                        spades and pick-axes to be over.</p>
                    <p>On the 22d of February, the Army of the Potomac was ordered to move, but it
                        was not ready. At last, on the 10th of March, it did move, under the protest
                        of its commander. On the 10th of March that army numbered 230,000 men by the
                        muster roll. They marched to Manassas and the wooden guns of Centreville,
                        and the enemy, less than 40,000 quietly moved away.</p>
                    <p>The Generals had voted not to advance on Manassas, but to leave the enemy
                        there and to sneak around to Annapolis. Seven out of eight of these Generals
                        were appointed by the advice of Gen. McClellan.</p>
                    <p>But the President and Secretary of War overruled this, and made the army move
                        on Manassas.</p>
                    <p>From this it appears that the "Committee on the Conduct of the War," composed
                        of men who knew nothing whatever of military affairs, poked their noses into
                        what did not belong to them and urged a movement of the army. It was no
                        doubt their officious intermeddling that induced the President to order the
                        army of the Potomac to move on the 22d of February, when it was not ready to
                        move. To the same cause may also, we presume, be attributed the President's
                        foolish order to McClellan to move on the 10th of March, which the General
                        obeyed under protest, as well he might, considering that the whole country
                        was a sea of mud, rendering active operations an utter impossibility.</p>
                    <p>If Chandler speaks the truth, McClellan and the Generals under his command
                        wished to move on Virginia from Annapolis. But those profound military
                        geniuses, the President and Secretary of War, aided by the wise counsels of
                        the modern Solomons composing the immortal "Committee on the Conduct of the
                        War," ordered it otherwise. In spite of McClellan and all his Generals, the
                        army was ordered on Manassas. We had failed to take that point in July 1861,
                        although some of the members of this great "Committee on the Conduct of the
                        War" were near the field and lent their legs to our army when the time came
                        for it to run. The wounded pride of these gallant committee-men demanded
                        that Manassas should be taken, and in compliance with their demand, the
                        President and his Secretary overruled eight or ten of the best military men
                        in the service of the Union and ordered the army through the mud to
                        Manassas. It went--and so did the enemy, who had a good railroad to carry
                        his troops away; and then McClellan was abused because his army on foot,
                        marching through the mud in obedience to the President's order, did not
                        overtake the enemy in the cars.</p>
                    <p>McClellan and his Generals wanted to go one way. The President, taking the
                        valuable advice of the "Committee on the Conduct of the War," sent them
                        another. The movement failed and a sudden change under disadvantageous
                        circumstances had to be made; and what has it all resulted in? Instead of
                        besieging Richmond, our army, in spite of its own gallantry and the skill of
                        its commander, is itself besieged at the distance of twenty or thirty miles
                        from the rebel capital. Who is responsible? Chandler says McClellan--we say
                        Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>Splitting rails is healthful exercise, but if ever it made a great military
                        genius out of the raw material of a backwoods politician, history has failed
                        to record the fact.</p>

<b>Republican State Convention</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A reprint from a Republican paper that argues that the recent Union
                    convention should not been seen as a pure Republican meeting. By supporting
                    David Wilmot and ignoring Senator Cowan, but yet by also professing their
                    support for Lincoln's confiscation bill, they ignore the fact that Lincoln and
                    Wilmot were in opposition over certain sections of that bill, and that in fact
                    Lincoln took some of his positions from Cowan. The writer warns the convention
                    to take closer note of events and positions before it passes judgement on
                    people.<br>

                        Almost the entire population of the town had collected around the depot to

                    <p>The Country, the People, the Army and the Contrabands.</p>
                    <p>Camp Near Madison C. H., Va., <br>June 29th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Thus far have we chased the Rebel hordes; truly did General Pope say he had
                        come from the West, where they were accustomed to see the backs of the
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>We hear of rebel cavalry; we see remnants of rebel camps; but every forced
                        march only brings us at daylight, as far from the enemy as we were the
                        previous day. They must keep on their retreat beyond the Virginia Central
                        Railroad, or stand and meet us again. We are now as far South as any of our
                        troops have been. We are about ten miles east of Port Republic, and have an
                        eye on the Shenandoah Valley. We have complete possession of the country
                        north of the Rapidan river. Here it is easily forded in a large number of
                        places.</p>
                    <p>The country is fertile, and nearly the whole section, from Front Royal down,
                        has been planted with grain and potatoes, in profusion. The wheat and hay
                        has been mostly harvested, and the oats are being gathered. There is a great
                        scarcity of laborers, so many have gone to the rebel army, but whites enough
                        are left to act as overseers over the slaves, who are worked day and night.
                        In most instances all the women are set to work in the field. Further back
                        we inquired and found that nearly all the best of the slaves who were not
                        sent South have run off towards our army.</p>
                    <p>One plantation, an old lady told us, had a hundred and seventy women and
                        children, and but eleven men fit to work in the field; most of them had run
                        away. In another case was 85 women and children and seven men. Here,
                        however, the proportion is not so great, and several thousand able bodied
                        men can yet be gathered up in Madison, Culpepper, Rappahanock, Fauquier,
                        Rockingham, and Page counties. One of our trains which has just come in from
                        Warrenton, has nearly all the drivers contrabands from Prince William
                        county. One of them says he, in company with others, had come into Warrenton
                        "to see the sojers," and the Provost gathered them up and put them into the
                        service; all seemed pleased at the change.</p>
                    <p>As we were marching down here one of the mules gave out; on the side of a
                        hill was discerned a darkey ploughing, over goes a cavalry man, and soon the
                        "dark" was on his mule, coming across to the road; his "mule now has his
                        tail and mane cropped, the badge "U.S." upon his shoulder, and the dark was
                        set to carrying the knapsacks of some weary and footsore soldiers.</p>
                    <p>Last night when we encamped here, our wagons went out to get some forage, and
                        about a mile out found some thirty men cutting and binding oats. The teams
                        commenced to load it and in about a half an hour had it all on. The overseer
                        rode over and demanded pay. He was asked if he would take the oath of
                        allegiance, but refused. He commenced to utter a tirade against the theiving
                        [sic] Yankees, but on one of the drivers making toward him with a good sized
                        sapling, he suddenly recollected that he had buisiness [sic] in another
                        direction.</p>
                    <p>To-day we have a large force out making hay.</p>
                    <p>The men are in the best of spirits, and the issuing of the recent orders by
                        General Pope have cheered up the drooping heart of many a weary and foot
                        sore patriot, who has been tramping around the country for months, and when
                        worn out, been compelled to mount guard over Rebel commissary stores, while
                        Jackson's crew were refreshing themselves by sleep, ready to spring upon
                        them at some unexpected moment.</p>
                    <p>Among the luxuries for the sick and faint now taken from rebel garners and
                        fields are flour, ice, potatoes, sheep, poultry, &amp;c. Along
                        Hedgeman's creek, Carter's run, and other streams, ice houses were found
                        well filled.</p>
                    <p>The country is flooded with bogus Secesh money; it is impossible, in many
                        cases to tell the good from the bad. We went into a small store at
                        "Orlear's" one day, where they were selling "fip calico" at 35 cents per
                        yard, and the whole contents of the store you could carry in a bushel
                        basket, and found the proprietor was taking all the paper offered. On
                        looking over his "pile," we found four different kinds of Richmond ones, and
                        two of fives. Many were the most worthless imitations. He was very indignant
                        at "Banks' men," whom he alleges passed it upon him.</p>
                    <p>Meeting an aged contraband, this morning, he had been into camp selling eggs,
                        butter, &amp;c., we found he had "pay for massa," in Secesh paper nearly
                        all bogus. He said he did not care what kind it was, he took whatever was
                        offered.</p>
                    <p>Among the contrabands who have found their way into our camps is one "Ned,"
                        now with Gen. Rickett's Division, who used to wait upon the General while he
                        was in the tobacco warehouses of Richmond. He seemed highly elated to find
                        the General escaped, and in a position where he can go soon again to
                        Richmond.</p>
                    <p>Near Hedgeman's river is a tract of land several miles square, known as the
                        "Marshall Place." It belongs to the Widow Marshall who has three sons in the
                        rebel army and one at home. There are over three thousand bushels of wheat
                        in the garners and fifty cattle, besides hundreds of acres of hay, corn and
                        oats.</p>
                    <p>The son at home says he was a Union man while there was any Union men, but
                        now there was none. He admits that Virginia is ruined, and that she cannot
                        recover from the losses she has sustained in 25 years. He says that slavery
                        in Virginia is practically abolished; that the few they now hold will never
                        be of any value, no matter if the war were ended today.</p>
                    <p>He is a "religious rebel;" "believes in foreordination," and says it seems to
                        be the will of God that slavery shall be wiped out; but for all his hatred
                        of the Yankees is bitter in the extreme; he thinks that Virginia, or the
                        South, will never submit to the North, and he will leave all--home,
                        property, and all--before taking the oath.</p>
                    <p>Stopping to get a drink of an old slave woman, we asked her if she ever heard
                        of "old John Brown." "Yes, indeed massa, long while ago; de Lord sent him
                        out to free de slaves, but de Virginians hanged him and now de Lord send
                        down hosts of men." She was firm in the belief that it was "de contention of
                        de Lord" to make all free. Although near a hundred years old, she seemed as
                        highly delighted at the prospect of freedom as would a youth with the world
                        before him. We find that it is a prevalent idea that John Brown was merely
                        out on a kind of reconnoissance, and that he was the originator of the
                        present war.</p>
                    <p>We have occasional arrivals from Richmond. The Rebels it appears, are moving
                        a large force across the James river to operate against Suffolk, and prevent
                        McClellan from crossing the James river.</p>
