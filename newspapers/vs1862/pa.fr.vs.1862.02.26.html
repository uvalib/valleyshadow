<b>War News--Fort Donelson Victory</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Four different accounts of the final day of fighting at Fort Donelson in
                    Tennessee, where Union forces overran a strategic Confederate fort. Several
                    articles discuss the Unionist sympathies of many Confederate soldiers. The paper
                    also reprints the exchange of letters between Confederate General S.B. Buckner,
                    left in charge of Fort Donelson, and Union General U.S. Grant, commander of the
                    troops attacking the fort. Buckner proposes discussion of terms of surrender,
                    and Grant replied that "No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender
                    can be accepted. I propose to move immediately on your works." Buckner
                    surrenders, though noting Grant's "ungenerous and unchivalrous terms."<br>

<b>Object of the War</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter from Amos Kendall to President Lincoln, defending Northern
                    Democrats and attacking abolitionists. He argues that while Northern Democrats
                    were willing to compromise in the interests of peace, once war became inevitable
                    they rallied around President Lincoln's leadership, and will spare no sacrifice
                    to defend the Union. Abolitionists, on the other hand, sought to divert the
                    military strength of the country from a fight to save the Union to a fight to
                    free the slaves.<br>

<b>Remarks of Mr. Cox of Ohio, in Defence of Gen. McClellan</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Congressman Cox of Ohio replied to Congressman Gurley's criticisms of
                    General McClellan, noting that Gurley, a minister "whose thoughts have been more
                    on the dove than the eagle," was presumptuous in criticizing the military
                    strategy of McClellan. Rumors of McClellan's unpopularity with his troops were
                    unfounded, Cox went on to argue.<br>

<b>Cameron and Wilmot</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports a rumor that Simon Cameron, former Secretary of War and now envoy
                    to Russia, and Senator David Wilmot, both of Pennsylvania, are discussing
                    switching positions if the Pennsylvania legislature approves. The Valley Spirit
                    on one hand thinks it might be a good idea to rid the country of a troublesome
                    political influence (Wilmot) and to prevent Cameron from tarnishing the
                    country's image through his corruption. But ultimately, even though they think
                    it would embarrass the Republicans, the editors decide that having Cameron in
                    the Senate would be even worse.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Spirit Vindicated</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors refer to a recent exchange in which "would-be Union sliders"
                    took issue with the Valley Spirit's publication of statistics showing the amount
                    of cotton produced in South Carolina--in an effort by the Spirit to argue that
                    the South was of vital economic importance and should be kept in the Union.
                    These opponents disputed the Spirit's statistics, but the editors in this piece
                    produce another report of South Carolina's produce, and use it to argue that the
                    abolitionists are deliberately distorting the truth.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>No Compromise With Traitors</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors wonder how those who decry any compromise with the South will
                    make up for lost federal tax revenues.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This is the cry with which the Republican hungerers and thirsters after
                        plunder put down the Crittenden Compromise. They did not want our troubles
                        settled peaceably, for a peaceable settlement would not have filled their
                        pockets. Well, we got no compromise, and what is the result? We have five
                        thousand traitors now to every single traitor we had when the patriotic
                        Crittenden plead for compromise; and we have a war which, no matter how soon
                        it may end, will leave on our shoulders a debt of at least one thousand millions of dollars. This is the
                        lowest amount we can escape with. The interest on this debt, at 7.80, the
                        present treasury rate, will be seventy-three millions per annum. If the
                        country is kept together and the Southern States are made to pay their
                        proportion, Pennsylvania will have about one-tenth of this sum to raise--say
                        seven millions of dollars a year. If the South gets off, Pennsylvania will
                        have about one-sixth of it to make up--say twelve millions of dollars a
                        year. Can the people of this State stand the grinding of additional taxes
                        out of them to the amount of twelve millions per annum? Can they pay even
                        seven millions over and above their present State, County, School, Borough
                        and township taxes? We don't see how it is to be done. Perhaps those who
                        would have "no compromise with traitors" can tell us.</p>

                    demonstrates the fear of its authors more than the strength of the Confederacy.
                    When Georgians realize that the object of the war is to preserve the Union and
                    not to interfere with slavery, then they will realize the folly of secession.<br>

<b>The Twenty Second</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes the events celebrating Washington's Birthday in Chambersburg.<br>(Names in announcement: Capt. John Jeffries, Capt. John Doebler, Rev.  Harden,  W.S. EverettEsq.)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One hundred and thirty years have elapsed since the birth of Washington, and
                        the importance of commemorating his natal day, by every suitable evidence of
                        joy and congratulation, never seemed so forcibly felt, or the celebration so
                        generally participated in, as at the present time. Every heart appeared
                        warmed anew with patriotic zeal, and fresh determination to merit, maintain
                        and improve the glorious legacy transmitted to his countrymen by the great
                        and good Washington. Our citizens were not behind in celebrating the day in
                        an appropriate manner. A Procession was formed in the Public Square,
                        composed of the Military and Firemen, under the Marshalship of Capt. John
                        Jeffries, which paraded through the principal streets of the town and made a
                        very fine display. The Military company was made up of the three months men
                        under command of Capt. John Doebler. They marched and maneuvered with great
                        regularity and precision, and their firing could not have been surpassed for
                        accuracy and rapidity. The Band accompanied the Procession and discoursed
                        its choicest music along the route. The apparatus of the respective fire
                        companies was decorated in the most tasteful manner with evergreens and
                        flowers. The scenic effect of the Procession was still further increased by
                        a handsome display of flags and Banners. After parading the streets the
                        Procession returned to the Public Square where a beautiful new flag--the
                        Stars and Stripes--was raised on the liberty pole erected in the centre of
                        the Diamond. Washington's Farewell Address was then read in a very
                        impressive manner, by Rev. Harden, to an immense crowd collected in front of
                        the Franklin House. This was followed by an eloquent and patriotic discourse
                        delivered by W.S. Everett, Esq. The programme for the day wound up with some
                        excellent music from the Band, and splendid singing by the ladies on the
                        veranda of the Hotel. In the evening a grand display of Fire Works was given
                        in the Diamond that afforded much gratification to all classes of our
                        citizens. The celebration of the day was conducted by our citizens in a
                        manner becoming freemen who are proud of their liberty and their country,
                        and who glory in the name of WASHINGTON who established for them the best
                        form of government the world ever beheld.</p>

<b>Infanticide</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A Chambersburg girl is accused of depositing her newborn child in a privy.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We learn that another case of supposed infanticide has occurred in this moral community. A girl residing near the upper end
                        of Main Street gave birth to a child, a few days ago, and deposited it in
                        the vault of the privy. This is becoming a very fashionable way of disposing
                        of these little responsibilities, and unless an example is made of some of
                        the unnatural mothers, we may be shocked by hearing of crimes still more
                        horrible, if that were possible, being committed among us. If we keep on at
                        this rate old Herod won't be a circumstance to some of our modern gals in the matter of slaughtering infants.</p>
