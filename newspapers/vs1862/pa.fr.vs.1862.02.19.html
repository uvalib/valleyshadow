                    Senate. The Valley Spirit contrasts Cowan's behavior to that of Senator Wilmot,
                    who was supported by the Transcript, and argues that Wilmot's vote to remove
                    Bright from the Senate was not made in good conscience, and that significant
                    doubt existed as to whether or not Bright should have been removed. The editors
                    cite Wilmot's vote as further evidence of the disregard of Republicans for due
                    process and the Constitution.<br>(Names in announcement: Hon. Edgar Cowan)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Transcript has twice vindictively assailed
                        Senator COWAN for opposing the expulsion of JESSE D. BRIGHT from the Senate
                        of the United States. In its issue of the 5th inst. it said it supposed "he
                        intended to darken his career in the Senate with the encouragement of
                        treason;" and on the 12th it said: "Mr. COWAN has most surely dug his own
                        grave. His political life will evidently end at the expiration of his
                        present Senatorial term. He has positively refused, knowingly, according to
                        his own expressions, to represent his constituents properly in the Senate of
                        the United States. He has committed an outrage upon the old Keystone, and
                        the Legislature should very politely request him to resign his seat, so that
                        it can be filled by one more worthy of its honors," &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>We care nothing for JESSE D. BRIGHT, and Senator COWAN is neither a personal
                        nor political friend of ours. But we put in an indignant protest against the
                            Transcript's coarse denunciation of one of
                        the ablest and most honest representatives that Pennsylvania has for a long
                        time had in the Senate of the United States. The man who takes a seat in
                        that august body should discard the low partisanship that disgraces our
                        State Legislature. This Mr. COWAN has done; and because he has done it, and
                        sunk the partisan in the statesman, he is assailed in unmeasured terms by
                        certain members of his own party, who have not the elevation of mind to
                        appreciate the dignity and the justice of his official conduct.</p>
                    <p>The Transcript compares the course of Mr. WILMOT
                        with that of Mr. COWAN, and eulogizes the former as warmly as it denounces
                        the latter. The very quotations it makes from the debate between these two
                        Senators of Pennsylvania, shows the rank injustice of its attack upon Mr.
                        COWAN. When Mr. WILMOT said, in answer to Mr. COWAN's inquiry, that "he was
                        frank to admit that if he were sitting as a
                        juror, there are those doubts hanging about the case (of BRIGHT) that
                        would make him hesitate to pronounce a verdict of
                        guilty," he gave up the whole case in favor of Mr. COWAN. As a
                        Senator sitting in judgment upon a fellow-citizen, he committed a horrible
                        outrage by rendering a verdict which he would not have rendered if he had
                        been sitting as a juror.</p>
                    <p>One of the most deplorable signs of these most deplorable times, is the utter
                        disregard of law evinced by the Republican party in general. Not only do
                        Cabinet officers exercise powers never conferred upon them by the
                        Constitution and laws--not only do members of Congress and of the State
                        Legislature openly proclaim their want of respect for the sacred instrument
                        which this gigantic war is waged to maintain--but the town and township
                        leaders of the Republican party take under their special protection the
                        degenerate statesmen and politicians who thus trample upon and deride all
                        that a true American holds dear.</p>
                    <p>And worse than all, when an eminent lawyer like Senator COWAN, unable and
                        unwilling to unlearn all that he has ever learned about the Constitution and
                        laws of his country, refuses to follow the path marked out by the blind
                        malice of such men as SUMNER and WADE, the cry for vengeance upon him goes
                        forth at once from mouths that but a single year ago were sounding his
                        praises.</p>
                    <p>The Transcript, which tenderly consigns Senator
                        COWAN to a grave of his own digging, and calls upon the Legislature to
                        request him to resign, has not a word of condemnation for State Senator
                        LOWRY, whose remarks on his resolutions of instruction were a burning
                        disgrace to Pennsylvania. LOWRY, who knew very well that his views on legal
                        and constitutional questions were not worth a rusty nail in comparison with
                        COWAN's, appealed to the mob spirit of the North and declared that there was
                        "too much disposition shown to conduct this war on legal and constitutional
                        grounds." For saying less than this, Democrats have been whisked off to
                        forts and other military prisons, on the unlawful order of a Cabinet member
                        or military officer, with the full approval of the Transcript and other Republican journals.</p>
                    <p>It is such men as these political gods of the Transcript, WILMOT and LOWRY, who have brought the country to the
                        verge of ruin. It is such men as COWAN who will yet save her, if she is not
                        beyond the reach of salvation. There is not now in the whole country a man
                        who has done more than DAVID WILMOT to estrange and imbroil the two sections
                        of the Union. From the day when he offered his celebrated proviso in Congress, fourteen or fifteen years ago,
                        the country has known no peace on the slavery question. That firebrand,
                        wantonly lighted in the Capitol of the nation, has gone on burning with ever
                        increasing fury, till it has enveloped the whole country in the frightful
                        conflagration we are now struggling to suppress. LOWRY is but another WILMOT
                        on a smaller scale. He has less ability, but even more malice. He has no
                        capability for doing good in any sphere of life, and under ordinary
                        circumstances he could do but little harm; but he is a dangerous light to
                        follow in times like these, and the Transcript
                        incurs a heavy responsibility by holding him up as a guide to the public.</p>
                    <p>Senator COWAN's general course in the Senate, so far as it has attracted our
                        attention, has been that of an able, resolute, safe and honest man. The
                            Transcript will find itself mistaken in
                        predicting that he has dug his grave. It may cover him with abuse and slaver
                        WILMOT with praise, but the honest people of patriotic old Pennsylvania will
                        have no difficulty in distinguishing between the enlightened statesman and
                        the mischievous demagogue. As long as EDGAR COWAN stands by the
                        Constitution, Pennsylvania will stand by him--for it is not the sentiment of this glorious old State that the
                        Constitution can be saved only by being violated.</p>

                        try to give you a few items that perhaps may be
                        acceptable to some of your readers although you cannot expect much from a
                        poor soldier. There has been nothing exciting here in this division of the
                        army since that famous communication to the Cincinnati Gazette from this place. The Pennsylvania boys of this Reg't
                        were very much pleased with your notice of it in the Valley Spirit. All we ask is a chance at the enemy and we will
                        try to earn our laurels. I saw an extract from a letter from this Reg't, in
                        your paper in regard to rations issued to this Reg't which I was sorry to
                        see. The writer carried the idea that we were not very well provided for. I
                        think this Reg't has been well supplied with provisions with one or two
                        exceptions. When the bridge over the Rolling Fork River was washed away we
                        lived on a very short allowance for a few days. We have had once or twice
                        some crackers that were rather hard but they were an exception. In fact I
                        can say that we have much better living than I expected when I entered the
                        service. We of course do not fare as well in regard to delicacies from our
                        friends as we would if encamped near home, which I presume is better for us,
                        as I have noticed whenever the boys have received
                        boxes from home they are apt to get on the sick list. There is no prospect
                        of a forward movement here at present, but we never know before an order
                        comes. We are all in hopes to see a forward movement soon. Mr. EDITOR if our
                        friends at home would only write us letters oftener and give us all the home
                        news they would often raise our drooping spirits. If this should prove
                        acceptable you may hear from the Bloody 77th again.</p>
