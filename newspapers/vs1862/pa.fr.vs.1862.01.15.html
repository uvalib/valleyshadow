<b>First Annual Message of Andrew G. Curtain, Governor of Pennsylvania</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article reprints Governor Curtain's January 8 address to the State
                    Senate and House. Curtain deals with the finances of the state first and then
                    turns to a number of issues surrounding railroad construction and financing. He
                    then spends the bulk of his address discussing Pennsylvania's participation in
                    the war effort. He lauds the patriotism of Pennsylvania volunteers and notes
                    that thus far Pennsylvania has contributed 109,615 men to the cause. He also
                    discusses purchases of armaments by the state and then briefly turns to other
                    state issues.<br>

<b>To The Public</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>George H. Mengel has sold the Valley Spirit to P.S. Dechert, who had been
                    connected with the paper until two years ago, when he sold his interest to
                    Mengel, and to B.Y. Hamsher, former Clerk of the Courts of the County, a
                    Democrat who was elected in a majority Republican county. Mengel thanks his
                    subscribers for their patronage and assures them that no change will be made in
                    editorial content. The Valley Spirit will continue to speak as the voice of
                    Franklin County Democrats.<br>(Names in announcement:  P.S. Dechert,  B.Y. Hamsher,  George H. Mengel)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have disposed of the Valley Spirit Printing
                        Establishment to Messrs. P. S. DECHERT and B. Y. HAMSHER by whom the paper
                        will hereafter be published. This arrangement will make no change in the
                        business relations our patrons hold with this establishment. The size, price
                        and tone of the paper will remain unchanged, and the business department of
                        the office will be conducted as heretofore. The new firm will take charge of
                        the entire business of the establishment from the first of January, 1862. It
                        is not necessary for us to bestow an extended eulogy on the gentlemen to
                        whom we have sold out. Their characters as honest men and good citizens will
                        be endorsed by every man in this community. They possess all the
                        qualifications necessary for conducting a successful and popular paper, and
                        one that will not only command the support of its own party but the respect
                        of the public generally. Mr. DECHERT has been connected with the Valley Spirit ever since its establishment in this
                        place in 1848, until about two years ago when he sold out his interest to
                        the undersigned. He was always looked upon as the business man of the
                        establishment, and in truth, to his energy and tact is the paper indebted
                        for the extensive patronage it now enjoys. He will be found careful and
                        prompt in all business transactions and never fail to deal justly by, and
                        give entire satisfaction to the patrons of the establishment. Mr. HAMSHER is
                        a gentleman of unblemished moral character, honored and esteemed by all who
                        know him. He is a sterling Democrat and most ardently devoted to the
                        principles of his party. In 1857 he was nominated by the Democratic party
                        for the office of Clerk of the Courts of this County, and although the party
                        is in the minority, he was elected by the very handsome majority of nearly
                        three hundred votes. He fulfilled the duties of his office faithfully and
                        intelligently, and it was the general remark that we never had a more
                        attentive and accommodating officer to fill the position he occupied in our
                        Courts. We know of no man in the county who would be more acceptable to the
                        Democratic party in connection with their political organ than Mr. HAMSHER.
                        Under the judicious management of these gentlemen the Valley Spirit cannot fail in maintaining the high character it
                        has acquired, and retaining and extending its circulation and patronage.</p>
                    <p>In taking leave of our patrons we would return our thanks for the very
                        liberal patronage and many acts of kindness bestowed upon us while connected
                        with the Spirit. We labored, in return,
                        assiduously and conscientiously for the advancement of the Democratic party,
                        and from the very generous support we have uniformly received we feel that
                        our efforts have been appreciated and fully rewarded. In retiring we would
                        bespeak for the new firm the patronage of the public in general, and from
                        the Democracy that "aid and comfort" which they, as the publishers of the
                        political organ of the party in this county, are entitled to claim.</p>

<b>The Abolitionists at Work</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial arguing that, of the two forces seeking to keep the Union apart,
                    abolitionists are far more pernicious than secessionists--the latter are
                    fighting for property, while the former are fighting for a misguided ideal.
                    Abolitionists have become obsessed only with freeing the slaves, regardless of
                    the consequences that freeing African Americans would have on the country. The
                    editorial was prompted by a petition circulating in Franklin county, apparently
                    through the churches, supporting the emancipation of slaves in the Confederacy.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are two classes of politicians in our country engaged in efforts to
                        prevent a restoration of the Union--the Secessionists of the South and the
                        Abolitionists of the North. He stands ready to sacrifice everything near and
                        dear--the Union itself--for the sake of the negro. The Secessionist asks to
                        be "let alone" in the enjoyment of his property
                        or he is ready to break up the Union and set up for himself. The one is
                        contending for his "rights"--the other for an "idea." The Abolitionist
                        professes to be chuckfull of philanthropy for the negro--we mean the negro a
                        far off--"a way down South," but he entertains the most supreme contempt for
                        the black man around him. He would move Heaven and Earth to free the slave, and elevate him to an equality with the
                        white-man, but the free negro at his door might
                        come up as a worthless weed and rot where he grows for ought he cares. This
                        is the fanatical one-sided idea that has crazed the heads of so many
                        northern politicians. We might laugh at the absurdity of the thing as we do
                        at spiritualism, free loveism, and all the other isms that go hand in hand
                        with Abolitionism, was there not such "a method in the madness" as to
                        produce a great deal of trouble in the country. With this fanatical faction
                        the "Constitution of the United States is a Covenant with Hell;" the Flag of
                        our Country--the Glorious Stars and Stripes--is "Hates Polluted Rag;" the
                        leader of this Abolition party, but a short time ago, declared that he went
                        in for a dissolution of the Union because he "considered the dissolution the
                        abolition of slavery, and if the Union made every man as wise as Solomon,
                        and as pure as St. John, and as safe as an angel in the courts of Heaven, to
                        cling to it would be a damnable crime while slavery exists!" It is these
                        atrocious sentiments, and others like them, that have provoked the present
                        war, and to prolong it to the "bitter end" the nigger is dragged into the
                        contest by his wooly-head at every turn until it has resolved itself into a
                        war for the special benefit of Sambo, and his abolition admirers. To fight
                        for the maintenance of the Union or the defence of our Constitution and
                        Government is no part of the abolition creed. With them the motto is "the
                        Union may slide but hold on to the nigger!" Is it to be wondered at that the
                        Southern people felt alarmed at their position in the Union, with four
                        hundred millions of property in slaves endangered by the advent of such a
                        fiendish party to power? The country was well warned of the mischief that
                        abolitionism was brewing in the land. That wise statesman and pure patriot
                        HENRY CLAY made this wonderful prediction in the United States Senate in
                        1839, which has been literally fulfilled:</p>
                    <p>"Sir, I am not in the habit of speaking lightly of the possibility of
                        dissolving this happy Union. The Senate know that I have deprecated
                        allusions, on ordinary occasions, to that direful event. The country will
                        testify that if there be anything in the history of my public career worthy
                        of recollection, it is the truth and sincerity of my ardent devotion to its
                        lasting preservation. But we should be false to our allegiance if we did not
                        discriminate between the imaginary and real dangers by which it may be
                        assailed. Abolitionism should no longer be regarded as an imaginary danger.
                        The Abolitionists, let me suppose succeed in their present aim of uniting
                        the inhabitants of the free States, as one man, against the inhabitants of
                        the slave States. Union on one side will beget union on the other; and this
                        process of reciprocal consolidation will be attended with all the violent
                        prejudice, embittered passions and implacable animosities which ever
                        degraded or deformed human nature. One section will stand in menacing and
                        hostile array against the other. The collision of
                            opinion will be quickly followed by the clash of arms. I will not
                        attempt to describe scenes which now happily lie concealed from our view.
                        Abolitionists themselves would shrink back in dismay and horror at the
                        contemplation of desolated fields, conflagrated cities,
                            murdered inhabitants and the overthrow of the fairest fabric of human
                            government that ever rose to animate the hopes of civilized man."</p>
                    <p>Thus said the great and good statesman HENRY CLAY. His counsel was heard and
                        heeded by the men of his day and there was no civil war in the country. He
                        knew where the real danger lay and pointed out Abolitionism as the evil that
                        would ultimately overthrow the Union. He was a man of peace and the friend
                        of compromise for the sake of the Union, but if he lived at this day and
                        would talk of peace he would be pronounced a
                        "traitor," and of compromise a "coward." The
                        conservative men of the country, backed by the entire Democracy, have
                        labored long and faithfully to avert the calamities that now hang over the
                        land like a funeral pall; they have warned the people that unless a stop was
                        put to the progress of Abolitionism it must surely end in the dissolution of
                        the Union. The warning was unheeded--a sectional party, reared on the basis
                        of Abolitionism, was elevated to power and at once the horrors of a
                        fratricidal war burst upon us, "attended with all the
                            violent prejudices, embittered passions and implacable animosities which
                            ever degraded or deformed human nature." Thus has the prophesy of
                        CLAY become true.</p>
                    <p>But why trouble ourselves about Abolitionism? The skirts of the Democracy are
                        clear of it, it is only known among us by name, and is confined to a handful
                        of crazy fanatics in "Yankee land" who take up with spiritualism,
                        free-loveism, abolitionism, and every other ism, that tends to infidelity.
                        We have surely none among us who would be misled by such a scandalous,
                        wicked and treasonable doctrine! Come, gentle reader, allow us to undeceive
                        you. We have men--ah, Christian men--in our own county who are as rabid
                        Abolitionists at heart as Loyd, Garrison or Wendell Phillips. Some of them
                        even pretend to be followers of the "meek and lowly Jesus" but in place of
                        preaching the Gospel of "peace and good will towards men," mistake their
                        calling and exhibit, in and out of the pulpit, the most infuriated spirit of
                        vindictiveness towards the whole Southern portion of their common country.
                        They would rather every foot of our country would be drenched in fraternal
                        blood than concede one iota of their miserable idiosyncrasies. These are the
                        men of the same stamp of the New England Puritans, who killed the Indians,
                        hung the Quakers, drove out the Baptists, drowned women for witches, and all
                        in the name of Religion! Have we the evidence that this species of
                        fanaticism is rampant among us? We think we have. The following petition is
                        now abroad for signatures in a part of Franklin County and many have deluded
                        into signing it through church influence. It is a
                        most arrant abolition imposition on the loyal people of the county, and
                        strange to say a few Democrats have been deluded by the arch machinations of
                        these destroyers of our country into signing it--these worse than madmen who
                        talk of restoring and preserving the Union by emancipating the negroes! Such
                        an absurd idea could only originate in the addled brain of a stark-mad
                        Abolitionist. But let us have the "petition" that wise and patriotic

                    <p>"As petitions of vital importance have been presented to Congress asking for
                        the unconditional emancipation of the slaves of the Rebel States, and also
                        to assign territory to them where they can enjoy the protection of the
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>AND WHEREAS--Congress should receive the united sympathy and Mutual

                    <p>AND WHEREAS--The various Christian Denominations form a very important part

                        condemnation of Southern Treason, and Slavery, therefore</p>

                        and government of these United States.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, 2nd that this preamble and resolution be
                        signed by men representing the various Protestant Churches in the Northern
                        states, a copy of which to be forwarded to the president, Cabinet, Senate
                        and House of Representatives."</p>
                    <p>Signed by Rev Joshua Kennedy, Jacob B Cook, Dr. Henry K. Byers, John McLean
                        and 107 others.</p>
                    <p>We confess we were mistaken in regard to the extent of the anti-slavery
                        feeling among us. We could not suppose that patriotism was at such a low
                        ebb. That there was among us those who are willing to see our gallant army
                        fight to free the negroes without caring what becomes of the Constitution
                        and the Union. This scheme of emancipating the negroes is a programme of
                        blood and horrors. It cannot be carried out without violating the
                        Constitution and destroying the Union for ever. Those who favor this
                        infamous proposal will boldly tell you that the Constitution must be set
                        aside. They are well aware that it recognizes Slavery and protects it in the
                        States were it exists, but that is of no consequence in their minds. The war must be prosecuted for the entire and total
                            abolition of Slavery or it can meet with no favor at their hands.
                        This is the issue they have thrown upon the country which is to divide the
                        sentiment of the Northern people and crush out every spark of Union feeling
                        in the South. The North has, heretofore, been united and her people making
                        great sacrifices, and contributing men and money to carry on the war for the
                        restoration of the Union and enforcement of the laws. The Abolitionists
                        would pervert it from this object and make it a grand scheme for the
                        emancipation of the negroes. Will our army fight in such a cause? To free
                        four millions of ignorant negroes would be one of the most inhuman acts that
                        could be inflicted on the people--white and black, north and south. If they
                        were allowed to come North, and if you free them you give them the right to
                        go where they please, there would be an influx of these creatures that would
                        create among our laboring men an enormous competition, by which their wages
                        would be reduced to the lowest standard of European poverty. But the idea is
                        to "colonize them in the Southern territory to be under
                            the protection, care, and government of the United States." This
                        is displaying an amount of ignorance concerning the nature of our Government
                        that would disgrace the most ignorant negro in the land. It could not, of
                        course, be carried out unless the Union is restored, and if again restored
                        it must be on the basis of allowing the States to control their domestic
                        affairs after their own fashion. The negroes set free by the act of the
                        general Government would be immediately re-enslaved by the Southern States
                        if found in them, nor could the Government prevent this without destroying
                        the rights of the States and revolutionizing the entire character of our
                        institutions. But the most ridiculous portion of the above petition is the
                        plan proposed to free the negro from the individuals and make the Government
                        his master. The Government is to become a slave-holder and work the nigger
                        for the benefit of the Northern Abolitionist. The negroes are to be taken
                        from their present masters and made to cultivate, "under
                            the protection, care and government of the United States" the
                        cotton fields of the South to enrich the Lords of the Loom in the North.
                        This is a new feature in abolitionism and Yankee economy with a vengeance.
                        The fact is while the Abolitionist pretends to feel for the supposed
                        sufferings of the slaves they have always kept an eye single to their own
                        pockets, and would run a cargo of slaves into a Southern port tomorrow if it
                        were not for the blockade. Men have only to look at this emancipation
                        question fully, fairly and frankly and they will soon satisfy themselves
                        that it is unsound in law and morals, and henceforth keep their signatures
                        clear of Abolition petitions.</p>

                    Volunteers, quartered on the North Bank of the Green River in Kentucky. Jacob
                    Royer, from near Waynesboro in Company A, under the command of Captain McKesson,
                    died; James Ronlet, from near Shippensburg in Company C under the command of
                    Captain McNally also died. Daniel Levanite from Franklin County, in the Battery
                    Company, has been lost but it was not certain if he was drowned or taken
                    prisoner--he was sent out to collect water, and his kettle was found later but
                    no trace of Levanite. Confederate cavalry had been active in the area so it was
                    possible that he was taken prisoner. Generally, the 77th is in good health and

<b>Annual Report of Henry D. Moore, State Treasurer</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Moore discusses three primary areas of activity of his department: the
                    issuing of state bonds, at 6% interest, to fund the wartime expenditures of the
                    state; the means by which the state will pay the $1.9 million dollar tax levied
                    by the federal government for support of the war effort; and the default of the
                    Wyoming Canal Company on the $281,000 in bonds the state holds. Moore added a
                    commentary on the unjust structure of state tax laws, which, he argues, allowed
                    wealthy holders of bonds, mortgages, and other securities to escape taxation and
                    threw the tax burden onto real property holders.<br>
