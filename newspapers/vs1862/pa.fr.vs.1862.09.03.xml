                <summary>Transcripts of two speeches given at a Democratic rally in Philadelphia on
                    August 23, 1862. These speeches emphasize the commitment of the Democratic party
                    to the Constitution and to the fighting of the war against the rebellion. The
                    speakers also express their support for President Lincoln and Secretary of War
                    Stanton. They also quote the letter from Lincoln to Horace Greeley in which the
                    President singles out the preservation of the Union as the pre-eminent goal of
                    the war. The speeches and resolutions blame abolitionist congressmen for the
                    war.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The condition of the military affairs of the country are not as flattering at
                        the present time, as the hopes of the people led them to expect. The army of
                        Virginia has fallen back from the line of the Rappahannock to some point we
                        hardly know where. We have accounts of two successful rebel raids in the
                        rear of Pope's army within a week, and also a rumor that the rebels are at
                        Manassas in force, which however we discredit. It is exceedingly difficult
                        with the confused and conflicting reports that reach us, to arrive at
                        anything like a correct understanding of the real condition of things.</p>
                    <p>One thing, however, is certain, our arms have met with some serious reverses
                        of late, and we are apparently no nearer the end of this struggle than we
                        were a year ago. We say apparently, for we still hope and believe that with
                        the new levies now pouring into the field, that the campaign may be so
                        managed by those in authority, as to turn the tide of victory in our favor,
                        the war be brought to a speedy termination, and the national authority
                        re-established over every foot of territory belonging to the nation.</p>
                    <p>Among the mistakes that have been made in the past, the first and greatest in
                        our opinion, was under-estimating the strength and resources of the South.
                        Our rulers seemed to have had no adequate conception of the task before
                        them. The people also were carried away by the same delusion, and permitted
                        themselves to run into the wildest extravagance and fanaticism on the
                        subject. This rebellion was to be crushed out in a few weeks or months at
                        most. It was to be a mere breakfast-task some told us, and he who dared to
                        differ from these absurd notions, was put down as a "sympathizer with
                        treason." We have all since been convinced of the fatal error by sad
                        experience.</p>
                    <p>Another mistake, the logical consequence of the other, was made in not
                        calling out a sufficient force at once to crush out the rebellion, and
                        restore the national authority. We solemnly believe that with 200,000
                        additional men in the field after our brilliant successes in the Southwest,
                        and when Gen. McClellan first advanced into Virginia, the war would be
                        substantially ended to-day, and the authority of the government under a
                        process of successful restoration in all the States. Then the rebellion was
                        tottering to its fall, and one heavy blow struck in Virginia, such as
                        200,000 additional men could have struck, would have ended its life at once.</p>
                    <p>But unfortunately for the country, Congress was in session at the time, both
                        branches controlled in a great measure by men of one idea--miserable
                        charlatans, abstractionists and theorists, devoid of common sense and
                        lacking in everything necessary to constitute practical statesmanship. These
                        men had other ends to accomplish than the saying of the country. They had a
                            <emph rend="italic">party</emph> programme to carry out. Slavery had to
                        be abolished in the District of Columbia and the Territories. Confiscation
                        and emancipation bills were introduced and urged with a persevering energy
                        and fanatical zeal, regardless of Constitutional objections or their
                        injurious effect upon the Union cause in the Slave States. Through the
                        clamor and "pressure" of these men, President Lincoln was induced to step
                        aside from the plain path of his duty and tinker at the slavery question.
                        With all due respect for the President, and full confidence in the honesty
                        of his intentions, we think he made a serious blunder in bringing forward
                        his "emancipation policy" at that particular time. It has not resulted in
                        anything practical, and it is apparent to us that it never will. What we
                        wanted then was what we want now, a more vigorous prosecution of the war by
                        throwing an overwhelming force into the field. If the President, instead of
                        sending his ill-timed message into Congress asking the Border States to
                        liberate their slaves, had issued a proclamation calling into the field
                        several hundred thousand new men, the results might have proved of infinite
                        importance, and the country would not be in the condition we find it to-day.</p>
                    <p>But we do not wish to grieve over the past, or needlessly deplore that which
                        cannot now be remedied. We simply allude to the facts with the hope, that
                        similar errors may be avoided in the future. We want the whole power and
                        resources of the loyal portion of the country thrown into this struggle, in
                        order to suppress this unholy, terrible and damning rebellion at once. <emph
                            rend="italic">This must be done and that as speedily as possible</emph>.
                        If this war should be permitted to last until the resources of the country
                        are exhausted we shall have anarchy in the country as certain as tomorrow's
                        sun shall rise; and after anarchy we will have despotism as its legitimate
                        and logical sequence. Hence the necessity of putting an end to this war in
                        the shortest possible time in which it can be done.</p>
                    <p>We also want that miserable tribe of fanatical and one-idea men who occupy
                        seats in the present Congress turned out, and their places filled by men of
                        sense--men who have the ability to comprehend the magnitude of the crisis
                        through which we are passing, and the patriotism to adapt the means to the
                        end, regardless of sectional prejudices or partisan bigotry. We want no more
                        trifling whilst the nation is trembling upon the brink of ruin. In
                        conclusion, we append the following appropriate remarks from that staunch
                        Union paper, the <emph rend="italic">Louisville Democrat</emph>:</p>
                    <p>The late disgusting acts of Congress, proposing confiscation, emancipation,
                        and the employment of negroes, all resulted from conscious weakness. They
                        were desperate expedients to supply the lack of power. If they had called
                        for the whole power of the country the rebellion would have fallen without
                        any of these desperate expedients, and it will never be put down with them.
                        We want no new laws with hard penalties leading to barbarous results. We
                        want soldiers, soldiers, soldiers in countless multitudes--legions, that
                        there is no power in this conspiracy to resist.</p>
                    <p>This will be a vigorous and energetic prosecution of the war. The parade of
                        laws on the statute-book and bulky proclamations are all idle. With such
                        force no more laws are needed, no unconstitutional enactments or
                        unconstitutional practices are wanted. Such power can afford to be generous
                        as well as just. It will accomplish the end without a trespass on private
                        rights or personal liberty. In its presence we can afford to support the
                        dominion of law and order, and dispense with suspicions and watchfulness,
                        which comparative weakness is compelled to resort to. Let us have this sort
                        of vigor.</p>
                    <p>P.S. Since writing the foregoing article we have received important and
                        stirring news from the seat of war in Virginia. A series of battles have
                        been fought during the last week. A severe engagement took place on Friday
                        between Gen. Popes forces and the rebel forces under Gen. Jackson, on the
                        old Bull Run battle ground, between Centerville and Manassas. After fighting
                        from early in the morning until late in the evening, the rebels were driven
                        back and Gen. Pope retained possession of the field during the night. The
                        next day, Gen. Jackson being heavily re-inforced, renewed the contest, and
                        after severe fighting, Gen. Pope was compelled to fall back to Centerville,
                        which he did in good order. Since then the news has been vague and
                        unsatisfactory. We refer our readers to our news columns to gather such
                        information as we have been able to give them.</p>

                <summary>Discusses recent reports of Union setbacks in Virginia. The editors blame
                    these defeats on the fact that both the leaders and the people of the North
                    underestimated the South. Added to that was the denial to General McClellan of
                    sufficient troops to crush the rebellion decisively. The editors fault
                    Congress's interference in the war. They go on to urge that the full resources
                    of the country be thrown against the rebellion, and then note at the end that
                    late news indicates a defeat of the Union troops at Manassas.</summary>

                    <p>There is a small sheet published in this place calling itself the <emph
                            rend="italic">semi-weekly-dispatch</emph>. Its <emph rend="italic"
                            >semi-weakly</emph> contents are composed of a compound of fanaticism,
                        bigotry and <emph rend="italic">malice</emph>. It intensely hates everything
                        that is just, national and conservative, and pursues with a vindictive
                        malignity becoming a demon, all persons who disapprove of the bigoted
                        fanaticism which <emph rend="italic">it</emph> advocates. It publishes in
                        its columns, the prattle of children two years of age, for the purpose of
                        casting reproach on their parents.</p>
                    <p>If three or four Democrats happen to meet on the street and engage in
                        conversation, the fact is published in its next issue as the meeting of a
                        treasonable conclave. It has in its employ, a set of spies, eaves-droppers
                        and informers, who report imaginary conversations and <emph rend="italic"
                            >looks</emph> of Democrats for publication. It is governed by no fixed
                        principle and has no "method in its madness," but wanders about in darkness
                        like a Will-o-the-wisp, indulging in all sorts of inconsistencies, such as
                        endorsing the order of Gen. Hunter liberating the slaves in his department,
                        on <emph rend="italic">Tuesday</emph>, and on <emph rend="italic"
                        >Friday</emph> of the same week, endorsing the order of the President <emph

                    <p>The poor thing is afflicted with a deep-seated and chronic enmity towards the

                        it in its distress we regard its hatred as a compliment to ourselves. It
                        keeps carping, snarling and barking at us regularly after the fashion of a
                        very small terrier dog. All we have to say on that point is, that if it
                        derives as much pleasure from the employment as we do amusement, we advise
                        it to keep on. In short it is an immense paper and has an immense
                        circulation particularly in the country, which country circulation is
                        regularly carried to the Post-office by a small boy in his vest pocket.</p>

                        few years ago, our friend of the <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph> is said
                        to have called upon his Highness at the house of a colored friend in town.
                        The interview we have no doubt was <emph rend="italic">mutually</emph>
                        agreeable. That was immediately before the John Brown raid into Virginia,
                        with which the above stated interview <emph rend="italic">might</emph> have
                        had some connection.</p>
                    <p>In one of his issues of last week appears a characteristic attack on the
                            <emph rend="italic">Spirit and Times</emph>, which is about the lamest
                        attempt at with and satire we have ever seen. In strict accordance with the
                        petty malice governing the establishment, its venom is hissed, serpent-like,
                        at the new member of the firm.</p>
                    <p>The author of this article, we have no doubt, is a certain <emph
                            rend="italic">profound</emph> legal gentleman who changes his political
                        opinions, we believe; not more than twice a year, and boasts upon the street
                        of being the Editor and having a <emph rend="italic">pecuniary</emph>
                        interest in the concern. We would say to him, that we do not pretend to be
                        learned in the law, but if we ever should turn our attention in that
                        direction, we hope to have his valuable assistance as <emph rend="italic"

                    have been connected with John Brown's raid.</summary>

                    <p>Headquarters 3d Brigade, Sturgis Div. <lb/>Alexandria, VA., Aug. 29, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Messrs Editors: The 126th Pennsylvania has been thrown into the Third Brigade
                        of Sturgis' Division, which consists of the 91st, 126th and 129th
                        Pennsylvania, and an Ohio regiment and battery. It is under command of Brig
                        Gen E E Tyler, of Ohio, who has seen much active service and is reputed to
                        be a brave and efficient officer. The other Brigade officers, as far as I
                        have learned their names, are Capt. and A. A. G., E. S. Quay; Lieut and
                        A.D.C., Wm Given; Capt and A.Q.M., John Morris; and Capt and C.S., J.G.
                        Willis. I have had the distinguished pleasure of becoming acquainted with
                        most of these gentlemen, have found them all courteous and accommodating,
                        and can safely pledge them all to do their duty under any and all
                        circumstances.</p>
                    <p>We have had stirring times in this vicinity during the past week. The roar of
                        the enemy's cannon is almost continually ringing in our ears. Of course but
                        very little that occurs is allowed to find its way into the public prints,
                        and that little is very unreliable, being chiefly concocted by persons miles
                        away from the field of action, no newspaper correspondents being allowed any
                        intercourse with the army. Our information is very limited and some things
                        we have an inkling of it would be impolitic to allude to. Suffice it to say,
                        communication with Pope's army has been completely cut off by Jackson's
                        forces, who now hold Manassas Junction in force. Whether they will be cut
                        off and compelled to surrender, or whether the same fate awaits our forces,
                        remains to be seen. I do not regard the movements and engagements of the
                        last few days as looking anything like a Federal Victory. There can be no
                        doubt of the fact that Manassas is very strongly fortified, whatever
                        assertions may have been made to the contrary; those fortifications are now
                        held by the rebels, and are between Pope's army and Washington. Strong blows
                        and heavy artillery only will now determine which army has succeeded in
                        cutting the other off.</p>
                    <p>Our regiment did not move, as anticipated, last week. Our whole brigade
                        remained behind, though the other brigades of our Division advanced to
                        Manassas, and participated in one of the recent engagements. On Wednesday
                        evening, we were ordered to strike tents and prepare to march, and laid on
                        our arms the whole night, when the order was countermanded and we again took
                        up our temporary abode on the old camping ground. Several of the railroad
                        bridges on the Manassas road are burned, and this may account for the delay
                        in our movements. Shortly after dusk, on the evening referred to, we
                        received the first news of the fighting at Manassas and Centreville, and of
                        the retrograde movement of a portion of our army. One continuous stream of
                        baggage wagons and ambulances had been filing by our camp all afternoon; and
                        soon a report was spread around the camp that the rebels had even advanced
                        between Centreville and Washington and were about attacking our forces at
                        Fairfax Court House, which, if they had succeeded in taking, would have
                        probably placed us in the same condition as Pope. We were drawn up in line
                        of battle, commanded to load our guns, and then permitted to lie down and
                        sleep if we felt so disposed, and sleep we did, very soundly too, for we had
                        been drawn up in line with our guns, knapsacks and accoutrements all fixed
                        for moving and remained for several hours, expecting every moment to take up
                        the line of march for the scene of action, where in the distance the thunder
                        of the cannon was rolling along the hills.</p>
                    <p>I see some of our papers have deemed it worth while to refer to the gallant
                        "Water-melon charge" of the 126th, and it seems proper that I should allude
                        to the matter. It is true that some indiscreet and blameworthy young men did
                        enter a car, which was standing on the sideling, at Bridgeport, <emph
                            rend="italic">through an open door</emph>, and take therefrom some
                        water-melons. It is also true that subsequently a door was broken open, and
                        altogether, perhaps, some thirty or forty melons taken. Yet, for this
                        conduct, it is to be hoped the friends at home will not seek to blame the
                        whole regiment. We know the proceeding was openly and most strongly
                        denounced by the great majority; and as soon as the officers discovered the
                        outrage, they put a stop to it at once. That is was an outrage, it would be
                        useless to deny, and I assure you the disgrace is keenly felt. Yet we all
                        unite in denouncing the statement which appeared in the Harrisburg <emph
                            rend="italic">Telegraph</emph>, to the effect that four hundred melons,
                        or one hundred dollars worth, were taken, as an unmitigated falsehood, which
                        both the man who told the tale and he who wrote the article knew to be such.
                        I sincerely hope some movement will be made to compensate the unfortunate
                        individual for the loss of his melons. But somehow those who participated
                        most extensively in the "charge," seem to be the least willing to respond to
                        such a call.</p>
                    <p>We in the North complain of the effects of the War, but to see it in all its
                        horrors one should visit Alexandria. It almost equals the description of
                        Goldsmith's Deserted Village, with the exception of the stir and bustle
                        created by the proximity of our large army. Half the houses and stores and
                        deserted, and the streets are neglected and dirty, while the whole city
                        seems to be one immense hospital, or army storehouse, with long trains of
                        wagons or ambulances rumbling over the roughly paved streets at all hours of
                        the day and night.</p>
                    <p>I am at present detached from the Regiment, being in the Brigade
                        Quarter-master's Department, but see or hear from "the boys" daily, and will
                        endeavor to keep you posted on all the news.</p>
                    <p>Several of the "messes" desire me to think, individually and collectively,
                        those kind friends who have kept them so well supplied with delicacies and
                        conveniences, and I take great pleasure in adding my own having done my best
                        to demolish the contents of several of the boxes. In this connection it
                        might not be out of place to say that our address till remains unchanged.</p>

                    wagons and ambulances go by their camp daily. He reports that they are not

                    it as far as Fairfax court house. Alexandria, he adds, is a deserted city and

                <summary>An announcement of the opening of the Common Schools of Chambersburg, which
                    took place last Monday. All the teachers, listed above, return from the previous
                    year, except Miss Charlotte Heck, who replaces a teacher who declined a
                    reappointment. The schools will remain open for 10 months.</summary>

                <summary>Reports that the deputy marshals appointed to enroll all persons subject to
                    military duty are making progress. The only time they were not received with a
                    "manly, patriotic spirit" was at Col. Hughes' ironworks, where several of the
                    "hands" treated the deputy "rather roughly." The editors condemn their conduct
                    and state that everyone should be willing to give to the government in return
                    for the protection it affords.</summary>

                <summary>Reprint of a request from the Surgeon General asking on behalf of the
                    Ladies' Soldiers Aid Society for women and children to help fill a lint
                    shortage. Lint is used in bandaging wounds, and the Surgeon General urges women
                    and children to help "scrape up" extra lint. He also asks for old shirts and
                    sheets to use as bandages, as well as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and dried
                    fruits for food. The editors add that donated goods can be dropped off at the
                    drug store of J. S. Nixon.</summary>
