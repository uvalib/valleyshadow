<b>Speech of Hon. Charles Biddle of Pennsylvania</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A speech given by Representative Charles Biddle in the U.S. House of
                    Representatives, discussing the "negro question," particularly the issue of
                    arming black troops. Biddle vehemently opposes this idea, predicting a slaughter
                    of whites by armed blacks. He also believes that emancipation will unleash a
                    horde of "ungovernable" blacks onto the countryside, and he recommends that
                    Union commanders return contraband slaves to their owners.<br>

<b>Resolutions of Loyalty</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses the resolutions passed by the Philadelphia Conference of the
                    Methodist Episcopal Church. The focus of the resolutions on the Constitution and
                    Union, the editors believe, is an endorsement of essentially Democratic
                    principles, and the lack of mention of abolition is interpreted as a repudiation
                    of that position. The editorial goes on to note that a further resolution
                    proclaiming the willingness of the Methodists to pay the taxes necessary for the
                    war probably does not extend to paying taxes to fund Republican corruption.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Wendell Phillips Mobbed</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial arguing that though the mobbing of Wendell Phillips in Cincinnati
                    should not be praised, rabble rousers such as Phillips should not be allowed to
                    publicly speak.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Late Election</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Celebrates the recent Democratic victories in the spring election in
                    Franklin County and notes similar results in Carlisle, in York County, in
                    Shippensburg, and in Washington County.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>For the Valley Spirit</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This letter writer condemns the Chambersburg Times for fomenting dissension
                    within the Democratic Party and wonders why that editor calls himself a Democrat
                    if he is continually attacking the party. He adds, however, that the Valley
                    Spirit should refrain from engaging in such controversy unless absolutely
                    necessary.<br>
