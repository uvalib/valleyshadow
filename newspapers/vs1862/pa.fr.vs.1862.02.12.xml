                <summary>A letter from one Congressman to another. A.S. Diven, the author of the
                    letter, delineates the differences between them regarding the ultimate aims of
                    the war. The author seeks to restore the Union and to maintain all the rights of
                    the Southern states prior to secession, namely, slavery. He views secession as a
                    plot by a few leaders that misled thousands of Southerners. In the author's eyes
                    his correspondent, an abolitionist, would unjustly deprive the South of its
                    legitimate property and would make the region dependent on the other states.</summary>

                <summary>Notes that President Lincoln has put a Democrat, Edwin Stanton, in the
                    place of a Republican as Secretary of War. With McClellan, a Democrat, at the
                    head of the Army, the article claims that Democrats have been vindicated from
                    the accusation of being traitors. Democrats have in fact proved themselves more
                    loyal to the Union than anti-slavery Republicans.</summary>

                <summary>The White House gave a ball last Thursday, which the Valley Spirit views as
                    the pinnacle of bad taste. Since Lincoln had campaigned against Buchanan on the
                    grounds of waste, corruption, and extravagance, the editors accuse Lincoln of
                    engaging in the same practices he condemned. The Spirit also criticizes the
                    Lincoln administration's handling of the Trent affair and argues that if it had
                    exhibited the same willingness to compromise with the South that it showed with
                    Britain, the war might never have happened.</summary>

                    afflicted as of late--whether his Abolitionism has struck in on him or in his
                    recent attempt to purge himself of the abomination he has induced a state of
                    hypercatharsis we are unable to determine."</excerpt>

                    sectional interests. Now that he is faced with expulsion, however, he realizes
                    he can no longer serve with the likes of Senator Sumner of Massachusetts or
