<b>Senator Cowan's Speech Against Confiscation</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints the speech of Pennsylvania Senator Cowan, which compares the
                    proposed policy of confiscation of Confederate property to a bill of attainder.
                    Cowan claims the policy is unconstitutional and will further serve to alienate
                    potential allies in the South.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Tuesday last the confiscation bill being up for consideration in the U. S.
                        Senate, Mr. Cowan delivered the following able speech in opposition to it.
                        The Senator, it will be seen, like the great statesmen who adorned the
                        Senate a few years since--Webster, Clay, Wright and Benton--takes the
                        Constitution, which he has sworn to support, for his guide, and eloquently
                        pleads for its observance. Our Western Pennsylvania Senator stands like a
                        rock, against whose flinty ribs the waves of fanaticism lash themselves into
                        foam, without moving it from its solid base and centre.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McDougal having concluded his speech, Mr. Cowan said:</p>
                    <p>I agree with the Senator from California in considering this one of the more
                        important bills before Congress, and as upon which the fate of the American
                        Republic may depend. We are now standing squarely face to face with
                        questions which are most pregnant with results for the future. Shall we
                        stand or fall by the Constitution, or leaving it, enter for the future upon
                        the wide field of revolution? Shall we attempt to go back to those doctrines
                        which marked the middle ages, and introduce now into this country feuds like
                        those which intervening centuries have not sufficed to remove? These are the
                        great questions which are in this bill--every one of them. This bill
                        proposes to go forward and strip the whole population of the South of their
                        property and reduce them to poverty--and while yet 400,000 of them have arms
                        in their hands. If there is anything calculated to make that entire people
                        our enemies always, it will be the promulgation of such an act as this. Will
                        they yield to us sooner in view of such a destruction? What would we
                        ourselves do under any such circumstances? I need hardly ask the question of
                        men who have descended from sires who refused to pay a petty tax on tea, and
                        from grandsires who raised a revolution rather than pay twenty shillings
                        ship money--that I think was the amount demanded from Hampden--a revolution
                        which cost King Charles his head. No such sweeping measure as this has ever
                        been enacted. Even in the days of William the Conqueror, the proud Norman
                        and his barons were content with the fiefs and castles of the Saxon leaders.
                        They did not dare to strip the people of their property, nor even much
                        increase their burdens. They knew that, victorious as they were, they would
                        have involved themselves in a far more dangerous struggle, in which every
                        peasant would have been a principal combatant. The English in their contest
                        with, and bills of attainder against, the Irish never attempted to touch the
                        possessions of the common people, but only the property of the nobles. This
                        bill goes further, and attempts to confiscate another species of property,
                        which cannot be put into the coffers of the conqueror. I mean the property
                        in slaves. I don't intend to stop to discuss the question of property of
                        this kind. [illegible line] South seems to agree as to this kind of property
                        with wonderful unanimity, and to resent any interference with it. This bill
                        proposes to liberate 3,000,000 of slaves--truly the most stupendous stroke
                        for universal emancipation ever attempted in the world. Indeed, I think it
                        virtually liberates the whole 4,000,000. What is to be the effect of this
                        upon the war? Shall we be stronger, or shall we find that we have only
                        doubled the number of those in arms against us? They have now no cause for
                        rebellion. Will not this bill furnish them one? Let the loyal men of that
                        section, who know them, answer this question. I will abide their answer. I
                        submit again that no deliberate assembly in the world ever before sat in
                        judgment on so stupendous an issue. Yet, as if to blind us still more, this
                        bill has a proposition of still greater magnitude, and, if possible of still
                        greater difficulty; that is to take these millions and transfer them to some
                        tropical clime, and to protect them there with all the rights and guaranties
                        of freemen. And this is all provided for in a single sentence of nine lines.
                        Truly we must have recently transported ourselves from the practical domain
                        of facts, and set down in the romantic regions of Eastern fiction. Do the
                        advocates of this measure propose to confer upon the President the
                        gold-making touch of Midas? Nothing short of the ring and lamp of Alladin,
                        with their attendant genii, would insure the success of such a scheme,
                        unless it is believed that the Treasury Note possesses the magic power. And
                        even under that supposition, I think that the owners of those Southern
                        climes, and the Transportation Companies, ought to be consulted in regard to
                        the legal tender clause. I presume it is not suppossed [sic] that this
                        modern exodus will be supported on the way by quails and manna; and yet I am
                        free to say that it will require some such miraculous interposition as that
                        which favored the Israelites in their journey out of Egypt. But, sir, is it
                        not strange that this scheme should be so coolly presented for our
                        consideration, and urged to its final consummation with a kind of surprise
                        that any one should oppose it? It is certainly due to ourselves, and due to
                        the country, that we should not make haste to engage in such gigantic
                        schemes. Then, again, there is a further consideration involved in this
                        bill, and one of greater moment, which is that it is in direct conflict with
                        the Constitution of the United States, requiring of us, if we pass it, to
                        set aside and ignore that instrument in its most valuable and fundamental
                        provisions, those which guarantee the life and property of the citizen, and
                        those which define the limits and boundaries of the several Departments of
                        this Government. Pass this bill and all that is left of the Constitution is
                        not worth much, certainly not worth this terrible war which we are now
                        waging for it--for be it remembered that this war is waged solely for the
                        preservation of the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>I am aware that some think that the Constitution is a restraint upon the free
                        action of the nation in conduct of this war, which they suppose could be
                        carried on a great deal better without it. I have no hesitation in saying
                        that no greater mistake has ever been made anywhere than is made by such
                        people. I am afraid it will amount to a confession that they have not
                        carefully examined the full scope of its provisions. The greatest danger is
                        that these propositions, at the first glance, seem possible and even
                        plausible. They are not the rolling breakers which every one may see, but
                        the sunken rocks, which are all the more dangerous because they are hidden;
                        therefore, I am opposed to this bill, and I will give my reason, and show,
                        if I can, why I think that in all its main provisions it is unnecessary,
                        impolitic, inexpedient, unconstitutional, and, I may add, utterly and
                        totally useless; and I think I can show that the Government has all the
                        power under the Constitution which is necessary to put down this rebellion
                        and punish the Rebels, and that there is not in reality any necessity for
                        straining any of its provisions in any way. I shall adress [sic] myself to
                        this first proposition, which is that Congress can forfeit the property of
                        the rebels for a term longer than their lives by any enactment either direct
                        or indirect. All persons now in rebellion, having levied war against the
                        United States are guilty of treason within the exact definition of that
                        crime in the Constitution. But the second section of that same clause
                        provides that no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood,
                        forfeitures, etc., except during the life of the person attained. Therefore,
                        any law made for the guidance of the Courts must conform to this provision,
                        and no greater penalty can be imposed than it will warrant. The power
                        assumed in this bill is also obnoxious to the provisions of the
                        Constitution. If it be assumed that Congress can make any forfeiture of the
                        property of rebels without allowing the means of defense in the Courts,
                        people will do well to remember that our government is not an absolute
                        power. The powers of the Government are limited and defined, and expressly
                        delegated, and Congress has no power to punish any person except for
                        contempt. If we had half a dozen of the most traitorous rebels here to-day,
                        we could not punish them; we could not bid the sergeant at arms take them
                        out and hang them. Nay, more, the President himself and all his army could
                        not lead them away from these halls--for here they would be within the
                        domain of the law, and within its provisions, and the only way would be to
                        deliver them over to the proper judges, and each one might require to have a
                        separate Judge. And I may say further, that it is in this limitation of the
                        powers of the Government, that its great merit consists; on this account we
                        love, cherish, and revere it, and we are now at war to defend and preserve
                        it. Again, the Constitution says "that no bill of attainder--ex post facto--law shall be passed." Bills of
                        attainder were resorted to in England to punish persons who were out of
                        reach of the Courts in many cases, even after they were dead. They condemned
                        the accused to death, if not dead, forfeited the estates and corrupted the
                        blood of the children and heirs. Bills, however, like the one under
                        circumstances which did not inflict capital punishment, were called act of
                        pains and penalties, which, though perhaps they do not come within the
                        express letter of the Constitution, still are contrary to its spirit, as
                        they seek to remove the persons from the power of the courts; and passing a
                        number of bills of pains and penalties you produce the same effect as a bill
                        of attainder. No warrant can be found for any Legislature to undertake to
                        pass any such bills. But I now propose to go further and argue that the
                        exercise of such a power, even if it had been granted, would be both
                        mischievous and impolitic, and our fathers did wisely and well in refusing
                        it. Their great principle was to punish the guilty alone, and not to involve
                        a whole family, because in many cases the family would be innocent. Suppose
                        this measure passes, and these people are to be overthrown. It does seem to
                        me you give them every possible motive for revenge and hate. Their women and
                        children will hate you, and their children's children down to the latest
                        generation will curse you. And if they should rebel again have you not sown
                        the seeds of many rebellions by this one measure? All this might make no
                        difference if these were alien enemies, and were engaged in a war for
                        conquest. But it is not so. We have here in Congress made a solemn
                        declaration that it is not a war of conquest or subjugation, but for the
                        preservation of the Constitution and the Union, and I am for standing by
                        that declaration. We have been told and believe that many of these men now
                        serving in the rebel army are there by force. Are they to be hung on the
                        same scafforld [sic] as the willing traitor? This bill makes no difference.
                        The victim of force in the beginning would end by being the victim of wrong
                        and justice. Again, thousands of these people have been duped into rebellion
                        by being told that we were all Abolitionists. Shall there be no provision
                        for these men who have thus believed this because it was asserted by
                        Southern demagogues, and as they thought proved by Northern knaves? This
                        bill distinguishes not the house of the planter from the negro hovel of the
                        slave, and makes no difference between the broad acres of the one, and the
                        little garden of the other. But even if your bill is carried into operation,
                        who will buy your confiscated estate? What kind of neighborhood will exist
                        between the former owners and your purchasers? The tradition of wrong will
                        sit at the hearthstone of that family for ages, like a hideous specter ever
                        inciting to revenge and rebellion. You might as well try to attract
                        purchasers by promising them a good title to an Irish feud, or a Corsican
                        vendetta. Such titles have never been good. You might as well expect capital
                        to seek the margin of a volcano, where the lava had not ceased to flow. That
                        which is taken by war must be held by war.</p>

<b>Crush Out Abolitionism</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Defends Democrats against an accusation by the Harrisburg Telegraph that
                    all they have been doing is attacking Republicans, not fighting the rebellion.
                    The article points out the number of Democratic generals serving in the army and
                    accuses abolitionists of "ultraism" and of fomenting the war.<br>

<b>'Supporting the Government'</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An editorial which argues that the Lincoln Administration has tried to
                    prevent criticism of a number of disagreeable acts under the guise of
                    "supporting the government." Included in this list are: the conversion of the
                    war into a war for abolition, the appointment of Cameron as envoy to Russia, the
                    retention of Gideon Welles as Secretary of the Navy despite accusations of
                    corruption, the sycophantic reaction to Britain's demands in the Trent affair,
                    the appointment of Jim Lesley and Bill Moran, and finally the reduction of
                    McClellan's command and the reappointment of Fremont to a position of authority.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that Lincoln is gradually showing his true colors and softening

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. EDITOR: To an unpretending observer of passing events there are no bright
                        prospects for the future of our country. Nothing but darkness and doubt are
                        visible to an eye "wide awake" to the continued supreme folly of abolition
                        madness at a time like the present, or to a mind fully alive to its baneful
                        effects upon the cause of the Union on the one hand, and on the other, the
                        great argumentative aid it affords rebel speakers and writers in keeping
                        their people in the dark as to the real intentions of the Government. We
                        will not say here that our own eyes are sometimes obscured as to its "ultimate" intentions. For our only hope, at this
                        time, rests on the ability of Abraham Lincoln to withstand the mad clamours
                        of radical abolitionism, which is, next to secession, more to be abhored
                        than any other curse in the land. But recent events would seem to indicate
                        that the said Abraham is gradually softening towards an idea on whose wings
                        alone he so triumphantly rode into the presidential chair. While the writer
                        of this is quite satisfactorily disappointed with the course of Mr. Lincoln,
                        though it might, to the great benefit of the country, have been much more
                        unequivocal in many respects, and less tardy in developing its real
                        intentions, if indeed they are even now fully developed, it must not be
                        forgotten that the moderate republicans either understood the President to
                        be a conservative man, thereby most wofully [sic] deceiving the radicals, or
                        the President himself has been compelled to yield to sentiments which are
                        and always have been at war with his former oft-expressed opinions. Be this
                        as it may the conduct of the party as a whole just operated sufficiently
                        upon the fears and excitement of the moment to enable Southern traitors to
                        carry their States out of the Union. Now, is it to be expected, so long as
                        the radicals are at perfect liberty to abuse the Border States, and the
                        Union men of the South generally, even more violently than they were in the
                        habit of abusing the South before secession, is it to be expected that there
                        can be that unity of feeling between the States yet in the Union which the
                        uninterrupted success of the war for the Constitution and the Union so
                        absolutely demands? The fearful broils which the unhallowed attacks of
                        abolitionism are now provoking from Border State men in Congress,
                        unmistakably prove the original cause of the present dreadful rebellion. And
                        as the abolitionists succeed in their determination to also to drive [sic]
                        these men out of the Union so will the difficulties to crush the rebellion
                        increase. Yet with all these facts in full view there are new tests of
                        loyalty prescribed. A man must pay his portion of the expenses of the war
                        not only without a grumble but "cheerfully" if he wants to raise his loyalty
                        above suspicion, although it is a well established fact, even according to
                        republican showing, that the incubus of abolitionism, by its roguery and
                        folly, will increase the expenses of the war beyond calculation, compared
                        with what an honest and economical administration of affairs would have made
                        them. The man who expects such humiliation from the people betrays an
                        ignorance of human nature as mean and cowardly as the noisy stay-at-home
                        abolitionists show in their devilish attacks upon those who are imperilling
                        their lives for their country. The man who can take it on himself to dictate
                        such tests of loyalty under such circumstances must either be a knave or a
                        fool, must either have a "finger in the pie" of roguery or else be bordering
                        on a species of mental bereavement.</p>
