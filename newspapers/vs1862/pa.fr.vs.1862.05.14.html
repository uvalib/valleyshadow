<b>Address of Democratic Members of Congress to the Democracy of the U.S.</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A speech reaffirming the platform of the Democratic party and the party's
                    crucial role in the successful prosecution of the war. Democrats have always
                    fought in the interests of the nation as a whole, the authors claim, and the
                    great size and wealth of the country can be mostly attributed to its nurturing
                    under Democratic administrations. The Democratic party stands for restoring the
                    Union and supporting the administration in fighting the war. Democrats oppose
                    purely sectional parties, such as the Republicans who agitate for abolition.
                    Philip Johnson and S. E. Ancono of Pennsylvania are among the Representatives
                    who signed the address.<br>

<b>Republican Evidence</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Address by Mr. Dawes of Massachusetts to the House of Representatives

                    Dawes produced documents that seemed to indicate that Cameron used the
                    procurement of such items as horses as a way to win over political enemies in
                    Pennsylvania.<br>

<b>Let It Be Read</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Directs the reader's attention to the Democratic address on the first page.
                    The editors echo the speech's contention that the Democratic party is the true
                    party of the Union. They go on to accuse the Republicans, including Lincoln, of
                    seeking to destroy the white race in order to elevate the black race. The party
                    of Jefferson, Madison, and Jackson will eliminate sectionalist tendencies of all
                    sorts.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>'Who are in Fault"</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Attacks a claim by the Transcript that the roots of secession could be
                    found in Calhoun's nullification doctrine in 1832. It would be just as easy,
                    claim the editors, to find the roots of secession in the Hartford Convention of
                    1812 or the Whiskey Rebellion in 1795. The Transcript uses faulty logic, they
                    claim, and then the editors proceed to cite Southern Unionists, including Andrew
                    Johnson, Joseph Holt, Parson Brownlow, the Louisville Democrat and the
                    Louisville Journal, as proof of the patriotism and heroism of that cause.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Col. Housum</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notes the return of Lieut. Col. P. B. Housum of Chambersburg, a member of
                    the 77th Regiment of Penn. Volunteers, who returned to his home last Friday. He
                    was in command of the regiment, since his superior Col. Stumbaugh had been
                    promoted to command of the brigade, but "impaired health" required him to take a
                    brief furlough. Housum was one of the first men to raise a company at the
                    outbreak of the war, and after serving in the three months service he
                    volunteered again, received a commission as Lieut. Col. in the 77th, and was
                    ordered to Kentucky. Despite sickness, he kept his place in the regiment during
                    the battle at Pittsburg Landing.<br>(Names in announcement: Lieut. Col. P. B. Housum)</blockquote>
<b>Abolition Logic</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that one can see abolitionists arguing on both sides of the question
                    as to whether or not black labor is superior to white, and what impact abolition
                    will have. If black labor is inferior and slavery is crowding out white labor in
                    the South, then abolition will release a flood of marginal labor into the
                    market. On the other hand, if black labor is superior, it will crowd out white
                    labor, which will be unpopular with the white working class. Either way, say the
                    authors, emancipation will have deleterious consequences.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Louisville Democrat</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The arguments of Abolitionists are the most contradictory it has ever been
                        our duty to read. The first proposition is, that the black labor in the
                        South, protected and fostered by State Institutions, expels the labor of the
                        whites, and thus is a decided injury to the dominant race. Therefore, for
                        the good of the whites, it should be abolished. If this is so, what is to be
                        the result of their vaunted philanthropic measure? The whites will gradually
                        deprive the blacks of all the labor by their superior energy and industry,
                        and these will be thrown upon the community, an idle, thriftless, vagabond
                        race, to be supported by taxation upon white labor in indolence and
                        debauchery. The duty which has compelled the master to support the slave and
                        make him useful, will have passed away, and, instead of the burthen resting
                        where it should, and where it can be made remunerative, it will fall upon
                        all men--the white laborer as well as the wealthy planter--and no return
                        will be made. It is a plain fact that it requires about three hundred
                        million of dollars per annum to support the negroes. This is now done by the
                        master, who gets a profit in return, but when the white labor has eaten it
                        out, the necessary poor house, police regulations, &amp;c., will have
                        increased this sum to five hundred million dollars per annum; a tax, in
                        times of profound peace, equal to what is now paid in the midst of the most
                        gigantic war the civilized and savage world has ever known, exceeding the
                        tremendous efforts of France in the days of the elder Napoleon.</p>
                    <p>This conclusion is indisputable upon the premises of the Abolitionists.
                        Therefore, when any man in the North or South is addressed by such
                        arguments, and trusts in them, he must get his own consent to pay annually a
                        tax of five hundred million of dollars per annum for
                            this one purpose alone; and add to it two or three hundred
                        millions additional, for the usual expenses of the government, we do not
                        think it would be an excess to put down the government expenses, one year
                        after another, including war times as well as peace, under such a scheme, at
                        a thousand million per annum. Then, if we add the favorite colonization
                        scheme, with its enormously additional expenses, we can come within the mark
                        by placing the annual governmental expenses at fifteen hundred millions of
                        dollars per annum. This is not excessive. There is the expense of removing
                        them from all parts of the country, the expense of shipping, the purchase of
                        the territory to which they are exiled, the expense of sustaining them.
                        Suppose that we grant that their labor, released from competition of the
                        whites, was to pay five hundred million above what is necessary to feed and
                        clothe them--even the Abolitionists do not grant this much--which is more
                        than they get in servitude, but put the figures down at a minus; still there
                        is a thousand million. That is, every man, woman and child has to pay each
                        $29 per annum to support the negro, or to every father of a family of five,
                        the sum of $145 per annum. There is no use arguing such a question. No
                        people can pay it. It is an absurdity. It is clear that the substitution of
                        white for slave labor involves the duty of sustaining the negroes, or
                        exterminating them with fire and sword. This is the plain matter of fact
                        philanthropy of Abolitionism and colonization, and includes the sum total of
                        its morality.</p>
                    <p>The very converse of the above proposition is assured by the many
                        Abolitionists--that the negro laborer is superior to the white. That is,
                        that the negro, emancipated from the trammels of slavery, and elevated to
                        the position of the white man, will do better; will be at least equal to
                        him, and in many avocations superior. These men are not struggling, then, to
                        make this a republic of white men, but blacks. The result of their argument
                        is, that blacks being fully equal to the whites, and in some cases superior,
                        will be brought into competition with them. The fact, then, before every
                        white laborer is, that when this scheme succeeds, he may expect a black
                        competing with him in every field of life--on the farm, in the workshop, in
                        the manufactures, and as domestic servants. Everywhere he will find the
                        negro under-working him, and placed upon a precisely equal footing with him.
                        Is there any white laboring man, whose philanthropy extends so far, that,
                        for the purpose of emancipating slaves, he is willing to take the bread from
                        the mouths of his little ones? And yet madness and fanaticism are daily and
                        hourly telling him in the lecture rooms, on the stump and in Congress, that
                        such is to be the result, for the conclusion is inevitable, and hailing the
                        day when it is accomplished as the millennium.</p>
                    <p>If this be true, the white laborer must prepare for the consequences. The
                        negro, no longer confined by the laws to a particular State or section, will
                        seek his market whatever it can be found. If he is equal to the white, he
                        will no more confine himself to one section than the white does. Indiana,
                        Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania, notwithstanding stringent laws, will soon
                        find floods of laborers pouring in upon them. The increase of the blacks
                        cannot be confined to the now slave States. It must, in the nature of
                        things, spread, and it will certainly seek the border free States. If they
                        are profitable, more profitable to employers than white labor, they will, as
                        inevitable, make their way to them as water finds its level.</p>
                    <p>We have thus succinctly placed the two arguments, the only two we have heard
                        that were not all froth, before our readers. It is easy to see that,
                        granting in turn the premises upon which each proceeds, that the
                        emancipation of slavery will be a direct injury to the country. We can state
                        shortly what would be the ultimate result of either. After a heavy expense
                        and turbulence, the States in which there were negroes would be compelled,
                        in self-defense, to resume the old laws, and again reduce the blacks to
                        bondage. Men need not go insane upon it. It is not a question whether
                        slavery is an evil or not, any more than if it is an evil for man to earn
                        his bread by the sweat of his brow. It is a fact and condition that cannot
                        be altered without producing injury to both classes. The negroes are here
                        and must be managed. The wisdom of the past shows that they have been at
                        least as well cared for as the laboring whites, and until we can so improve
                        upon the past as to relieve the destitution and suffering of our own race,
                        we had better refrain from experimental plans to add to the comforts of one
                        already situated as God intended them.--Louisville

<b>The Riots in Schuylkill Co'ty</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>One hundred and sixty members of the Pennsylvania state reserves were
                    dispatched to Minersville, in the West Branch coal region, in response to a
                    miner's strike which began on Monday. The miners stopped working the pumps which
                    kept water out of the mines, and demanded an advance of ten cents per wagon for
                    miners and twenty-five cents per day for laborers. The owners of the mine, the
                    Forest Improvement Company, are furnishing large amounts of coal to the
                    government. The company will attempt to restart the pumps under the protection
                    of the reserves. The miners are supposedly well-armed and refuse to let anybody
                    work.<br>
