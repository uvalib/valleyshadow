<b>Speech of Hon. Horatio Seymour</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints a speech given at the New York State Democratic Convention.
                    Seymour reads from Republican papers that admit mistakes by the administration,
                    and offers these statements as evidence that Republicans should not label all
                    critics as traitors. He goes on to argue that Republicans cannot save the Union,
                    because they are "higher law men" who are willing to violate the written
                    Constitution in fanatical pursuit of abolition. Republicans stand in the way of
                    an "honorable peace" with the South with such proposals as emancipating the
                    slaves, a program which, in Seymour's view, would only be a "cruel wrong" to
                    black people.<br>

<b>The Contest in Maryland</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses the battle at Antietam in detail. The correspondent details the
                    flow of action in broad terms, praising the bravery of the men and the wisdom of

                    advance of his troops on the left side of the battle. The writer blames
                    Burnside's delay for the ferocity of the fighting, as the Confederates were able
                    to shift troops to meet each new wave of the attack.<br>

                    <p>The Tribune has the following despatch, dated:</p>
                    <p>Battle-Field of Sharpsburg, Wednesday evening Sept. 17, 1862--Fierce and
                        desperate battle between 200,000 men has raged since daylight, yet night
                        closes on an uncertain field. It is the greatest fight since Waterloo; all
                        over the field contested with an obstinacy equal even to Waterloo. If not
                        wholly a victory tonight, I believe it is the prelude to a victory
                        to-morrow. But what can be foretold of the future of a fight in which from
                        five in the morning till seven at night the best troops of the continent
                        have fought without decisive result.</p>
                    <p>I have no time for speculation; no time even to gather details of the battle,
                        only time to state its broadest features, then mount and spur for New York.</p>
                    <p>After the brilliant victory near Middletown, General McClellan pushed forward
                        his army rapidly, and reached Keedysville with three corps on Monday night.
                        That march has already been described. On the day following the two armies
                        faced each other idly, until night. Artillery was busy at intervals, once in
                        the morning opening with spirit, and continuing for half an hour with vigor,
                        till the Rebel battery, as usual, was silenced.</p>
                    <p>McClellan was on the hill where Benjamin's battery was stationed, and found
                        himself suddenly under a rather heavy fire. It was still uncertain whether
                        the Rebels were retreating or reinforcing; their batteries would remain in
                        position to either case, and as they had withdrawn nearly all their troops
                        from view there was only the doubtful indication of columns of dust to the
                        rear.</p>
                    <p>On the evening of Tuesday Hooker was ordered to cross the Antietam creek with
                        his corps, and, feeling the left of the enemy, to be ready to attack next
                        morning. During the day of apparent inactivity McClellan had been maturing
                        his plan of battle, of which Hooker's movement was one development.</p>
                    <p>The position on either side was peculiar--When Richardson advanced on Monday
                        he found the enemy deployed and displayed in force on a crescent-shaped
                        ridge, the outline of which followed, more or less exactly, the course of
                        Antietam creek. Their lines were then forming and the revelation of force in
                        front of the ground which they really intended to hold was probably meant to
                        delay our attack until their arrangements to receive it were complete.</p>
                    <p>During the day they kept their troops exposed, and did not move them to avoid
                        the artillery fire, which must have been occasionally annoying. Next morning
                        the lines and columns which had darkened cornfields and hill crests had been
                        withdrawn. Broken and wooded ground behind the sheltering hills concealed
                        the Rebel masses. What from our front looked like only a narrow summit
                        fringed with woods, was a broad table-land of forest and ravine, cover for
                        troops everywhere, nowhere easy access for an enemy. The smoothly sloping
                        surface in front and the sweeping crescents os [sic] slowly mingling lines
                        was all a delusion. It was all a Rebel stronghold beyond.</p>
                    <p>Under the base of the hills runs the deep stream called Antietam Creek,
                        fordable only at distant points. Three bridges cross it--one on the
                        Hagerstown road, one on the Sharpsburg pike; and one to the left, in a deep
                        recess of sleepy falling hills. Hooker passed the first to reach the ford by
                        which he crossed, and it was held by Pleasanton with a reserve of cavalry
                        during the battle. The second was close under the Rebel centre, and no way
                        important to yesterday's fight. At the third, Burnside attacked and finally
                        crossed. Between the first and third lay the battle lines. They stretched
                        four miles from right to left.</p>
                    <p>Unaided attack in front was impossible. McClellan's forces lay behind low,
                        disconnected ridges, in front of the Rebel summits, all or nearly all
                        unwooded. They gave some cover for artillery, and guns were, therefore,
                        massed on the centre. The enemy had the Shepherdstown road and the
                        Hagerstown and Williamsport road both open to him in rear for retreat. Along
                        one or the other, if beaten, he must fly. This, among other reasons,
                        determined, perhaps, the plan of battle which McClellan finally resolved on.</p>
                    <p>The plan was generally as follows: Hooker was to cross on the right,
                        establish himself on the enemy's left if possible, flanking his position,
                        and to open the fight. Sumner, Franklin and Mansfield were to send their
                        forces also to the right, co-operating with and sustaining Hooker's attack,
                        while advancing also nearer the centre. The heavy work in the centre was
                        left mostly to the batteries. Porter massing his infantry support in the
                        hollows. On the left Burnside was to carry the bridge already referred to,
                        advancing then by a road which enters the pike at Sharpsburg, turning at
                        once the Rebel flank and destroying his line of retreat. Porter and Sykes
                        were held in reserve. It is obvious that the complete success of a plan
                        contemplating widely divergent movements of separate corps, must largely
                        depend on accurate timing, that the attack should be simultaneous and not
                        successive.</p>
                    <p>Hooker moved Tuesday afternoon at four crossing the creek at a ford above the
                        creek and well to the right, without opposition. Fronting southwest his line
                        advanced not quite on the Rebel flank, but overlapping and threatening it.
                        Turning of[f] from the road after passing the stream, he sent forth cavalry
                        skirmishers straight into the woods and over the field beyond. Rebel pickets
                        withdrew slowly before them, firing scattering and harmless shots. Turning
                        again to the left, the cavalry went down on the Rebel flank, coming suddenly
                        close to a battery which met them with unexpected grape and canister. It
                        being the motive of cavalry to retire before the batteries, this company
                        loyalty followed the law of its being and came swiftly back without pursuit.</p>
                    <p>Artillery was sent to the front, infantry was rapidly deployed, and
                        skirmishers went out in front and on either flank. The corps moved forward
                        compactly, Hooker, as usual, reconnoitering in person. They came at last to
                        an open grass-sown field included on two sides with woods; protected on the
                        right of the hill, and entered through a corn-field in the rear. Skirmishers
                        entering these woods were immediately met by rebel shots, but held their
                        ground, and as soon, supported, advanced and cleared the timber. Beyond, on
                        the left and in front, volleys of musketry opened heavily, and a battle
                        seemed to have begun a little sooner than it was expected.</p>
                    <p>General Hooker formed his lines with precision and without hesitation.
                        Ricketts' division went into the woods on the left in force. Meade, with the
                        Pennsylvania Reserves, formed in the centre. Doubleday was sent out on the
                        right, planting his batteries on the hill, and opening at once on a rebel
                        battery that began to enfilade the central line. It was already dark, and
                        the rebel position could only be discovered by the flashes of their guns.
                        They pushed forward boldly on the right, after losing ground on the other
                        flank, but made no attempt to regain their hold on the woods. The fight
                        flashed, and glimmered, and faded and finally went out in the dark.</p>
                    <p>Hooker had found out what he wanted to know. When the firing ceased the
                        hostile lines lay close to each other, their pickets so near that six rebels
                        were captured during the night. It was inevitable that the fight should
                        recommence at daylight. Neither side had suffered considerable loss; it was
                        a skirmish, not a battle. "We are through for the night," remarked the
                        General, "but to-morrow we fight the battle that will decide the fate of the
                        republic."</p>
                    <p>Not long after the firing ceased it sprang up again on the left. General
                        Hooker, who had taken up his head-quarters in a barn, which had been nearly
                        the focus of the rebel artillery, was out at once. First came rapid and
                        unusual picket shots, then several heavy volleys. The General listened a
                        moment and smiled grimly.</p>
                    <p>"We have no troops there. The troops are shooting each other. It is Fair Oaks
                        over again." So everybody lay down again, but all the night through there
                        were frequent alarms.</p>
                    <p>McClellan had been informed of the night's work, and of the certainties
                        awaiting the dawn. Sumner was ordered to move his corps at once, and was
                        expected to be on the ground at day-light. From the extent of the rebel
                        lines developed in the evening, it was plain that they had gathered their
                        whole army behind the heights and were waiting for the shock.</p>
                    <p>The battle began with the dawn. Morning found both armies just as they had
                        slept, almost close enough to look into each other's eyes. The left of
                        Meade's Reserves and the right of Rickett's line became engaged at nearly
                        the same moment, one with artillery, the other with infantry. A battery was
                        almost immediately pushed forward beyond the central woods, over a plowed
                        field, near the top of the slope where the cornfield began. On the open
                        field, in the corn beyond and in the woods which stepped forward into the
                        broad fields, like a promontory into the ocean, was the hardest and
                        deadliest struggle of the day.</p>
                    <p>For half an hour after the battle had grown to its full strength, the line of
                        fire swayed neither way. Hooker's men were fully up to their work. They saw
                        their General everywhere in front, never away from the fire, and all the
                        troops believed in their commander, and fought with a will. Two-thirds of
                        them were the same men who, under MacDowell, had broken at Manassas.</p>
                    <p>The half hour passed, the Rebels began to give way a little, only a little,
                        but at the first indication of a receding fire, Forward, was the word, and
                        on went the line with a cheer and a rush. Back across the cornfield, leaving
                        dead and wounded behind them, over the fence, and across the road, and then
                        back again into the dark woods which closed around them, went the retreating
                        Rebels.</p>
                    <p>Meade and his Pennsylvanians followed hard and fast--followed till they came
                        within easy range of the woods, among which they saw their beaten enemy
                        disappearing--followed still, with another cheer, and flung themselves
                        against the cover.</p>
                    <p>But out of those gloomy woods came, suddenly and heavily, terrible
                        volleys--volleys which smote, and bent and broke, in a moment, that eager
                        front, and hurled them swiftly back for half the distance they had won. Not
                        swiftly, nor in panic, any further. Closing up their shattered lines, they
                        came slowly away--a regiment where a brigade had been hardly a brigade where
                        a whole division had been victorious. They had met from the woods the first
                        volleys of musketry from fresh troops--had met them and returned them till
                        their line had yielded and gone down before the weight of fire, and till
                        their ammunition was exhausted.</p>
                    <p>In ten minutes the fortune of the day seemed to have changed--it was the
                        Rebels now who were advancing, pouring out of the woods in endless lines,
                        sweeping through the corn-field from which their comrades just fled. Hooker
                        sent in his nearest brigade to meet them, but it could not do the work. He
                        called for another. There was nothing close enough unless he took it from
                        his right. His right might be in danger if it was weakened, but his centre
                        was already threatened with annihilation. Not hesitating one moment, he sent
                        to Doubleday: "Give me your best brigade instantly."</p>
                    <p>The best brigade came down the hill to the right on the run, went through the
                        timber in front through a storm of shot and bursting shell and crashing
                        limbs, over the open field beyond, and straight into the corn field, passing
                        as they went the fragments of three brigadges [sic], shattered by the Rebel
                        fire, and streaming to the rear. They passed by Hooker, whose eyes lighted
                        as he saw these veteran troops led by a soldier whom he knew he could trust.
                        "I think they will hold it," he said.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Hartsuff took his troops very steadily but now that they were under
                        fire, not hurriedly, up the hill from which the corn field begins to descend
                        and formed them on the crest. Not a man who was not in full view--not one,
                        who bent before the storm. Firing at first in over the corn-field. There was
                        a broad interval between him and the nearest division, and he saw that if
                        the Rebel line were complete his own division was in immediate danger of
                        being flanked. But his orders were to advance, and those are orders which a
                        soldier--and Sedgwick is every inch a soldier--loves best to hear.</p>
                    <p>To extend his own front as far as possible, he ordered the twenty-fourth New
                        York to move by the left flank. The manoeuvre was attempted under a fire of
                        the greatest intensity; and the regiment broke. At the same moment, the
                        enemy perceiving their advantage, came round on the flank. Crawford was
                        obliged to give on the right, and his troops pouring in confusion through
                        the ranks of Sedgwick's advance brigade, threw it into disorder and back on
                        the second and third lines. The enemy advanced, their fire increasing.</p>
                    <p>General Sedgwick was three times wounded, in the shoulder, leg and wrist, but
                        he persisted in remaining on the field so long as there was a chance of
                        saving it. His Adjutant General, Major Sedewick, bravely rallying and trying
                        to reform the troops, was shot through the body, the bullet lodging in the
                        spine, and fell from his horse. Severe as the wound is, it is probably not
                        mortal. Lieutenant Howe, of General Sedgwick's Staff, endeavored vainly to
                        rally the Thirty-fourth New York. They were badly cut up and would not
                        stand. Half their officers were killed or wounded, their colors shot to
                        pieces, the Color Sergeant killed, every one of the color-guard wounded.
                        Only thirty-two were afterwards got together.</p>
                    <p>The Fifteenth Massachusetts went into action with 17 officers and nearly 600
                        men. Nine officers were killed or wounded, and some of the latter are
                        prisoners. Capt. Simons, Capt. Samples, of the Sharp shooters, Lieut. Darley
                        and Lieut. Berry are killed. Capt. Bartlett and Capt. Jocelyn, Lieut. Spurr,
                        Lieut. Gale and Lieut. Bradley are wounded. One hundred and thirty four men
                        were the only remains that could be collected of this splendid regiment.</p>
                    <p>General Dana was wounded, Gen. Howard who took command of the division after
                        Gen. Sedgwick was disabled, exerted himself to restore order, but it could
                        not be done there. Gen. Sumner ordered the line to be reformed under the
                        fire. The test was too severe for volunteer troops under such a fire. Sumner
                        himself attempted to arrest the disorder, but to little purpose.
                        Lieutenant-Colonel Revere and Captain Audenreid, of his staff, were wounded
                        severely, but not dangerously. It was impossible to hold the position.
                        General Sumner withdrew the division to the rear, and once more the
                        cornfield was abandoned to the enemy.</p>
                    <p>French sent word he could hold his ground. Richardson, while gallantly
                        leading a regiment under a heavy fire, was severely wounded in the shoulder.
                        Gen. Meagher was wounded at the head of his brigade. The loss in general
                        officers was becoming frightful.</p>
                    <p>At one o'clock affairs on the right had a gloomy look. Hooker's troops were
                        greatly exhausted, and their General away from the field. Mansfield's were
                        no better. Sumner's command had lost heavily, but two of his divisions were
                        still comparatively fresh. Artillery was yet playing vigorously in front,
                        though the ammunition of many of the batteries was entirely exhausted, and
                        they had been compelled to retire.</p>
                    <p>Doubleday held the right inflexibly. Sumner's headquarters were now in the
                        narrow field where the right before Hooker, had begun the fight. All that
                        had been gained in front had been lost! The enemy's batteries, which, if
                        advanced and served vigorously, might have made sad work with the
                        closely-massed troops, were, fortunately, either partially disabled or short
                        of ammunition. Sumner was confident that he could hold his own; but another
                        advance was out of the question. The enemy, on the other hand, seemed to be
                        too much exhausted to attack.</p>
                    <p>At this crises Franklin came up with fresh troops, and one division of the
                        corps, formed on the left. Slocum was sent forward along the slopes lying
                        under the first ranges of the division of Rebel hills, while Smith was
                        ordered to retake the cornfield and woods which all day had been so hotly
                        contested. It was done in the handsomest style. His Maine and Vermont
                        Regiments and the rest went forward on the run, and, cheering as they went,
                        swept like an avalanche through the cornfields, fell upon the woods, cleared
                        them in ten minutes, and had them. They were not again retaken.</p>
                    <p>The field and its ghastly harvest which the reaper had gathered in those
                        fatal hours remained finally with us. Four times it had been lost and won.
                        The dead are strewn so thickly that as you ride over it you cannot guide
                        your horse's steps too carefully. Pale and bloody faces are everywhere
                        upturned. They are sad and terrible, but there is nothing which makes one's
                        heart beat so quickly as the imploring look of sorely wounded men who beckon
                        wearily for help which you cannot stay to give.</p>
                    <p>General Smith's attack was so sudden that his success was accomplished with
                        no great loss. He had gained a point however, which compelled him to expect
                        every moment an attack, and to hold which, if the enemy again brought up
                        reserves would take his best energies and best troops. But the long strife,
                        the heavy losses, incessant fighting over the same repeatedly lost and won
                        inch by inch, and more than all, perhaps, the fear of Burnside on the left
                        and Porter in front, held the enemy in check. For two or three hours there
                        was a lull even in the cannonade on the right, which hitherto had been
                        incessant. McClellan had been over on the field after Sumner's repulse, but
                        had speedily returned to his head quarters. Sumner again sent word that he
                        was able to hold his position, but could not advance with his own corps.</p>
                    <p>Meantime w[h]ere was Burnside, and what was he doing? On the right w[h]ere I
                        had spent the day until two o'clock, little was known of the general
                        fortunes of the field. We had heard Porter guns in the centre, but nothing
                        from Burnside on the left. The distance was too great to distinguish the
                        sound of his artillery from Porters left. There was no immediate prospect of
                        more fighting on the right, and I left the field, which, all day long, had
                        seen the most obstinate contest of the war, and rode over to McClellan's
                        head-quarters. The different battle-fields were shut out from each other's
                        view, but all partially visible from the central hill which General
                        McClellan had occupied during the day. But I was more than ever impressed,
                        on returning with the completely deceitful appearance of the ground the
                        Rebels had chosen when viewed from the front.</p>
                    <p>Hooker's and Sumner's struggle had been carried on over an uneven and wooded
                        surface, their own line of battle extending in a semi-circle not less than a
                        mile and a half. Perhaps a better notion of their position can be got by
                        considering their right centre and left, as forming three sides of a square.
                        So long therefore as either wing was driven back the centre became exposed
                        to a very dangerous enfilading fire, and the further the centre advanced the
                        worse off it was, unless the lines on its side and rear were firmly held.
                        This formation resulted originally from the efforts of the enemy to turn
                        both flanks. Hooker, at the very onset, threw his column so far into the
                        centre of the Rebel lines that were compelled to threaten him on the flank
                        to secure their own centre.</p>
                    <p>Nothing of all this was perceptible from the hills in front. Some directions
                        of the Rebel lines had been disclosed by the stroke of their guns, but the
                        whole interior formation of the country beyond the hills was completely
                        concealed. When McClellan arranged his order of battle, it must have been
                        upon information, or have been left to his corps and division commanders to
                        discover for themselves.</p>
                    <p>Up to three o'clock Burnside had made little progress. His attack on the
                        bridge had been successful, but the delay had been so great that to the
                        observer it appeared as if McClellan's plans must have been seriously
                        disarranged. It is impossible not to suppose that the attacks on the right
                        and left were meant in a measure to correspond, for otherwise the enemy had
                        only to repel Hooker on the one hand, then transfer his troops and push them
                        against Burnside.</p>
                    <p>Here was the differences between Smith and Burnside. The former did his work
                        at once, and lost all his men at once--that is, all whom he lost at all;
                        Burnside seems to have attacked cautiously, in order to save his men, and
                        sending successively insufficient forces against a position of strength,
                        distributed his loss over a greater period of time, but yet lost none the
                        less in the end.</p>
                    <p>Finally, at 4 o'clock, McClellan sent simultaneously orders to Burnside and
                        Franklin; to the former to advance and carry the batteries in his front at
                        all hazards and any cost; to the latter to carry the woods next in front of
                        him to the left, which the Rebels still held. The order to Franklin,
                        however, was practically countermanded, in consequence of a message from
                        Gen. Sumner that, if Franklin went on and was repulsed, his own corps was
                        not yet sufficiently reorganized to be depended on as a reserve.</p>
                    <p>Franklin, thereupon, was directed to run no risk of losing his present
                        position, and, instead of sending his infantry into the woods, contented
                        himself with advancing his batteries over the breadth of the fields in
                        front, supporting them with heavy columns of infantry, and attacking with
                        energy the Rebel batteries immediately opposed to him. His movement was a
                        success so far as it went, the batteries maintaining their new ground, and
                        sensibly affecting the steadiness of the Rebel fire. That being once
                        accomplished, and all hazard of the right being a forced back having been
                        dispelled, the movement of Burnside became at once the turning point of
                        success, and the fate of the day depended on him.</p>
                    <p>How extraordinary the situation was may be judged from a moment's
                        consideration of the facts. It is understood that from the outset Burnside's
                        attack was expected to be decisive, as it certainly must have been if things
                        went well elsewhere, and if he succeeded in establishing himself on the
                        Sharpsburg road in the Rebel rear.</p>
                    <p>Gens. Hooker, Sumner and Franklin, and Mansfield, were all sent to the right
                        three miles away, while Porter seems to have done double duty with his
                        single corps in front, both supporting the batteries and holding himself in
                        reserve. With all this immense force on the right, but 10,000 men were given
                        to Burnside for the decisive moment of the day.</p>
                    <p>Still more unfortunate in its results was the total failure of these separate
                        attacks on the right and left to sustain, or in any manner to co-operate
                        with each other. Burnside hesitated for hours in front of the bridge which
                        should have been carried at once by a 'coup de main.' Meantime, Hooker had
                        been fighting for four hours with various fortune, but final success. Sumner
                        had come up too late to join in the decisive attack which his earlier
                        arrival would probably have turned into a complete success; and Franklin
                        reached the scence [sic] only when Sumner had been repulsed. Probably before
                        his arrival the Rebels had transferred a considerable number of troops to
                        their right to meet the attack of Burnside, the direction of which was then
                        suspected or developed.</p>
                    <p>Attacking first with one regiment, then with two, and delaying both for
                        artillery, Burnside was not over the bridge before two o'clock--perhaps not
                        till three. He advanced slowly up the slopes in his front, his batteries in
                        rear covering, to some extent, the movements of the infantry. A desperate
                        fight was going on in a deep ravine on his right, the Rebel batteries were
                        in full play, and, apparently, very annoying and destructive, while heavy
                        columns of Rebel troops were plainly visible, advancing, as if careless of
                        concealment, along the road and over the hills in the direction of
                        Burnside's forces. It was at this point of time that McClellan sent him the
                        order above given.</p>
                    <p>Burnside obeyed it most gallantly. Getting his troops well in hand, and
                        sending a portion of artillery to the front, he advanced them with rapidity
                        and the most determined vigor, straight up the hill in front, on top of
                        which the Rebels had maintained their most dangerous battery. The movement
                        was in plain view of McClellan's position, and as Franklin on the other
                        side, sent his batteries into the field about the same time, the battle
                        seemed to open in all directions with greater activity than ever.</p>
                    <p>The fight in the ravine was in full progress, the batteries which Porter
                        supported were firing with new vigor, Franklin was biting away on the right
                        and hill-top ridge and woods along the whole line was crested and veiled
                        with white clouds of smoke. All day had been clear and bright since the
                        early cloudy morning, and now this whole magnificent, unequalled [sic] scene
                        shone with the splendor of an afternoon September sun. Four miles of battle,
                        its glory all visible, its horrors all hidden, the life of the Republic
                        hanging on the hour--could any one be insensible of its grandeur?</p>
                    <p>There are two hills on the left of the road, the farthest and lowest. The
                        Rebels have batteries on both. Burnside is ordered to carry the nearest to
                        him, which is the farthest from the road. His guns opening first from this
                        new position in front, more entirely controlled and silenced the enemy's
                        artillery. The infantry came on at once, moving rapidly and steadily up long
                        dark lanes, and broad, dark recesses, being plainly visible without a glass
                        as they moved over the green hillside.</p>
                    <p>The next moment, the road in which the Rebel battery was planted was canopied
                        with clouds of dust swiftly descending into the valley. Underneath was a
                        tumult of wagons, guns, horses, and men flying at speed down the road. Blue
                        flashes of smoke burst now and then among them, a horse or a man or half
                        dozen went down, and then the whirl wind swept on.</p>
                    <p>The hill was carried, but could it be held? The Rebel columns, before seen
                        moving to the left, increased their pace. The guns, on the hill above, send
                        an angry tempest of shell down among Burnside's guns and men. He had formed
                        his columns apparently in near angles of two fields bordering the road, high
                        ground about them everywhere except in rear.</p>
                    <p>In another moment a Rebel battle-line appears on the brow of the ridge above
                        them moves swiftly down in the most perfect order and though met by
                        incessant discharges of musketry, of which we plainly see the flashes, does
                        not fire a gun. White spaces show w[h]ere men are falling, but they close up
                        instantly, and still the line advances. The brigades of Burnside are in
                        heavy column: they will not give way before a bayonet charge in line. The
                        Rebels think twice before they dash into these hostile masses.</p>
                    <p>There is a halt: the Rebel left gives way and scatters over the field; the
                        rest stand fast and fire. More infantry comes up. Burnside is outnumbered,
                        flanked, compelled to yield the hill he took so bravely. His position is no
                        longer one of attack. He defends himself with unfaltering firmness, but he
                        sends to McClellan for help. McClellan's glass, for the last half hour, has
                        seldom been turned away from the left.</p>
                    <p>He sees clearly enough that Burnside is pressed; needs no messenger to tell
                        him that. His face grows darker with anxious thought. Looking down into the
                        valley where 15,000 troops are lying, he turns a half-questioning look on
                        Fitz John Porter, who stands by his side gravely scanning the field. They
                        are Porters troops below; are fresh and only impatient to share in this
                        fight. But Porter slowly shakes his head, and one may believe that the same
                        thought is passing through the minds of both Generals. "They are the only
                        reserves of the army; they cannot be spared."</p>
                    <p>McClellan remounts his horse, and with Porter and a dozen officers of his
                        staff rides away to the left in Burnside's direction. Sykes meets them on
                        the road; a good soldier, whose opinion is worth taking. The three Generals
                        talk briefly together. It is easy to say that the moment has come when
                        everything may turn on one order given or withheld, when the history of the
                        battle is only to be written in thoughts and purposes and words of the
                        General.</p>
                    <p>Burnside's messenger rode up. His message is, "I want troops and guns. If you
                        do not send them I cannot hold my position for half an hour." McClellan's
                        only answer for the moment is a glance at the western sky. Then he turns and
                        speaks very slowly: "Tell General Burnside that this is the battle of the
                        war. He must hold his ground till dark at any cost. I will send him Millers
                        battery. I can do nothing more. I nave no infantry.</p>
                    <p>Then, as the messenger was riding away, he called him back. "Tell him if he
                            cannot hold his ground, the bridge, to the
                        last! always the bridge! If the bridge is lost, all is lost."</p>
                    <p>The sun is already down; not half an hour of daylight is left. Till
                        Burnside's message came it had seemed plain to every one that the battle
                        could not be finished to-day. None suspected how near was the peril of
                        defeat, of sudden attack on exhausted forces; how vital to the safety of the
                        army and the nation was those fifteen thousand waiting troops of Fitz John
                        Porter's in the hollow. But the Rebels halted instead of pushing on ; their
                        vindictive cannonade died away as the light faded. Before it was quite dark
                        the battle was over. Only a solitary gun of Burnside's thundered against the
                        enemy, and presently this also ceased and the field was still.</p>
                    <p>The peril came very near, but it has passed, and in spite of the peril, at
                        the close the day was partly a success; not a victory, but an advantage had
                        been gained. Hooker, Sumner and Franklin held all the ground they had
                        gained, and Burnside still held the bridge and his position beyond.
                        Everything was favorable for a renewal of the fight in the morning. If the
                        plan of the battle is sound there is every reason why McClellan should win
                        it. He may choose to postpone the battle to await his reinforcements.</p>
                    <p>The Rebels choose to retire while it is possible. Fatigue on both sides might
                        delay the deciding battle, yet if the enemy means to fight at all, he cannot
                        afford to delay. His reinforcements may be coming, but where are his
                        supplies? His losses are enormous. His troops have been massed in woods and
                        hollows, where artillery has had its most terrific effect.</p>
                    <p>Ours have been deployed and scattered. From infantry fire there is less
                        difference.</p>
                    <p>It is hard to estimate losses on a field of such extent, but I think ours
                        cannot be less than six thousand killed and wounded--it may be much greater.
                        Prisoners have been captured from the enemy; I hear of a regiment captured
                        entire, but I doubt it. All the prisoners whom I saw agree in saying that
                        the whole array is there. Hill and Longstreet are either killed or
                        prisoners.</p>

<b>The President's Proclamation</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors express their deep disappointment with Lincoln's Emancipation
                    Proclamation. They had hoped that he would ignore the advice of radicals, and
                    they had praised every evidence of his conservative tendencies. Now, however,
                    the editors see that Lincoln has thrown his lot in with the radicals. The
                    Proclamation will have little practical effect, they note, except to alienate
                    Unionist Southerners as well as slaveholders in the border states.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The great agony of the radicals is over. They clamored for a proclamation
                        until they succeeded. They besieged the President on all sides, and waged an
                        incessant war upon him for months, until at last he succumbed to the
                        "pressure" and issued a proclamation proclaiming unconditional freedom to
                        all the slaves in the seceded States after the first day of January next.
                        Where the President pretends to find his authority for issuing such a
                        proclamation, he does not deign to inform us. This new policy is to be the
                        great panacea for all our ills, and is to kill the rebellion at one blow. We
                        shall soon see the fruits of the policy and know from practical experience,
                        what abolition philosophy is worth. In the meantime we must be permitted to
                        hold the same views we have ever held on this subject, until we are
                        convinced to the contrary by practical results.</p>
                    <p>The conservative men of the country have been greatly disappointed in this
                        action of the President. They had been persuaded that he was a man of honest
                        intentions and desired to do what was best for his country. They hoped, even
                        sometimes against hope, that he would eventually see the true ground of his
                        position, discard the mad counsels and revolutionary teachings of the
                        radical men of his party, plant himself firmly upon the pillars of the
                        Constitution, and make an earnest effort to save the country. They caught at
                        every exhibition of conservatism in the President to strengthen this
                        opinion, and were prompt in commending and endorsing every act of his
                        tending to strengthen and promote the great cause in which the country is
                        engaged, where the abolitionists who are now in ecstacies [sic] over his
                        recent proclamation, either treated him with silent contempt or broke out in
                        open murmurs of discontent and opposition. Yet in the face of these facts
                        the President has given way to their clamor, and thrown himself, body and
                        soul, into the hands of the radical abolition faction, who have been seeking
                        the ruin of the country for many years, and who have pronounced the
                        Constitution a "league with death and a covenant with hell," and the honest
                        and conservative masses of the free States and the loyal Union men of the
                        Slave States, have been shamefully deceived, and the nation been made to
                        bleed afresh at every pore through the weakness and imbecility of its chief
                        executive officer.</p>
                    <p>A word as to the effect of this Proclamation. Practically it is not worth the
                        paper it is written on. If the administration is unable to enforce the
                        legitimate and Constitutional laws of the country, in the seceded States,
                        how is this unconstitutional and foolish paper proclamation to be enforced?
                        The President himself told the Chicago Delegation that it would be
                        inoperative, and could not free a single slave. The proposition is too
                        absurd for a moment's serious consideration.</p>
                    <p>But there is another aspect in which this subject is all important, that of
                        its bearing upon the loyal Union men of the slave States. They have suffered
                        long and much for the sacred cause of the Union in their respective States.
                        They persistently denied the allegations of the Secessionists that this was
                        war on the part of the Government for the abolition of Slavery. This was the
                        great argument of the Secessionists by which they were enabled to carry the
                        people with them. The Union men planted themselves upon the broad principles
                        of the Constitution, and bravely contended for the old Union and the old
                        flag, with danger and death oftentimes staring them in the face, trusting in
                        the good faith of the administration to sustain them. How have they been
                        sustained. Alas! how! President Lincoln, with one stroke of the pen,
                        violates the plighted faith of the Government, and says to the whole
                        southern people, that the Union men were wrong and the Secessionists were
                        right. In no other way could Abraham Lincoln have done so much to strengthen
                        and consolidate the rebellion. We have no doubt that Jefferson Davis would
                        have given the last dollar in the Confederate Treasury to have just such a
                        proclamation emanate from the President of the United States.</p>

                    the editors conclude, the right to vote does not seem threatened and it should

                        Correspondence of the Valley Spirit.
                    </p>
                    <p>Camp Near Sharpsburg, MD. <br>September 27th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors: For some inexplicable reason,
                        masterly inactivity again seems to rule the hour. Our vast army is still
                        lying on this side of the Potomac, seemingly resting on the laurels so nobly
                        won last week. The right wing now rests at Williamsport, while the left runs
                        as far up as Harper's Ferry. General Fitz John Porter's corps of which we
                        form a part now holds the centre. Of course we have no more idea of the
                        cause of the delay than you have, though speculations and rumors are rife. A
                        recent reconnoisance [sic] across the river developed the fact that there is
                        no considerable force of the enemy for several miles into the interior;
                        though it is now ascertained that a large body did advance towards the
                        river, about the middle of the week; where they have gone, no one seems to
                        know.</p>
                    <p>Opposite Williamsport, it is said, the enemy are in force. Their pickets are
                        plainly seen from the Maryland shore. What the near future will develope
                        [sic] it is impossible even to conjecture. It is intimated, occassionally
                        [sic], by the "higher powers," that another invasion of Maryland is even
                        expected, which is to prove far more formidable than the first; but this may
                        be merely to stimulate the men to more vigilance on their picket posts or
                        more promptness in the discharge of their duties. Of one fact there can be
                        but little doubt, that whoever will take the aggressive, another desperate
                        battle must be fought, in this vicinity before winter sets in; and on the
                        issue of this battle the speedy termination or prolongation of the war most
                        undoubtedly depends.</p>
                    <p>I regret to announce that the effort to secure the reinstatement of Major
                        Austin has failed; and justice compels me to say that this is a particularly
                        hard case, as will be seen by the ensuing statement, voluntarily submitted
                        to the War Department, by Brig. Gen'l Tyler and the field and line officers
                        of the regiment.</p>
                    <p>The following is submitted as an impartial statement of the facts in regard
                        to so much of General Order, No. 125, as relates to the dismissal of Major
                        James C. Austin, of the 126th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, from the
                        service of the United States.</p>
                    <p>On the 28th day of August last, Major Austin received a certificate from the
                        Surgeon of the Regiment, setting forth that owing to serious illness he was
                        rendered temporarily unfit for duty, and that his condition demanded a
                        removal from camp. This certificate was based upon an application for leave
                        of absence, which was approved by both Col Elder commanding the Regiment and
                        Brigadier General Tyler commanding the Brigade.</p>
                    <p>On the day following, he proceeded to Washington, D.C., to obtain the further
                        approval of the War Department. On account of some informality in the
                        application, this was withheld, but no such decision was made known to Major
                        Austin until his disease had assumed such increased violence as to make his
                        immediate return to his post a physical impossibility. This fact he
                        immediately communicated to Elder and Gen. Tyler, and remained in Washington
                        under medical treatment until the 3d of September, following, when he
                        promptly returned to duty.</p>
                    <p>His extreme illness not only justified him in this, but the fact that the
                        General Order, No.--"prohibiting officers from visiting Washington," had not
                        been published in his Regiment, completely vindicates him from the charge of
                        absence without leave, knowingly and intentionally, implied in the order
                        publishing his dismissal.</p>
                    <p>Such are the facts of this case as they have come to the knowledge of the
                        undersigned, who will cheerfully bare testimony to the strict attention Maj.
                        Austin has given to his duties, since his entrance into the service, and who
                        honestly believe that to enforce the order of his dismissal will work great
                        injustice to a good soldier and loyal man.</p>

                        Company K. have been detailed to the Provost Guard at General Porter's Head
                        Quarters. They are now located about half a mile from us. Their address for
                        the present is: "Care provost Marshal, Gen'l F. J. Porter's HeadQuarters,
                        Fifth Army Corps, Army of Potomac, Washington, D.C."</p>
                    <p>The only excitement we have now, to break the monotony of camp life, is
                        picket duty, and occasionally it is exciting enough for all practical
                        purposes. The other night when company A was out, when all was as still as
                        death, a bomb exploded in our immediate vicinity, or a round shot was fired
                        over our heads. We were upon the river bank, and you may well imagine it
                        occasioned no little excitement. Every one remained very quietly at his
                        post, not knowing what moment the next shot would be fired, or where it
                        might choose to strike. As we saw no flash, however, or heard no report from
                        the opposite shore, we concluded the report must have been occasioned by the
                        accidental explosion of an old shell in the woods to our rear, as also the
                        scarred trees in the vicinity would seem to indicate. Perhaps some of our
                        Franklin County friends have had a little experience in "picketing" at home.
                        But there is a vast difference between the performance of that duty at
                        Marion or New Franklin, and its faithful discharge along the borders of the
                        enemy's country. For several days there was considerable firing between the
                        pickets of the hostile armies, but it has now been stopped by mutual
                        consent. Yet there is no telling what wiles the foe will resort to.
                        Consequently every one watches, with the most intense anxiety, every
                        movement of a bush or bramble; the slightest unusual sound falls upon his
                        ear like some alarm bell. "Do you hear that noise?" "Listen, it comes
                        nearer." Yes, the rustling of the bushes comes nearer and nearer. "Halt! who
                        comes there!" All is silent! Then again comes still nearer the rustling of
                        the bushes on the river bank. Again, "Halt," and this time "click" goes the
                        musket locks, when peering into the underbrush, a pair of horns and a cow's
                        head is distinctly visible. "That came pretty nearly being a dead cow;"
                        "Well it did;" and then all is quiet for the next hour. Then comes the tread
                        of footsteps, heard distinctly, and more distinctly every moment. You hear
                        the "halt" of your next neighbor, and a few words in an undertone, and on
                        comes the footsteps; soon the bushes, a few paces distant, open and a file
                        of armed men appear. "Halt! who comes there?" Then comes the welcome word
                        "Relief." "Advance, Sergeant of the relief, with the counter sign." The
                        sergeant approaches, gives the countersign, in a low tone, over the point of
                        the guard's bayonet, and then the relief takes your place and you fall into
                        the rear and return to your bivouac for four hours sleep, when your turns
                        comes round again for another tiresome and exciting two hours watch. Such
                        are a few of the incidents attending the most unpleasant and dangerous duty
                        the soldier has to perform.</p>
                    <p>It becomes the sad duty of your correspondent to record the first death which
                        has yet occurred in our regiment--that of Sergt. David E. Carson, of
                        Mercersburg, who died, of Typhoid fever, after a brief illness, at the
                        residence of his brother, W.K. Carson, in Baltimore city, on the 13th inst.
                        He was a member of company C, (Capt. Brownson's) and, being very unwell, was
                        left in Baltimore, when we passed through. His disease soon assumed a
                        violent type, and he never left his bed after his arrival in Baltimore. He
                        leaves a widow and three small children, and a large circle of relatives and
                        friends to mourn his loss. The following just and sincere tribute of respect
                        has been paid him by his immediate companions in arms:</p>
                    <p>Camp Antietam, Near Sharpsburg, MD., <br>September 27th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>At an adjourned meeting of the Mercersburg Guards, Co. C, 126th Regiment,
                        Penna. Vols., held at the above time and place. In relation to the death of
                        our fellow member, Sergeant David E. Carson, the following preamble and
                        resolutions were adopted:</p>
                    <p>WHEREAS, It has pleased an allwise Providence to remove from our midst our
                        esteemed fellow-member, Sergt. David E. Carson, whose association, during
                        the short time he was with us, was that of unity and pleasure, therefore.</p>
                    <p>Resolved.That in the decease of Sergt. David E.
                        Caison, we have lost a true friend to the cause in which we are engaged; the
                        country has been deprived of the services of a true and faithful soldier,
                        and his family and friends, a loving husband, an indulgent father, a dutiful
                        son, a kind brother and a true friend.</p>
                    <p>Resolved. That we deeply sympathize and condole
                        the family and friends of the deceased in their bereavement; and that a copy
                        of these resolutions be sent to the family; and that they be published in
                        the Good Intent, Valley
                            Spirit, and Repository and Transcript.</p>

                    <p>Crowds of Franklin County friends still continue to visit us daily, as a
                        general thing bringing loads of provisions with them, which have not
                        contributed very much to the health of the regiment. We have not been
                        accustomed to good living lately, and, with such an abundance of the good
                        things of this life, together with our damp and cold nights and foggy
                        mornings, our hospital is full to overflowing. We have now but eight hundred
                        and fifty men fit for duty, in the regiment. Those who send provisions to
                        the army should confine their hospitality to bread, butter, ham and the
                        substantials--vegetables too are in great demand, but keep your sweetmeats
                        at home--they do much more harm than good.</p>

                        about four hundred patients in the three hospitals. We can say, from
                        personal observation, that they are well attended by the Surgeons in charge,
                        and everything that the kindness of our citizens can suggest, is cheerfully
