<b>Speech of Hon. Hiester Clymer</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints a speech given by Hon. Hiester Clymer in the Pennsylvania Senate
                    during the debate on a resolution to instruct Pennsylvania's congressional
                    delegates to vote in favor of abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia.
                    Clymer opposes the measure without the consent of Maryland, which ceded the land
                    to Congress. Doing so without Maryland's permission would violate the spirit in
                    which the state donated the land, and abolition in that area would create a
                    "powder keg" if the states around it did not free their slaves also.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notes the vote along party lines in Congress in favor of the abolition of
                    slavery in the District of Columbia. The Republicans have betrayed their promise

<b>Report of the Tonnage Tax Committee</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The legislative committee investigating corruption in the passage of the
                    bill relieving the Pennsylvania Railroad of the tonnage tax released its
                    findings. The editorial argues that the committee bungled the investigation and
                    did not discover any new facts. It notes that only a handful of legislators and
                    two newspapers were accused in testimony of having been paid off to lobby for
                    the bill. However, the editors end up concluding that the corruption that was
                    previously exposed should be denounced.<br>

<b>'A Specimen Brick'</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial attacks the Repository and Transcript for its comment that
                    former President Buchanan had transferred arms to the South and personally
                    profited from the transaction. The editors admit that former Secretary of War
                    Floyd had done so, but they protest against painting Buchanan with the same

                    thanks at the end of the session. This was because, in the editor's estimation,
                    Rowe had represented himself as all things to all people but then turned out to
                    be a Republican, thus alienating Democratic members.<br>

                    <p>Rev. J. M. Thomas, Chaplain of the 77th regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers,
                        made a visit to this place on Wednesday last. He left the regiment a short
                        time ago at Nashville and the object of his visit here was to impart
                        information, to those having friends in that portion of the army, concerning
                        their condition, and to take on his return any message they might have to
                        send. During his short stay here he visited most of the families of those of
                        the 77th regiment who reside in the place. The Rev. gentleman gives a
                        glowing account of the Franklin county soldiers. He says their regiment is
                        held in high esteem by the whole Brigade, and that in character and
                        discipline it ranks among the best in the service. He speaks in high terms
                        of praise by the whole Brigade, and that in character and discipline it
                        ranks among the best in the service. He speaks in terms of praise of the
                        moral and physical condition of the men, few are ever observed intoxicated
                        or heard using profane language. Many hold regular prayer meetings, and
                        other religious exercises, in their tents. The general health, and physical
                        condition of the regiment in every respect, the Chaplain pronounces
                        excellent. The best feeling exists among the officers of the regiment. No
                        bickerings, so common among military men, have taken place in the 77th. The
                        officers, one and all, are beloved by the privates and every attention that
                        can in any way contribute to the comfort or happiness of the men is
                        assiduously bestowed by their commanders. We are much gratified to hear such
                        a favorable account of our men through as reliable a source as the Chaplain
                        of the regiment.</p>

                    <p>PITTSBURG LANDING, via Fort Henry, April 9, 3:20 A. M.--One of the greatest
                        and bloodiest battles of modern days has just been closed, resulting in the
                        complete rout of the enemy, who attacked us at daybreak on Sunday morning.
                        The battle lasted, without intermission, during the entire day, and was
                        renewed on Monday morning, and continued undecided until four o'clock in the
                        afternoon, when the enemy commenced to retreat, and are still flying towards
                        Corinth, pursued by a large force of our cavalry.</p>
                    <p>The slaughter on both sides has been immense.</p>
                    <p>The fight was brought on by three hundred of the Twenty-fifth Missouri
                        Regiment of Gen. Prentiss [sic] Division attacking the advance guard of the
                        Rebels, which they supposed to be the pickets of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>The Rebels immediately advanced on Gen. Prentiss' Division, on the left wing
                        pouring in volley after volley of musketry, and riddling our camp with
                        grape, canister and shell.</p>
                    <p>Our forces soon formed into line and returned the fire vigorously, and, by
                        the time we were prepared to receive them, had turned their heaviest fire in
                        the left centre, Gen. Sherman's division, and drove our men back from their
                        camps, and bringing up a fresh force opened fire on our left wing, Gen
                        McClernand's. This fire was returned with terrible effect and determined
                        spirit by both the infantry and artillery along the whole line, a distance
                        of over four miles.</p>
                    <p>General Hurlburt's Division was thrown forward to support the centre, when a
                        desperate struggle ensued. The Rebels were driven back with terrible
                        slaughter, but soon rallied and drove back our men in turn.</p>
                    <p>From about 9 o'clock until night closed there was no determination of the
                        result of the struggle.</p>
                    <p>The Rebels exhibited remarkable good generalship. At times engaging the left
                        with apparently their whole strength they would suddenly open a terrible and
                        destructive fire on the right or centre. Even our heaviest and most
                        destructive fire upon the enemy did not appear to discourage their solid
                        columns. The fire of Major Taylor's Chicago Artillery raked them down in
                        scores, but the smoke no sooner dispersed than the breach was again filled.</p>
                    <p>The most desperate fighting took place late in the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Buel's [sic] forces had by this time arrived on the opposite side of the
                        river, and another portion was coming up the river from Savannah.</p>
                    <p>At five o'clock the Rebels had forced our left wing back so as to occupy
                        fully two thirds of our camp and were fighting hard in their efforts to
                        drive us into the river, and at the same time heavily engaged our right.</p>
                    <p>Up to this time we had received no reinforcements, Gen. Lew Wallace failing
                        to come to our support till the day was over, having taken the wrong road
                        from Crump's Landing, and being without other transports than those used for
                        the Quartermaster's and Commissary stores which were too heavily laden to
                        ferry any considerable number of Gen. Buell's forces across the river, the
                        boats that were here having been sent to bring up the troops from Savannah.</p>
                    <p>We were therefore, contending against fearful odds, our forces not exceeding
                        88,000 while that of the enemy was upwards of 60,000. Our condition at this
                        moment was exceedingly critical. Large numbers of our men were panic-struck,
                        and others worn out by hard fighting. The average per centage of skulkers
                        had straggled towards the river, and could not be rallied.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Grant and staff, who had been fearlessly riding along the lines the
                        entire day, amid an unceasing storm of bullets, grape, and shell, now rode
                        from the right to the left inciting our men to stand firm until the
                        reinforcements could come across the river.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Webster the chief of the staff, immediately got into position the
                        heaviest pieces of artillery, pouring on the enemy's right; while a large
                        number of batteries were planted along the entire line from the river bank
                        north-east of our extreme right, some two and a half miles.</p>
                    <p>About an hour before dusk, a general cannonading was opened upon the enemy
                        from along our whole line, with a perpetual crack of musketry. For a short
                        time, the Rebels replied with vigor and effect, but their return shots grew
                        less frequent and destructive, while ours grew more rapid and terrible.</p>
                    <p>The gun-boats Lexington and Tyler, which lay a short distance off, kept raining shell on the
                        Rebel force. This last effort was too much for the enemy, and ere dusk the
                        firing had nearly ceased, when night coming on, the combatants rested.</p>
                    <p>Our men rested on their arms in the position they held at the close of the
                        night, until the forces under Brigadier-General Wallace arrived and took
                        position on the right, and General Buell's from the opposite side and
                        Savannah were being conveyed to the battle-ground.</p>
                    <p>General Nelson's division was ordered to form on the right, and the forces
                        under General Crittenden were ordered to his support. Early in the morning,
                        General Buell having arrived, the ball was opened at daylight by Gen.
                        Wilson's division on the left, and Major-General Wallace's division on the
                        right.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Nelson's force opened a most galling fire on the Rebels, and advanced
                        rapidly so they fell back. The fire soon became general along the whole line
                        and began to tell with terrible effect on the Rebels.</p>
                    <p>Gen. McClerand, Sherman and Hurlburt's men, though chiefly jaded from the
                        previous day's fighting, still maintained their honors won at Donelson, but
                        the resistance of the Rebels was terrible and worthy of a better cause.
                        Their resistance, however, was not enough for our undaunted bravery and the
                        dreadful desolation produced by our artillery, which was sweeping them away
                        like chaff; and knowing that defeat here would be the death blow to their
                        hopes, their Generals still urged them on in the face of destruction, hoping
                        by flanking us to turn the tide of battle.</p>
                    <p>Their success was for a time cheering as they began to gain ground on us,
                        appearing to have been reinforced; but our left, under Gen. Nelson, was
                        driving them back with wonderful rapidity, and at 11 o'clock General Buell's
                        forces had succeeded in flanking them and capturing their batteries of
                        artillery.</p>
                    <p>They, however, again rallied on the left, and re-crossed, and the right
                        forced themselves forward in another desperate effort; but reinforcements
                        from General Wool and General Thomas came in, regiment after regiment, which
                        were sent to General Buell, who had again commenced to drive the Rebels.</p>
                    <p>About 3 o'clock, P. M. Gen. Grant rode to the left where the fresh regiments
                        had been ordered, and finding the Rebels to be wavering he sent a portion of
                        his body-guard to the head of each of the five regiments, and then ordered a
                        charge across the field, himself leading.</p>
                    <p>The cannon balls were falling like hail around them. The men followed with a
                        shout that sounded above the roar and din of the artillery and the Rebels
                        fled in dismay and never made another stand.</p>
                    <p>General Buell followed the retreating Rebels driving them in splendid style,
                        and at half-past 5. P. M., the whole Rebel army was in full retreat to
                        Corinth with our cavalry in hot pursuit.</p>
                    <p>We have taken a large amount of artillery and also a number of prisoners.</p>
                    <p>We lost a number of prisoners yesterday; among them is Gen. Prentiss. The
                        number has not been determined yet, but is reported at several hundred. Gen.
                        Prentiss is reported wounded.</p>
                    <p>Among the killed on the Rebel side is the General-in-Chief, General Albert
                        Sidney Johnston, by a cannon ball, on the afternoon of Sunday. Of this there
                        is no doubt, as it is corroborated by several Rebel officers taken to-day.</p>
                    <p>It is further reported that Beauregard had his arm shot off. This afternoon
                        Generals Bragg, Breckinridge and Jackson were commanding the Rebel forces.</p>
                    <p>There never has been a parallel to the gallantry and bearing of our officers,
                        from the commanding General to the lowest officer.</p>
                    <p>General Grant and his staff were on the field and riding along the lines in
                        the thickest of the enemy's fire during the entire two days, and all slept
                        on the ground on Sunday night, during a heavy rain. On several occasions,
                        General Grant got within range of the enemy's guns and was discovered and
                        fired upon.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant-Colonel McPherson had his horse shot from under him when alongside
                        of General Grant. Captain Carson was between Gen. Grant and your
                        correspondent, when a cannon ball took off his head, and killed and wounded
                        several officers.</p>
                    <p>General Sherman had two horses killed under him. General McClernand shared
                        like dangers and also General Hurlburt, each receiving bullet holes through
                        their clothes.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Buell remained with his troops during the entire day, and, with Gen.
                        Crittenden and General Nelson, rode continually along the line encouraging
                        their men.</p>
