<b>Charge to the Grand Jury by Hon. James H. Graham</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Address of Hon. James H. Graham to a grand jury in Cumberland County. His
                    remarks reflect on the war, and focus, by the end, on the folly of the policy of
                    Northern abolitionists to make emancipation a central war aim. He implies that
                    abolition sentiment may even slip toward treason, as abolitionists agitate
                    against the protections for slavery in the Constitution.<br>(Names in announcement:  James GrahamH.)</blockquote>

<b>Indefinitely Postponed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that the State Committee of the "People's Party," a Republican
                    effort to attract Democratic voters to its ticket, met and decided not to call a
                    State Convention at the present time. Dissension between those who wished to
                    maintain a pure Republican party and those who wished to attract Democrats
                    caused party leaders to postpone the convention until unity could be assured.<br>

<b>Legislative Corruption</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial addresses the appointment of a legislative investigating
                    committee to examine the passage of an act commuting the tonnage tax in the
                    previous session. While suspicious generally of the legislature's ability to
                    investigate itself, the editors hope that the "ventilating" of the issue will
                    answer some questions.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Libel on Pennsylvania Soldiers</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A Cincinnati Gazette article claimed that, in an engagement in Kentucky on
                    January 19, Pennsylvania soldiers in the 77th and 79th Regiments panicked and
                    fled the field without even sighting the enemy. The editors of the Valley Spirit
                    condemn this accusation as "calumny" and cite a Louisville Journal article
                    refuting the charges.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The present Congress, in the view of this editorial, has become sidetracked
                    by debates over the future of African-Americans when more important matters,
                    such as how to keep the nation financially solvent, are in need of attention.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Congress</blockquote>
<b>Letter from the Army</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Letter from H.R. Treher, son of John Treher of Loudon, stationed at
                    Patterson's Creek, near Cumberland, Maryland. The letter does not specify the
                    regiment, although it mentions that the commander is General Lander. The bulk of
                    the letter focuses on marching and camping in the rains and the mud.<br>(Names in announcement:  H.R. Treher,  John. Treher)</blockquote>
<b>Letter from Camp Pierpont</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Letter from Joseph Miller, a solider formerly stationed at Camp Slifer, now
                    at Camp Pierpont in Virginia with the "11th Reg't P.R.C." He writes to thank the
                    ladies of Chambersburg who set a "box of fine edibles" to the camp. He also
                    recalls the hospitality of Chambersburg during the time he was stationed there.<br>(Names in announcement:  Joe. P. Miller)</blockquote>
<b>A Good Move</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Several collection boxes for relief of sick and wounded soldiers have been
                    placed at the Post Office and the railroad ticket office, and the Valley Spirit
                    urges all to contribute.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Turn Them Out</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the discrepancies between the state auditor's and the state
                    register's reports and calls for the removal of the state auditor.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Superintendent's Salary</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Valley Spirit omitted the salary of the superintendent of common
                    schools in last week's listing of moneys received from the state. His salary of
                    $600, the editors feel, could be justly doubled, due to the excellent job he
                    does.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Shocking Accident</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Henry Kupfender of Chambersburg was killed on Friday in a train collision
                    while tending several railroad freight cars belonging to Messrs. Wunderlich and
                    Nead on the North Central Railroad near Baltimore. His body was severed in two,
                    and it was returned to the city where his funeral was held on Sunday. He left a
                    wife and several small children.<br>(Names in announcement:  Henry Kupfender,   Wunderlich,   Nead)</blockquote>
<b>The 'Poor House'</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors visited the Poor House last week, dined with Directors Latshaw,
                    Harris, and Spencer, and met Steward James Chariton, Esq. They reported that
                    conditions there were excellent.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr.  Spencer, Mr.  Latshaw, Mr.  Harris,  James CharitonEsq.)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Monday last, we paid a flying visit to the Alms House. We arrived there
                        just in time to partake of the many good things prepared for the occasion,
                        and served up in the shape of a magnificent
                        dinner. After dinner we were ushered into the business room of the
                        establishment, where we found the Directors--Messrs. Spencer, Latshaw and
                        Harris--in session, than whom, three more gentlemanly and courteous men, we
                        venture to assert, are not to be found anywhere. Afterwards, with the
                        Directors, we passed through the various rooms and cells of the poor unfortunates, and found everything in apple-pie order, under the judicious management of
                        the present obliging and efficient Steward--James Chariton, Esq. Everything
                        about the establishment presented an air of neatness, cleanliness and order,
                        which speaks well for the present management of the institution, and must
                        conduce much to the health and comfort of the inmates.</p>

<b>Recruiting Station</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Lieutenant William Burgess, of Captain Dixon's company of the 6th Regiment
                    of Pennsylvania Reserves, has set up a recruiting station at the Franklin Hotel.
                    Volunteers may choose the regiment they will serve in and will be furnished with
                    transportation and sent off immediately.<br>(Names in announcement: Lieut. William Burgess)</blockquote>
<b>Chambersburg Boys in Trouble</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Four or five members of Capt. Brand's company have been accused of robbery
                    in Harrisburg. The Spirit protests their innocence and notes that they are from
                    respectable families in town.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some four or five of the members of Capt. Brand's company have been arrested
                        in Harrisburg for robbery, and sent to prison to answer for the offence in
                        default of $500 bail. A man by the name of Charles Gray alleges that he was
                        robbed by the party, of some thirty dollars, while crossing the Harrisburg
                        bridge after night. We do not believe the young men arrested would be guilty
                        of committing such an act. They have always borne good characters while
                        among us, and some of them have respectable connections in this place.</p>
