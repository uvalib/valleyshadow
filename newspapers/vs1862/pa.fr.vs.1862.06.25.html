<b>Mobocracy</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Alludes to threats made against prominent merchants in Franklin County due
                    to their political beliefs. The Spirit goes on to defend Democrats against
                    accusations of disloyalty but maintains their right to disagree with the

                    intends to conduct the upcoming election.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There seems to be a spirit of mob violence manifesting itself at the present
                        time in different sections of the country. From our exchanges we learn that
                        it exists in almost all parts of the noble old State of Pennsylvania, and
                        even in our own county we have heard intimations of the same. but a few days
                        since we were told of threats that were made against several of our most
                        highly respectable merchants in certain portions of the county. This spirit
                        of lawlessness, we are fain to believe, only exists in the minds of the most
                        degraded class of the community, for certainly no respectable and
                        law-abiding citizen would countenance anything of the kind. We have a few
                        words to say upon this subject in behalf of the Democratic party of Franklin
                        County. Democrats to a man are law-abiding and peaceable citizens and
                        opposed to every species of violence. They love the Constitution and Union
                        with a patriotic devotion that knows no abating. We know the sentiments of the Democracy of this county, and as we know
                        them we here give them under the solemn obligations we owe to our country
                        and our God. We do not believe there is a single disloyal Democrat in the
                        county, or one who does not with his whole heart desire to see the
                        government vindicated and maintained against the assaults of treason, and
                        the nation emerge from its present calamities to all its former greatness
                        and glory. But whilst they are giving a loyal and patriotic support to every
                            necessary measure to suppress this unholy
                        rebellion, they will not tamely submit to indignities and outrages, for no
                        other offence than the expression of their honest sentiments in opposition
                        to the radical and dangerous measures now being agitated by political
                        demagogues, in and out of Congress. They will not be coerced into an
                        endorsement of all the partisan legislation of the miserable partisan
                        majority in the present congress. Conscious of their own loyalty against
                        which they challenge the investigation of the world, they will never relinquish their right as American freemen to
                        freely discuss the measures and policy of their political opponents,
                        approving such as they deem just and proper and condemning those that they
                        deem wrong, and calculated to hinder the accomplishment of the great end
                        which we all profess to have in view. This right they will never relinquish.
                            Never! Never!!</p>
                    <p>We call upon the leaders of the Republican party to say how they intend to
                        conduct the approaching political campaign. We desire to know whether, as in
                        former times, we are to have a friendly discussion of the political issues
                        of the day, or whether we are to have scenes of violence and terror tending
                        to anarchy, and ending it may be in all the horrors of the French
                        Revolution. The spirit of mob violence is a two-edged sword and usually cuts
                        more ways than one. We respectfully suggest to the Repository and Transcript to put itself upon the record in
                        condemnation of this fell destroyer of the peace and good order of society,
                        and prove itself still to be what it has been in the past--the respectable
                        organ of a respectable party.</p>

                    hope that "the individual don't mistake whiskey for patriotism," and criticize

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have not learned that any arrangements have been made for a general
                        patriotic celebration of the coming Fourth of July, in this place. We
                        presume it is intended that each individual shall display his patriotism on
                        his "own hook." This will answer, for want of a better arrangement, if the
                        individual don't mistake whisky for patriotism. We never like to see an
                        American citizen make a beast of himself on the fourth of July. If there is
                        one day in the whole year that he should respect and observe decently it is
                            this day. Heretofore this day has been given
                        up pretty much to drunkenness and riotous jollification by quite too large a
                        portion of our community. We trust that this may not be the case on the
                        coming Fourth, and that if any are found desecrating the day in such
                        unbecoming manner that they be set down as doubtful patriots and bad
                        citizens. That man has but a poor appreciation of our glorious institutions
                        who thinks that he can only display his love for them by getting drunk on
                        the Fourth of July. We hope to see the day celebrated in a becoming manner
                        by our citizens one and all--men, women and children--free from excessive
                        and dissipation of every sort, but with no lack of that exhibition of
                        patriotism, and harmless jollification, that the "Glorious Fourth" forever
                        demands.</p>
                    <p>Our Sunday Schools, we understand, are making preparations for having their
                        usual picnics which is a very proper and delightful way of celebrating the
                        Fourth. We wish the young folks a happy time devouring the good things got
                        up for the occasion and hope they may enjoy themselves hugely.</p>

<b>An Extraordinary Letter</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    <p><br>Hagerstown, April 26, 1861.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Funsten--Dear Sir--I have dropped Gen. Harper
                        a note, and also forwarded him a map of our county. The map of Franklin
                        county I will forward him, and all the information he may desire thereto, in
                        a day or two.</p>
                    <p>The "Union Shriekers," or Black Republicans here, are gaining on the fears of
                        the people. Many good Southern Rights men are now wavering, owing to these
                        excited apprehensions, and our cause is daily losing strength. I will hope
                        the lower portion of the State will remain [illegible] and, in the end, we
                        will escape from the chains that bind us to Black Republicanism.</p>
                    <p>You will do me a great kindness, and one that I will not be likely to forget
                        soon, if you interest yourself with Gen. Harper in procuring me a good
                        weapon of defense. Only yesterday I was threatened with a mob, who said they
                        would compel me to hang out the "Stars and Stripes."</p>
                    <p>Very truly yours,</p>
                    <p><br>Daniel Dechert</p>
                    <p>The above letter is so extraordinary in its character, that when we first
                        heard of it, we felt inclined to doubt its authenticity. But we have since
                        been assured that its genuineness is unquestionable. We forbear denouncing
                        this treasonable letter as its notorious character merits, from regard for
                        the feelings of his relatives in this place who are deeply mortified in
                        consequence and heartily unite with every loyal citizen in denouncing it as
                        an act of the basest treachery and ingratitude. Though we have not seen or
                        spoken to Mr. Daniel Dechert for four years, yet from what we heard of his
                        course since the commencement of the troubles in the country we were
                        satisfied that he was controlled by a faction of Secessionists in Hagerstown
                        and that his sympathies were with the South; but that he would be guilty of
                        an overt act of treason in writing such a letter as the above, was more than

                    <p>Nothing interesting has been announced from Gen. Fremont's Department.</p>
                    <p>Advices from Front Royal state that General Shields has succeeded in
                        concentrating all his troops at Strasburg. The rear guard of his army left
                        Luray about an hour before it was entered by Ewell's advancing column. Ewell
                        is now believed to be in occupancy of Luray, with a heavy force.</p>
                    <p>Arrivals, to-night from New Market, bring intelligence that General Fremont
                        was about to advance to New Market, seven miles south of Mount Jackson, and
                        opposite the gap in the Massanutten Mountain, through which the road leads
                        to Luray. Jackson is believed to have a considerable force of light troops
                        in Harrisonburg, while another body is at or near Port Republic. Prisoners
                        report that White's division of fifteen hundred are within supporting
                        distance of Port Republic.</p>
                    <p>The Seventh Louisiana Regiment was opposed to the Seventh Indiana at the
                        battle at Port Republic. The deadly effect of our fire can be imagined when
                        the former left the field with only 36 unhurt. This is the evidence of a
                        prisoner from that regiment. The combat was hand to hand or at pistol range.
                        Col. Carroll's Artillery used nothing but canister and grape, and when the
                        enemy came too near to use these with effect, the canoniers used their
                        revolvers with telling effect upon their assailants. Col. Carroll led three
                        successive regiments up to the support of the Seventh Indiana and drove the
                        enemy back until they were flanked and compelled to retreat. It is reported
                        here that Col. Carroll goes to Washington to correct some misunderstanding
                        in relation to his orders previous to the engagement.</p>
                    <p>A general court martial, of which Col. Ruger, Third Wisconsin, is President,
                        and Lieut. Patterson, Second Massachusetts, is Judge Advocate, is now in
                        session here. Charges against officers for absence without leave, selling or
                        disposing of horses and other government property and privates for similar
                        acts are to be tried.</p>
                    <p>It is stated that there are now absent by authority, from this command, 1575
                        men and 75 commissioned officers, greatly reducing our limited numerical
                        strength.</p>
                    <p>The Twenty ninth Pennsylvania has been detailed as a Provost Guard of
                        Hagerstown, Williamsport and Martinsburg.</p>
                    <p>Col. Alexander, aid to Governor Peirpont, is now here, looking after the sick
                        and wounded of the Virginia regiments. The State jurisdiction has been
                        re-established in Morgan and Berkely counties, and will shortly be extended
                        to Jefferson and Frederick. The election in Berkely last month gave 800
                        majority for Gov. Peirpont.</p>
                    <p>A considerable haul of guns, pistols and ammunition was made in Berryville
                        yesterday. The arms were all loaded with ball cartridges. The office of the
                        'Berryville Conservator' was confiscated several days ago for Rebel
                        publications, and the effects removed hither to aid in army printing.</p>
                    <p>A large amount of loose and fixed ammunition, left here it is supposed by
                        Gen. Shields, was discovered by the ordnance officer in the old stone
                        churuch [sic] today. It was probably overlooked by the enemy in their late
                        visit to this place, to whom it would have been a valuable acquisition.</p>
                    <p>The first instance of the arrest of a colored man for abetting the enemy
                        occurred to-day. It had been stated that he volunteered as guide and spy for
                        Jackson in his late advance hither. He is confined for further
                        investigation.</p>
                    <p>General Sigel has been in command of this Department during the temporary
                        absence of Gen. Banks, who returns to-morrow.</p>
                    <p>Gen Slough's Brigade was reviewed yesterday, preparatory to future movements.
                        The appearance and exercises of the various regiments and batteries were
                        highly creditable to themselves and their commander.</p>
                    <p>The bridge over the Potomac at Harper's Ferry has been rebuilt, and the cars
                        run regularly to the West. At the instance of the Government, the Baltimore
                        and Ohio Railroad Company are repairing the Winchester and Potomac road, and
                        travel will be resumed upon it by Thursday. [T]his will greatly facilitate
                        the transportation of much needed army supplies.</p>
                    <p>The occupation of the valley by our present forces has not restored a feeling
                        of security to to [sic] the loyal residents, and the Secessionists insist
                        upon it that Jackson will shortly pay us another visit in his usual style.
                        The more judicious portion of the latter regret this, as they can see no
                        possibility of his retaining it should he succeed in forcing us to retreat.</p>
                    <p>From all indications daily intelligence is received from and despatched to
                        Jackson's army. The house of a leading Secessionist was searched yesterday,
                        upon information that a mail had been deposited there the previous night,
                        but without success.</p>

<b>Who Are the True Patriots and Who are the Traitors?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Quotes a resolution from an 1844 meeting of the American Anti-Slavery

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A correspondent of the Philadelphia Inquirer, writing from Winchester, Va.,
                        says:</p>
                    <p>Gen. Fremont's scouts all agree in reporting that at least a portion of
                        Jackson's force have returned from the south side of the Shenandoah where
                        they met Shields, to Harrisonburg, and that they now hold that place.
                        Another account says that Jackson has pickets down the Harrisonburg road
                        toward Mt. Jackson for a distance of eight miles. It is asserted that his
                        pickets and Fremont's met yesterday afternoon. The former, being in greater
                        force than the latter, is said to have driven them some distance. This
                        requires confirmation. I regard it, however, as highly probable that Jackson
                        was feeling Fremont's present position and strength, and that such a
                        skirmish did occur, without any decided advantage to either party. The
                        Secessionists here are confident that he will attempt to return down the
                        Valley in a short time. They say they know that he has been reinforced
                        largely. All our people who come from Fremont's advance, including his best
                        scouts, agree in the statement that Jackson's force has been considerably
                        augmented. The Secessionists claim that it reaches now thirty eight thousand
                        men.</p>
                    <p>Where do these reinforcements come from?</p>
                    <p>The only solution I can give of what seems to be an indisputable fact is that
                        some of the forces have been withdrawn from the sea-coast defences of South
                        Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and sent to this valley. It is certain they
                        cannot spare troops from Richmond in its present beleaguered condition. On
                        the contrary, private Secession advices from Richmond state that Davis would
                        call Jackson to Richmond at once, so sorely is he pressed, were it not that
                        there is such a universal outcry against him by every Virginia Rebel in the
                        Valley, and secondly, because he knows the moment Jackson is withdrawn from
                        our front, Banks and Fremont with consolidated forces, would move at once
                        upon Staunton, thereby controlling the Virginia Central, and from thence to
                        Lynchburg, control the Virginia and Tennessee road. Thus the two leading
                        railroad avenues from which Richmond derives the only support which can
                        possibly reach her half starved soldiery and resident population, would be
                        in the possession of our forces. Moreover, there would be no line of retreat
                        left for demoralized troops in case of a forced evacuation of Richmond.</p>
                    <p>The withdrawal of the sea-coast forces from South Carolina, etc., is
                        confirmed by the telegraphic despatches announcing the arrival of a large
                        portion of Beauregard's army at Charleston. Doubtless, the number announced,
                        30, 000, is an exaggeration. They have come to take the place of those sent
                        to Richmond and to Jackson.</p>
                    <p>Our Government fearful of such an interchange of troops from one place to
                        another, has ceased simultaneous attacks to be made on Galveston, Mobile and
                        Charleston, intending thereby, to compel the reserve forces in Texas,
                        Alabama, and South Carolina, to be retained at home. I, therefore, doubt
                        whether Beauregard has sent a single man to Richmond. The sea-coast defence
                        forces have been sent quietly leaving only enough men to amuse Hunter with a
                        show of opposition, and have reached Richmond and Southern Virginia ten days
                        since, and now that Hunter and the South Atlantic and Gulf Squadron are
                        moving actively, Beauregard must supply the vacuums thus created from his
                        own army.</p>
                    <p>What Could Jackson Effect by Another Raid?</p>
                    <p>I think, nothing, except hard fighting and a terrific loss of life on both
                        sides. I feel at liberty to say that he will not find a little band of five
                        thousand men and sixteen pieces of artil[l]lery to meet him. I can also say
                        that he will meet a force fully equal to his own, as well equipped and
                        commanded by Generals who have fought him, separately or unitedly, a half
                        dozen or more times and who know the Valley now as thoroughly as he does. He
                        has lost his most accomplished cavalry leaders, Sheets and Ashby. He has
                        lost nearly a whole battery of artillery. Fully one thousand of his best
                        troops have been killed and fifteen hundred wounded in the recent
                        engagements in this valley. Fremont has taken about eight hundred prisoners.
                        So his aggregate losses would reach a total of 3300. Is it possible that,
                        when he has left the Valley, thus decimated by inferior forces, he can hope
                        to return here and effect any important result against forces seasoned and
                        hardened as most of ours have been, in actual conflict, equal in number to
                        any force he can bring, and better appointed? Yet I do not doubt that, from
                        the dash and enterprise of the man, he will try "his hand at the job." He
                        will find it a "huge job."</p>
