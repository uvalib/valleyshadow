                    country in view of its pending troubles and impending perils. In vain do we look
                    for a stirring appeal in behalf of a bleeding country, something to touch the

                    high and lofty deeds."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>This anxiously looked for document we lay before our readers in this issue of
                        our paper. We are disposed to treat everything emanating from so high a
                        source as the President of the United States with respect and fairness, but
                        are compelled to say that in our judgment this message falls far short of
                        the expectations of the people, and is woefully deficient in everything that
                        would indicate true statesmanship in its author. We have always aimed to
                        treat the occupant of the presidential chair with the respect due to the
                        dignity of his station and in this respect our course has been radically
                        different from that of our political opponents, who never failed to seek
                        every opportunity during Democratic administrations, to speak in the most
                        disrespectful terms of the President and insult him with epithets and
                        language too foul and filthy to be used by decent people against a street
                        scavenger.</p>
                    <p>Especially have we been lenient towards the acts of Mr. Lincoln. We honestly
                        desired to support him and did support him and did support him in everything
                        that our judgment could approve and which we believed to be calculated to
                        restore the supremacy of the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was.
                        Any act or policy that does not tend to the accommplishment [sic] of this
                        great object will at all times meet with our unqualified condemnation .
                        Further than our judgment approves we cannot and <emph rend="italic"
                        >will</emph> not support any man either high or low.</p>
                    <p>But what shall we say of the message? that is the question. We confess that
                        it disappoints us, not that we expected much , but that it comes so
                        infinitely short even of that which we expected. In vain do we look for a
                        full and fair presentation of the state of the country in view of its
                        pending troubles and impending perils. In vain do we look for a stirring
                        appeal in behalf of a bleeding country, something to touch the finer
                        emotions of the human heart and to arouse the patriotism of the people to
                        high and lofty deeds. In vain do we look for broad and comprehensive views
                        of statesmanship, such as would give hope to the people that our beloved
                        country might yet be rescued from the terrible evils which reckless
                        politicians and ambitious demagogues have brought upon it.</p>
                    <p>The President almost entirely ignores the existence of this horrible civil
                        war that is devastating the land and exhausting its resources. It is true he
                        makes several incidental allusions to "war" and "rebellion," but gives us no
                        account of our military operations during the year or the probabilities of a
                        successful termination to the deadly strife.</p>
                    <p>While thousands and tens of thousands of brave men have fallen on the bloody
                        field, and rivers have been made to run red with gore, and while upon every
                        hilltop and in every valley of this broad land the voice of the bereft have
                        been heard in accents of mourning for their loved ones slain in battle, and
                        while the deadly conflict is still raging with all its fierceness and fury,
                        without a word of commiseration for the brave wounded and dead, or a genial
                        paragraph for the living and with the destinies of thirty millions of <emph
                            rend="italic">white</emph> people in his keeping, the President of the
                        United States babbles about the <emph rend="italic">negro!</emph></p>
                    <p>He proposes three amendments to the Constitution, and follows the proposition
                        with an elaborate argument trying to prove that his "compensated
                        emancipation" policy is the grand panacea for all our ills. His argument,
                        however, does not indicate much ability in Mr. Lincoln as a logician. His
                        reasoning must fail to convince the most unsophisticated minds and his
                        conclusions are miserable abortions which bear their own absurdity on their
                        face.</p>
                    <p>His views on the finances and his recommendation of a general Banking law are
                        equally unsound and totally inadequate to relieve the wants of the country.
                        We append the following remarks from the <emph rend="italic">Journal of
                            Commerce</emph> on the two main propositions contained in the message as
                        expressing our own views better than we could express them ourselves:</p>
                    <p>"The financial propositions of the President require no examination at the
                        hands of men familiar with the laws of finance. They are rejected at one by
                        the good sense of the experienced banker or financier, without a moment's
                        hesitation.--Again and again heretofore such plans have been examined,
                        sifted, even tried, and they have always proved ruinous. At the present time
                        especially they are unfitted to the wants of the country. Any great change
                        in the currency, such as is proposed, would produce commercial disaster
                        everywhere. Before the change could be effected the majority of banks and
                        bankers would be ruined, the people would be convulsed with financial
                        embarrassments, and the distress which would visit high as well as low would
                        inevitably set the seal of condemnation on the proposed system. Certainly
                        the President and his advisers cannot have any clear idea of the working of
                        the laws of money. They need experience in the common affairs of the money
                        world, or they would never have threatened us with a plan so crude, so
                        manifestly worthless for all practical purposes, even if it be not entirely
                        without authority of the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lincoln is evidently in earnest in his plans of emancipation. His
                        earnestness demands that his views receive a careful, candid and studious
                        examination by the people, and this they will have. But who can read them at
                        a moment like this and not be astonished at their presentation as a means of
                        bringing to an end the existing war, which is destroying the nation? We are
                        compelled to say that the whole plan indicates a failure on the part of the
                        President to appreciate the vastness of the war, the swift nature of its
                        influences, the terrible verge on which the country trembles. While Congress
                        is discussing and adopting amendments to the Constitution, while the
                        Legislatures of the States are assembling and considering them, after
                        Congress shall have done with them, while we wait the chances of all the
                        free States and seven of the slave States agreeing to incorporate these
                        propositions in the grand instrument of our national existence, the war goes
                        on fearfully, and the blood of the people flows fast and--if this plan be
                        our only hope--in vain!</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lincoln makes that terrible error of imagining, as the radical men have
                        taught him, that this war is a war about slavery alone, that slavery is the
                        cause of rebellion, disagreement, disunion. He proposes to adopt a scheme of
                        emancipation involving an immense debt, on the theory that if he can thus
                        dispose of the slavery question he will have removed out of the way all
                        causes of discord, the American millenium [sic] will have dawned, and--no
                        matter what it costs us--we have nothing to do but live on in peace and
                        prosperity, until we are a nation of a hundred millions--then pay our debt
                        and be perfectly blessed. The theory is strange enough in peaceable times,
                        it is with solemn sadness that we see it offered in these days of awful war,
                        as a means of ending conflict and establishing national peace and union. To
                        us it appears as impracticable and hopeless of good as letting go an anchor
                        is mid ocean to save a vessel that is driving before a tempest, with torn
                        sails and disheartened crew.</p>

                <summary>The editors express their disappointment with the address by President
                    Lincoln. Though they profess to try to support the President regardless of his
                    party affiliation, they attack his address for downplaying the civil war and for
                    stressing emancipation rather than discussing the sacrifices of Northern
                    soldiers. The editors also quote the Journal of Commerce's critique of several
                    of Lincoln's propositions, including the national banking act and the abolition
                    plan. The banking scheme would disrupt the entire economy, they claim, and the
                    emancipation plan would destroy the nation financially and politically.</summary>

                    freemen into slavery. The inquiry on whites was tabled, while the resolution on
                    blacks was passed. Such discrimination toward whites, the writer notes, "speaks

                    <p>In Camp Near Fredericksburg, Va., <lb/>December 2nd. 1862.</p>
                    <p>There has been no movements of the Grand Army of the Potomac since my last
                        letter. The Rebels still have possession of Fredericksburg. They do not
                        appear in very great strength in the city, but there are indications of an
                        immense army occupying the country around it. From the hills on this dies
                        the Rappahannock we can look down upon the ancient place, and wonder that
                        our leaders did not move to its possession when we first came here. On
                        Sundays the ringing of the church bells can be distinctly heard and people
                        seen repairing to their respective places of worship. Through the weeks
                        there seems to be no cessation from the usual routine of business and
                        altogether there is an apparent unconcern as to our presence or future
                        movements. Along the river bank fortifications have been thrown up and are
                        hourly strengthened without molestation, and Rebel Cavalry come down to the
                        streams to water their horses and converse with our pickets on this side.
                        Under the circumstances out position seems a very queer one. There is not
                        the least indication observable of our early forward movement, and all
                        theories with reference to the future are built without any tangible or
                        reliable foundations. The geneal [sic] belief is however that our inactivity
                        is owing to the necessity of having ample supplies before moving too far
                        away from our base of operations. This I think is likely the case. When we
                        came here our Subsistence Department had become greatly reduced and the
                        wretched condition of the road, from Acquia Creek Landing, our newly
                        established and most convenient depot, to this point, impeded transportation
                        and caused provoking delay. The truth is, that for a time both man and beast
                        were suffering for want of food. Within a few days the railroad has been
                        completed and the various stores needed will be more rapidly furnished. At
                        what particular date the army will resume its march I dont [sic] believe the
                        leaders themselves know. It is desirable and absolutely necessary that
                        before further advances are made we have an abundance of Subsistence and
                        Quarter Master's supplies, and whenever these are on hand in requisite
                        quantities the public desire for a renewal of active hostilities will be
                        gratified.</p>
                    <p>The city of Fredericksburg is one of the most ancient in the country, and has
                        a conspicuous place in our early history. It is situated immediately on the
                        South West bank of the Rappahannock a river which at this point resembles
                        our own Conococheage. The population of the place is about three thousand.
                        It is the seat of justice of Spotsylvania County, and in times past must
                        have been an attractive and interesting place. Here, in one of the
                        Cemeteries, repose the ashes of "Mary the Mother of Washington." The tomb
                        contains this simple inscription, but it speaks volumes of the virtues of
                        her who gave birth to him who was "First in War, First in Peace, and First
                        in the hearts of his Countrymen." Washington was born only about thirty
                        miles from here, in Westmorland County, and I have no doubt in his early
                        manhood was a frequent visitor to Fredericksburg. He was a prominent member
                        of the Free Mason's Lodge in existence there, and held at one time the
                        honorable position of Grand Master of the United States. His regalia was in
                        possession of the Lodge up to the time of the breaking out of the Rebellion,
                        when it was removed to some other section and secured. I have no doubt I
                        could find much about Fredericksburg worty [sic] of record but must forego
                        until we get there.</p>
                    <p>Among the distinguished visitors to the army last week, were President
                        Lincoln and Mrs. Burnside. The President confined the business of his visit
                        to an interview with the General Commanding. The result may be looked for in
                        time, Mrs. B. was at Head Quarters on a visit to her husband. The General
                        himself has been spending too much time at Acquia Creek Landing and has been
                        rendering himself very popular by his unassuming manners and free social
                        intercourse among the soldiers, and employees of the Government.</p>
                    <p>Thanksgiving day came and passed without any special observance from the
                        Pennsylvania boys. We missed the usual home dinner of former days of this
                        character, when the good things of life abounded and happy hearts surrounded
                        the festive board. Good dinners at home may have been the order of the day
                        on this last Thanksgiving, but I can hardly believe there was the same
                        enjoyment of them as there would have been, had the many vacant chairs been
                        filled with the patriot fathers and sons now far away battling for their
                        country and its honored flag. We thought of the day and its purpose and
                        thought of home and those we love. To many a one the question may have
                        recurred what shall I give thanks for, when our beloved country is enduring
                        the shock of war and I am so far away suffering the pangs of absence, the
                        chilly blasts of winter, and the hardships of military service? Yes we have
                        much to thank God for. To Him we owe the profoundest gratitude for the
                        health and strength He has vouchsafed to us to battle for the Right. To Him
                        we are indebted for protection from countless dangers. He has been merciful
                        to us in all our wickedness and saved us thus far from disease and death.
                        The food that we eat still comes from His hands, and we breath [sic], and
                        move, and still have being through his clemency and goodness. And has he not
                        blessed our loved ones at home? To them He has been gracious and bountiful
                        and opened their hearts in His praise and goodness for His protecting hand
                        upon us. Yes, He deserves our thanks and the richest offerings of our
                        hearts. In all seasons His is our shield and whether at our own firesides
                        surrounded with peace and Comfort or in the din and strife of war His
                        goodness and mercy are boundles [sic] and we should give Thanks.</p>
                    <p>A letter appeared in the Philadelphia "Press" lately denouncing in most
                        unmeasured terms the conduct of our Brigade on its recent march from
                        Harper's Ferry, the writer accuses us of all manner of bad deeds and would
                        leave the inference that we were an organization of marauders and thieves
                        instead of soldiers for the Union. This letter came to the notice of Gen.
                        Tyler and he read it the other day for the information of the whole Brigade.
                        He pronounced it a tissue of unmitigated lies, and was indignant to the
                        highest degree. He said it was his desire to preserve the honor and respect
                        of his command at all times, and that he was proud to say that no one could
                        justly accuse them of violations of law, such as the letter writer referred
                        to, would have the public believe they were guilty of. He knew that there
                        were a few men in his command who discarded and repudiated all observance of
                        orders, but he defied any one to show him a command who had not some such
                        characters. As for his command in general, he claims that it was second to
                        none other in the service in respectability and behavior, and it should ever
                        have such a reputation if his efforts availed. Gen. Tyler is very jealous of
                        the honor of his Brigade and labors unceasingly for its effectiveness and
                        discipline. He was right in meeting the assaults made upon it and uttered
                        the truth when he said the scribbler of the "Press" was a defamer and
                        falsifier. I refer to the subject more particularly as the "Press"
                        circulates largely in Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>I paid a visit on Sunday to the Camp of the 107th. They are located near the
                        Railroad a Brooke's Station about three miles from here I found the boys
                        generally hearty and well. Capt. Brand, of Company "K," had tendered his
                        resignation which was accepted and he had left for home. The Captain has
                        been in active service for more than a year and has amply proved his bravery
                        on the battle fields of Manassas, South Mountain and Antietam. He parted
                        with his command reluctantly and was only induced to take the step by bad
                        health. 1st Lieutenant Rhodes, will take the Captains place and 2nd
                        Lieutenant Cook will take his position. While on my way to the 107th I saw
                        Gen. Burnside in a special train returning to his Head Quarters from Acquia
                        Creek Landing.</p>
                    <p>Our boys are fitting up their shelters with wooden foundations and pine
                        boughs for better protection against the storm and cold.</p>
                    <p>It is rumored that Major Pumroy, U.S. Paymaster, will shortly visit us for
                        the purpose of paying us for three months service. I think there will be no
                        disappointment this time. A large portion of the amount received will go to
                        the families and friends of the boys at home.</p>

                <summary>A correspondent in the 126th Reg't Penn. Volunteers writes from their
                    position outside Fredericksburg. Little has changed, he reports, although the
                    Confederates seem to be digging in. The delay in attack, he believes, comes from
                    the Union forces being short of supplies. He also reports that Thanksgiving
                    passed by without special observance. In addition, he writes that accusations
                    made against their brigade in the Philadelphia Press about their conduct on the
                    march down to Fredericksburg are completely unfounded.</summary>

                        On Saturday they broke guard and fled in every direction. Such was the
                        condition of affairs that a detachment of the provost guard battallion [sic]
                        of this city were ordered to Chambersburg, on Saturday afternoon, to guard
                        the camp and prevent further desertions. The kind of weather we are now

                    the Bank of Chambersburg to issue checks in the sum of 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents,
                    redeemable in sums of a dollar or more at the bank, which should provide for the
                    community's needs and yet not violate the law against the issuance of small
                    notes.</summary>

                <summary>Explains that the rise in kerosene prices is due to a scarcity rooted in
                    the suspension of manufacturing. Refiners were worried that government taxes
                    would ruin their business, and many suspended manufacturing. But with
                    manufacturing back on track, the editors believe it will be impossible for
                    refiners or speculators to keep prices so high.</summary>
