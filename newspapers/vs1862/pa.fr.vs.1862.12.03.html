<b>The Reign of Terror Ended</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writers decry the Lincoln administration for its restrictions on civil
                    liberties and for its pursuit of emancipation at the expense, as they see it, of
                    white civil rights. The recent elections, they claim, have broken the power of
                    the Republicans. The Democrats will now demand the restoration of all
                    "constitutional rights and privileges of the States and citizens," including
                    letting the South regulate slavery itself.<br>

<b>The Cause for McClellan's Removal</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors accuse the administration of trying to soften the blow of the
                    news of McClellan's removal by releasing a letter by General Halleck the same
                    day, as well as the findings of the Harper's Ferry commission. Despite Halleck's
                    explanations, the editors do not believe that McClellan should have been
                    obligated to move his army on a particular day chosen by political leaders--this
                    has no parallel in military history, they claim. The real reason for McClellan's
                    dismissal, they assert, was a purge by radical members of Lincoln's cabinet
                    aiming to get rid of the conservative generals in the army.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors poke fun at an editorial in the Transcript and Repository,
                    which claims that those who support slavery are "only rushing upon the thick
                    bosses of Jehovah's buckler." The emancipation proclamation, the editors note,
                    was issued by Lincoln with no claim of divine guidance, but perhaps, they
                    assert, the President had talked to the editor of the Transcript and received
                    the word "through the medium of our inspired neighbor."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In Camp Near Fredericksburg, Va., <br>November 25th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>We remained in Camp at Warrenton one week. During this time, Major-General
                        Fitz John Porter was relieved of his command of our corps and Major-General
                        Hooker was appointed in his place. The latter officer is also the senior in
                        command of the Grand Centre Division of the army and ranks next to General
                        Burnside. Monday morning the 17th we took our departure. About 4 P.M. we
                        reached Warrenton Junction which at the time was a new base of supplies for
                        the Army. Here our esteemed Chaplain, Rev. Mr. Niccolls took his departure
                        for home, the period of his official engagement with us having expired. A
                        large number of sick of the Division were forwarded also from this point to
                        the hospitals in Alexandria. Tuesday we marched sixteen miles to a place
                        near Richland Creek. Wednesday we came to within four miles of
                        Fredericksburg where we remained until Saturday when we moved and encamped
                        at this point after marching over a "curcumbendibus" route of eight miles.</p>
                    <p>The weather throughout the entire week was of the most cheerless and
                        disagreeable character. From the time we broke camp near Warrenton until
                        Friday noon it rained almost incessantly. The roads were rendered very
                        nearly impassable, by reason of the mud, to either man or beast. The
                        services of the pioneer force were almost constantly required in clearing
                        new roads through woods, and building temporary bridges over rapidly rising
                        streams. Our progress under the circumstances was considerably impeded
                        though we managed to make our destinations each day. The boys suffered
                        considerable from the cold and wet and many a wish was expressed for a rapid
                        expiration of their term of soldiering. In camp, matters were no better. The
                        rain pelted through the thin fabric of our shelters and blankets, clothing
                        and haversacks underwent a complete soaking.</p>
                    <p>On our last day's march we passed the vestiges of a camp occupied last summer
                        by the Pennsylvania Reserve corps. The whole arrangement was of a beautiful
                        and attractive character. Shelters, square and semi-conical, made of green
                        sod and with every appliance get-atable to make them comfortable, were
                        ranged along the streets: arches, wreaths and festoons of evergreen appeared
                        at various points handsomely arranged, and rustic seats were erected
                        wherever they seemed desirable. No little genius and good taste had been
                        expended in the execution of all this work. It certainly surpassed anything
                        in the way of a camp we have every yet seen and I can imagine the hilarity
                        and joy which prevailed among the Reserve boys in their beautiful embowered
                        homes.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Reed and Lieut. Jeremiah Cook returned to their command on Friday. They
                        received a very kind and cordial reception. In their absence Lieut.
                        Hullinger had charge of the company and devoted himself closely to its
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>We had the pleasure of shaking by the hand on Saturday the brave and gallant
                        Col. Charles T. Campbell, of the 57th P.V. His command is encamped a mile or
                        so from here.</p>
                    <p>The Grand Army of the Potomac have been moving to this point for some days.
                        At present its base of supplies is Acquia Creek about 12 miles from here.</p>
                    <p>Fredricksburg is occupied by the Rebels. Their and our pickets occupy either
                        side of the Rappahannock. There is nothing new astir and I do not see any
                        indication of hostile operations shortly.</p>
                    <p>SHENANDOAH.</p>

                        returned thanks to the Almighty Ruler of the Universe for the many blessings
                        He has bestowed upon us as a nation, and as individuals. Through the efforts

                    Shoemaker, and Miss Kate Wilson were appointed a committee to report presiding
                    officers for the meeting. The program then began. Shoemaker and Richard made
                    remarks on written arithmetic with Richards illustrating on the board. A.
                    McElwain opened the evening session with a prayer, and vocal music was given by
                    several young ladies and gentlemen. The committee on officers reported Rev. J.
                    Dickson, president and D. S. McFadden and George M. Stenger, vice presidents.
                    Remarks were made on arithmetic by A. McElwain; remarks on Geography by J. M.
                    Andrews, and remarks on Grammar by Eckhart. Thursday Morning--McFadden occupied
                    the chair; prayer by Mr. Dietrich. J. S. McElwain exercised the teachers in
                    grammar by the correction and analysis of sentences. Rev. J. Dickson then
                    appeared and took his seat. A. McElwain lectured on Penmanship, and J. W. Coble
                    remarked on the same subject. Thursday Afternoon--Prayer by Rev. J. Dickson. A.
                    McElwain made additional remarks on Penmanship, followed by G. B. Miller on the

                    newspaper which complained that the public schools did not provide religious
                    training for pupils; McElwain commented to the effect that "religious
                    inculcation of religious creeds is very properly left to others, instead of the
                    Common Schools teacher." Essay read by Miss Virginia Reilly on music, and by
                    Miss Annie Walk on orthography and reading. Mr. Richards exercised the teachers
