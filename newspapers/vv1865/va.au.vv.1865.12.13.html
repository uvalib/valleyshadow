<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>[section missing]</p>
                    <p>Are we content to go for the next twenty-five years as we have done for the
                        last, satisfied with the bounties which nature has bestowed, and without any
                        effort to keep pace with the march of progress? Are we still to leave vast
                        mineral resources undeveloped, water power unapplied, or even our
                        agriculture in its hampered condition, for want of access to market? Of what
                        use are our deposits of Iron, Coal, Lead, &amp;c., and what value our
                        crops of hay and grain if it be necessary to wagon them from twenty to sixty
                        miles to market? It is evident that so long as the present condition of
                        affairs continues we can expect no rapid improvement of our Valley, no great
                        increase of wealth and prosperity. Mt. Jackson is farther from Richmond or
                        Baltimore in a Commercial sense, than central Connecticut or Ohio. The
                        farmer or manufacturer might as well have his crops or his fabrics in
                        British America as in the centre of this great Valley. The large corn and
                        hay crops of our Country must be converted into Cattle or wasted, while the
                        markets of Baltimore, Washington or Richmond are supplied these staples from
                        Northern or Western States, distant five times as far in miles.</p>
                    <p>This condition of affairs should be corrected and now is the time to do it.
                        We are just starting out in a new race, and should use all our enterprise to
                        attract the capital and energy now seeking investment. We have natural
                        advantages, in our Valley, unequaled. To have an outlet by which these
                        advantages may be turned to account, is our first need. Our interests
                        require a railroad from Winchester to Salem, a road to be made without
                        delay, and which will put us within a few hours of any of the great markets.
                        The Manassas Gap road seems hopelessly debilitated. It shows no signs of
                        reviving life, and if it were on its legs would probably consume the
                        remainder of the century in doing what ought to be done in the next two or
                        three years. The enterprise must be undertaken anew and under different
                        auspices.</p>
                    <p>There are two ideas that suggest themselves. First to have a new Company with
                        a charter to make their road from Winchester to Salem. Or, next, to give to
                        the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company the right of way. This company has
                        always been extremely anxious to open a road through the Valley, and now we
                        understand are willing to make the road entire, if only the charter be
                        given. Nor is there any doubt that this Company and Baltimore City would
                        advance all the funds needed to build the road, to any company that might
                        take it in hand, provided they were secured reasonable privileges in return.
                        There are many reasons why we should prefer that the road should be in the
                        hands of a company composed of citizens of our own State and located in it.
                        Nor do we doubt that the enterprise might be successfully set on foot, and
                        that without delay, on this basis. But this ought not to be a sine qua non. Our first need is the road. If no
                        other arrangement can be effected, we hope the legislature will promptly
                        give the charter asked for to the Baltimore Company, coupled with a
                        requirement that the road shall be completed in some certain short space of
                        time. Then with five thousand workmen put on it we might have the road done
                        to Staunton in six months, and to Salem in two years.</p>

<b>The March of Civilization</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

                        over her labor and he found she had produced the following beautiful,
                        remarkable and original piece of poetry--</p>

<b>What is Store For Us</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Although the current political situation looks gloomy, the editors argue
                    that there is room for hope. The policies of the radical Republicans promise to
                    alienate the West, along with moderate northerners. The President has made it
                    clear he will oppose their reconstruction policies, and southerners are
                    supporting him because of it.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We publish a full synopsis of the President's Message and Senator Wilson's
                        bill, which is one of the many bills of a similar character introduced to
                        degrade the South and hamper the President in his policy of restoration. In
                        reading the message and Wilson's bill our people will see that the issue
                        between Andrew Johnson and the Radicals is distinctly made by the latter.
                        The President wants the Southern States restored to their Constitutional
                        rights, but the crazy radicals want them degraded and reduced to a
                        territorial condition. It remains to be seen who is the most powerful, and
                        in the contest the Southern people will support, as far as they can, the
                        President.</p>
                    <p>The times indeed look gloomy on the surface, and the Radical mob at
                        Washington seem to have everything their own way, but, looking beneath the
                        scum that has floated to the top, we can see evidences of disintegration and
                        demoralization among the unconstitutional party that now controls Congress.
                        The dignified and manly course taken by the members from Virginia and the
                        South, in returning home, as soon as they found their services were not
                        needed by Congress, has strengthened the hands of all constitutional men
                        North and placed the Radicals in their proper position, as the dis-union
                        party. The moderate Republicans and Conservative members, from the North and
                        West, are evidently disgusted with the extreme measures of the Radicals, and
                        supported by the President and the conservative sentiment of the whole
                        country, time is sure to brig everything right.</p>
                    <p>This is the hopeful view of the political situation, for if the Radicals
                        continue to have everything their own way the darkest day of the South is
                        yet to come. While we hope for the best we should not despond if the worst
                        comes. Admitting the facts of the present we must never disgrace our past by
                        making unconstitutional concessions to power--never admit wrong is right, by
                        sending pliant tools to Washington to "misrepresent" us. Let us work along,
                        as best we may, and build up our shattered fortunes. After what has passed
                        we can lose nothing by waiting patiently, and if we are only true to
                        ourselves; true to our Country; true to Constitutional principles, a just
                        God will never see such a people as ours, made the slaves of a Radical mob
                        who now seek our destruction.</p>
