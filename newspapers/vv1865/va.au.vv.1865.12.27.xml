                <summary>This article ridicules the Virginians who attempted to gain seats in the
                    house by pledging loyalty to the government and claiming to have been Unionists
                    during the war. The Clerk still refused to seat them.</summary>

                    reconstruction policy, arguing that slavery should have been ended more
                    gradually.</summary>

                    <p>The Concord N. H. Monitor publishes a portion of a letter from Dr. Stillwell,
                        formerly in charge of the hospital in this city, which contains the
                        following items of general interest concerning matters in that portion of
                        Virginia in which he resides, viz: King George county, on the Potomac river,
                        below Washington:</p>
                    <p>"We have an entire change of labor system. The negroes held a meeting and
                        refused to engage to work, except by the day or month--at $10 per month and
                        board, or fifty cents per day and board. The planters held a meeting, and
                        decided to refuse to hire the blacks under any circumstances, for any price.
                        They are employing Germans for 60 per year. These emigrants are flowing into
                        the country in great numbers, and great suffering is expected this winter by
                        the freedmen being unable to obtain any employment. I have upon my place
                        twenty German families, and they work splendidly. They are building a school
                        house and church, and all the planters are delighted with them."</p>
                    <p>Grand opportunities are afforded Northern farmers to settle here. The
                        planters have land, in abundance, teams, &amp;c., and will work their
                        land on shares with any one who will feed the laborers during the working of
                        the crop, and oversee the farm. The land will produce corn from five to
                        twelve barrels per acre, or tobacco one hogshead per acre. These are the
                        staples. Live stock is very cheap for cash-a very scarce article here.</p>

                    <p>The war between the President and Conservatism on our side, and the Radical
                        mob, led by Sumner, Stevens &amp; Co., on the other, still rages. The
                        President has received a "heavy reinforcement" in the report of that
                        generous conqueror, Gen. Grant, and though the "rump" Congress may still
                        make a show of resistance, and attempt to ruin the South, our people may
                        rest easy, for Johnson, aided by Grant, is master of the situation. The
                        Richmond <emph rend="italic">Enquirer's</emph> special telegraph
                        correspondent from Washington, usually so well informed, gives that paper
                        the following review of the situation on the 20th. He says:</p>
                    <p>The Congressional proceedings yesterday, in both houses of Congress were of
                        the most absorbing interest, particularly in the Senate.</p>
                    <p>The message of the President announcing the reports of Lieut. Gen. Grant, and
                        Maj. Gen. Schurz upon the condition of the Southern States was a bombshell
                        in the Radical camp. It came upon them like a clap of thunder from a clear
                        sky. Sumner bitterly denounced the reports and the Administration.</p>
                    <p>Reverdy Johnson, Dixon and Doolittle came to the rescue and a lively debate
                        ensued.</p>
                    <p>Major General Howard's report on the same subject has been sent into the
                        House, and Hon. John Covode's is yet to be presented. These reports are all
                        of the same tenor. They represent the masses of the people of the South as
                        thoroughly cured of any secession proclivities, and ready and anxious to do
                        everything that can be honorably and honestly required of them to restore
                        their States to the Union. Simultaneous with the presentation of these
                        reports comes the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the
                        Governor of Alabama, announcing unequivocally the restoration of the State
                        to the Union.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the proclamation states that the anti-slavery Constitutional
                        amendment has been adopted by three-fourths of the States, including, to
                        make up the requisite number, the States of Virginia, Louisiana, Tennessee,
                        Arkansas and South Carolina. Thus eight of the so-called Confederate States
                        are necessarily recognized as still States in the Union, in order to perfect
                        the adoption of the Constitutional Amendment, and the onus is thrown upon
                        the Radicals of undoing all that has been done, and declaring that the
                        amendment is not incorporated in the Constitution if they fail to recognize
                        the legal and loyal existence of those eight lately insurgent States.</p>
                    <p>The president has evidently accepted the gauge given by Thad. Stevens in the
                        House and Sumner in the Senate, and has, in the estimation of all parties,
                        trumped their trick. He has furnished to the caucus committee, of fifteen,
                        General Grant's report on the condition of the Southern States, which they
                        cannot, dare not and will not controvert. He has provided for them the
                        testimony of eye and ear witnesses of all grades, from the highest military
                        to the highest civil reputation; testimony which cannot be impeached, and
                        within twenty-four hours after the Radical batteries were opened upon him
                        and his policy, he has completely silenced them by a <emph rend="italic"
                            >coup de main</emph>, that was not dreamed of in their philosophy. He is
                        marching straight forward in his programme, turning neither to the right nor
                        left. It is admitted this evening, even among the Republicans, that he has
                        won the day.</p>
                    <p>The majority of the Republican party here are already, after yesterday's
                        demonstrations, preparing to keep step to the Presidential music, and claim
                        the whole programme as Republican; repudiating the ultraism of Sumner and
                        Stevens. They conclude that it is better to throw overboard a few of the
                        great gentlemen of the Republican crew, who think to endanger the whole
                        ship. They are even beginning to back out from the test proposed by a
                        popular vote in this District upon the negro suffrage question. They advise
                        voters not to go to the polls on Thursday, so that they may have an
                        opportunity to claim that no test has been made. The simple fact is they
                        have been badly beaten at all points, and have nothing whatever to show as
                        their trophies in the fight, except their caucus resolutions and Sumner and
                        Stevens tirades of abuse.</p>
                    <p>The Administration party is daily growing stronger, and it is predicated by
                        sage political observers that when the President opens fire from his reserve
                        of big guns there will be few left to oppose his policy. This is to be done
                        early in January, beginning with the use of Executive patronage.</p>
                    <p>Even Republicans admit that within thirty days a majority of the Senate will
                        be on the side of the Administration. This is all that will be needed, for
                        which a Conservative majority in the Senate, the Radicals in the House will
                        be utterly powerless for hurtful legislation, except to refuse admission to
                        members from the Southern States.</p>

                <summary>This article reports that the Radical Republicans have sustained a series
                    of political defeats. The States of the ex-Confederacy are ratifying the 13th
                    Amendment, and President Johnson is rapidly re-admitting them to the Union.
                    Several reports from the South, including Grant's and Schurz's, have been
                    presented in Congress and report that southerners no longer harbor secessionist
                    sympathies and are ready to return to the Union.</summary>

                    <p>Broke upon us bright and beautiful as a spring morning. Staunton was alive
                        with Freedmen and a great many freedmen were alive with whiskey, as well as
                        some white folks. Some heads were smashed but more eggs. The boys fired
                        crackers and a general racket was kept up.</p>
                    <p>About 12 o'clock the military ordered Saloons to be closed and cleared the
                        streets and from that time on every thing was more peaceful. On the whole
                        every body seemed to enjoy themselves in their own way and no one seemed
                        sorry that Christmas day passed as well as it did.</p>

                    <p>This was once a great thing in the Mountains and bids fair to be so again. We
                        learn that all the watering places are making most extensive preparations to
                        accommodate the seekers of health and pleasure, next Summer. Our energetic
                        friend, J. I. A. Trotter, is now running his stage lines to nearly all of
                        the Springs, and is making arrangements to run to all of them. His stages
                        now run to Lewisburg, and to almost every part of the Mountains, and by the
                        time the travel commences, in April, he will have all the lines
                        re-established. As the Cholera never reached the Mountains of the great
                        Valley, they will offer great inducements to persons forced to leave the
                        cities on the coast.</p>

                    <p>The President's message, enclosing reports on the condition of the South, is
                        very conservative and he expresses himself satisfied with what the South has
                        already done. General Grant agrees with Andrew Johnson, but Sumner and the
                        Radicals say the message and reports are "white-washed" affairs. The war
                        with the Radicals "goes bravely on," but don't be uneasy, for he is master
                        and is certain to win.</p>

                <summary>The paper predicts that President Johnson will win his war with the
                    radicals. He is reportedly pleased with the progress the South has made toward
                    reunion.</summary>
