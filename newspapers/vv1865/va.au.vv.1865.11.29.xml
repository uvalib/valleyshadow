                    <p>Whether the people of this district are represented in the next Congress or
                        not, they may still be proud of the high Constitutional stand they have
                        taken at the election of the Hon. A. H. Stuart. In a recent letter Mr.
                        Stuart expressed his determination to tender his certificate of election and
                        if not accepted, to return home. This is the only dignified and manly
                        course, and we hope there is spirit enough left, even in the "test oath"
                        Congressmen from the South to act with Mr. Stuart in this matter, of such
                        vital importance to the South and to the maintenance of true constitutional
                        principles.</p>

                        >Sentinel</emph>, who has been perambulating through the great Valley,
                        writes that paper the following capital notice of Staunton and some of its
                        enterprising people:</p>
                    <p>"Staunton is rapidly assuming the peace costume. You see it in the increased
                        number of new stores, mechanical establishments and business houses of
                        almost every description. The carpenter's hammer is heard on all hands, and
                        the painter's brush is giving a new face to many of the buildings. Oyster
                        houses, and of course, drinking saloons are also abundant. I took quarters
                        at the America, or Railroad Hotel, now kept by Maj. O'Ferrall, a gentleman
                        formerly of Morgan county, Va., and where he was, some years ago, elected
                        clerk of a court of that county at the early age of eighteen, which gave
                        rise to considerable discussion as to his constitutional or legal
                        eligibility. The American is a good but not grand hotel--the rates three
                        dollars a day. The Virginia Hotel, now the property of Mr. Schaeffer, a very
                        large and elegant establishment, is undergoing a thorough repair, and is
                        consequently not open to the public. No expense seems to be spared in its
                        refinement, and when completed it will be one of the best arranged and most
                        elegant hotels in the Valley of Virginia. The fine railroad depot at this
                        place, destroyed by fire, during the war, has not yet been rebuilt, although
                        it is much needed to protect from depredation and the weather the large
                        quantity of freight arriving here daily. All the calamities of a four years'
                        desolating war cannot, I am aware, be repaired, as it were, in a day.</p>

                    Dean ridicules African American suffrage by pointing out that it would allow
                    blacks to rule over whites in a state that has produced leaders such as Patrick
                    Henry, Lighthorse Harry Lee, Robert E. Lee, and Thomas J. Jackson.</summary>
