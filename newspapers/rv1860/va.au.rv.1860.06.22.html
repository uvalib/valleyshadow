                    <p>Democratic National Convention</p>
                    <p>BALTIMORE, June 18.--The Convention assembled here at [?] o'clock to-day. The
                        Theatre was densely packed. The assemblage was called to order by the Hon.
                        Caleb Cushing. Prayer was offered by the Rev. Dr. McCro--. The President
                        congratulated the Convention on its re-assembling, and expressed the hope
                        that harmony would prevail.</p>
                    <p>The New York delegation introduced a resolution that the claims to seats by
                        delegates from the Cotton States be referred to the Committee on
                        credentials, and that the report of that committee be final, with the
                        understanding that no one be admitted who does not pledge himself to abide
                        by the decision of the Convention, and support the nominees.</p>
                    <p>An hour was spent in discussing points of order and motions to adjourn. The
                        New York delegation . . . [word missing] . . . to sustain the call for the
                        previous question, which was lost.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gilmer, of Pa., offered the following resolution:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the President of this Convention be directed to issue tickets
                        of admission to seats in the Convention to the delegates from the States of
                        Texas, Florida, Mississippi and Arkansas, in which States there are no
                        contesting delegations.</p>
                    <p>The Convention then adjourned 'till 5 o'clock, P. M.</p>
                    <p>The Convention re-assembled at 5 o'clock. The President stated that he had
                        had placed in his hands credentials of gentlemen claiming seats in the
                        Convention from the States of Delaware, Georgia, Alabama, Florida,
                        Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas, including in that . . . [text

                        gentlemen claiming seats from the State of Mississippi, and in addition to
                        that, there has been addressed to the chair a communication from Mr.
                        Chaffee, claiming a seat from the State of Massachusetts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gilmer, for the purpose of arranging difficulties, withdrew his
                        resolution, and asked leave to offer another, embodying the original
                        resolution with an addenda, as follows:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the President of this Convention be authorized to issue
                        tickets of admission to seats in the Convention to the delegates from the
                        States of Arkansas, Texas, Florida and Mississippi, in which States there
                        are no contesting delegations; and that in those States, to wit: Delaware,
                        Georgia, Alabama, and Louisiana, where there are contesting delegations, a
                        committee on credentials shall be appointed by the several delegations to
                        report upon said States.</p>
                    <p>A spirited and able debate was continued up to near nine o'clock. The
                        previous question on the pending resolution and amendments was moved and
                        seconded, when a motion to adjourn until ten o'clock Tuesday morning
                        prevailed.</p>
                    <p>SECOND DAY.--BALTIMORE, June 19.--The Convention met this morning at 10
                        o'clock.</p>
                    <p>The resolutions on the admission of delegates were amended so as to read that
                        the credentials of all persons claiming seats in this Convention, made
                        vacant by the secession of delegates at Charleston, be referred to the
                        committee on credentials.</p>
                    <p>This was adopted under a call for the previous question.</p>
                    <p>The Convention then adjourned until 5 P. M., to await the report of the
                        committee.</p>
                    <p>At 5 o'clock the Convention met pursuant to adjournment, and the Committee on
                        Credentials not being ready to report, adjourned until to-morrow.</p>
                    <p>THIRD DAY.--BALTIMORE, June 20.--The Convention met at five o'clock, and
                        adjourned till ten to-morrow. The Committee on Credentials are still unable
                        to report.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Avery, of North Carolina, Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, and other Southern
                        Delegates, waited on Dean Richmond, Chairman of the New York delegation, to-
                        day, with a proposition to admit all the seceding delegates, with the
                        understanding that no candidate shall be nominated who was voted for at
                        Charleston, thus excluding Douglas, Hunter, Dickinson, Lann, Guthrie, Davis
                        and Johnson, but it is not probable that the proposition will be accepted.</p>
                    <p>There is no foundation for the report that the Douglasites have threatened to
                        withdraw from the Convention under any circumstances.</p>
                    <p>It is rumored that the delay of the report of the Committee will embarrass
                        the Seceders, as the Convention in Richmond is advertised to meet to-morrow.
                        But this is not entitled to credence, as it is known that the President of
                        that Convention, together with the South Carolina delegates and others, are
                        now in Richmond, ready to meet at the appointment of the time, and adjourn
                        from day to day till the rising of the Convention here.</p>
