                    <p>GRAND RECEPTION!</p>
                    <p>THE MASSES IN MOTION! ! !</p>
                    <p>One Hundred Guns Fired! !</p>
                    <p>Last Saturday was a glorious day for the Democracy of Augusta. Agreeably to
                        arrangement, a committee of reception left on the cars on Saturday morning
                        to meet Judge Douglas at Gordonsville, and escort him to Staunton. A large
                        number of persons had assembled at that place, and on the arrival of the
                        Richmond train, Judge Douglas made his appearance on the platform, and was
                        greeted with loud applause. W. F. Gordon, Esq., introduced him to the
                        audience, which Judge D. acknowledged by a few remarks delivered in a
                        conversational tone. On arriving at Charlottesville, between 300 and 500
                        persons had collected at the Depot. W. F. Gordon, Esq., introduced him in a
                        beautiful and eloquent address, and Judge D. responded in a speech of
                        fifteen minutes in length, which breathed a healthy national sentiment, and
                        was frequently applauded. Thence to Staunton, groups of men, women and
                        children were assembled at each Depot to catch a glimpse of the great
                        statesmen and patriot, who, whatever the political difference, they could
                        not withhold from him a tribute of admiration. At Staunton he was met by an
                        immense concourse of people, who anxiously and eagerly awaited his
                        appearance on the platform, while the "deep- mouthed" cannon thundered forth
                        its welcome in an hundred rounds. Judge D. was placed in a carriage which
                        was ready for the occasion, and was escorted to the platform in the
                        Court-yard, by the Staunton Artillery, under the command of its gallant and
                        courteous Captain, J. D. Imboden, Esq., who, forgetting for the present his
                        party association, contributed his share to a cordial welcome to the honors
                        and hospitalities of the city, of our distinguished guest.</p>
                    <p>The largest audience we have ever seen congregated in Staunton, assembled in
                        and around the Court-house yard to see and hear Mr. Douglas. The audience
                        was variously estimated at from 2500 to 3500 persons.--His appearance on the
                        stand was greeted by three tremendous cheers, followed by a general murmur
                        of delight and satisfaction running through the crowd.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Wm. H. Harman welcomed him to the Valley of Virginia, and introduced him
                        to the vast throng in attendance substantially as follows:</p>
                    <p>JUDGE DOUGLAS: I am commissioned by the good people of Augusta, in their name
                        and behalf, to extend to you a most cordial and hearty welcome to the Valley
                        of Virginia; and to assure you of their unaffected appreciation and
                        admiration of your high character, great talents, unswerving devotion to
                        principle, and lofty patriotism.</p>
                    <p>I am not here, sir, as a mere partisan to extend to you the homage of party;
                        but as one of the people, in the name of the people, to give you the
                        assurance which your devotion to the best interest of the <emph
                            rend="italic">whole people</emph> of the Union during the past quarter a
                        century, in so eminent a degree entitle you--the assurance, free, hearty and
                        unqualified, that the people of the Valley of Virginia desire you to enter
                        and be cherished in their homes, as your great qualities of heart and mind
                        are already cherished in their best affections.</p>
                    <p>Sir, the period in the history of our glorious country has arrived when <emph
                            rend="italic">the people</emph> are called upon to arise in their
                        majesty, and under the guidance and leadership of those true, faithful and
                        tried <emph rend="italic">servants</emph>, preserve to themselves and their
                        posterity the priceless inheritance bequeathed them by their Revolutionary
                        ancestry, which has been endangered and put in peril by the wickedness of
                        politicians and placemen who have sought and are seeking to be their
                        masters.</p>
                    <p>To you, sir, all eyes are turned! In this crisis, involving our dearest
                        interests, we have the right to expect, and do expect, of you, the same
                        loyal devotion and self- sacrificing love of our common country which has
                        characterized and distinguished you during your past service in the councils
                        of the nation.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">The people</emph>, guided and directed by the patriotism
                        and wisdom of noble leaders and counsellors, of which I sincerely trust you
                        may be the chief, will roll back the swelling tide of sectionalism and
                        fanaticism which threatens to engulf them-- will preserve in all its fair
                        and beautiful proportions this magnificent republican edifice reared by our
                        fathers.</p>
                    <p>Again I bid you welcome, thrice welcome, to Augusta--to a portion of whose
                        fair daughters and sturdy sons I now have the honor to introduce you.</p>
                    <p>Ladies and fellow-citizens, I have the honor and profound pleasure to
                        introduce you to the great chieftain who has been selected to bear the
                        banner of the National Democracy--America's noblest, most gifted and valiant
                        son--the man whose eloquence inspires the hearts of patriots, and at the
                        sound of whose voice placemen, place-hunters, and spoils-men cower and grow
                        pale--Hon. Stephen A. Douglas, of Illinois.</p>
                    <p>After these remarks, Judge Douglas came forward amidst vociferous cheering.--
                        He thanked the audience for the kind and cordial reception that had been
                        extended him, not only here, but throughout the State of Virginia wherever
                        he had been.-- The proverbial hospitality of Virginians had prepared him to
                        expect a courteous welcome to the hallowed soil of the Old Dominion, but not
                        for the generous greeting that had been extended him everywhere,
                        irrespective of party.</p>
                    <p>He came to compare notes with the people to ascertain whether there was not
                        some common ground upon which all could stand in defense of the Union and
                        the Constitution. He then proceeded to discuss the relations of the Colonies
                        to the mother government, as illustrative of the Territorial doctrines he
                        was advocating. The Colonies did not desire separation from Great
                        Britain--they averred in every petition they could to the mother government,
                        but at the same time demanded the privilege of regulating their own affairs
                        in their own way in respect to their domestic concerns. The first quarrel
                        between the Colonies and Great Britain occurred with Virginia and on the
                        slavery question. Seventy years previous to the Revolutionary war, Virginia
                        demanded that the African slave trade should be restricted; for the reason
                        that the landing of the savage negroes in the midst of the settlements,
                        while the border was lined with Indians, rendered life and property
                        insecure, and hence, the colony of Virginia passed laws unfriendly to the
                        trade, levying heavy penalties upon the importation of slaves. British
                        merchants protested, the King in council issued an order forcing Virginia to
                        have slaves whether she wanted them or not. The struggle continued until
                        1772, when the House of Burgesses of Virginia passed a memorial to the King,
                        setting fourth that if the people of the Colony were not permitted to
                        regulate that institution to suit themselves, His Majesty would lose that
                        portion of his Dominions. The only question was whether an American citizen,
                        under the Constitution, was not entitled to as many privileges in a
                        Territory as was the British subject in the Colonies? If he was not, then it
                        was difficult to tell what was gained by the revolution. The people of a
                        Territory claim what our fathers fought for as their rights in the
                        Colonies--to regulate their own affairs in their own way, under the
                        Constitution. The colonies did not contend that they were sovereign, but
                        that they possessed the inherent right to govern their own affairs.</p>
                    <p>Congress, he argued, could declare war, make peace, raise a revenue, coin
                        money, maintain armies, establish navies, and do all those acts which are
                        federal and not local, but government had no right to interfere between
                        husband and wife, parent and child, or any other matter which is domestic
                        and not federal. The Southerner could go to the Territory with his negro,
                        and be entitled to the same protection under the local laws that the
                        Northerner could have with his property. The first thing to be enquired
                        after was, whether the local laws were friendly to the particular property
                        token there. If they were not, then he would advise the emigrant to go some
                        place else. If a merchant started to the Territory with a supply of liquors
                        and found the Maine liquor law in force, he would be very apt to change his
                        course. So with every other species of property. It was subject to the local
                        law, and that generally represented the sentiment of the people. He here
                        defended at some length the doctrine of the equality of the States and the
                        citizens of the States in the Territories, and contended that Illinois and
                        Virginia had precisely the same privileges, one not more nor less than the
                        other. This doctrine he had defended and would continue to uphold as long as
                        he lived. He was a law-abiding, Constitution- loving man. Each man with his
                        property stood in the Territories upon the same ground, entitled to the same
                        protection and subject to the same restrictions as the other. They were both
                        alike to be governed by the local law.</p>
                    <p>He said that the North-west loved the Union as dearly, if not more so, than
                        the people of Virginia. They were bound by marriage and kindred ties to both
                        North and South, and if this Union should be dissolved, it would be cutting
                        the heart- strings of those who had emigrated to the West, leaving their
                        fathers, mothers, sisters and kindred behind in both sections of the Union.
                        They of the North-west never intended to pay duty at the mouth of the Ohio
                        river in following the waters of the Mississippi to the Gulf. They furnished
                        the waters of the Mississippi, and intended to claim the privilege of
                        navigating it free of duty into the broad ocean. He appealed to all to join
                        in upholding and maintaining the Constitution, and in the assertion and
                        defense of the equal rights of all.</p>
                    <p>He argued that the running of Mr. Breckinridge could have no other effect
                        than to divide the Democratic vote in the Northern States, and thus render
                        the chances of the election of Lincoln more probable.--The friends of Mr.
                        Breckinridge--the bolters from the Baltimore Convention--were therefore, in
                        effect, aiding in bringing about the success of the Black Republican
                        candidate, which he should look upon as a great calamity to the country.</p>
                    <p>He said that he had been asked in Norfolk the other day by the Breckinridge
                        Elector whether he thought the mere election of Lincoln would be cause
                        sufficient to dissolve the Union: He answered, no. Any man who was elected
                        President of the United States by the American people in conformity with the
                        Constitution, must be inaugurated. If, after that, he attempted to make war
                        upon the rights of any State or the citizens of any of the States, he would
                        insist upon enforcing the laws, and hanging him as a traitor to his country
                        ten feet higher than Virginia hung old John Brown.--There was no evil in the
                        Union for which secession was a remedy. If government failed in
                        accomplishing the end for which it was instituted, and became oppressive,
                        there was no sufficient remedy but revolution.--He was maintaining the
                        Constitution and laws of the country at every hazard and against all
                        aggressors--he cared not whether they came from the North or the South.--He
                        would exhaust every resource before he would appeal to the last resort, but
                        if it came to that, he would unite in defending the rights of Virginia as
                        readily as he would those of Illinois.</p>
                    <p>It was a pretty question to ask him whether he would help dissolve the Union
                        in the event of the election of Lincoln, when the secessionists have
                        inaugurated the very steps to accomplish that object in opposing him in the
                        North. They bring about the election of Lincoln, and then ask him if he will
                        not assist them in dissolving the Union because of that result? He answered
                        emphatically, no!</p>
                    <p>As we shall publish hereafter a more extended and connected report of the
                        remarks of the honorable gentleman on the main points of his speech, we have
                        purposely omitted a notice of several less important ideas advance.</p>
                    <p>He concluded his very able, interesting and patriotic speech, by stating that
                        he understood the Hon. Wm. Smith had recently made a speech in this place to
                        a <emph rend="italic">very large</emph> audience. (Mr. Smith had about 150
                        persons to hear him, not one-third of whom will vote for Breckinridge, after
                        notices had been circulated for nearly a week.) In that speech he had read a
                        letter from Mr. Buchanan, which raised a question of veracity between
                        himself and the President. The following is the letter:</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, Aug. 11, 1860.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">My Dear Sir</emph>:</p>
                    <p>I have received your favor of the 8th inst, inclosing a printed extract from
                        the recent speech of Judge Douglas at Concord. You inform me that you expect
                        to be at the Charlottesville Convention, and "would like to know something
                        of the interview referred to in that speech." According to this extract, the
                        Judge states: "The President told me that if I did not obey him and vote to
                        force the Lecompton Constitution upon the people against their will, he
                        would take off the head of every friend I had in office." It is unnecessary
                        to quote the alleged reply of the Judge. Surely there must be some mistake
                        in the report of the speech; because I never held any such conversation with
                        Judge Douglas, nor any conversation affording the least color or pretext for
                        such a statement. It was not in my nature to address such threatening and
                        insulting language to any gentleman. Besides, I have not removed one in ten
                        of his friends, nor one of his relatives. Even among those of his friends
                        who have rendered themselves prominently hostile to the measures of the
                        administration, a majority still remain in office. I might add, that I never
                        held a political conversation with Judge Douglas on this or any other
                        subject, since the day my first annual message was read in the Senate on the
                        8th of December, 1857; and I did not transmit the Kansas Constitution to
                        Congress until the 2d of February, 1858, the question of slavery not having
                        been decided by a vote of the people until 21st December.</p>
                    <p>Now, my dear sir, in writing thus to you I have transgressed a rule which I
                        had prescribed for myself, not to contradict any statements assailing my
                        public conduct and character until after the conclusion of my term of
                        office. A statement, however, comes with such force from a Senator of the U.
                        S. who is one of my constitutional advisers, and this, too, in a published
                        speech delivered by him in his canvass for the highest elective office in
                        the world, that I deem the present case a proper exception.</p>
                    <p>Yours very respectfully,</p>
                    <p>JAMES BUCHANAN.</p>
                    <p>Hon. WM. SMITH.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the point relative to the President's threat to ostracise his
                        friends, he (Douglas) had made the statement in a public speech. The
                        president denies it in a letter to a member of Congress. He could have no
                        controversy with him about the matter. <emph rend="italic">There were no
                            witnesses to the conversation</emph>. As to the other point, that he had
                        not removed his friends, he appealed to the record to contradict the
                        assertion. He had not sought a controversy with the President on these
                        points. The President had forced it upon him by writing him a letter to be
                        read all over the country, and that after he had taken the stump against
                        him. He left the matter to the consideration and verdict of the people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglas here alluded to the charge that he was the "stump candidate." He
                        said the reason which had prevented candidates heretofore from taking the
                        stump was the fear of giving utterance to sentiments in one locality that
                        would lose votes in another. He had no such fear. He had but one sentiment
                        for all the sections of our common country, and could with equal freedom
                        give utterance to them in the North or South, East or West. He declared he
                        was not courting votes for the Presidency. If the people would put down the
                        two sectional parties which are threatening the perpetuity of the
                        Union--rebuke fanaticism both North and South-- he did not care who they
                        made President.</p>
                    <p>He again thanked the audience for their marked attention, and said he should
                        carry back with him to the prairies of Illinois the most grateful
                        recollections of the generous hospitality which had been extended to him by
                        the people of Augusta.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglas was then escorted to the residence of M. G. Harman, Esq., whose
                        guest he was during his stay in the city.--A number of friends dined with
                        him, and at night between three and four hundred of our citizens called to
                        see him. He was serenaded by Turner's Cornet Band, in response to which he
                        made a brief speech, thanking the members of the band, and renewing to the
                        crowd his obligations for the many acts of kindness shown him while in
                        Staunton.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday Judge Douglas was again visited by a number of our citizens, and on
                        Sunday evening, in company with a few friends, left for Harrisonburg, where
                        he met with a most cordial reception and made a speech on Monday.</p>
                    <p>At the close of Judge Douglas' speech on Saturday, Col. Bolling, of
                        Petersburg, in response to repeated calls from the crowd, made a most
                        excellent speech of a half hour's length.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Yost: As I notice in your last paper that you "tender the columns of the
                        Vindicator to those of your party brethren who, following their honest
                        convictions of right, differ from you," I would beg leave to submit the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>Our political history has doubtless never been more interesting than now, and
                        we feel that all who write or speak, either in favor of or against any
                        candidate, or points at issue, should know what he does, so that he may
                        "render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things
                        that are God's."</p>
                    <p>We very well know that many of those who write and speak against Mr.
                        Breckinridge, (Mr. Douglas included) misrepresent him in a great measure,
                        and assert things which they cannot sustain.</p>
                    <p>The Cincinnati platform, upon which Buchanan was nominated in '56, sums up
                        the whole power of the Territories thus:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we recognise the right of the people in the Territories [not
                        the Legislature] whenever the number of their inhabitants justifies it, to
                        form a Constitution with or without slavery, and be admitted into the Union
                        upon terms of perfect equality with the other States.</p>
                    <p>Thus it is defined that the right of the people of a Territory to settle the
                        status of slavery begins only when they begin to form a Constitution, and
                        not before.</p>
                    <p>Now this is what we want, and nothing more. The assertion that we want
                        Congress to legislate slavery into the Territories, (which assertion was
                        also made by Mr. Douglas on last Saturday,) <emph rend="italic">we</emph>
                        unhesitatingly pronounce false and absurd, and ask any man who has ever
                        advanced such an idea, to prove it. We ask Congress to protect the property
                        of all the people in the Territories against unconstitutional legislation,
                        Northern Aid Societies, &amp;c., so that the South may emigrate and have
                        a chance to extend her Territory, and not be encompassed by those who
                        together with the final overwhelming negro population, will crush us out of
                        existence.</p>
                    <p>The Constitution of the U.S. says that Congress shall protect the people and
                        property of all the States wherever its authority extends. Now does not its
                        authority extend into the Territories? And are not slaves property? If so,
                        is not Congress bound by the Constitution of these United States to protect
                        slaveholders and their slaves in all Territories under its authority? This
                        is what we ask, and is the only point upon which we differ from you:
                        consequently, the assertion that we no longer stand upon the Cincinnati
                        Platform--that we are bolters and disunionists--is groundless and
                    foolish.</p>

                <summary>The writer claims that many opponents of Breckinridge, including Douglas,
                    misrepresent his views. The author argues that Breckinridge supporters believe
                    that "the right of the people of a Territory to settle the status of slavery
                    begins only when they begin to form a Constitution, and not before. . . . The
                    assertion that we want Congress to legislate slavery into the Territories . . .
                    we unhesitatingly pronounce false and absurd."</summary>
