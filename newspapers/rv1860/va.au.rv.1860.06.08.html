<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We publish elsewhere a communication from a Democratic friend, who assigns
                        some reasons for differing with the editor of this paper and those in the
                        South who are willing to accept the nomination of Judge Douglas for the
                        Presidency, believing him to be the most available man that can be presented
                        to the American people at this time. The ground over which our correspondent
                        travels is so very familiar to every intelligent reader that we shall not
                        consume time and space by following him through the various stages of the
                        Kansas embroglio, &amp;c. Suffice it to say, that we have never believed
                        Judge Douglas was responsible for the division in the Democratic party. It
                        was a point about which there was no two opinions, that the people of Kansas
                        should regulate their own domestic affairs to suit themselves. This was the
                        express declaration of the Nebraska bill--it was a policy to which the
                        Democratic party and the President were fully committed, and which the whole
                        country was prepared to see carried out. The action of the fraudulently
                        elected Constitutional Convention was designed to defeat this idea, by not
                        submitting unreservedly the Constitution they had framed to the ratification
                        or rejection of the people. Judge Douglas took the position that the
                        Constitution should, without qualification, be submitted to a vote of the
                        people of the Territory, who had to live under it, to accept or reject.--The
                        President endorsed the action of the Convention, and favored the idea of
                        submitting only the slavery clause to the voters of the Territory. This,
                        Judge Douglas contended, was a violation of the spirit and intent of the
                        Nebraska Bill, and the President's own instructions to Governor Walker--that
                        it was forcing upon an unwilling people a system of State government
                        repugnant to their wishes. The sequel showed that Judge Douglas was right
                        and the President wrong. Judge Douglas adhered to the Kansas-Nebraska bill,
                        which was the law of the land, and the President did not. Hence, we assume
                        that the division in the Democratic party is not chargeable to Judge
                        Douglas, upon any assumption of fairness or legitimacy. Any "paralyzation"
                        to the "arm" of the Administration, therefore, is necessarily the fruit of
                        Mr. Buchanan's own action--the offspring of his departure from the declared
                        policy of the Democratic party.</p>
                    <p>The idea that Judge Douglas "dictated" his platform to the Charleston
                        Convention is simply ridiculous, and is not warranted by anything in the
                        whole dispute between Douglas and the Administration. In response to a
                        private letter he wrote a private letter giving his views of what the
                        Democracy should do and what he was willing to do. Any other man thus
                        written to, and occupying a similar position, would have answered as he did.
                        His letter was published, and this fact is to be construed into a
                        "dictation" to the Charleston Convention! There is about as much justice in
                        this charge as in many others preferred against Judge Douglas, all of which
                        are without the least foundation in fact.</p>
                    <p>The assumption of our correspondent that Judge Douglas tendered the "squatter
                        sovereignty" issue to the South 12 months ago, is unsustained by the history
                        of the Territorial question. Judge Douglas has tendered no new issue. He
                        stands precisely where every prominent Democrat stood in 1856, asserting and
                        maintaining with singular ability and force the great doctrine of
                        non-intervention by Congress with slaver in the Territories, and insisting
                        that the country is pledged to this policy by all that is binding in
                        legislation and obligatory by solemn compact. He plants himself upon the
                        legislative compromise of 1850 and 1854, and the Democratic platforms of
                        1852 and 1856--legislation and platforms suggested and demanded by the
                        South, and to which she is honorably bound to adhere. Any departure from it,
                        is a violation of ratified terms of agreement and the initiatory step to the
                        tearing up of the compromises upon which the perpetuity of our government is
                        based. Mr. Douglas and his friends do not insist upon an empty abstraction,
                        as insinuated by our correspondent. They resist the attempt to force upon
                        the Democratic party a new test of orthodoxy, which is inexpedient in policy
                        and speculative in fact. They resist, and rightly do so, the imposing upon
                        the Northern Democracy an issue which cannot fail to crush them hopelessly.
                        They are now recovering partially from the blow they received in 1854 in the
                        passage of the Nebraska bill, repealing the legislation of 1820, which
                        discriminated against the South. They fought for our cause then and were
                        beaten. The sober second thought of the people, however, has induced many to
                        return to the Democratic party, and if no new test is presented, by which
                        the Northern mind can be inflamed by the appeals of the Black Republican
                        party against the Democracy, they will again triumph, and restore the
                        Democracy to the power which she lost by defending the demands and the
                        rights of the South in 1854. The popular mind is now settled down upon the
                        policy of non-intervention and popular sovereignty--a policy advocated and
                        enforced by the South--and to re- open the agitation of this subject will be
                        suicidal to our friends at the North, and a virtual dismemberment of the
                        Democratic party. Judge Douglas is firm in his maintenance of the fixed
                        position of the Democratic party, and any action contemplating a departure
                        from that position must come from those who are desirous of breaking up our
                        present organization and destroying that basis of national fraternization
                        which has been so significantly endorsed by the American people.</p>
                    <p>There may be an honest difference of opinion in regard to Mr. Douglas'
                        availability. We are firmly convinced, that as parties now stand, Mr.
                        Douglas is decidedly the most available man the Democracy can present to the
                        people. Our correspondent thinks not. We believe Douglas, if nominated at
                        Baltimore, will carry nearly every Northern State that voted for Pierce in
                        1852, as well as every one of the Middle States.--We believe he is the only
                        man who can beat Lincoln in the North-west. Other persons may differ with
                        us, however. He carried Illinois in 1856 over Mr. Lincoln, and can do it
                        again, notwithstanding the doubts to the contrary of our correspondent. He
                        gained in Lincoln's own county 750 votes, and carried the county. There was
                        no summing up of the popular vote as between Douglas and Lincoln. It is only
                        assumed by the opponents of Douglas that Lincoln received a larger popular
                        vote than Douglas, because the combined votes of the Know Nothings, Black
                        Republicans and Administration Democrats, was larger for State Treasurer and
                        Superintendent of Public Schools than that cast for the regular Democratic
                        ticket. Even this was effected by running the opposition ticket in the
                        Southern part of the State, where Black Republicanism was unpopular, as Know
                        Nothings and opposed to Lincoln, and in the Northern part, as Abolitionists.
                        In the Southern part of the State, the Opposition candidates, who were
                        leading Fillmore Know-Nothings, disclaimed the support of Lincoln; and by
                        such management and combination, assisted by all the power and influence of
                        the Administration, the regular Democratic candidates for State Treasurer
                        and Superintendent of Public Schools, were defeated by a small majority.
                        Douglas, however, carried the Legislature and was elected to the U. S.
                        Senate over Lincoln and the Administration both, which is sufficient to
                        justify us in the assertion that he can do it again.</p>
                    <p>The extract which we publish at the request of our correspondent, from the
                        speech of Mr. Butler, of Mass., is a tissue of misstatements from beginning
                        to end. Our correspondent terms Butler a Douglas delegate, sent by a Douglas
                        constituency.-- Mr. Butler was elected as a Douglas Democrat, but on his
                        arrival at Washington city it was discovered that he was a traitor in the
                        camp, and would avail himself of the most opportune time to stab Douglas.
                        His delegation, believing him to be treacherous, refused to make him its
                        Chairman. Their suspicions were just, for at the very moment his vote would
                        have served Douglas, by giving him a majority, he asked to have it changed;
                        and after that voted for Jeff. Davis, who at no time received over one vote.
                        This shows how far Butler was actuated by honest motives in declaring
                        himself for Douglas before he was appointed to Charleston. He wars upon his
                        face the marks of a dishonest man, and all the apologies man could offer for
                        him, could never relieve him of the stamp of meanness which nature has
                        written all over his countenance.</p>
                    <p>The assertion that the adoption of any rule was made the condition of the
                        Middle State remaining in the Convention is simply untrue. Virginia had made
                        no provision for dissolving her connection with the Convention, and did not
                        intend to, notwithstanding the blatant threats of one or two members of the
                        delegation. The assertion that Douglas was not the choice of a majority of
                        the whole electoral vote, is simply untrue. The unit vote operated in his
                        favor in New York, and against him in several other States. In Ohio and
                        Indiana there was not a single delegate against him, and Mr. Butler
                        falsifies the history of the Convention when he asserts that there
                        were--Even if there had been, as there were in New York, the unit vote was
                        simply carrying out the instructions of their constituents, and it is not
                        legitimate to assume that the majority cast was not bona
                            fide, when it was done in obedience to instructions from the
                        creators of the delegations. In Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas,
                        Kentucky and Louisiana, and perhaps other States, there were Douglas
                        delegates who did not vote for him on account of either of the unit vote or
                        of instructions--enough to have overbalanced the votes which were per se against him in the New York delegation.--Is
                        it fair to take from him in the one instance, and not give to him in the
                        other?--He went to the Convention to betray Douglas, and did so. We have
                        before us a history of his entire manoeuvring, both at home and at
                        Charleston, and we can draw no other inference from it, than that Mr. Butler
                        is an unprincipled politician.</p>
                    <p>The best evidence we can adduce to sustain the assumption that the delegates
                        to Charleston who seceded did not represent their constituents, is the fact
                        that public meetings are being held in every one of the States whose
                        delegates left the Convention, denouncing their action, and insisting on
                        being represented at Baltimore. If they did represent their constituents,
                        then those constituents are faithless to the compromises of the Democratic
                        party entered into at the solicitation and upon their demand.--They are
                        false to the solemn promises made both in word and act, and untrue to every
                        obligation that a fair and legitimate contract imposes.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the action of the delegates from this District to Charleston, we
                        have but a few words in reply to our correspondent.</p>
                    <p>We never assumed that Mr. Douglas was the first choice of the Democracy of
                        this District--that he was preferred to Mr. Hunter or Mr. Wise previous to
                        the meeting of the Charleston Convention. We assumed that if there was no
                        chance for the nomination of one of Virginia's distinguished sons, then Mr.
                        Douglas was their choice. We believe so yet, and the more so since the
                        recent meeting in Rockingham endorsing the action of Dr. Moffett and Mr.
                        Yost at Charleston, and the frequent and extensive intercourse we have had
                        with the people since our return from Charleston. We believe--in fact we
                        know--that in the present condition of political affairs, Mr. Douglas is now
                        decidedly the choice of the Democracy of the Tenth Legion District, and it
                        is our purpose at Baltimore to endeavor to represent that choice. We have
                        assumed, and now assume, that we represented the District at Charleston.
                        There has been no expression of dissatisfaction with the course we pursued
                        there, save by three or four persons immediately in the vicinity of
                        Staunton. We have been all the time perfectly willing to meet those
                        gentlemen before a full meeting of the Democracy of the county, and test the
                        matter, provided they would call such meeting, confident that we would be
                        fully and almost unanimously sustained.--These gentlemen, and among them our
                        correspondent, have not seen proper to call the meeting, for reasons
                        doubtless satisfactory to themselves. Hence, until the contrary is shown, we
                        contend that we have fully and fairly represented the District.</p>

                    <p>It will be seen by a communication in another column, that the members of the
                        M.E. Church in Staunton are dissatisfied with the action of the General
                        Conference on the subject of slavery, and that a Convention is suggested of
                        the laity and ministry of the Baltimore Conference. We give below a
                        palliating version of the action of the Convention, to which, however, we do
                        not subscribe. It is taken from a correspondence of the Baltimore Sun. We
                        will discuss this matter more fully hereafter:</p>
                    <p>"The report of the majority as adopted is as follows: "We believe that the
                        buying, selling, holding or using of human beings as chattels is contrary to
                        the laws of God and nature, inconsistent with the Golden Rule, and with that
                        rule in the discipline which requires all who desire to remain among us to
                        do not harm, and to avoid evil of every kind.' Subsequent to the adoption of
                        the above, a resolution was passed declaring the aforegoing as only
                        'advisory' and 'not bearing the force of law.' In other words, the whole
                        chapter of the Discipline upon the subject of slavery has been stricken from the statutes of the church; and
                        while it declares now in so many words that it has no law operating as such
                        on its membership upon the subject of slavery, the church gives such advice
                        and admonition in the Discipline as it deems salutary on this subject. Law
                        has give place to 'admonition,' and such and no more is the result of this
                        long and troublesome agitation."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"For the Vindicator."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:Permit me, a sincere well-wisher of the Democratic party, through
                        your columns, to offer a few ideas which have presented themselves to my
                        mind in connection with the Charleston Convention and its unfortunate
                        disruption.</p>
                    <p>It seems to be a growing belief in this neighborhood, and you, sir, I am
                        sorry to see, are laboring (honestly, no doubt) to crate the impression that
                        the opponents of squatter sovereignty and its great embodiment were mainly
                        instrumental in bringing about that result, so much to be deplored by ever
                        democrat and lover of his country.</p>
                    <p>I take issue with you on this point, and will endeavor to state as concisely
                        as possible my reasons, "for the faith which is within me."</p>
                    <p>In the first place, some two years ago, Judge Douglas entered into a bitter
                        feud with a Democratic administration, which has made useless all its
                        measures, paralyzed its arm, and withal proved the "direful spring of woes
                        unnumbered' to the Democratic party. I will not stop to enquire who was
                        right or wrong in that struggle; I will not attempt to judge between
                        Lecompton and anti-Lecompton, but will only express my curiosity to know how
                        the gentleman who pressed Congress to go behind and reverse the action of a
                        Convention of an inchoate State reconciles that position with his present
                        rampant, non-intervention views. Again, some twelve months ago, Mr. Douglas
                        with an arrogance heretofore unheard of in an aspirant for the Democratic
                        Presidential nomination, presumed to dictate his
                        platform to the party, kindly consenting to rule over us for the next four
                        years in accordance with those views, but stoutly refusing the nomination if
                        the Convention in its insolent disregard of the self-constituted dictator of
                        the Democracy should decide to frame a 'slave code' for the territories, as
                        he sneeringly denominated congressional intervention for the protection of
                        slave property in the territories.</p>
                    <p>Thus we see that two years ago, Judge Douglas for trifling cause, divided and
                        distracted the Democratic party (for whether the Kansas Lecompton
                        constitution was just or unjust, whether Congress had a right to interfere
                        and disregard and reverse the action of a legally constituted Convention for
                        the framing of a State Constitution or not, the admission of Kansas under
                        that Constitution would have resulted in injury to no one, for if
                        distasteful to the people, it could be changed by the popular vote at any
                        time.) And we also see that twelve months before the meeting of the
                        Charleston Convention, Mr. Douglas had presented the squatter sovereignty
                        issue to the South fairly and squarely, and fairly and squarely we had to
                        meet it or surrender everything.</p>
                    <p>Again: The Democracy North and South have agreed that when a territory
                        proposed to enter the Union as a State, it had a right to establish or
                        prohibit slavery as a majority of its people chose. When then in the name of
                        expediency, in the name of common sense, in the name of the harmony of the
                        Democratic party and the country, does Mr. Douglas persist in vesting the
                        territorial legislature with a power which we are all agreed the
                        constitutional convention of the territory is clothed?</p>
                    <p>But Mr. Douglas and his friends, especially those who vegetate South of Mason
                        and Dixon's line, assume to treat the whole question as an empty
                        abstraction, of no practical effect either for or against the South; either
                        for [or] against the North. So much the worse for them,
                            so much the more heinous their sin. How dare they force a useless
                        and abstract question of no practical importance upon the Democracy,
                        destructing the party even to disruption and threatening the Union? What
                        excuse will they give to this and succeeding generations for thus wantonly
                        sacrificing the only National party, for thus madly jeopardizing the
                        existence of the most beautiful system of government the world has ever
                        seen?</p>
                    <p>The difference between us of the South and Mr. Douglas and his friends, is
                        that we are willing to disband the Democratic party--to burst the bonds
                        which bind these States in Union--to shake this Government for turret to
                        foundation, in defense of a principle which we believe to be of vital importance to the South and its institutions,
                        and in opposition to a policy which in our
                        opinion is pregnant with the doom of our section, which they are
                        ready to sever the Democratic party--to endanger the Union--to subvert the
                        Constitution (for many of them, yourself among the number, acknowledge that
                        the opinion of the Supreme Court expressed extra judicially, is with us)
                        upon an issue which they themselves have pronounced an empty and miserable
                        abstraction.</p>
                    <p>But my principle object, in writing this article was to combat the (in my
                        opinion) erroneous idea of Mr. Douglas' availability, which seems to be his
                        tower of strength in the South. In the Convention we learn from a speech of
                        the Hon. B.F. Butler, of Massachusetts, a Douglas
                            Democrat, representing a Douglas constituency, that the bare
                        majority of Mr. Douglas was 'more apparent than real."</p>
                    <p>In regard to his strength before the people, we have the stubborn fact
                        staring us in the face, of six Democratic States seceding from the
                        Convention and declaring their determination no to support a squatter
                        sovereign man on a squatter sovereign platform. I know it has become the
                        fashion for the Douglas men to affirm that the seceding delegations did not
                        represent their constituency! What more right have you, sir, to say that
                        those instructed gentlemen who seceded in
                        obedience to their instructions, did not represent their constituency, than
                        they have to say that you and your colleague, who if instructed at all,
                        acted in conflict with your instructions, did not represent your people. No,
                        sir, those delegates did represent the people who sent them to the
                        Convention! It is hardly probable that one
                        District Convention should be so packed as to send delegates to a National
                        Convention to misrepresent the sentiment of the people of the district,--it
                        is hardly possible that a whole State should do such violence to the people as to
                        misrepresent them in Convention but it is too much for human credulity to
                        believe the remarkable coincidence of six States misrepresenting their
                        people at Charleston! If you convince me of the existence of this monstrous
                        fact, then I am convinced that Conventions are stupendous fraud on the pole,
                        wrong in theory and infamous in practice. But I think it will not be denied
                        by any candid man that those States which seceded are uncompromisingly
                        opposed to Douglas and squatter sovereignty. Then where is his strength? It
                        cannot be in the other Southern States,, for though a large majority of the
                        Democratic party will sustain him if nominated, yet there is a respectable
                        minority, sufficient I firmly believe, in many Democratic States to turn the
                        scale against him.</p>
                    <p>Will he carry many of the Northern States which went for Fremont in '56? I
                        think not. Will he with his low tariff vows, find favor with the iron
                        interest of Pennsylvania? That too, I think, is doubtful.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, can he carry Democratic Illinois? If reasoning from the past is
                        legitimate, I can hardly doubt every candid mind will decide that the
                        chances are against him; in '59, in the midst of the Lecompton excitement,
                        when the whole North welcomed him as its great Democratic champion (and when
                        too he first distinctly affirmed his squatter theory to sweet to Northern
                        palates,) when he had an opportunity to bring all his tremendous powers as a
                        popular debater and stump orator to bear on the canvass, he was beaten
                        before the people by a majority of five thousand.
                        Besides the facts which I have cited, there is an administration party not
                        to be despised in every Northern State, justly incensed with Judge Douglas
                        and uncompromisingly opposed to his aspirations.</p>
                    <p>After this brief and imperfect survey of the field, I ask is the nomination
                        of Mr. Douglas expedient? As this article is already longer than I had
                        intended, but I cannot conclude without adverting to one other subject,
                        which more nearly concerns this district.</p>
                    <p>You have given two reasons why you and your colleague determined to break the
                        unity of the Virginia delegation at Charleston, 1st because you believed
                        Judge Douglas to be the real choice of your constituency. 2d because the
                        unit system bore oppressively upon Western Virginia. For your former reason
                        if it be true, as you believe that Mr. Douglas is the choice of hits
                        district, you acted very inconsistently in pleading yourself before the
                        District Convention to vote for Mr. Hunter as long as any chance of his
                        nomination remained, and for your second, pardon me if I assert that to
                        establish the existence of the fact, you have brought no particle of proof
                        or argument.</p>
                    <p>But let the facts be as they may let me ask shall the unity of the Virginia
                        Delegation be broken for the purpose of placing the most distinguished
                        district of the Commonwealth--the renowned Tenth Legion--prominently before
                        the country in opposition to what many, very many, Southern statesmen
                        believe to be the best interests of this section? Shall all the ancient
                        usages and land marks of the Virginia Democracy be swept away for the
                        purpose of forcing down the throat of a reluctant and protesting South a
                        platform and man peculiarly obnoxious to her? I am sure if the voice of the
                        gallant Democracy of this district could be fairly heard they would answer
                        emphatically in the negative.</p>
