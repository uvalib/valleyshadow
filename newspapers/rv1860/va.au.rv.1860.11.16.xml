                <transcript>
                    <p>Census of Augusta County.</p>
                    <p>We are indebted to Robt. W. Burke, one of the Deputy Marshals to take the
                        census, for the following census returns of this county: Whole population,
                        27, 705, of which 5, 553 are slaves, and 569 free negroes.--As compared with
                        the census of 1850, these figures show an increase of 8, 152, of which 300
                        are slaves. It will thus be seen that notwithstanding the plaintive appeals
                        of demagogues as to the decrease of slave population in Virginia, here in
                        Augusta county there has been really an increase. We believe, further, that
                        in Western Virginia, notwithstanding the extensive trade in this species of
                        property, the result will exhibit that we have more slaves than in 1850.</p>

                    <p>The Meeting To-Morrow.</p>
                    <p>We are decidedly of the opinion that the meeting called to-morrow is
                        premature.--We should await any demonstration counter to disunion until we
                        see something tangible to strike at. The times require calm deliberation,
                        and well matured and well digested action. Let us see precisely the ground
                        upon which we stand, and have fully developed the purposes of the
                        refractory, before we initiate any policy. The vote of Augusta is the most
                        potent rebuke to secession that could possibly be given. We should be
                        content with that for the present.</p>

                <commentary>Vindicator recommends this article as "embracing the true idea."</commentary>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Sound Advice.</p>
                    <p>The Richmond Whig of the 13th inst., has the following sound "Suggestions to
                        the People of Virginia." We think they embrace the true idea, and we
                        recommend them to the consideration of our readers:</p>
                    <p>Now that the Presidential contest is over, and has resulted adversely to the
                        wishes and the interests of the Southern people, it behooves the people of
                        Virginia, in our judgement, to preserve a "masterly inactivity" for the
                        present. We throw out this suggestion, not as partizans, but as Virginians,
                        devoted to the rights and honor of the Commonwealth, and looking with an eye
                        single to the maintenance of her rights and honor at any cost.</p>
                    <p>In a word, let the true and patriotic people of Virginia, instead of
                        indulging in hasty committals, or adopting any rash and ill-advised policy,
                        patiently and dignifiedly await the development of events. Let there be no
                        passion, no excitement, no wildness on the part of any of us, either in view
                        of what is already passed or in view of the probabilities of the future. The
                        action of Virginia should at all times--and especially in critical times
                        like these--be calm, deliberate and enlightened. There is neither wisdom nor
                        patriotism <emph rend="italic">in haste</emph>, in a conjuncture like the
                        present. The threatening aspect of affairs certainly demands the serious and
                        deliberate reflection of us all; and, therefore, let none of us be in a
                        hurry--let none of us be driven or seduced into rash committals or
                        precipitate action.</p>
                    <p>This is our opinion as to the course Virginians should pursue under existing
                        circumstances. In the course of a few weeks, or months at farthest, we shall
                        be prepared to look the times squarely and intelligently in the face, and
                        determine our course of action, <emph rend="italic">as Virginians</emph>, if
                        any action should be deemed necessary. In short, let the people of Virginia
                        be quiet and calm for some time to come.</p>
