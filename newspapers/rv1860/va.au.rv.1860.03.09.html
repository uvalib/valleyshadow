                        to edify the Senate with his eloquence, and it is to be surmised that he
                        will continue to do so until some impertinence on his part induces another

                    <p>Baltimore Conference.</p>
                    <p>The following extract of the proceedings of the Baltimore Conference, just
                        held at Winchester; we take from the Baltimore American. That clause in the
                        Methodist Discipline relating to slavery has elicited in the last few
                        months, much comment, but holding as we do, to the doctrine of religious
                        tolerance, in its highest and strictest sense, we have hitherto studiously
                        avoided writing anything which might have the appearance of interfering with
                        the internal affairs of a religious denomination; but we cannot refrain from
                        expressing, here, our proud satisfaction that these petitions emanated from
                        the Valley of Virginia, and our earnest hope that their suggestions and
                        reasoning may have such powerful weight with the General Conference as to
                        induce that body to assert that this appearance
                        of hostility to the institutions of Virginia shall no longer exist;</p>
                    <p>The Bishop here presented to the Conference memorials from the following
                        places: Blacksburg circuit, East Rockingham circuit, Staunton station,
                        August circuit, Churchville circuit, Lexington station, and Rockbridge
                        circuit. The memorials refer to the slavery
                        question and refer to the unpleasant and unjust position in which
                        they are placed, it being asserted by the Southern church that they are
                        tainted with Abolitionism, whilst the Northern branch of the Church, with
                        which they are connected, give grounds for these charges, in the fact that
                        they are constantly declaring that the Baltimore Conference is entirely
                        agreed with the Northern church in their intense hatred of slavery, but are
                        prevented through policy from declaring such
                        hostility.</p>
                    <p>The memorialists say they have full confidence in the soundness of the
                        members of the Baltimore Conference, and will remember through life the kind
                        lessons of religious instruction received at their hands. These charges have
                        however weakened the effectiveness of the Church and are daily growing more
                        intolerable. The New York Christian Advocate is referred to, and its
                        sentiments on the slavery question declared, by the memorialists, to be
                            odious. The memorial concludes with an appeal
                        to the Baltimore Conference to come out from the Northern abolition branch
                        of the Methodist Episcopal Church, whose principles are in direct conflict
                        with the ministers and members of the Methodist Church in Virginia, and
                        declares that on the action of the Conference depends the prospect of the
                        Church in the Valley.</p>
                    <p>Rev. E. P. Phelps moved that a committee of seven, one from each district, be
                        appointed by the Bishop, to consider the memorial, to which the committee be
                        added one Steward from each district.</p>
                    <p>Rev. D. Thomas said this was an important question, and should receive the
                        greatest consideration. He moved an amendment to the resolution of Mr.
                        Phelps. The amendment proposed the election by the Conference of four
                        members from each district to form the committee. The amendment was voted
                        down and the resolution of Mr. Phelps adopted. At another stage of the
                        session Bishop Simpson announced the committee, composed of the following
                        ministers and laymen: Rev. John Bear, A. Griffith, S. Register, J. Lanahan,
                        G. N. Davis, Garner M. Goheen, A. Buhrman; Laymen, Col. J. S. Berry, J. S.
                        Carson, A. L. Pitzer, P. Conway, R. Rickets, P. Herring and H. Stewart.</p>
                    <p>The introduction of the memorials created considerable excitement, and it is
                        understood great efforts were made to prevent them from coming before the
                        body. Much interest is expressed this evening as to the character of the
                        report, which will be made on them some time to-morrow. It is thought if the
                        Committee fails to recommend some action, the churches embraced in the
                        Rockingham, Roanoke and Lewisburg Districts will take immediate steps
                        towards a separation. If these districts determine to secede then the
                        strength of the Baltimore Conference in Virginia will have departed, as
                        these districts embrace the greatest portion of the territory held by them.</p>
                    <p>Conference then proceeded to select place for the meeting of the next Annual
                        Conference. Staunton, Lewisburg and Fayette Street Station were put in
                        nomination. Staunton received 97 votes, and 40 were cast against it, and it
                        was declared chosen as the next place of meeting.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Correspondence of the Vindicator.</p>
                    <p>Richmond, Mar. 6, 1860.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--Never has the subject of the
                        Internal Improvement policy of Virginia been more thoroughly or more able
                        discussed than it has been during the session of the Legislature which is
                        now near its close.</p>
                    <p>The State being fairly committed to the main and leading lines of Improvement
                        by appropriations heretofore made, every consideration of State policy,
                        honor and credit required such appropriation as would insure their
                        completion at the earliest possible period. The sooner these works cease to
                        be charges upon the Treasury, certainly, the better. Some of them perhaps
                        had better never had been commenced. Competition in ordinary business
                        pursuits, sustained by individual enterprise, is productive of good.
                        Monopolies ought not to be encouraged. But should the State enter into
                        competition with herself, advantages might not be easily cyphered [sic] out.
                        But let the results be as they may, Virginia is fairly embarked in a system
                        of Internal Improvements. It is too late now to stop to count the cost. A
                        great highway will be opened up from the Atlantic to the waters of the
                        Ohio--Kanawha and Tide water will then shake hands. Marts of trade will
                        spring up within our own borders. We shall become a more homogenous people,
                        and Virginia will be, within herself, an Empire.</p>
                    <p>If these Improvements be estimated as a means of direct profit, such profit
                        may not be realized. But as a means of developing the resources of the
                        commonwealth, increasing its material wealth, power and prosperity, giving a
                        stimulus to industrial pursuits, infusing a spirit of energy among the
                        people, the results are beyond computation.</p>
                    <p>No response has as yet been given to the request of South Carolina, made
                        through her Commissioner, the Hon. C. G. Memminger. The opponents of a
                        Southern conference, hold up the disunion proclivities of South Carolina as
                        a scare-crow, and induce the belief that South Carolina, would, as it were,
                        with a disunion hook, fasten upon old Virginia and drag her out of the
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>A bill is now under discussion in the House of Delegates, which provides that
                        a special license, with an additional tax, shall be attained, for the sale
                        of certain articles therein specified, manufactured, outside the limits of
                        Virginia. It is advocated as a means of retaliation against the unfriendly
                        legislation of the non-slaveholding States. The speeches for and against
                        this bill are numerous and long. The votes in its favor will be few. This
                            cure which the political doctors prescribe
                        for the disease with which the body politic is afflicted, is considered to
                        be far worse than the disease itself. The accumulated mass of business that
                        is before the Legislature is unprecedented. As an evidence of this, it may
                        be stated, that before a single one of the ten standing committees of the
                        House of Delegates, more than three hundred propositions were submitted for
                        consideration. And about nine hundred bills are now before the two Houses of
                        the Legislature to be acted upon. There is a fault somewhere--either the
                        time is too short or there is too much legislation. The session has been
                        extended until the 13th inst.</p>
                    <p>The expenses directly and indirectly which have grown out of the Harper's
                        Ferry invasion are not yet certainly known. The immediate agents in this
                        unholy crusade will soon have all been brought to condign [sic] punishment.
                        But the more remote but no less responsible actors have not been reached.
                        But a just retribution, sooner or later, will most certainly overtake them.
                        History teems with evidence on this point. "Be wise therefore O, ye judges
                        of the earth."</p>
                    <p>Yours, truly,</p>
                    <p>MOUNTAINEER</p>
