<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Charleston Convention.</p>
                    <p>The announcement that the hotel keepers of Charleston would raise the board
                        to $5 a day, during the session of the Democratic National Convention, has
                        created great and just indignation throughout the country. It is certainly
                        the most palpable attempt at gouging and legal swindling on record. The
                        press of the country have suggested various modes of avoiding the necessity
                        of submitting to this unheard of and inhospitable extortion. The only one at
                        all feasible, is the suggestion that the visitors should eschew the hotels,
                        and sleep and eat on board of the steamers on the wharf.--This, we fear,
                        would be impracticable, on account of the limited facilities for
                        accommodating, on a short notice, so vast a multitude, some idea of which
                        can be formed from the fact that the delegation from Illinois alone will
                        number one thousand.</p>
                    <p>The National Central Committee have been seriously considering the expediency
                        of changing the place for the holding of the Convention from Charleston to
                        Baltimore. We would be heartily glad if the Central Committee should
                        discover that it has the power to make this change.</p>
                    <p>The report that the place of meeting of the Convention is to be changed from
                        Charleston to Baltimore, has created much excitement in the former city.
                        Some of the Charleston papers intimate that although Baltimore, or any other
                        city be chosen as the place of meeting, the Southern delegates will
                        assuredly assemble in that city, and proceed to nominate candidates for
                        President and Vice President.</p>
