                    <p>The Master-Spirit of the Charleston Secessionists.</p>
                    <p>The re-production of the notorious "Scarlet Letter" in our columns yesterday,
                        is producing a profound sensation here in sober-minded circles. Its
                        appearance has furnished a key to the unsuspecting, of the attempt at
                        Charleston to demoralize the integrity of the Democracy. The disaffection of
                        Alabama, as represented by Mr. Yancey and Mr. Walker, was assuredly
                        premeditated, if it was not studiously pre-arranged. The delegates seem to
                        have gone to the convention for no other purpose than to sow the seeds of
                        dissension in an heretofore harmonious body. This is manifest, as will be
                        seen by the extract below from a letter written by the latter to a brother
                        of Senator Clay, on the 7th of June, 1859, in answer to the three following
                        questions:</p>
                    <p>"1st. Is it the duty of Congress to intervene for the protection of slavery
                        in the United States?</p>
                    <p>"2nd. Are you in favor of a repeal of the laws of Congress, which declares
                        the foreign slave trade to be . . . [text missing]?</p>
                    <p>"3rd. What position should Southern Democracy assume in the Charleston
                        Convention?"</p>
                    <p>In the concluding paragraphs of his letter, Mr. Walker says:</p>
                    <p>"In answer, first--we should insist upon adopting a platform before making
                        the nominations. 2nd,--This platform must embody the first of the foregoing
                        propositions, and should embrace, in principle, the second, also--3d,--If
                        the first of these propositions--viz: protection of slavery in the
                        territories, is not adopted, the South should withdraw from the convention,
                        and make its own nominations, and enunciate a platform of principles
                        consistent with the dignity of sovereign States and the great right of
                        self-protection. In adopting this course, we must expect defections from our
                        own ranks. Old Saturn himself never devoured his offsprings with more
                        faculty and apparent relish, than do some men of their opinions and
                        professions, for the sake of the emoluments and honors of office; forgetting
                        that, in after life, the recollections of their treachery will remain only
                        like demons upon that memory, to taunt them with the cost at which they
                        purchased them. But our ranks will be reinforced by the good men and true of
                        what is now called the 'Opposition.' And I, for one, will hail them as
                        brothers, whatever may have been their antecedents. When the South is
                        beleaguered by enemies, at home as well as abroad, let us remember the
                        Christian precept, "Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex
                        Ephraim."</p>
                    <p>"We have a mission to fulfil, 'ennobled by its danger, and purified by its
                        isolation,' and we may well afford to cultivate that Corinthian spirit in
                        which each one is allowed to have a doctrine, or an interpretation of his
                        own, upon questions and issues having no present importance, but long since
                        buried in the Past.</p>
                    <p>With this spirit, let the crisis come!</p>
                    <p>Be bold, united, firmly set,</p>
                    <p>Nor flinch in word or tone;</p>
                    <p>We'll be a glorious people yet--</p>
                    <p>Redeemed--erect--alone!</p>
                    <p>I am, very respectfully,</p>
                    <p>Your obedient servant,</p>
                    <p>L. P. WALKER.</p>
                    <p>J. WITHERS CLAY, Esq."</p>
                    <p>It must be borne in mind that Mr. Walker, the ardent coadjutor and
                        collaborator of Mr. Yancey, was the chairman of the Alabama delegation--the
                        first delegation that ever seceded from a Democratic convention.</p>
                    <p>Is Delaware, or Maryland, or Virginia, or North Carolina, or Tennessee, or
                        Kentucky, or Missouri, or Arkansas, or Texas, or Louisiana, or Mississippi,
                        or Florida, or Georgia, or South Carolina, or even a considerable portion of
                        the citizens of Alabama, prepared to coalesce with such wild disorganizing
                        spirits? No, a thousand times no; we will undertake to say will be the
                        prompt and definite answer of each. Let them stand resolutely shoulder to
                        shoulder in the irrepressible conflict which is to be determined in
                        November, and, if Sewardism shall be triumphant, there will then be an
                        inseverable bond of union between the Democracy of the North and the South
                        sufficiently strong to efficiently protect the latter against Abolition
                        aggressions. The patriotic men of the slaveholding States desire nothing
                        more than this. Factionists cannot persuade or frighten them into a change
                        of this true policy.--Washington States.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Methodist General Conference.</p>
                    <p>From the proceedings of the General Conference of the M.E. Church, on the
                        12th, now in session at Buffalo, N.Y., we take the following:</p>
                    <p>The report on the slavery question has been agreed upon, and it said they
                        will report the following general rule:</p>
                    <p> Q--What shall be done for the extirpation of the evil of slavery.</p>
                    <p>A--We declare that [we] are as much as ever convinced of the great evil of
                        slavery, and we believe that the buying, selling, or holding of human beings
                        as chattels is contrary to the laws of God and nature, inconsistent with the
                        Golden Rule and with that rule in our discipline which requires [illegible]
                        desire to continue among [illegible] "do no harm" and to "avoid evil of
                        every kind." We therefore affectionately admonish all our preachers and
                        people to keep themselves pure from this great evil, and to seek its
                        extirpation by all lawful and christian means.</p>
                    <p>This report is said to have received the sanction of thirty one of
                        forty-seven members of the committee.</p>
                    <p>It is much to be regretted that any ecclesiastical body has so far departed
                        from the legitimate sphere of its legislation, as to intrude itself into the
                        political arena, and thus sectionalize and damage a great moral and
                        religious enterprise. The Methodist Discipline assumes a postulate which, in
                        our belief, is erroneous in ethic and unconstitutional in theory, when it
                        brands slavery as an evil, and intimates that it
                            can be "extirpated," in propounding the
                        question, "what shall be done for the extirpation of the evil of slavery?"
                        That slavery is purely a political question is sufficiently attested by the
                        early legislation of the country, and its recognition as such in the Federal
                        Constitutional itself. The separation of Church
                        from State was a cardinal consideration with the
                        founders and expounders of our system of government, and any legislation,
                        either ecclesiastical or political, whose tendency is to fuse these two
                        separate and distinct features of our free institutions, is clearly a
                        contravention of the whole scope and spirit of our governmental
                        organization. We think the denunciatory spirit of the Methodist Discipline,
                        in pronouncing slavery an 'evil,' is a clear
                        departure from the appointed province of the church, and destructive of the
                        great moral end contemplated in the christian dispensation. So long as this
                        declaration remains unrescinded, the religious sect that subscribes to it
                        must necessarily be subjected to suspicions and criticism in Southern
                        communities, inasmuch as it is an offensive assumption contradicted by the
                        Apostles themselves, and belied by the usage and history of the country ever
                        since its first settlement at Jamestown.</p>
                    <p>The true policy of the Methodist Church, as we conceive, is to erase this
                        offensive clause in their Discipline, and instead of declaring slavery to be
                        an "evil" calling for "extirpation," substitute the crowning doctrine and
                        philosophy of all orthodox creeds, that Christ died for the salvation of
                        sinners, and that the application of his blood is sufficiently efficacious
                        to "extirpate" all evils from the human heart,
                        and enlighten the human understanding both to discern and correct the
                        "evils" to which flesh is heir. Instead of a crusade against the institution
                        of slavery, let there be a siege of the kingdom of Satan; and an honest
                        effort to propagate the great truths of the Bible, instead of sowing broad
                        cast the seeds of dissension, heart-burnings, jealousy, anti-Christ, and the
                        doctrine of abolition fanaticism.</p>

                    <p>Our city has been enlivened during the week by the presence and military
                        training of the officers of the different volunteer and militia companies in
                        the county, under the direction of Col. J. W. Massie, of Rockbridge. A finer
                        looking corps of officers we have never seen. The General Muster of the
                        160th Regiment took place at Spring Hill on yesterday. The 32d will parade
                        at Fisherville to-day; and the 93rd at Middlebrook to-morrow.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday evening the ceremony of presenting a sword to Capt. Wm. S. H.
                        Baylor, by his company, the West Augusta Guard, and a banner to the Staunton
                        Artillery, by the ladies of Staunton, took place in front of the American
                        Hotel. Both companies made their appearance in full uniform and numbers, and
                        truly the exhibition was handsome. Not in Virginia is there a military
                        organization that surpasses in soldierly appearance, perfect discipline, and
                        intrinsic and substantial worth, the military organizations of Augusta
                        County. Col. Massie addressed the officers present in a patriotic strain for
                        a few moments, after which the presentation of a beautiful Damascus steel
                        sword to Capt. W. S. H. Baylor, was made on the part of the West Augusta
                        Guard, by Lieut. James Bumgardner, in a [word missing] and beautiful
                        address, and received by Capt. Baylor in a few eloquent and appropriate
                        remarks. The scabbard bears the inscription--"A token of affection and
                        confidence from the West Augusta Guard to their Commander, Capt. Wm. S. H.
                        Baylor, May, 1860." The blade is inscribed with the sentences--"The Citizen
                        Soldier." "Vel [word missing], vel bello, clarum fieri licet." There are
                        various devices on the scabbard, beautifully arranged, which contribute in
                        making it a most becoming and complimentary testimonial of a brave soldiery
                        to a brilliant, chivalrous, intelligent, and competent commander. Capt.
                        Baylor's company is sincerely attached to him both in the capacity of
                        citizen and soldier, and justly so, for he merits the confidence and esteem
                        of his sterling company.</p>
                    <p>After the sword presentation, Gen. Wm. H. Harman, on behalf of the ladies of
                        Staunton, presented an elegant Banner, wrought by their hands, to the
                        Staunton Artillery, in a strain of unaffected eloquence and feeling, which
                        was received by Capt. John D. Imboden, in the name of his company, in a
                        speech inspiring in historical incident, that excited a genuine glow of
                        patriotism in every heart. The banner is marked on one side with--"From the
                        ladies of Staunton, May 16, 1860." "Nemo me impune lacessit." On the
                        other--"Staunton Artillery, Organized Nov. 28, 1859." On the top of the
                        stuff is a handsome bronzed eagle, with wings out- spread, indicating the
                        onward tendency and destiny of the stars and stripes. Indeed, it was a most
                        significant evidence of the patriotic impulses of the beautiful and
                        accomplished ladies of our city, and a pleasing assurance that their "hearts
                        must be easy, for they're in the right place." Could the patriotic daughter
                        of the war of 1812, who bid even her fair-haired boy go, and never return
                        until the polluting feet of Tarleton and his men had been driven from the
                        soil of Augusta, have witnessed the smiling, beaming, bright, beautiful
                        countenances of her sex as they glowed under the impulse of patriotic love
                        on this occasion, she might have felt that the spirit that animated her
                        still survived in the hearts of the fair daughters of West Augusta.</p>
                    <p>The concourse assembled to witness the ceremony was very large, consisted of
                        men, women and children, and everything passed off most delightfully and
                        harmoniously--the companies closing the exercises with three cheers and a
                        tiger, a salute from the Artillery, and a parade through the principal
                        streets of the city.</p>
                    <p>Although dating its organization much later than the Guard, the Artillery
                        promises to equal it in the elegance of its uniform, the discipline of its
                        officers, and the worth and high character of its men. Both companies are a
                        credit and honor to the county, and distant be the day when the shall
                        slacken in their spirit and enterprise, or diminish in their numbers.</p>
