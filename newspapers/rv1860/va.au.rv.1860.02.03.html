<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>What Should be the Policy of the South towards Free Negroes?</p>
                    <p>Through the public journals we learnt that by a recent act of the Arkansas
                        Legislature free negroes have been left by two alternatives, to be sold into
                        slavery or to be banished from the State. To the unprejudiced and well
                        meaning mind, this set, at first view, will seem to rigorous; upon the
                        second sight, it will appear hostile to every feeling of kindness and
                        philanthropy. We see persons, who, though degenerate in color and in mind,
                        have, by their industry and morality, rendered themselves worthy of the
                        society in which they moved, forced from the soil that they love and the
                        homes that they cherish, merely because they belong to that species whom
                        God, in his mysterious providence, has cursed with a darkness of skin, and
                        whom He, in His great wisdom, hath, for the purposes of civilization,
                        subjected to the will of superior beings, and whom, I may add, these superior beings have cursed with freedom. We see the innocent suffer for the guilty. We
                        see those who are industrious and law-abiding, compelled to suffer the
                        penalty along with those who are indolent and vicious.</p>
                    <p>Men are apt to be prejudiced in these sectional times, and when persecuted to
                        persecute in turn. They are apt to apply severe remedies to great evils;
                        and, what is more, that remedy which first suggests itself, let it be,
                        "traced in blood and tears," or the offspring of kindness and
                        philanthropy.--This act of the "wise men" of Arkansas seems to have been
                        performed without premeditation, and upon the very spur of the moment. They
                        say that free-negrodom was . . . [text missing] . . . and it should be
                        abolished. They saw, as every one sees, that among that mongrel race, cursed
                        with freedom, there were some black in crime as well as in color, and
                        spotted in immorality, who tampered with their slaves; and made their
                        bondage as bitter as that of the Israelites upon the plains of Egypt. They
                        saw this, and concluded that the only remedy was to leave them two
                        uncompromising alternatives, viz: slavery, or expulsion from the State. And
                        from this stern decree of exile not one is excepted.</p>
                    <p>Now, I am sure that I have no more sympathy than any other philanthropist
                        for. that unfortunate class of beings, whom God in his Providence has made
                        black, and whom man in his improvidence has made free; but I am sure, too,
                        that if the majority of them are degenerated, degraded creatures, without
                        the least knowledge of virtue or the least awakening of morality, there are
                        some who deserve the approbation and encouragement of every friend of
                        civilization, who are far better in their personal character and mode of
                        life than the majority of the lower white class, and whom to drive from
                        friends that they love and a country to which they are attached, would be in
                        opposition to every feeling of our better nature. Within the confines of our
                        own county--aye, within my own immediate neighborhood--there are free
                        negroes, who, by their industrious and upright life, have amassed
                        considerable money, and have gained the applause of every good and honest
                        man. To make such persons exiles from their native State, would be like
                        driving them into a city of the plague or a den of robbers. They would be
                        morally as well as pecuniarily ruined. The state of inferiority in which
                        they are held by our better citizens, and the honorable and honest manner in
                        which they are dealt with, is the secret of their success amongst us. But
                        send them to a free State, and they have no such bulwark to protect them.
                        They are placed upon an equality with the highest, which renders them
                        haughty and indolent. They become the prey of the subtle, are stripped of
                        their . . . [text missing] . . . want or in crime. How many a disconsolate
                        wail has come back to us from that land of freedom(?)! How many must still
                        come, if the remaining Southern States follow the example of Arkansas!</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped, then, that the Virginia Legislature, if this subject be
                        again brought before that body, will take the wisest course and consult not
                        only our own safety and the safety of our property, but also the feelings of
                        goodness and humanity. One of the best remedies seems to be this: Let a law
                        be passed to the effect, viz: That every free negro must depart the State
                        before a certain time, or bring to the County Court of the county, in which
                        he or she resides, a certificate signed by at least six responsible men, of
                        his or her neighborhood, certifying to his or her good moral character and
                        industrious habits. Let this certificate be placed upon record and renewed
                        regularly within a certain given time; and, if this does not remove an evil
                        of which many complain--if this does not purge our society of the dross of
                        this species, while the purer metal remains, then I say take the severer
                        remedy used by our sister State.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, and as a proof of what I have asserted, that there are some
                        free negroes worthy of the "Old Dominion," I would point to the conduct of
                        several during the momentous events which grew out of "Old John Brown's
                        Raid." It is said that when the soldiers were about to depart from Richmond
                        for Charleston, a number of free blacks came forward and wished to volunteer
                        as soldiers, and when this was, of course, denied them, offered themselves
                        to go with the soldiers and attend them as servants. Such a sentiment of
                        patriotism was shown by the better part of the free blacks all over the
                        State; and it is rumored that even in our own County town of Staunton, the
                        contributions raised for the volunteers were greatly swelled from the purses
                        of free negroes. Is not such conduct praiseworthy, even in a negro? Is it
                        not almost incredible? And would it not be cruel, inhuman, and
                        unphilanthropic and un-Christian, to drive such men to ruin. Thus I have
                        discarded the name of "WAR," and plead in the name of PEACE.</p>

<b>Direct Trade With Europe</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In light of recent events, it is in Virginia's best interests to increase
                    direct trade with Europe. Argues that the South should not have ceded commercial
                    primacy to the North.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Direct Trade with Europe.</p>
                    <p>It has been a well settled opinion, for years, of some of the best thinking
                        men of Virginia, that a direct trade with Europe should be re-established
                        and fostered by the people of this State. Recent events have more powerfully
                        impressed the subject upon the public mind. The patriotic merchants of
                        Richmond and Alexandria have resolved to commence a large and brisk foreign
                        trade, in the confidence that an intelligent and loyal people will sustain
                        them in their laudable enterprise. Will their noble purpose meet with a
                        hearty and energetic second from every good citizen of the Commonwealth?
                        This is a practical question which addresses itself to every one, and which
                        must now be answered. The work has been commenced and cannot be successfully
                        prosecuted without the united and zealous co-operation of the whole
                        people--The city merchants may import goods, but unless they are bought by
                        the retail dealers they will lie on their hands and rot. Whether the country
                        merchants will buy of Virginia importers depends upon the will of their
                        customers--the people.</p>
                    <p>The will of the people should be, that Virginia shall resume her former
                        position of a principal commercial State. Norfolk is a monument of the folly
                        of Virginia in abandoning the flourishing trade which she enjoyed in the
                        better days of the Republic, which has been basely turned over to the hands
                        of our Northern neighbors, upon which they have grown proud and arrogant.
                        Virginia has suffered herself to become the customer of other States instead
                        of retaining them as hers. She has become content to carry her rich produce
                        and pour it into the lap of others, thereby indirectly admitting an
                        inability to turn it to any further profitable account, when, in fact, she
                        possesses noble rivers, bays and harbors of ample capacity to float the
                        commerce of the whole country. As if it were not enough to give others a
                        rich profit to export her produc[line illegible] centum to the importer, and
                        superadded the costs of a transhipment at Northern ports; thus paying,
                        substantially, the costs of two transhipments and two profits to the
                        exporter and importer, in sending away her produce and getting what she
                        needs in return,--as if she were not capable to doing the writing and
                        financeering necessary to the transaction of her own business. Her policy is
                        analogous to that of the man, who cannot write a letter to a merchant at
                        Richmond to sell his produce, but allows a profit to some one possessing no
                        greater facilities for sending.</p>
                    <p>This state of affairs is utterly in conflict with true economy, or the
                        independent spirit of our people. Will Virginia be herself again? Shall the
                        grass covered streets of Norfolk groan under Virginia tonnage for the
                        future, or will it still afford employment for the capital and drays of New
                        York? It is for you, Virginians, to say. The importance and necessity of a
                        change of policy is so palpable that it needs no discussion.</p>
                    <p>Let a prompt and determined declaration be made by the people in public
                        meetings throughout the State, that they will not encourage or support any
                        merchant who does not import or buy of Virginia importers. Let this
                        declaration be now made before the Spring trade commences, and it will be
                        found that our retail dealers will cheerfully and promptly conform to the
                        wishes of their patrons.</p>
                    <p>The people of the whole State should feel an interest in her prosperity and
                        greatness. The importers have a right to assurances of support, and they
                        expect it. In other words, they want to know whether the people will discard
                        that accursed pride which will not suffer many to purchase any article of
                        which it cannot be said that it was purchased on "Broadway" or Chestnut
                        streets. This feeling of wicked pride has had much to do with our bondage to
                        the North. To gratify it, everything had to be bought at the "Devil's
                        principal place on earth," (as it has been denominated by a distinguished
                        citizen of an adjoining county)--New York.</p>
                    <p>Let it be published that this soul and country destroying lust for fashion
                        and extravagance shall, now and here, have an end and be supplanted by
                        modesty and frugality. Let it be remembered that "pride goeth before
                        destruction, and a haughty look before a fall;" that a self- reliant and
                        economical policy is essential to prosperity in individual and State
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>A brisk direct trade from the waters of Virginia would inure to the advantage
                        of almost every remote corner and citizen of the State.</p>
                    <p>Commerce in almost all ages and countries has been the highway to wealth and
                        greatness. It is so still. Why is it that Boston, New York, Philadelphia and
                        Baltimore are large and wealthy? It is because of their commerce, and just
                        in proportion to its extent has been their growth.</p>
                    <p>Let any one analyze the multifarious operations of commerce and they will see
                        how it lengthens, widens and deepens. Here capital yields a heavy profit and
                        draws in its train thousands of well paid laborers.</p>
                    <p>Take, for instance, the profits which were lost to Virginia on the
                        $41,154,000 worth of goods reported by the Auditor to have been sold in the
                        State within the last two years, at 20 per centum, would give $8,230,800.
                        The same per centum upon the exports with which goods were bought, would
                        double that amount. Add thereto the charges for the transhipment of the
                        exports and imports, which are paid into Northern hands and to Northern
                        profit, and you will have a sum about equal to the per centage upon the
                        capital, making an aggregate loss to the State in two years of about
                        $32,920,000. If this statement approximates the truth, it will at once be
                        seen what an immense sum Virginia pays to others to do that which she can do
                        for herself.</p>
                    <p>The effect of $32,920,000 saved to the State bi-ennially upon her wealth,
                        power and influence would be immense. Her rivers, canals and railroad are
                        reaching out their mighty arms to embrace not only her own trade, but a
                        large portion of Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina.</p>
                    <p>We will not dwell upon the advantages to be derived from the establishment of
                        a center of trade at home by which the large sums which are annually paid on
                        Northern exchange would be saved to the State. The hints which have been
                        given are sufficient to show the immense importance of the subject. Let
                        prompt action be immediately taken to redeem the State from her commercial
                        thraldom, before the Spring trade commences.</p>
                    <p>May we not appeal with confidence to the intelligent and patriotic merchants
                        of the State, who perhaps enjoy a greater influence, as a class, than any
                        other, to take the lead in this important measure. They will rid themselves
                        of much inconvenience, annoyance and expense by buying at home and in the
                        consequent prosperity of the State, will lay the foundation for a greatly
                        increased and more prosperous business.</p>

                    <p>Nullification of the Fugitive Slave Law.</p>
                    <p>While the country is being agitated from center to circumference by the John
                        Brown raid, the underground railroad, the "irrepressible conflict,"
                        &amp;c., the Southern press and people seem to have overlooked, or
                        silently acquiesced in, the most flagrant violation of the Constitution and
                        good faith between the States, that has ever been perpetrated since the
                        formation of this Government.</p>
                    <p>Congress, carrying out the provision of the Constitution, has passed a law
                        making it incumbent upon each State of the Union to render back to the
                        master any slave who may have escaped from service. It is evident that
                        without such a law, the slaveholding States could not, with safety, continue
                        longer in the Union, and it is equally self-evident that unless this just
                        provision of the Constitution is carried out in good faith, [line illegible]
                        from the Confederacy, and seek that protection for her property which the
                        Union does not give. Has that law, made in accordance with an expressed
                        provision of the Constitution, been carried out in good faith by the
                        Northern States of this Union? Our answer is to be found on the statute book
                        of at least three of the Northern States; and the recent case of Myers, who
                        was tried in Pennsylvania for kidnapping, shows that even that conservative
                        State has virtually nullified the fugitive slave law. Myers, as the agent of
                        the owner, had returned several fugitive slaves to servitude in Maryland;
                        after having been inveigled into Pennsylvania, he was arrested and put on
                        trial for kidnapping. Now the only question which the Courts of Pennsylvania
                        were competent to decide, was, whether the slaves rendered back to
                        servitude, were, according to the decision of the Court of Maryland, legally
                        held in slavery. It is evident that a Court of Pennsylvania has no right to
                        decide, in the face of the decision of a Court of Maryland, that the slaves
                        were not lawfully held in bondage. But in vain the counsel for Myers
                        demonstrated the monstrosity of such a position. The
                            Judge, from the bench, instructed the jury that they were competent to
                            investigate as to the legality of the decision of the Court of Maryland,
                            and, if, in their opinion, that decision was wrong, they were to bring
                            in a verdict of guilty! And they did bring in a verdict of
                        guilty, and Myers was sentenced to eight years in the penitentiary. What
                        think the people of the South of this? Why slumbers the indignation of the
                        conservatives of the Union? Where is the enthusiasm which animated their
                        breasts when South Carolina dared to nullify a law of the Union? Why is the
                        Federal Executive silent? Where is that army with which the iron-willed
                        Jackson would have marched into a Southern State and enforced obedience to a
                        law of the Union at the point of the bayonet? </p>
