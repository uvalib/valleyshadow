<b>Secession and the Consequences</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font><p>The present political campaign presents the most remarkable phenomena 
                    ever displayed in a civilized country.  The Federal Government of this 
                    Union, established by free, sovereign and independent States, for the 
                    purpose of insuring domestic tranquility, providing for the common 
                    defense, promoting the general welfare, and securing the blessings of 
                    liberty to the Citizens of these States and their posterity, is 
                    jeopardised and staked upon an aerial, mythical abstraction, originated 
                    amidst the fogs and mists of blind and unhealthy prejudice, and nursed 
                    by the agitation of sectional excitement and jealousy.</p>
                    <p> The Federal Government of the United States is acknowledged by all 
                        the world as the most perfect of the kind ever devised, and the 
                        destinies of a people--the happiest, the purest, and the best of all the 
                        nations of the earth--are all put at fearful risk and imminent peril, 
                        for the purpose of agitating a theory of political belief utterly 
                        inexpedient to be applied to any political fact now existing, or which 
                        will probably exist in the future.</p>
                    <p> We propose to demonstrate fully, fairly and satisfactorily to any 
                        unprejudiced mind, that the act of the secessionists is suicidal to the 
                        best interests of the South, incompatible with the existence of a 
                        national Democratic party, and tending to the disruption of the Union 
                        itself.  And 1st.  THE ACT OF THE SECESSIONISTS WAS ACTUALLY SUICIDAL TO 
                        THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE SOUTH, if endeavored to be carried into 
                        operation.  Every one knows that the Congress of the United States 
                        consists largely of Black Republican representatives;  that the 
                        predominant influence which they possess interposes an insuperable 
                        barrier to the passage of any law on the subject of slavery in the 
                        current domain of the country, at all recognizing that institution as 
                        entitled to existence therein.  The history of that party from 1820 down 
                        to the present time, affords the most abundant testimony to the fact, 
                        that they are incapable of performing any deed, or of casting any vote, 
                        calculated in the slightest degree to benefit the slaveholder, where 
                        "slavery" itself is the subject matter of consideration.  Their claim 
                        over has been, and now is, that there shall be "no more slave territory 
                        and no more slave States"--their mission is asserted to be the 
                        extinction of slavery.</p>
                    <p> The Kansas-Nebraska bill and the Cincinnati platform vest in the 
                        judicial tribunal of the United States alone the power of disposing of 
                        and determining any vexed question in a territory, wherein is involved 
                        the right of property in a negro, or the constitutionality of the local 
                        law of a legislature of such territory.  The absolute withdrawal of the 
                        subject of slavery from the Congressional arena had long been an object 
                        of the keenest desire on the part of the South.  More than once had the 
                        agitation of the question, arising out of the smallest circumstance, 
                        imperilled the safety of the Union, and cost the nation an amount of 
                        treasure sufficient to purchase a colony of negroes.  It was a lever in 
                        the hand of Congressional fanatics which, applied at the pillars of the 
                        Constitution, and resolve the different members of the Confederacy into 
                        their original position of separate and independent sovereignties.</p> 
                    <p>The Kansas-Nebraska bill, then, was hailed by almost the entire South 
                        as the harbinger of a brighter day, when the operation of Congress would 
                        be directed and applied to purposes and schemes for the general welfare 
                        of the States and the people, and not to inflammatory harangues upon the 
                        theme of negro slavery, the right or wrong, advantage or disadvantage of 
                        which is a matter solely for the consideration of the States which adopt 
                        or repudiate it.</p>
                    <p>"Congressional intervention for protection" of slavery in the 
                        territories re- transfers this question of negro slavery back to the 
                        halls of Congress;  congressional intervention takes the interests of 
                        the slaveholder from under the protecting wing of judicial power, with 
                        all the appliances necessary to effect its decrees, and places them at 
                        the mercy of a merciless abolition Congress, which not only  wwill not 
                        act for the protection of slavery, but the ultimate aim of whose 
                        political career is to deprive Southern citizens of their rights and 
                        their property.--To remove the flock from the watchful guardianship of 
                        the shepherd's dog and crook, and place it at the mercy of a pack of 
                        ravenous wolves, in expectancy of more effectual safety, would be looked 
                        upon as an act of downright madness;  yet this removal of the interests 
                        of the slaveholder from under the jealous eyes and defense of judicial 
                        surveillance, when such men as Judge Tanney and Nelson are the sentinels 
                        on the outposts--to an arena where the assassin's dagger of a Kellog is 
                        backed by more numeric force than the Damascan blade of Southern honor, 
                        is not less insane.  Congressional intervention, whilst it may, as an 
                        original question for the protection of slavery in the territories, be 
                        constitutional as an act of expediency or necessity, is impolitic to a 
                        degree which, when we reflect upon the manner of Black Republican 
                        intervention, must be characterized as suicidal to the South.
                    </p>
                    <p>It affords abolitionism not only the means of perpetrating a direct 
                    wrong upon our citizens, but an opportunity for a continuation of these 
                    discussions in Congress, so pernicious to the welfare of the country.  
                    It furnishes fanaticism the ailment of which is the sine qua non of its 
                    existence.</p>
                    <p>It is a favorite idea, and one which we, with our understanding of 
                        the philosophy of the federal government, would be the last to dispute 
                        and the first to assert, that Congress is but an agent for the various 
                        States of the Union, with the extent of its powers distinctly defined 
                        and chalked out by the framers of the Constitution in that celebrated 
                        instrument;  that the eminent domain of the federal government is held 
                        in trust for the States, and that being common property, acquired by 
                        common blood, risk and treasure, should be free alike to the citizens of 
                        the North and South with their property.  This being the case, we put 
                        the question, whether, if the Southern delegates believed that not only 
                        the general good of the whole country, but the special advantage of 
                        their immediate constituents, would be subserved by investing the people 
                        of a territory with the power to pass their own local laws on all 
                        subjects, when they had formed their Legislature--laws themselves 
                        amenable to the criticism of judicial sagacity and change or abrogation 
                        of the edicts of the Supreme Courts--it would not be their duty, as 
                        honest representatives of the people's interests, to stand by such a law 
                        as the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, which drives from a national assemblage the 
                        discussion of a question that will agitate the whole country, to that 
                        field where the people are immediately interested in the discussion 
                        thereof?  Let not the people of the South and North forever be agitated 
                        on these questions, which can be better and more advantageously and more 
                        justly considered and determined by those alone interested, subject to 
                        the supervision of the federal judiciary.</p>
                    <p>We think we have proved the first proposition, and pass on to the 
                        consideration of the second--That Congressional Intervention is 
                        incompatible with the existence of the National Democratic party.</p>
                    <p>Opposition to Wilmot Provisoism, and a desire to do justice to the 
                        citizens of every portion of the Union, rallied the conservative men of 
                        every party and every section, upon the floor of the U. S. Congress, 
                        into one close, fearless, compact phalanx.  These men, consisting 
                        chiefly of Southern Democrats, and North-western Democrats, the latter 
                        led on by Stephen A. Douglas, of Illinois, whilst they in common were 
                        inspired with hatred to abolition usurpation, and a fervid love of 
                        country, disagreed upon one question in connection with slavery in the 
                        territories. They all admitted and agreed alike that the territories of 
                        the United States were the common property of the people of the several 
                        States of the Union--that this territory was subject to settlement by 
                        the North and South with every species of property recognized and 
                        established in these different sections--and that a territory, when it 
                        petitioned to be admitted as a State into the Union, should not be 
                        rejected because the institution of negro slavery had been adopted in 
                        the Constitution of such territory asking admission as a State.  In all 
                        this they stood directly at defiance with Black Republicanism.  Agreeing 
                        upon all these positions, they differed alone as to the time when the 
                        people of a Territory had the constitutional power to abolish slavery, 
                        or to institute it--one portion of the Democracy asserting that when a 
                        territory had a legislature capable of enacting laws, that then a 
                        majority of the people could determine the question for themselves, to 
                        suit themselves;  and another portion of the Democracy contending that 
                        the people of a territory could alone pass upon this question as to the 
                        non-existence of slavery when they came with the Constitution of a State 
                        in their hand, claiming admission as a State into the Confederacy.  
                        There was a point of diversity then as to the time when, 
                        constitutionally, the people of a territory could fully manage their own 
                        affairs, especially on the subject of slavery.  But this diversity 
                        existing as to constitutionality, there was no difference among the 
                        chief men of the North and South as to the ultimate conclusion of the 
                        whole matter.  Whilst said Messrs. Davis and Cobb and Orr, 
                        (substantially, not literally,) "we believe the legislature of a 
                        territory cannot, constitutionally, enact laws adverse to slavery, yet 
                        it has the power, by non- legislation for its protection, to operate as 
                        prejudicially upon its interests as if it had the power in reality to 
                        abolish it.  It has no positive power to prohibit, yet it is capable of 
                        a negative position, which will result in the same thing."  Under this 
                        view of the case, (see Hunter and Mason's speech on the Kansas-Nebraska 
                        bill,) the whole Democracy, feeling a common sympathy upon all cardinal 
                        points of faith, agreed to people of the territory, subject to the 
                        supervision of the Supreme Court of the U. S.--a supervision permanent, 
                        perpetual in its power to modify or nullify, and capable, in its right 
                        to demand the assistance of every branch of government to aid in 
                        carrying into operation its edicts, of correcting any wrong within the 
                        reach of the strong arm of the law.  If one portion of the Democracy is 
                        right in its constitutional construction, the Supreme Court stands by 
                        it;  if the other is right, the Supreme Court stands by it.  The spirit 
                        of this agreement was incorporated into the Kansas- Nebraska bill of 
                        1854, the most universally popular act in the South ever considered by 
                        Congress on the subject of slavery.  The Kansas-Nebraska bill was 
                        adopted and incorporated as a plank in the Cincinnati platform, and upon 
                        it all the Northern Democracy and Southern Democracy stood firmly and 
                        boldly amidst the political tempests which raged around it in 1856.  
                        This national Democratic idea and agreement comprehended in the 
                        Kansas-Nebraska act, Congressional intervention proposes to overthrow, 
                        to nullify--this National Democratic platform to abandon for one upon 
                        which not only the North-western Democracy cannot, in consistency with 
                        their honest opinions, stand, and which, by direct agreement, it was 
                        determined they should not be required to stand, but which a large 
                        portion of the Southern Democracy repudiate as unwieldy and misshapen in 
                        its proportions, and inexpedient and unwise in its assumptions and 
                        demands.</p>
                    <p>An abandonment of national ideas must break up the National Democratic 
                    party--a breach of an honest agreement, a Congressional compact, must 
                    break up the Democratic party--denunciation and abuse of the ideas of 
                    the North-western Democrats, must drive them from relations of amity and 
                    brotherhood with those who indulge in denunciation and abuse.  And thus, 
                    eventually that great Democratic party, which has been the 
                    avaunt-courrier of the mighty army of human progress, tolling up the 
                    rugged ascents of civilization in this nineteenth century of time;  that 
                    great Democratic party which has protected, vindicated and preserved the 
                    rights of the States, and the privileges of individuals, from the 
                    centralizing power of federal absorption;  which has given glory and 
                    power and importance to the national relations of the United States, and 
                    diffused the blessings of civil, religious and political liberty into 
                    the meanest hovel of the land--will be broken up by the wild passions of 
                    sectional jealousy, to occupy hereafter a position almost as powerless 
                    for harm or good as the party of the Opposition, now clamoring for the 
                    election of Bell.</p>
                    <p> If we have not proven the second proposition sufficiently to the 
                        satisfaction of our readers, we can furnish on demand, the evidence of 
                        those now fighting on the intervention plank, fully establishing our 
                        assertions.</p>
                    <p>That the secession at Charleston and Baltimore from the Democratic 
                        party tends to the disruption of the Union itself, will require but 
                        little effort on our part to show--all the signs of the times, all the 
                        movements of extreme Southern politicians and States;  all the 
                        pronouncements and denunciamentos of Cotton State organs, affords 
                        evidence startling to every lover of the Union, its permanence and 
                        perpetuity.  We do not propose to discuss the question of dissolution in 
                        the event of Lincoln's election.  We are satisfied that pure and 
                        philanthropic men believe the act of electing Lincoln on the part of the 
                        Northern people, justification in itself of dissolution.  We discuss not 
                        this question at present.  We do assert, however, that the Democracy 
                        united, standing shoulder to shoulder on the Cincinnati platform, with 
                        their banner borne by a bold, stout champion of the faith, would, 
                        without any doubt, have achieved a triumphant victory over the Black 
                        Republican and Opposition parties--that the Congressional 
                        interventionists destroyed, by their persistent effort to interpolate, 
                        and their withdrawal on the failure to obtain interpolation, the power, 
                        the unity and the prestige of the only party capable to achieve a 
                        triumph over Lincoln;  and that Lincoln's election, which may be secured 
                        by the secession, is considered a just cause for dissolution by some of 
                        the most prominent statesmen of the South.</p>
                    <p>We are not attacking seceders for advocating dissolution if Lincoln is elected--of this we shall have 
                        a chapter hereafter.  We are holding them up to the public observation 
                        as the authors of the disintegration of a party unity, the consequences 
                        resulting from which may be the election of the traitor Lincoln, cause 
                        sufficient, as contended by some, for a dissolution of this Confederacy.</p> 
                    <p>There is more than the affirmative of these propositions concluded in 
                        this wild and reckless act of secession--there is a latent--no, not 
                        latent--a potent insult offered to these brave and chivalrous Democrats 
                        of the north-west, who, in every hour of political trial, stood as a 
                        wall of fire between the assaults of fiendish abolition miscreants, and 
                        the rights and interests of the South.  Who advocated the annexation of 
                        Texas, itself a Southern measure?  The North-western Democracy, 
                        represented by S. A. Douglas.  Who in the North advocated the beneficent 
                        tariff of 1846?  The national Democracy, as represented by Douglas.  Who 
                        of the Northwest vindicated and defended the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850? 
                        Stephen A. Douglas, at the risk of fortune and life, in the front of 
                        infuriated mobs, with hideous visages lighted into fearful contortions 
                        by the burning fires of his own effigies?  Who run the gauntlet of 
                        Northern indignation on the abrogation of the Missouri line, and the 
                        restoration of equal rights, in common territory , to the Southern 
                        citizen, as effected in the Kansas Bill?  Stephen A. Douglas.--Such are 
                        the Democrats, and such the representative men of these Democrats, whose 
                        services and patriotism are repudiated and denounced by the slobbering 
                        lips of a tyrannical despot, as impersonated by James Buchanan, and in 
                        the honied sentences of a revolutionary precipitator, as represented by 
                        a Yancey.  Damn them!</p>

                    <p>Fate of the Seceders.</p>
                    <p>Now when the practical effects of that insane and criminal proceeding--the
                        secession at Charleston and Baltimore--are being realized in the defeat and
                        overthrow of the National Democracy at the North, the public mind will be
                        brought fully to understand the issue before the country, and the masses of
                        the people will bring home to themselves the dreadful consequences which are
                        likely to result from the disruption of the Democratic party. The question
                        has always been one of Union or Disunion, and all the sophistry of the
                        secession organs and speakers cannot now conceal the truth from the public
                        understanding. The shameless inconsistency of those who have precipitated
                        this ruin upon the country, and their barefaced effrontery, will now be
                        fully exposed . . . [text missing] . . . Douglas have labored hard to
                        convince the people of the danger in which they were placed, and have sought
                        by every means in their power to bring the true issue involved in the
                        contest fairly before the people. Much has been done towards dispelling the
                        illusion into which many of the honest masses were precipitated by the
                        leaders of the secession party. But argument and appeal are no longer
                        necessary. Facts--stubborn and undeniable facts--now present themselves,
                        which must convince the masses that all we have told them in regard to the
                        danger which is to be apprehended from this secession movement, will be in
                        all probability fully realized. The President of the United States and the
                        disunionists of the Cotton States, united in endeavoring to defeat the
                        nomination of a candidate upon the old platform of the party, and succeeded
                        in demoralizing and destroying the Democratic organization; and now, after
                        their work is complete, after they have succeeded in securing a breach in
                        our ranks, which is growing wider and wider, the people have the practical
                        results before them. The returns of the elections in Pennsylvania, Ohio and
                        Indiana, show in a manner which cannot admit of doubt, that our division has
                        given the Black Republican party an immense advantage in the Presidential
                        contest. The President, with increasing malignity, continues his war upon
                        the Democratic party, both North and South, and is doing all in his power to
                        secure its defeat. Look at the returns from the North. The gallant Democracy
                        have just passed through a contest precisely similar to the Illinois contest
                        in 1858. They have in many districts nobly sustained themselves against the
                        Republican and Administration coalition, and have gained six or seven
                        members of Congress. But in many districts, the aid which the Republicans
                        have received from the Breckinridge and Buchanan party, has enabled them to
                        increase their majorities, and the State tickets have consequently been
                        defeated. In almost every Northern State the Democracy are fighting a double
                        foe.-- The Republicans, bold, defiant and united as one man, at all times a
                        most formidable enemy--aided by the desertion of a fragment of the
                        Democratic party, under the control of Buchanan and Breckinridge, through
                        their army of office- holders and dependents--have everything to beck them
                        on to triumphant result. This is precisely a repetition of the Illinois
                        contest of '58--the Democracy against the Republicans, the latter aided by
                        the whole power of the Administration. Will the people of the South
                        countenance and justify such infamous conduct? Douglas and the main army of
                        Northern Democrats straining every nerve in a death struggle to defeat
                        Lincoln, and the Breckinridge party standing out in determined resistance to
                        Douglas and the Democracy, and using every effort to secure his defeat. It
                        is time the people understood these matters. The truth must be proclaimed,
                        and as a public journalist, it is our imperative duty to apprise them of the
                        facts and warn them of the danger. Democrats of Virginia, we call upon you
                        who have agreed to support this "bolters" ticket, to pause and reflect ere
                        it is too late.--Let no man, as he values the Union, and the peace and
                        continued prosperity of the country, unite himself with the Secession party.
                        Look at the conduct of the "bolters" themselves. They are now becoming
                        frightened at the results of their own action. They have sown to the wind,
                        and they are now about to reap the whirlwind. The people are becoming fully
                        aroused to a sense of the danger which threatens the country, and woe betide
                        the authors of the ruin, if it be not averted. The great "Bolter" from
                        Alabama has become frightened, and has gone to New York to speak to the
                        people there. For whom, Democrats of Virginia, do you suppose this leader of
                        secession is haranguing the people of New York? Is it for Breckinridge and
                        Lane? Is it for Congressional Intervention Mr. Yancey is pleading? Does he
                        proclaim that Mr. Douglas and his friends are no better than Lincoln? None
                        of these things has Mr. Yancey done in New York. But he implored the people
                        to vote the fusion ticket--19 of the electors being for Douglas, 10 for
                        Bell, and 6 for Breckinridge. Has it come to this? Are the Breckites so hard
                        run as to back down from their pretended ground of principle, and go for
                        Douglas the traitor, and Bell the abolitionist? Such is the fact so far as
                        Mr. Yancey is concerned. Wm. L. Yancey, who denounced Douglas as a traitor
                        in Virginia, and proclaimed Bell to be an abolitionist, is urging and
                        imploring the people to vote for Douglas and Bell to save the country and
                        the Constitution!--Does Mr. Yancey see the handwriting on the wall, or has
                        he become convinced that we, the National Democracy, have been right from
                        the first, in calling upon the people to sustain Stephen A. Douglas, as the
                        only man who can defeat Lincoln? Yancey is frightened--he is afraid of the
                        wrath of the people. The secession movement must go down in the South, and
                        every man who has led it must go down with it. How utterly idle and
                        ridiculous the boast of these men, that they are contending for principle!
                        In Virginia Mr. Yancey proclaimed that in order to sustain the Constitution,
                        Douglas must be voted down as a traitor and free-soiler in disguise. In New
                        York he tells them that in order to sustain the Constitution, you must vote
                        for Douglas--Douglas the agitator and advocate of free-soilism, as he
                        proclaims in the South. Can this man face an honest and intelligent people
                        after such miserable inconsistency?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Yancey is, we repeat it, alarmed.--His darling scheme cannot succeed. The
                        people of the South will repudiate him and his candidate, and with them his
                        doctrine of Intervention. This is what Mr. Yancey fears? What else could
                        induce him to go for the Douglas and Bell electors in New York? If he was
                        honest here, how can he advise any man to vote for Douglas anywhere? But
                        more than that--he tells them to go for Bell and Everett, with their 10
                        electoral votes. Bell, the abolitionist, supported by Wm. L. Yancey in New
                        York! We tell these seceders what we told them from the first--their days
                        are numbered.--The people are repudiating them all over the South. They have
                        been beaten in Missouri, Georgia, Arkansas and Kentucky, and wherever an
                        election has taken place. And now this great Mogul of the party goes to New
                        York and cries aloud for the Douglas men to save the "Constitution, and the
                        Union under the Constitution."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Yancey, like his candidate, won't answer as to what he will do if Lincoln
                        is elected. He says he will do what Alabama [word missing]. Pray what will
                        you tell Alabama to do, Mr. Yancey? Come out, gentlemen--don't dodge. You
                        are down, and you know it. People of Virginia have nothing to do with the
                        secession concern- -it is played out, and everybody knows it.</p>
