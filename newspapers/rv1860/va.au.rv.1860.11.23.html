                    <p>The Crisis--National Convention.</p>
                    <p>That impulsive, mercurial sentiment that responds to sectional passion,
                        regardless of consequences, seems to have taken possession of the leading
                        Breckinridge papers of the State. Thoughtless and indifferent to the grave
                        questions of which the present canvass is pregnant, they are rushing blindly
                        into the very jaws of destruction, and suggesting a scheme that must
                        inevitably "precipitate" a revolution in our political system, and blot us
                        from the roll of nations as the freest and best governed people in the
                        world. Hardly had the lightning flashed through the country the intelligence
                        of the revolutionary movements of S. Carolina, before the metropolitan
                        Breckinridge press, backed by the Alexandria Sentinel and Lynchburg
                        Republican, burthen their columns with clamorous appeals for a "Southern Convention," apparently ignoring the fact
                        that we are part of the whole confederacy, as well North as South; and
                        regardless of the important consideration that our cause of complaint is
                        against the North, and not the South. It seems patent to us, that a just
                        ambition to avert the calamity of dissolution; to allay the nervous
                        excitement incident to the election of a sectional President, and adjust the
                        difficulties which reckless and fanatical men have thrust upon us, would
                        have suggested the expediency of a National
                        Convention to cure sectional diseases, rather
                        than a sectional Convention to inflame sectional passions, brood over
                        sectional wrongs, and estrange and embitter the feelings of the parties to
                        the federal compact. He is a careless and superficial thinker who sees in
                        the election of Abraham Lincoln a verdict of the American people in favor of
                        the doctrine of the platform upon which he was elected. It is true, that
                        through the folly and divisions of the conservative element at the North,
                        Mr. Lincoln received a majority of the electoral votes of all the States,
                        and by virtue thereof becomes in name the President of the United States. It
                        is merely in name, for he goes to the White House with the moral power of
                        less than one-third of the people to back him; with the Senate, House of
                        Representatives, and Federal Judiciary--all the checks provided by the
                        Constitution--against him, and as utterly powerless to do harm as he would
                        have been had he remained at his quiet home in Springfield.</p>
                    <p>Viewing all the circumstances, therefore, attending the election of Mr.
                        Lincoln, and calmly surveying the facts as they are presented to us, we can
                        see no just reasons for a Southern Convention,
                        until the more rational and statesmanlike policy of a National Convention has failed to accomplish the desired end. A
                        Southern Convention would be utterly powerless to remove any one of the
                        causes of complaint, and could result in nothing else than an imagined
                        extenuation of our wrongs, driving reason from our deliberations, and
                        substituting therefor inflamed passions. The great and crowning error of the
                        Virginia delegation at Charleston--an error the resultant of which was the
                        disruption of the Democratic party, the election of Lincoln, and the
                        imperiling of the Union--was the appointment of a delegate to meet similar
                        delegates from the Southern States in consultation. That was the first step
                        towards the division that afterwards took place. Had the conference been
                        national--had there been an honest desire to adjust the differences of
                        opinion that existed, and one paramount sentiment, and that the defeat of
                        the Black Republican party, the Democracy this day would have the President
                        elect.</p>
                    <p>It is now proposed to pursue a like suicidal, contracted and narrow-minded
                        policy, by holding a Southern Convention instead
                        of a National Convention. We are well convinced that the intelligent masses
                        are opposed to any such folly. We know they are in this section. Believing
                        that South Carolina has recklessly and madly initiated steps of disunion,
                        regardless not only of the sentiments, but the interests of the border
                        States, they feel called upon, as patriots devoted to a Constitutional
                        Union, to speak out against any movement that can be construed as endorsing
                        her course, and to once again appeal to that stern sense of virtue and
                        honor, which in troublous times gone by made "Virginia the break-water to
                        sectionalism, to step forward to pour oil upon the maddened waters.</p>
                    <p>As fully carrying out this idea, and as indicating a step commensurate with
                        the vast interests involved, the following plan suggested by Gov. Letcher in
                        his inaugural address last January, seems the most appropriate and feasible:</p>
                    <p>"The only mode, therefore, of remedying the evil, that occurs to me, under
                        the Constitution, is provided in the fifth article thereof. Summon a
                        Convention of all the States, that a full and free conference may be had
                        between the representatives of the people, elected for this purpose, and
                        thus ascertain whether the questions in controversy cannot be settled upon
                        some basis mutually satisfactory to both sections. If such a Convention
                        shall assemble, and after full and free consultation and comparison of
                        opinions, they shall find that the difference between the slaveholding and
                        non-slaveholding States are irreconcilable, let them consider the question
                        of a peaceful separation, and the adjustment of all questions relating to
                        the disposition of the common property between the two sections. If they can
                        be reconciled, let them adjust the terms, and give them such sanction as
                        will render them effective.</p>
                    <p>"I suggest, therefore, that you adopt resolutions in favor of the call of
                        such a Convention, and appeal to the Legislatures of the several States to
                        unite in the application proposed to be made in Congress, in pursuance of
                        the provisions of the article aforesaid. If the non-slaveholding States
                        shall fail or refuse to unite in the application, such failure or refusal
                        will furnish conclusive evidence of a determination on their part to keep up
                        the agitation, and to continue their aggressions upon us. If the Convention
                        shall meet, and the questions cannot be satisfactorily adjusted, the people
                        of the South will clearly understand what they are to expect in the future."</p>
                    <p>Should this plan fail--should Northern fanaticism rise superior to Northern
                        reason and patriotism--should they close their eyes to the fearful
                        consequences, to them more especially, which must follow in the wake of
                        disunion--then, conscious of having discharged our duty to our country--to
                        the memory of the past and the hopes of the future,--we can calmly, and like
                        men sustained in the right, proudly throw the responsibility where it
                        properly belongs. We have no hosannahs to shout to the Union, nor do we mean
                        to be driven to an extreme under the influence of the siren song for
                        Southern rights, as understood by the Cotton States. We will never consent
                        that South Carolina and Alabama shall arrange the programme by which the
                        border States must leave the Union. If there can be no adjustment under the
                        plan suggested by Gov. Letcher, still we are opposed to a Southern Convention. In that event, we shall favor
                        a border State Convention. We have no idea of
                        being "hitched" to the Cotton States upon just such terms as they may
                        prescribe. We shall advocate a Convention of the Border
                            States, and urge that they lay down
                        the terms upon which they are willing to go into a Southern
                        Confederacy--especially stipulating against the re-opening of the African
                        Slave trade, and all "entangling alliances" with foreign powers.</p>
                    <p>But we are well convinced that a Convention of all the States of the Union,
                        where we could meet the North face to face, and discuss the questions at
                        issue, would be prolific of good, and quite probably remove all just cause
                        of embittered feeling and sectional excitement and crimination.</p>
                    <p>We trust the press of the State will freely discuss the policy of the two
                        suggestions--a National and a Southern Convention--give healthy direction to the popular mind,
                        and thus enable our legislators, in January next, to reflect in their action
                        the sentiments of their constituents. We are satisfied that it only requires
                        the thoughts of the people to be brought to bear upon the idea, and they
                        will, without division, discard, as unworthy the magnitude of the occasion,
                        the contracted and fanatical idea of a Southern
                        Convention, until at least the more rational remedies for the ills we bear
                        have been exhausted.</p>

                    <p>Where are our Statesmen?</p>
                    <p>In these dark hours of our national existence, when political throes are
                        shaking the fundamental law of the country--when the passions of sections
                        are erupting the groundwork of the government, and spreading the fiery lava
                        of sectional animosity and hatred broadcast over the land, unsettling
                        commerce, depreciating property, stagnating every channel of trade, and
                        sending dismay and painful forebodings to the firesides of the timid, where
                        is the statesman of Virginia to come forward and open up some way of
                        deliverance? Echo answers, where? The press, with a puerility that is really
                        disgusting, is furnishing ailment for excited passion, never aspiring to the
                        dignity of grappling and digesting a comprehensive idea.--Conducted, with a
                        few exceptions, by men who could never reach a higher distinction in any
                        other profession than that of an eleventh-rate lawyer, or third-rate calico
                        vender, they have succeeded, by the aid of a few store-box and pot-house
                        politicians, in raising a storm that utterly bewilders them, and which
                        leaves them without compass or rudder to guide the vessel they have
                        launched. The criminal ignorance or imbecility of the men who have brought
                        about this fearful state of affairs can only properly be atoned for upon the
                        gallows.</p>
                    <p>But where are our statesmen? Not a man of prominence in the State, save
                        Governor Letcher, has come forward with any suggestion looking to a solution
                        of the difficulties that now environ us. Hunter, fearful that he may not
                        strike the current, awaits the development of the opinions and plans of
                        everyone else, before he will venture to present to the nation any
                        devisement by which our country may be saved from the impending ruin. He, of
                        all others, should come forward and endeavor to direct the storm, for it was
                        the folly of his shallow-pated followers that created it. Mason, too dull to
                        emit anything original and too soporific to play the part of an ingenious
                        plagiarist, amuses himself in the luxurious and dreamy delights of
                        bedizening milk punch and apply-toddy, while the very citadel of liberty is
                        trembling and quaking under the shock of the attacks of reckless fanatics.
                        Wise, that intellectual comet of the age, throwing himself, Achilles-like,
                        stubbornly into the bosom of Princess Anne, ventures no further than to
                        organize his Minute men, apparently unmindful of the duty he owes his State
                        and the country, and forgetful that Princess Anne is neither the State or
                        the Union.</p>
                    <p>The press, incapable of suggesting an idea, and
                        only equal to the task of adding fuel to the flame, with no power to
                        suppress it, and our Senators and Congressmen apathetic and indifferent,
                        Virginia of 1860 presents a painful and humiliating contrast to the Virginia
                        of other days. We shall look for some comprehensive plan from Governor
                        Letcher in his message to the extra session of the Legislature. We discover
                        in his inaugural address the true idea on which to base action. We trust he
                        will again recommend it, and elaborate the propositions presented.</p>
