                    <p>MURDER.</p>
                    <p>On Thursday night last, Mr. Benj. Thacker, living a few miles east of
                        Balesville, in this county, was shot and killed while asleep in his bed. He
                        was an inoffensive old man, between 65 and 70 years of age, and deaf and
                        partially blind. Pryor Wood, James Wood, alias Sprouse, and Mary Sprouse, a
                        girl of 17 years of age, have been arrested and lodged in jail, charged with
                        the murder. A called Court will sit on Tuesday next to examine into the
                        charge. The principal witness against them is a little girl seven years old,
                        who states that Thacker was shot with a short gun, (rifle.)</p>

                    <p>Central Railroad.</p>
                    <p>We understand that a paper is now in circulation in this community for the
                        signature of the stockholders in the Central R. R., the object of which is
                        to request the President and Directors of that Road to call a meeting of the
                        Stockholders to take into consideration the matter of Sunday mails. It is
                        proposed by this paper to inquire into and decide upon the policy of running
                        the cars to Gordonsville, and then stopping them there on Sunday, and to
                        discuss the expediency of discounting Sunday trains altogether, or if Sunday
                        trains are to be run, to ascertain why it is they cannot be continued to
                        Staunton, where the mails diverge more generally than at any other point
                        between Richmond and Covington. Our people have borne this discrimination
                        against them until it has become intolerable. We intend to act in the
                        matter, and if the inconvenience cannot be remedied in one way it may be in
                        another.</p>
                    <p>It requires one-tenth of the stock of the Company to call a meeting of the
                        stockholders. This can easily be obtained, and then we can have a full
                        discussion and examination into the matter.</p>
