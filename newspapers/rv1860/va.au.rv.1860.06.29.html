<b>Effort to Crush Out Judge Douglas</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator claims that efforts are underway to crush Douglas by
                    misrepresenting his positions, especially in the South. The paper warns
                    Democrats to ignore such lies, since "a truer friend of the South has never
                    breathed the air of a free State. . . . No man of all the Northern statesmen has
                    made so many sacrifices for the South as he has made."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Protection to Slavery in the Territories</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The advocates of a slave code in the territories deny that the "question of
                    protection to slavery in the Territories is a judicial question, and they will
                    not consent to leave the matter to be decided by the Courts." The Times
                    disagrees with this stand and argues that it is "unable to see how the South is
                    to avoid submitting the question to the courts for final arbitrament. She cannot
                    avoid it if she would."<br>

<b>A Great Invention</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Waddells of Staunton have invented a new car couple, which is designed
                    to unite railroad cars easily.<br>(Names in announcement:  L. WaddellJr.,  Wm. H. Waddell)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A Great Invention</p>
                    <p>L. Waddell, Jr., and Wm. H. Waddell, of this place, have within a few days
                        patented a 'car couple," which is destined, in the opinion of all practical
                        men, who have examined it, to supersede all other contrivances for uniting
                        railroad cars.</p>
                    <p>The invention is most ingenious, simple in construction, and strong. We will
                        not undertake to describe it. But this much we can say, that by its use a
                        train of any number of cars can be coupled by simply backing them
                        together--and a boy ten years old, standing upon the platform of a passenger
                        car, or on top of a freight car, out of all danger, can uncouple a single
                        car, or an entire train, either when in motion or standing still--on a level
                        or on a grade--No backing or 'stacking up" of the train is necessary before
                        uncoupling. And by the use of this invention, an engineer seeing danger
                        ahead, could detach the whole train as easily and as quickly as he could
                        sound the steam whistle, and thus prevent a catastrophe, from dragging the
                        train after the locomotive off the track, or over an obstruction.</p>
                    <p>In the hands of a yankee this patent right would be an immense fortune. We
                        understand that our townsman, J.D. Imboden, Esq., has purchased an interest
                        in it, and the exclusive right for five years to control and sell the patent
                        right throughout the United States. Mr. Imboden is now in Richmond, making
                        arrangements to put it upon all the Railroads in Virginia, and in a few days
                        will proceed to Baltimore to have it tried upon the Baltimore and Ohio
                        Railroad.</p>
                    <p>This is a great Southern invention, and we hope to
                        see it come as speedily into universal use as it would if some yankee had
                        discovered it.</p>

                        President and Vice President, which resulted in the unanimous choice of John

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For the Vindicator, Churchville, June 21, 1860</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor, Respected Sir: The action of the last General Conference on the
                        subject of slavery has created a profound sensation throughout this entire
                        valley. We shall not stop to inquire whether the people in many portions of
                        our Conference acted prematurely, or whether they should have waited
                        patiently the action of our next Annual Conference. Neither is it necessary
                        to discuss the question as to the meaning of the new chapter on
                        slavery--whether it be statutory or advisory--is a matter of small moment
                        just now. It is enough for us to know, that in any light in which it may be
                        regarded, it is sufficiently offensive to our people to require some action
                        upon our part, before the sitting of the Annual Conference in Staunton. The
                        necessity is upon us, and willing or unwilling, we must meet it, and do so
                        promptly. Neither will it be profitable to animadvert upon the course of our
                        delegates, the editor of the Baltimore Advocate, or any other of our
                        brethren. They are all doubtless good men and true, having the same great
                        object in view-- the glory of God, and the welfare of our beloved Methodism.
                        In a word, an question that is at all calculated to widen the breach that
                        now unhappily divides us, should be ignored, and the one great effort should
                        be to bring about a unity of feeling and action; otherwise, we are torn into fragments, and a state of things
                        heretofore unknown upon the border realized. Our only hope, as we humbly
                        conceive, is in concert of action. Whatever is done by us, let it be done as
                        a whole. Such is my confidence in the Baltimore Conference as a whole, that
                        I would be willing, almost unconditionally, to
                        say "thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God." Never were mortals
                        more deceived, than we should be did she violate her solemn pledge made at
                        the last session in Winchester. But she will not, nay,
                            she cannot.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, let me suggest that we hold a Convention just as soon as the
                        necessary steps can be taken to secure one; and in order that we may act in
                        unison, let each circuit and station hold a meeting, composed of laymen, whose sole business it shall be to appoint
                        delegates to a District Convention--let there be at least 2 delegates to
                        each circuit and station--let it also be understood that no definite action,
                            as it regards a separation from the M.E.
                        Church, is even contemplated by the District Conventions, their main
                        and perhaps their sole business being to determine on a General Convention,
                        indicating the time and place for the same. We may discuss any question that
                        may be deemed legitimate, and in this way let off the
                            steam by the meeting of the General Convention. But our final
                        action should embrace alone the items referred to. Some may ask what good
                        these District Conventions will do, if nothing definite is accomplished
                        looking toward a separation from the North? We reply, much, every way, in
                        addition to taking off the gas, (and of course we
                        mean no offense by this remark) we can, by this convening together, come to
                        some definite understanding among ourselves before the meeting of the
                        General Convention, and be prepared to act as a unit. This we conceive to be
                        the great advantage to be derived from District Conventions. It has been
                        suggested that the Presiding Elders meet and consult with a view to District
                        or a General Convention. To this there can, in our judgment, be no
                        objection, provided they have a meeting at an early day.</p>
                    <p>It may be proper, before we close, to remark that so far as our membership is
                        concerned, they have the utmost confidence in the integrity of the Baltimore
                        Conference, and most of them, (perhaps all,) to use the language of one of
                        our most prominent official members, "would suffer any earthly privation
                        rather than become the willing instrument in causing divisions among
                        ourselves. This, we believe, is the universal feeling of Churchville
                        Circuit.</p>
                    <p>Praying for the peace and unity of our beloved Methodism, we remain.</p>
                    <p>Yours respectfully,</p>
