                    <p>Editorial Correspondence.</p>
                    <p>CHARLESTON, May 1st, 1860.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday was a stormy and rather significant day in the Convention. For
                        several days previous, a conflict of talent, tactics and endurance had been
                        progressing between the Yancey extremists and fire-eaters--more properly
                        disunionists--and the peculiar friends of Judge Douglas, relative to a
                        Platform. Yesterday that contest was brought to a crisis by the defeat of
                        the disunionists, and the adoption of the Cincinnati Platform. Before this
                        was announced six of the Southern States--Alabama, South Carolina, (in
                        part,) Arkansas, (in part,) Louisiana, (in part,) Texas and Florida, retired
                        from the Convention.</p>
                    <p>The position of Virginia, as always heretofore, is looked to with interest by
                        the other Middle slave-holding States, and her action will doubtless have a
                        conservative influence with the discordant elements of the Convention.
                        Alabama, with Yancey as the leader, came here pledged to a certain course,
                        with arrogant demands for certain concessions, the refusal of which was
                        predetermined by her to be cause sufficient for retiring. The demands were
                        inexpedient and impolite, looking more to a sectional triumph than to the
                        formation of a basis of national fraternization. Being pledged, as she was,
                        then, to this extreme demand, and occupying no grounds upon which she could
                        be approached, or from which she could recede with honor or self-respect, it
                        was a matter of regret, as well as protest, on the part of the delegates
                        from the Tenth Legion District, and R. H. Glass and James Barbour, that
                        Virginia should, by tangible action, encourage and nurse the refractory and
                        obstinate little State, and her deluded followers. This was done, however,
                        under the ill-advised, ill-digested and suicidal counsels of Mr. Brannon
                        from Lewis county; who made a motion, through the State delegation, to
                        appoint a committee of one to meet the disunion States. The whole game was
                        to tie the Middle slaveholding States--and especially Virginia--to the tail
                        of Alabama, (!) and thus backed, for Alabama to take the bit in her mouth.
                        The short-sightedness of Mr. Hunter's peculiar guardians in the Virginia
                        delegation, entrapped them completely, and placed them in the humiliating
                        position of shifting their position, and exhibiting inconsistencies most
                        glaring, and vastly damaging to Mr. Hunter. This whole movement was bitterly
                        opposed in caucus by both the delegates from 11th District, and Mr. Glass,
                        of Lynchburg. But numbers prevailed. Had the Convention proceeded to the
                        nomination of candidates for President and Vice President, at first, instead
                        of the formation of a platform, as was the wish and policy of your
                        delegates, Mr. Hunter, ere this, would have been the nominee. Those,
                        however, who claimed the direction of his interests, deemed that course
                        unwise and have thus destroyed all hope of his success. Douglas has a
                        majority in the Convention now determined either
                        to give the nomination, or take it.--They have power to indicate the men, if it is
                        impossible to nominate Douglas.</p>
                    <p>The ostensible cause of the difference between the members from the different
                        sections of the country, is mythical and speculative. It is strange, too,
                        that heretofore, differences of opinion upon the territorial question, as
                        well as others of far greater magnitude, have been tolerated, but that at
                        this time a straight-laced demand must be made for the concession of an
                        abstract idea, the granting of which can be of no possible good to us, but
                        of certain political death to our Northern friends. It would not be worth
                        the paper upon which it was written to declare the doctrine by this
                        Convention of Congressional intervention. No Congress would ever attempt to
                        interfere in the domestic affairs of a Territory for the protection of the
                        rights of the South. But it is a possible case, if the right so to do is
                        declared, that it may be exercised by an unfriendly Congress greatly to the
                        detriment of our interests. Let the question rest undisturbed and our
                        Northern friends will be able to carry the elections in the Northern and
                        North-western States, and thus place votes in
                        Congress for our protection, instead of having abstract notions written down
                        on paper. This is the census year. The Legislatures must be elected, which
                        will re-district the States, and if the Black Republicans secure the
                        Legislatures, it is hardly reasonable to suppose that a Democratic District
                        will remain in the whole North-west. Then, would it not be better to leave
                        abstractions alone, by which we will defeat the Northern Democracy, than to
                        insist upon a theoretical and speculative idea that can bring us no
                        practical benefit?</p>
                    <p>It has really been a source of humiliation to Virginians to witness the scene
                        of Virginia being led by Alabama, and this too through the instrumentality
                        of a few men who claim to be par excellence the friends of her favorite son,
                        R. M. T. Hunter. This gentleman might well exclaim, "save me from my
                        friends." Those delegates who have been the substantial friends of Mr.
                        Hunter, and whose policy, if it had been adopted, would have eventuated in
                        his nomination, are James Barbour, of Culpepper--the ablest of Virginia's
                        young men--R. H. Glass, the talented editor of the Lynchburg Republican, and
                        the delegates from 11th Electoral District. These gentlemen have stood firm
                        to the declared policy of the Virginia Democracy, while others have loaned
                        themselves to the extremist suggestions and actions, thus co- operating with
                        those who have brought upon us the present distracted and unhappy state of
                        affairs here. They will have to meet their constituents, for the people of
                        Virginia have never, and will never, until better cause is given than now,
                        resort to any fanatical steps to disturb the Harmony of the Union, or
                        distract the Democratic organization. The People, I am satisfied, of the old
                        Tenth Legion, will stand firm to the Democratic Flag, keep untarnished its
                        folds, and give a hearty support to the nominations which may be made by the
                        National Democratic Convention at Charleston.</p>
                    <p>It is the purpose of your delegates to remain in the Convention as long as it
                        is in session, and vote the sentiments of their constituents. That will be
                        the position of others--a majority of the delegation,--let the result and
                        the consequences be what they may. It is gratifying to us to find that after
                        running out after strange gods, the whole delegation had to come back to our
                        position, and vote for the Cincinnati Platform, thus vindicating the course
                        of your delegates, and Messrs. Glass and Barbour, and the wisdom of their
                        policy. It is strange to see the lick spittles and pimps of the present
                        administration, such as Bright and Bigler--coalescing with Yancey and his
                        leigeman. Can these men have a truer regard for the interests of the South,
                        than Virginians themselves? In short, the essence of the whole of this
                        disturbance and rebellion is opposition to Judge Douglas. Bigler, Bright,
                        and Shedell are here, scheming and plotting for the defeat of Douglas, and
                        nothing, however dishonorable and humiliating to the sense of gentlemen, is
                        left undone to effect that end. Were Douglas out of the way, they would not
                        care for a platform; nor would they much care as to the man placed upon it.
                        It is war upon Douglas.</p>
                    <p>I will take pleasure, hereafter, in ventilating the action of some of the
                        Virginia delegation, who have both injured Mr. Hunter, and misrepresented
                        the State. The time has come for better men to take the place of a few
                        tricksters, and by this means, restore the old Commonwealth to her true
                        position in the family of States.</p>
                    <p>The seceding States organized a separate Convention last night; and invited
                        Fernando Wood, of New York, to participate. It is said this morning, that
                        Davis of Miss., and Bright, of Ind., will be nominated by them. I still
                        think, however, that they will come back to the original Convention, and
                        participate in its proceedings. Of this, however, you will be informed, by
                        telegraph, before this reaches you.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible at this writing to predict when we will get away from
                        Charleston.</p>
