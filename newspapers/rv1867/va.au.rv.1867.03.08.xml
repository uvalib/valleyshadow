                    Louisiana. Planters describe them as "good laborers and sober men" who are

                    will perform any task so long as the "contracts passed are carried to the

                    for harsh measures" to be imposed on the South. It suggests that they are either
                    "the fawning sycophants who have eulogized the South in the day of its power" or
                    "fierce fanatics who have breathed vengeance and destruction for years."</summary>

                    the Southern Military Reconstruction bill, despite the fact that it failed to
                    block the passage of the legislation, and describe his message as "an able and
                    dignified document" that "lays bare, with a master hand, the enormities of the
                    enacted reconstruction scheme."</summary>

                <summary>Notes that the election commissioners in Alexandria refused to allow blacks
                    to vote in the municipal election held on March 5 because they "were not
                    entitled to the right of suffrage, until the State is reconstructed by a
                    Convention." The total white vote was 735, yet, had the black vote, which
                    numbered close to 1,300, been included, the election would have surely turned
                    out different. The results are expected to be challenged.</summary>

                    sessions was so short that, in addition to the ten southern states, Congress
                    began without representatives from California, Kentucky, Tennessee, Connecticut,
                    New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, who have yet to arrive in Washington.</summary>

                <summary>Reports that Martin H. Lotts was caught attempting to break out of jail.
                    Having failed in a bid to escape once before by "burning through the floor of
                    his cell," Lotts employed a different method this time. Armed with several fine
                    saws and a file that his wife smuggled into the prison in a pair of shoes, Lotts
                    succeeded at cutting through the bars on his window, but as he was about to flee
                    a cell-mate, Alex W. Greaver, intervened. The ensuing fight drew the attention
                    of the guards who "came to the rescue and safely secured the would-be-fleeting
                    Lotts."</summary>
