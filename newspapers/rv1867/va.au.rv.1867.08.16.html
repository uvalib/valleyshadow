<b>The Model Wife</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article contains an abstract of a preacher's sermon that lists the
                    characteristics of a woman worth making a wife. His model,of coursef is based
                    upon a biblical portrait of femininity, which he suggests is more suited to the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Rev. Dr. Willets delivered one of the series of lecturers before the
                        Young Men's Association of this city, the past winter.--His subject -- the
                        Model Wife -- was treated in such a way as to excite teh applause of all the
                        large audience present. One of our daily papers furnishes the following
                        abstract of the lecture:</p>
                    <p>The modesty of woman's nature causes us to overlook her influence on mankind,
                        because they are silent, like the moisture which nourishes the flower and
                        the tree. And how the world fails to see this. Mankind only looks at that
                        which makes a noise and fuss in the world; and too few recognize the worth
                        of a good woman. That sweet spirit presiding over the home, is an object of
                        reverence. It is a significant fact that the most complete picture in the
                        Bible, is the portraiture of a model wife, which is beautifully portrayed in
                        the Book of Proverbs. In that picture, there is no mention of idleness; she
                        is industriousness; she not only attends to her duties, but she sets the
                        example of industry. A foolish and pernicious idea has crept into society
                        that work should be done only by the common people. Now-a-days young ladies
                        try to look like the lily; and like the lily, "they toil no, neither do they
                        spin, yet Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these." In
                        ancient times, the wives of Emperors brought to their husbands, the
                        productions wrought by their own hands. If our fair sisters would have their
                        checks glowing with health, let them be industrious like the Empresses of
                        classic times. I would say "Buy a broom;" make yourself useful; make the
                        bread, and be ready for the day of need. Taste
                        and neatness should be practiced. A neat wife will refine the roughest
                        specimen of a man. All these shiney-faced fellows have model wives who did
                        not come from the Lord, like the one mentioned in the Bible, but probably
                        they came from the other place; such women arouse all of the asperities of a
                        man's nature. Some persons may think that little matters of cleanliness and
                        neatness, are trivial; but a neglect of them is like a canker sore upon the
                        life. By this, I do mean an extreme fastidinous in household matters, and a
                        superfluity of dress, so that one is compelled to agree with the Yankee,
                        who, on meeting one of our fashionable dressed belles in the street,
                        exclaimed: "Wal, there may be some humanity in that ar bundle of dry goods;
                        but its mighty leetle! If men are gay deceivers, I'd like to know what the
                        women are?"</p>
                    <p>There is such a thing as industry without good management. There are those
                        who ar busy from morning to night, and yet fal in the essential elements of
                        a well regulated household. A learned Judge comprehended the idea of proper
                        management in the kitchen, when he had inscribed on his wife's tombstone,
                        "She was an excellent woman and a good cook" And
                        the old deacon who attnded a religious convention, caught teh spirit of the
                        same idea, for on being questioned as to what kind ot ime he had, he said,
                        "Very good; and such puddings." I like to hear a
                        man brag about the manner in which his wife can get up things for the table.
                        It shows that she has the faculty of gumption, by
                        which she can accomplish wonders. A woman may have all the [unclear] and
                        music, and French, and if she have no gumption, she is not worth much. A
                        good wife sees that her household are producers and her husband does not
                        have to do a dishonorable thing to meet expenses which accrue from her
                        carelessness. A despondent man finds, in her cheerful co-operations, just
                        the sympathy which he needs, and he is not wise who does not counsel with
                        her in matters of importance. If he is threatened with reverses, why should
                        he not confide inher who can more fully understand him than any one else?
                        She is but his other half. Women have an instinctive judgement. God has
                        given them an inactive perception. Yet some men say, "what do women know
                        about business? Let them attend to the babies."</p>
                    <p>A good wife stretches out her hand to the afflicted poor. This diamond of
                        mercy is the central jewel in the coronet of goodness.--The most unnatural
                        thing in the world is a very woman who, having the means, does not relieve
                        the poor. In this sphere of charity she can escape compare with man. It was
                        not woman who slept in the garden of Gethseman; it was not woman who refused
                        to follow Christ to the cross; but it was woman who poured out her tears and
                        Him who washed His feet with the hair of her head.</p>
                    <p>It is important to take care of the tongue and temper. We should see twice as
                        much as we say. Some wives' tongues, however, are like race horses, the
                        lighter the load the faster they run. And by this continual fretting, they
                        make men's lives burdens to them; and when death puts the seal of silence
                        upon them, husbands can say with the bereaved clergyman who preached his
                        better-half's funeral sermon; pointing to the coffin, said he:</p>
                    <p>"There the wicked cease from troubling;" and then
                        placing his hands on his heart, "here the weary
                        are at rest." Others may not be veritable scolds, and there is the real
                        throne of her power. In the retired realms of the domestic life, character
                        is formed, and heaven has given to her the mission of taking the whole
                        world, in its infancy, and shaping it. God has created her to the highest
                        sphere in the world; and infinite goodness pillows the infant's head upon
                        its mother's breast. The fruit of this is the honor of the household; and
                        from high places come back praises her.</p>
                    <p>There are some who think that they should leave home and take teh stump. But,
                        oh, what a mistake. All great and good men have had domestic mothers, whose
                        presence has been the controlling power fo their after lives. When John
                        Adams was Minister to Hague, he took his son, John Quincy Adams, then a lad
                        of great promise, with him. At a dinner party, some one toasted John Quincy
                        for his wonderful talents. The father arouse to his feet, and, in response,
                        with eyes filled with tears, replied; "Gentlemen, I thank you for the
                        respect shown my son. John Quincy has a mother! has a mother!" And that
                        mother, in a letter to her boy, actually shaped and developed his great
                        life; and no man knew that so well as he.</p>
                    <p>The last words of Henry Clay, as death was stealing over him, were,
                        "Mother--mother--mother." She had died fifty years before, but her name was
                        the first on his lips in childhood, and the last in death. And so woman is
                        the morning and evening star of life.</p>

                    <p>The colored people general ar vbery sensitive upon teh matter of the terms
                        commonly employed to descrive or to distinguish them from the white race.
                        The subject should not trouble them at all, seeing that no particular same
                        whatever can be applied to them which will in all respects meet the ease.
                        The word "freedmen" will not answer because all are not freedmen.--The word
                        "colored" will not apply to them any more than it would to teh so-called
                        white race; neither black nor white being "colors," but decided negatives.</p>
                    <p>Taking the comprehensiveness of teh term in view, the white people have more
                        colore than the black, and if either should be called "colored" it ought to
                        be the former. It is a distinction, however, of which the white people are
                        not disposed to rob the latter.</p>
                    <p>The term "negro" cannot apply to all, while it does apply to some, as we find
                        it defined as "one of the black, woolly-headed, flat-nosed, and thick-lipped
                        race of men inhabiting Africa." We showed the other day teh word "Sambo" to
                        mean teh "offspring the mulatto and the negro;" and "mulatto means the
                        offspring of parents one of whom is white and the other black. "Cuffee,"
                        another common term is doubtless derived from the word Caffree, an
                        inhabitant of one of countries of Southern Africa. And inasmuch as the
                        mixture which pervades them as a people, is in the way, they cannot
                        legitimately be styled Africans. to be nice and particular in designating
                        them, therefore we must call each after the name which histroy and the
                        dictionary have given him.--None of their names have any other than a
                        serious and actual significance, however unpleasant they may sound on
                        account of their associations. If however there must be one particular
                        appellation, what shall it be? --Exchange.</p>

                    second district (Staunton) and added 13 others. The tally for the third district
                    (Middlebrook) has yet to be reported, but it is not believed to be much
                    different than the previous count.<br>
