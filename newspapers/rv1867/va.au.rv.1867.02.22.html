<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In Washington, say the editors, Congress is debating a number of amended
                    versions of Stevens's Reconstruction bill. Though it is "useless" to speculate
                    on the various proposals, since so many have been put forth, one thing is
                    certain: none of them bears "even a tittle of justice to the brave though
                    conquered South."<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In our last issue we gave the substance of the Stevens Military
                        Re-construction bill and the bill proposed by Elliott for the
                        re-organization of the Government of Louisiana, which was thought to be a
                        favorite and which would be used as a precedent and would be applied to all
                        the Southern States. Since that time, an amendment to the Stevens bill,
                        styled the Blaine amendment, has been the popular scheme for
                        re-construction, which in turn has given way to the Sherman substitute for
                        the Stevens bill, which has been adopted by a vote of 29 to 10 in the United
                        States Senate. We publish the tenor of this substitute elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>It is useless to speculate on the various bills offered in Congress, which
                        look to reconstructing the South, so various and in such rapid succession
                        are they offered. There is one thing, however, we can not fail to notice,
                        that no bill is offered which bears upon its face even a title of justice to
                        the brave though conquered South. It would naturally seem that a victorious
                        people should forget the malignity begotten by war, and the rather seek to
                        re-instate the prosperity and foster a tendency to unity of feeling and
                        interest among the whole people than to keep discovered vast sections,
                        which, under a united government, must necessarily rely on each other for
                        their financial prosperity. Our experience has taught us the reverse. The
                        endeavor of the victors in our late war, through their representatives, has
                        been to keep dissevered rather than unite the once hostile sections of our
                        country. Whether for the sake of party -- for the purpose of pandering to
                        fanatical Northern majorities, or pure malignity, or all combined, it is
                        nevertheless so. We must accept it as it is, having no voice in, much less
                        power to control the conduct of affairs, and wait with patience until a
                        malignant fanaticism shall, as it will, over-leap itself, and in the effort
                        to destroy our liberties, awaken the North to the dangers of its own and to
                        the necessity of preserving constitutional liberty on this continent,
                        whether it enures to the advantage of so-called "Rebels" or not. If this
                        result does not follow then indeed did the once boasted constitutional
                        liberty of this country expire with the dying throes of the Confederacy, and
                        has been forever buried by the self-styled defenders of a Constitutional
                        Union.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discussing the conflict between West Virginia and Virginia over the
                    creation of the former, the editors maintain the counties of Berkley and

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the Senate of West Virginia on Tuesday last, Mr. Hoke, from the Judiciary
                        Committee "reported a substitute for Senate resolution No. 9, authorizing
                        the Governor to appoint Commissioners to treat with the authorities of
                        Virginia on the subject of the public debt, which says the Commissioners are
                        not to treat with the Virginia Commissioners until it is decided in the
                        Courts whether Virginia has a right to the counties of Berkeley and
                        Jefferson, or until Virginia relinquishes all claims on her part to the said
                        counties in dispute are turned over the rightful jurisdiction of Virginia,
                        when every white male, over 21 years of age, irrespective of past political
                        sentiments, is entitled to vote, and hence the substitute offered by him.
                        It's no use kicking. These counties must come back to the old fold and West
                        Virginia must pay her just share of the State debt.</p>
