<b>Whiskey From Cornstalks</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article states that a Virginian has invented a still that makes whiskey
                    using corn stalks, which, as a consequence, will save an immense quantity of
                    grain and potatoes since those are the ingredients currently used to make
                    liquor.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 28th of the present month letters patent will be issued at Washington
                        to Messrs. James Neely and --- Allen of Buckingham county, Virginia, for th
                        manufacture of alcoholic spirits from a material heretofore regarded as
                        worthless.</p>
                    <p>By this valuable and important addition to modern sciences, an immense
                        quantity of grain and potatoes, of which ardent spirits are now
                        manufactured, will be saved for the natural uses for which they were
                        intended.</p>
                    <p>The invention is no less beneficial than extraordinary and surprising, and is
                        destined to create a revolution in the manufacture of all kinds of
                        spirituous liquors. The simple and unpretending cornstalk, when shorn of its
                        ears and fodder, formerly rubbish and even beneath the notice of a hungry
                        horse or cow, has been found by the inventor to possess every necessary
                        qualification for the distillation of liquor of a superior quality and
                        flavor. To the genius of Mr. James Neely, of Buckingham, is the country
                        indebted for this wonderful discovery, and we are happy to say that both the
                        government officers in Washington and distillers in the North who tested his
                        samples, have not only given the most flattering assurances of the great
                        value and importance of his invention, but have also congratulated him as
                        the fortunate possessor of such a secret.</p>
                    <p>The usual process of distilling is all that will be required in the
                        manufacture of the new material into ardent spirits; no additional expense
                        is incurred, while, on the contrary, it will prove a source of great
                        revenue, and a blessing to the country--the evil will in future have this
                        much a modification. Added to this, the culture of corn will now become
                        doubly valuable, and the farmer will realize from the sale of his stalks
                        nearly an additional half of the usual proceeds from his corn crop.</p>
                    <p>The sample of the article we have seen, which was manufactured in October
                        last, is all that the inventor claims for it, and unlike some of our
                        expensive brands of whisky readily mixes with water--not evincing that oily
                        nature so often seen in fine liquors, and which has always precluded the
                        possibility of making what is generally known as "good grog." This quality,
                        we may add, most particularly recommended it to Commissioner Rollins and the
                        Executive Department at Washington. Several capitalists from the North have
                        already made propositions an extensive business next fall, but as yet no
                        plans of a definite nature have been agreed upon, though many are projected.
                        We expect to hear that some of our Richmond distillers will secure the right
                        for the use of this invention in this State.--Richmond
                            Times.</p>
