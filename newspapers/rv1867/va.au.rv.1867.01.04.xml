                <summary>The article relates that a woman named Francis F. Sigel, who joined the
                    army after disguising herself as a man, has applied to the Pay Department for
                    "back pay for her services in the Western armies as a cavalryman." Sigel
                    enlisted in the 13th Missouri with her husband in 1861 and fought for two years
                    until she was wounded at the Battle of Shiloh, at which time her sex was
                    discovered and she was discharged. The piece describes Sigel as having
                    "contracted all the rude airs, attitudes and manners of a man."</summary>

                    twenty-one years in prison for committing a felony, the Supreme Court is
                    expected to rule whether Alabama is a state or territory, a decision with
                    considerable implications for the current debate over reconstruction.</summary>

                    year so as to "return to our former prosperous condition." They point to the
                    emergence of "Cotton and Woolen Factories, Machine Shops, Forges and Furnaces,
                    Rolling Mills &amp;c., which have sprung into existence in the South" as
                    industries that have paved the way to fostering greater independence for the

                <summary>The editors lament that Christmas was difficult for all southerners this
                    past year, particularly the former slaves who, burdened with new
                    responsibilities since gaining their freedom, no longer have money to spend on
                    frivolous purchases. Because blacks had nothing to do with the changes, and "are
                    destined never to return to their former happy condition," the editors avow, "we
                    can only feel for and sympathize with them, and sorrow over their unhappy fate,
                    and wish them happier Christmas holidays in the future than the sad and joyless
                    one just past."</summary>
