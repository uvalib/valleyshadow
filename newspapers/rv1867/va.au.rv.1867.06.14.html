<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors remind readers of the importance of registering to vote, and
                    examine some of the provisions contained in Gen. Scholfield's proclamation on
                    voter eligibility. Evidently there is considerable confusion over who is
                    actually disfranchised.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We again called attention last week to the necessity of all, who are not
                        disfranchised registering their names as voters, when called upon to do so
                        by the Boards of Registration. In this issue we publish the notice, of the
                        President of the Board, that registration will be commenced, in District No.
                        1 and 2, Staunton, and District No. 3, Middlebrook, on June 22nd, to-morrow
                        one week, and continue until and including June 29th, Sunday excepted. The
                        time for registering, revising the lists and reporting to the commandant of
                        the State is short and we desire to impress upon all the necessity of
                        promptly presenting themselves for registration.</p>
                    <p>There are also several points to which we desire particularly to call the
                        attention of our people. There will be but one place of registration in each
                        magisterial District, and consequently but one place of voting, and no one
                        can vote except at the place he registers. Each one is, therefore, expected
                        to register in his magisterial District, where he must vote.</p>
                    <p>there will be two lists, one for those who are registered as voters, and
                        another for those who are rejected or are considered doubtful, with the
                        reasons therefor. The latter we may call the doubtful list, and upon which
                        we advise all, who are uncertain whether they are disfranchised, or are
                        rejected, to have their names placed and let the matter be decided by the
                        commandant of the State. In this way many will be allowed ultimately to
                        register as voters, who are inclined to believe they are disfranchised.</p>
                    <p>We desire also to remove the impression that any one who aided the rebellion
                        is, therefore, disfranchised. We publish the order of Gen. Schofield in our last issue, from which this
                        conclusion was erroneously drawn, in the 3rd paragraph of which he
                        distinctly says that no one is disfranchised for participation in the
                        rebellion, unless he previously was either a
                        member of Congress or officer of the United States, civil or military, and
                        as such took an oath to support the Constitution of the United States, or
                        was a member of any State Legislature, or executive or judicial officer of
                        any State and afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion against or
                        gave aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States, or has been
                        convicted of felony against the laws of any State or of the United States.
                        He then proceeds to define the executive and judicial officers of a State to
                        be "Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Auditor of Public
                        Accounts, 2nd Auditor, Register of the Land Office, State Treasurer,
                        Attorney General, Judges of the Supreme Court of Appeals, Judges of the
                        Circuit Courts, Judge of the Court of Hustings, Justices of the County
                        Courts, Mayor, Recorder and Alderman of any city or incorporated town, who
                        are ex-officio Justices, Coroners of towns and
                        counties, Escheators, Inspectors of tobacco, flour and other commodities."</p>
                    <p>No all who held any one of these offices before the war and afterwards gave
                        aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States and all who have been
                        convicted of felony are disfranchised, but no one is disfranchised for
                        aiding in any way in the late war, unless he previously held one of the
                        offices which General Schofield enumerates, as given above by us, and all
                        such can take the oath required, which we publish again for the information
                        of our people, and is as follows:</p>
                    <p>"I ---, do solemnly swear, or affirm, in the presence of Almighty God, that I
                        am a citizen of the State of ---; that I have resided in said State for ---
                        months next preceding this day, and now reside in the county of ---, or the
                        parish of ---, in said State, as the case may be; that I am 21 years old;
                        that I have not been disfranchised for participation in any rebellion or
                        civil war against the United States, nor for felony committed against the
                        laws of any State or of the United States; that I have never been a member
                        of any State Legislature, nor held any executive or judicial office in any
                        State, and afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the
                        United States or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof; that I have
                        never taken an oath as a member of any State Legislature, or as an executive
                        or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United
                        States, and afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the
                        United States, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof; that I will
                        faithfully support the Constitution and obey the laws of the United States,
                        and will, to the best of my ability, encourage others so to do. So help me
                        God."</p>
                    <p>Some may think that they can not take this oath on account of swearing that
                        they have never been disfranchised for participation in the Rebellion, when
                        the Alexandria Constitution disfranchised all who aided or abetted the
                        Confederacy. We would ask all such to reflect a little and remember that
                        Congress, by its Reconstruction act, ignores that Constitution, and
                        consequently no disfranchisement under tat act could possibly be claimed.
                        The President of the Board, and Registrars in this county so hold, as Gen.
                        Schofield plainly does, for which we again refer to paragraph 3rd of his
                        order No. 34, the substance of which we quote above, that no one is
                        disfranchised, for participation in the Rebellion, (by the Alexandria
                        Constitution or any act of Congress,) unless he previously held one of the offices we have enumerated. All
                        conscientious scruples on this score must therefore, be thrown to the wind.</p>
                    <p>We have endeavored, in as concise a way as possible, to show that aiding in
                        the Rebellion, according to Gen. Schofield's order does not disfranchise any
                        one unless he previously held certain designated officers which required an
                        oath to be taken to support the Constitution of the United States, and we
                        again appeal to all as a duty they owe to themselves and posterity to come
                        forward and register, and be thereby placed in a condition thereafter to
                        exercise the right of suffrage.</p>
