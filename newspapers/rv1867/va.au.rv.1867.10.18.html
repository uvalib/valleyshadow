<b>Ohio White Boys In Blue</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article reports that a political organization named "Our Boys in Blue"
                    has been organized in Ohio. The group is composed of former soldiers who declare
                    themselves against "equalizing" and "fraternizing" with blacks. They declare
                    their motive for fighting in the late war was not to free the slaves, but to
                    "restore the Union." The piece contends that there are 30,000 other veterans in
                    New York and Brooklyn who share these sentiments.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In response to a call published in the Stanton papers, for a meeting to be
                        held in Staunton on the 12th of October, 1867, of the purpose of nominating
                        candidates for the Convention, a number of citizens, not large, but fairly
                        representing the people of all portions of Augusta county, assembled and
                        unanimously slected Joseph A. Waddell and Power Harrison to represent the
                        county, and James C. Southall, of Albemarle, to represent the District
                        compsed of Augusta, Albemarle and Louisa counties. The undersigned were also
                        appointed by said meeting a committee to prepare an adress to the voters of
                        Augusta.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harrison and Mr. Waddell are both too well known, and their character adn
                        capacity too highly appreciated by our people, to need that the action of
                        the meeting, in choosing them, should be vindicated. As the white majority
                        in the counties of Augusta, Albermarle and Louisa is large enough to elect a
                        conservative delegate, by concentrating the entire white vote upon a single
                        candidate, who it was believed, would command the vote of Albemarle and
                        Louisa. Mr. James Southall, the Editor of the Charlottesvilee Chronicle, who
                        is efficiently using his great abilities in the interests of conservativism,
                        and who is extensively and favorably know in these counties, seemed most
                        available for ensuring their vote, and at the same time acceptable to the
                        people of Augusta.--It is believed that he will unite the entire
                        conservative vote of the District, and thus defeat the election of a
                        radical. It cannot be expected that each voter should have his first choice.
                        Concert of action is indispensable, and can only be secured in teh way
                        provided by the meeting -- the people fairly
                        represented [unclear] held after full and
                            fair notice, men have been nominated who are
                        known to be good and true and suitable.</p>
                    <p>The election of good men can now only be secured
                        by uniting upon those nominees.--Then let every conservative, every anti-radical come himself, and use all his
                        influence in inducing others to come, and vote for the conservative
                        nominees.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Seeking to dispel the notion that a return to power by the Democrats would
                    result in the re-enslavement of blacks, the editors contend the "villainous
                    parties" responsible for this rumor are simply trying "to force the colored
                    people, as a body, to vote the radical ticket."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We learn that some villainous parties are endeavoring to impress it upon the
                        colored people that with the return fo the Democrats to power they will be
                        reverted to slavery.--This is perfectly fallacious and is resorted to by
                        mean white scoundrels and black ignoramuses to force the colored people, as
                        a body, to vote the radical ticket. When any one preaches such a doctrine to
                        you set him down as a scoundrel and avoid him as you would a plague. He
                        means to use you and then, as similar pretended friends in Ohio have just
                        done, to cast you aside. Your old masters never want you again as slaves,
                        and if the question were put to them on Tuesday next, it would be voted down
                        by a large majority. They are relieved of a burden by your emancipation and
                        they will never take up that burden again. Be satisfied of this truth an
                        kick out your presence the scoundrels, white or black, who believe you are
                        such fools as to be imposed upon and used by such idle trash.</p>
