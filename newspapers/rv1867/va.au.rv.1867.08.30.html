<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors allege that Republicans have consistently fought to prevent the
                    immigration of whites to the South as part of an effort to retain control over
                    the region. If whites were allowed to move to the South, the editors assert, it
                    would alter the balance of political power and remove the obstacles holding back

                    <p>In the Presidential Campaign of 1856 and 1860 the Republican party made their
                        great point against the institution of slavery, as keeping in "depraved
                        ignorance" millions of colored people and preventing millions of Northern
                        whites from removing to and settling in the South, the fairest and most
                        productive portion of our country. To-day slavery is removed, but this party
                        have attempted to raise a greater barrier to the migration thither of
                        Northern whites, by the elevation of that "depraved ignorance" to the
                        franchise and law making privilege.--The object is patent. Power, that
                        omnific source of evil. To retain that held at the surrender, by preventing
                        Northern immigration and by enfranchising whites, has been the cue of
                        Radicalism for two years past. The effort, however, will fail. This fair
                        land of ours will not be given over to that "depraved ignorance," so much
                        denounced in the past, and lauded as so "comprehending of loyalty and law"
                        in the present.</p>
                    <p>The unsettled condition of our country at first deterred many from coming
                        thither, but the immense advantages of our soil and climate, the magnitude
                        and variety of our resources and the character of our people will draw
                        thither a desirable immigration.--Already are we selling our Forges,
                        Furnaces, Mineral and Grazing lands to enterprising Northern men of capital;
                        who will bring others, industrious, energetic and sober like themselves, to
                        assist them in their business. The welcome these sturdy immigrants will
                        receive will dispel the illusion of our hatred to Northerners, and will
                        occasion many messages to friends at home to come and dwell with them in
                        this land abounding in rich resources, and among a sociable and hospitable
                        people.</p>
                    <p>No! the day is not distant, when our forests, silent for hundreds of years,
                        will resound with the woodsman's axe, and our water power set in motion
                        Machinery, which will add immeasurably to our wealth and occasion the
                        continued influx of a healthy population, which will partake of our feelings
                        and interests and dispel the dark cloud, which some, at present, think

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors contend that the "irrepressible conflict" between capital and
                    labor has reached a dangerous new level in the U. S., spurred on by the
                    disagreement over how to pay off government bonds.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>An irrepressible conflict is upon the country, not that proclaimed between
                        white and slave labor, which was never possible, but a conflict between
                        capital and labor, which have ever been somewhat antagonistic. More than
                        ever is it the case now. Capital holds the bonds of the Government, has
                        taken and sounded the alarm. She feels the burden of taxation yet draws
                        comparatively no interest from the bonds. New England, in the main, holds
                        them and is to that extent exempt from taxation on her capital. A little
                        cloud arose in consequence in the West, from which could be heard an earnest
                        cry for equal taxation. It has spread and increased until not only equaly
                        taxation is the cry, but payment of the bonded in greenbacks and even repudiation is heard on all sides. Just now a brisk
                        canvas is going on in some of the Western States on these issues. The
                        Democracy are making a strong effort with the over-burdened tax-payers, and
                        even some Republicans, fearing the popularity of the payment of the bonds in
                        greenbacks, are claiming it as a Radical measure. While we should dislike to
                        see repudiation, yet the conflict between bondholders and taxpayers of the
                        North is interesting. It is a fight in which we can take no hand though the
                        relief from taxation to the amount necessary to pay $150,000,000 of interest
                        on the bonds would be great indeed to us. Interest, therefore, places us on
                        the side of the taxpayers and we wish them success and a "God speed" to the
                        day when taxation will be less and money -- even greenbacks more plenty.</p>

                    <p>Do the friends of negro suffrage take into consideration the probability that
                        every negro vote will be a vote in favor of repudiation? In their anxiety to
                        confer the franchise on the freedmen, that circumstances may have been
                        overlooked. The negroes, as a race, are neither by nature or experience
                        qualified to appreciate the relations between debtor and creditor in a moral
                        point of view; and it is not likely that they will neglect an opportunity to
                        vote themselves free from the burdens of taxation. The negro rarely works
                        voluntarily, except to provide the necessities of life, and to gratify his
                        daily appetite for little luxuries. When he finds that he has to work so
                        much the harder to assist in redeeming the financial pledges of the
                        government, he will not be found on sensitive in regard to the sanctity of
                        the public national debt as to sacrifice his personal ease and comfort
                        before that crushing financial Juggernaut.</p>
                    <p>But, perhaps, the Radicals, in so zealously urging negro suffrage, have in
                        view the probability of a popular sentiment in favor of repudiation. They
                        see, perhaps, that the masses are beginning to chafe under the pressure of
                        enormous taxes. They appreciate, perhaps, the difficulty of preserving the
                        inviolability of a debt that the debtors have the powers to cancel by a
                        given number of slips of paper thrust into a ballot-box. It is yet to be
                        demonstrated that a government controlled by the popular will, in which the
                        people are sovereigns, will continue, throughout all the changes of partisan
                        sentiment and fortune, to acknowledge a public debt that drains every ounce
                        of revenue and swallows up the best part of the profits of labor. It is fair
                        to presume that, sooner or later, the rallying cry of some political party
                        will be repudiation, and in that event the partisans of that measure may
                        rely upon the negro vote.--New York News.</p>

                        great degree of ability and was almost entirely devoid of politics save and
                        except an effort to impress upon the people to reconstruct under the
                        military bill. He laid down as the basis of Republican Government the three
                        points, a general system of education, that labor should be made honorable
                        and that the avenues to employment and office should be open to all without

                        he fears a contest with Hunnicutt, from the manner in which he advised
                        against the "Wicked" being placed in office. If that is the case, he need

                        Governor has the inside track here, but then we prefer, if possible, a
                        representative Virginian as our next Governor, and are not yet prepared to
