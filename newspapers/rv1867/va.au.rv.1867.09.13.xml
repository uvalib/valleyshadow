                <summary>The article laments the fact that American farmers have yet to discover the
                    agricultural benefits of using animal bones as fertilizer. Every year, it notes,
                    "immense quantities of bones" are exported to foreign lands where they improve
                    the quality of farm land.</summary>

                    local black residents, reports the article. The melee, which almost turned into
                    a riot, started after some soldiers "badly" beat a black man who, following an
                    order issued by the local commanding officer, refused to sell them liquor. Local
                    blacks rushed to the man's rescue and "a free fight commenced." The fracas ended
                    only after a detachment of troops were called in to disperse the crowd.</summary>
