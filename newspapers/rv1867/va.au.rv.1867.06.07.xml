                <transcript>
                    <p>We have heretofore spoken of the necessity of all, who are not disfranchised,
                        registering when they are called upon to do so, and we now desire still
                        further to impress upon our people the necessity which urges to such a
                        course. We are about to see the experiment made in our midst of
                        enfranchising a whole class of uneducated people, who have not the slightest
                        idea of the subjects upon which they will be called upon to vote. We have
                        already seen that the endeavor has been made, and that they are to some
                        extent being manipulated by those who are inimical to us and them.
                        Necessitated, as we were, to bend all our energies to the recuperation of
                        our damaged fortunes and disgusted with the political phases assumed after
                        the war, we have been loth to engage in politics, and yet feel a great
                        disinclination to do so, even to the extent of registering. This latter is
                        all wrong. We have seen the Government of Maryland, Tennessee and West
                        Virginia controled by a minority, who lorded it with a tyrannical hand over
                        the majority. this will be the case in Virginia if we fail to register and
                        place ourselves on an equality with this minority, but different from those
                        States, the majority here are able to prevent it, there they were not. But
                        what signifies our ability to still control the government of our State, if
                        we fail to do it? By failing to register we will surely fail to place
                        ourselves in a condition to vie with a minority for the control of the State
                        and hence the imperative necessity to register. Upon the registration of
                        voters will be apportioned representation in the Convention, if one be
                        called. If we fail to register we lose not only our weight in the
                        apportionment of representation, but the right to vote. The Attorney General
                        says after the Books of registration are closed, which must be done before
                        September, neither a name can be added as a voter nor officer. The voluntary
                        refusal of any to register may therefore, disfranchise as virtually, and
                        perhaps for all time, as if he had been disfranchised by act of Congress. We
                        have all to save and nothing to lose by registration. Then let us not fail,
                        one and all, to have our name entered on the register.</p>
                    <p>It may be thought that the white majority in the State is so large that some
                        of us need not be particular about registering. Be not deceived by this.
                        Every colored man will register. Let those, who have not been satisfied with
                        this heretofore, read the following order from General Brown, which speaks
                        for itself:</p>
                    <p>BUREAU OF REFUGEES, FREEDMEN<lb/>AND ABANDONED LANDS,<lb/>HEADQ'RS ASSISTANT
                        COMMISSIONER<lb/>STATE OF VIRGINIA<lb/>RICHMOND, Va., May 28, 1867.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">Circular Letter.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>it is reported that many of the freedmen of the State will fail to register
                        under the military bill through the agency of persons hostile to their
                        exercising the rights of suffrage.</p>
                    <p>The act to continue in force and to amend "an act to establish a bureau for
                        the relief of freedmen and refugees" requires the officer of the Bureau to
                        aid the freedmen "in making the freedom conferred upon them available to
                        themselves and beneficial to the Republic."</p>
                    <p>It is, therefore, clearly your duty to counteract, as far as possible the
                        influence of persons inimical to the freedmen registering or voting, and to
                        advise and instruct them in regard to their rights under the above named
                        bill, and the great importance of their exercising these rights. By availing
                        yourselves of the various meetings of the freedmen, and others means at your
                        command of spreading information among them, not one in the state need be
                        uninformed in regard to his right and duty in the matter.</p>
                    <p>If any freedmen fail to register through ignorance, the Bureau officer in
                        charge of the sub-district or division where such failure occurs, will be
                        considered derelict in the performance of his duty.</p>
                    <p>The opinion expressed in this letter in regard to the duties of Bureau
                        officers is in accordance with that held by Major-General Schofield,
                        commanding this district.</p>
                    <p>O. BROWN<lb/>Brvt. Brig. Gen., Ass't. Com.</p>
                    <p>No one desires to intimidate or prevent the colored people from voting,
                        however much they may regret the hallucination which has forced this upon
                        us, but it is made a pretext to have every colored man registered, without
                        even a desire expressed to have the white men of the State registered also.
                        The object is plain and patent, and if those, who have proposed to
                        themselves not to register, will reflect upon the damage to themselves and
                        posterity by such a course, they will, as sure as the time comes round,
                        present themselves and have their names recorded as voters on the books of
                        the Registrars.</p>

                <summary>The editors implore readers to register for the upcoming election. Though
                    it is generally believed that the white majority in the state is sufficiently
                    large to repulse any political challenge from blacks, the editors fear political
                    apathy among whites will greatly reduce the strength of the conservative vote.</summary>

                    General Order No. 34, which sets out the criteria for suffrage eligibility.
                    Since Lee's surrender, they note, the people of Virginia have generally
                    acquiesced to the federal government's demands.</summary>

                    <p>We publish elsewhere Gen. Schofield's order, no. 31, superseding, to all
                        intents and purposes, the civil by the military authorities in this State,
                        to which we invite the attention of our readers. We are at a loss to
                        understand the treasons which induced this extraordinary order in this
                        State. Since the day of Gen. Lee's Surrender our people have quietly
                        subsided into a quiet and peaceful condition, yielding ready obedience to
                        the authorities that be, caring more to advance their own immediate private
                        interests, by a wonderful energy and industry, than to infringe the rights
                        of others, be they whites or blacks. For many long months, and long before
                        Gen. Schofield, in accordance with the Reconstruction act, was assigned to
                        the command of District no. 1 our civil tribunals have, with a marked
                        impartiality, adjudicated between all classes, according to laws adapted to
                        the changed condition of affairs, and without complaint from any source that
                        we are aware of. The civil tribunals and officers have not failed to afford
                        protection to persons in their rights of person and property and have had to
                        call on no assistance, except in a few cases, arising from the teaching of
                        bad men, who inflamed the ignorant material in the South to an extent, which
                        could only find its vent, as it did, in several riotus demonstrations, which
                        could only be suppressed by the assistance of the military. these cases have
                        arisen thro' parties, who, are not of or with the vast majority of our
                        people in sentiment and feeling, and have furnished the only reason for
                        civil officers calling in military assistance. Although it is asserted that
                        the Military Commissioners are intended only to aid and not to supersede the
                        civil authorities, except in cases of necessity,yet it seems to us to
                        virtually override the civil authority the civil authorities, the reason for
                        which will hardly transpire, unless Gen. Schofield, who heretofore seemed to
                        be greatly averse to interfering with the civil officers, should vouchsafe
                        an explanation. The reason can scarcely be arrived at otherwise by our
                        people.</p>
