                    <p>The Southern whites, and particularly the leading men among them , possess a
                        power they may not have yet realized. Such men as Wade Hampton, Henry A.
                        Wise, and others, like them, while they have not the suffrage and cannot
                        hold office, are able to exercise great influence over the negroes and
                        political affairs. There are from fifty to a hundred thousand of these
                        ostracised old leaders, who are still powerful through their intelligence
                        and position and on the stump. We advise them, then, to carry the revolution
                        which the Northern Radicals have inaugurated to its end -- to its utmost
                        limit. In doing this they should advocate sending negroes to Congress. In
                        every State and district intelligent blacks can be found. Let them be sent
                        to Congress in the proportion of the negro vote. Supposing the Southern
                        States entitled to ninety members in the House of Representatives under the
                        increased vote, thirty negroes should be sent, as that would be about a fair
                        proportion to the numbers of the two races, and out of the twenty Senators
                        six should be black by the same rule. Henry A. Wise has a fine, intelligent
                        and faithful servant, who should be sent from the Old Dominion, to sit by
                        the side of Mr. Sumner in the Senate, and that negro friend of whom Wade
                        Hampton spoke so pathetically, a noble fellow, evidently, might be seated by
                        Wilson, Chandler, Sprague or Trumbull, and be called to the chair
                        occasionally by Ben Wade, the President of the Senate. This is practicable
                        reasonable and fair, and would only be carrying out the theories already
                        established. True, the smell of the negroes might be unpleasant to the
                        dainty Northern Senators and members; but the Southerners would not find it
                        so they could have no objection to black colleagues on that score; for as
                        Yancey once said, the smell was perfume to Southerners. By all means let the
                        South carry out the theories of the Radicals to their logical results by
                        sending both negro Representatives and Senators to Congress. It would create
                        an extraordinary fermentation and reaction in the North, undoubtedly; but
                        what of that? The principle is the thing. Perish every-thing rather than
                        sacrifice principle. In whatever point of view we look at the movements now
                        going on in the South and at the position of parties with regard to the
                        issues that have been raised, we foresee that remarkable changes must take
                        place. We advise the Southerners to use the power the Radicals have placed
                        in their hands and bring the revolution to its logical end.</p>

                    over the general public in that region, the article argues that they should use

                    <p>We of the South are but illy cognizant of the importance which attaches to us
                        in the eyes of Northern men at present. Parties there are looking out to
                        secure success in the next Presidential campaign. The Northern election held
                        since the war, have generally resulted in favor of the Radicals, but with
                        decreasing majorities. Just now the tables seem to be turning and we hear on
                        all sides of Democratic and Conservative triumphs at the polls. The
                        Democratic and Conservatives are taking courage and are looking wistfully to
                        the time when a reconstructed South will add its vote to theirs and aid in
                        restoring the Government to its old Constitutional landmarks. The Radicals
                        on the other hand are trembling lest the power they have swayed so long and
                        so mercifully will be snatched from them. They begin to believe that their
                        high-handed measures will not stand the test of a fair discussion before the
                        people. They fear that the efforts to "republicanize" the South by their
                        "universal manhood suffrage" scheme is a failure, as will cast an almost
                        united vote in favor of conservatism. This fear, from the signs of the
                        times, is likely to induce them to send among us their Senators and
                        Representatives, and lesser lights of the Republican household, to stump
                        every Southern State in the interest of Radicalism. The Conservatives want
                        us reconstructed speedily to accomplish the end they desire, and rather than
                        fail would have us reconstruct under any scheme. The Radicals have gone too
                        far to retreat and will not change their plan, but hope yet by lecturers,
                        stump speakers and the like, to carry the Southern vote in favor of
                        Radicalism. They hold the power and have completely ignored the Executive,
                        as they will the Judicial Department of Government, if its decision is
                        adverse to their policy. We are, therefore, for all that we can see, doomed
                        to have universal suffrage forced upon us. With this fate before us, shall
                        we lie idly by, while Northern canvassers mould to their will the plastic
                        mind of the ignorant freedmen and thus render permanent Radical predominance
                        in this country, and more humiliating the condition of the Southern whites,
                        in that their present condition will be their future one, and for all time
                        to come? Or shall we essay to explain, truthfully and candidly to the newly
                        enfranchised their condition, which has been thrust upon them as well as
                        ourselves, and instruct them in regard to the policy they should pursue,
                        which will alike conduce to their interest and ours? We think there can be
                        no question as to our course. Already the action of prominent Southern men
                        has shown conclusively that there has ever been and is now an abiding
                        sympathy between the Southern whites an blacks, which has made the Radicals
                        doubtful of the success of their reconstruction experiment. The course we
                        have indicated and which we have advocated before can do no possible harm,
                        even should the Supreme Court decide, and speedily, against the
                        constitutionality of the reconstruction scheme an some unanticipated power
                        relieve us, and forever, of its disagreeable onus. We are therefore
                        delighted to learn that prominent gentlemen of Richmond, have accepted an
                        invitation to address the freedmen and give them solicited counsel and
                        advice: This should be done at every point, so that if vote he must he will
                        vote intelligently, which will be for his own interest and that of those who
                        have been his sympathizing friends from early childhood.</p>

                <summary>Sensing that their time has come and gone, the Radicals are forcing their
                    Reconstruction policies, including universal suffrage, on the South in order to
                    maintain their hold on power. To circumvent the Radicals' plans, the editors
                    argue white conservatives must seek an alliance with the freedmen and must not
                    oppose granting them suffrage so long as blacks "vote intelligently."</summary>

                    <p>A meeting of the colored people was held in this place on Monday night last.
                        Phillip Russell presided.</p>
                    <p>The object of the meeting is fully set forth in the Preamble and Resolutions
                        which we publish below.</p>
                    <p>Preamble and Resolution</p>
                    <p>We, the freedmen of Augusta County, is Mass Meeting Assembled, do recognize
                        in the events of the late war the judgement and mercies of Divine Providence
                        in sweeping, as with the bosom of [unclear], the foul wrong of human bondage
                        from the face of our country, and trusting to Him for guidance, we will
                        strive to use our personal and political freedom for the glory of His name,
                        and the advancement of the moral and material interests of all. And Whereas,
                        we are called upon to exercise the great privilege of the Franchise, it is
                        due to our friends in other States, as well as to our fellow citizens in
                        Virginia, that we define our political belief on the great questions of the
                        day, and seek such National political association as will add strength to
                        freedom, and also see to it that in the Constitution about to be framed for
                        the government of ourselves and posterity we ask no more than justice, nor
                        accept less than safety.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, be it Resolved,</p>
                    <p>That our grateful thanks are due to the gallant armies of the United States
                        who under Providence followed the flag of Liberty and Union until victory
                        crowned their efforts.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That we hold in reverent remembrance the
                        memories of those who fell in the cause of Freedom and especially of Abraham
                        Lincoln, "the good," the signer of our deed of emancipation, and the last
                        martyr.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That our profound gratitude is due to
                        those in the 39th Congress who, step by step, have perfected for our
                        security the legitimate fruits of successful contest.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That our late masters were not
                        themselves legally responsible for withholding from us our natural rights,
                        so we enter upon the exercise of them "with malice towards none, with
                        charity towards all."</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That we believe the principles dominant
                        in the 39th Congress to be just as well as necessary for our future
                        security, we identify ourselves, and seek affiliation with the National
                        Union Republican Association at Washington and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That believing in principles before men,
                        we will not support by our votes at the coming elections any candidates who
                        will not pledge themselves faithfully to advocate our wants and insist upon
                        what we believe to our rights, and shall enforce strict responsibility to
                        such pledges.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That we demand,</p>
                    <p>1st. That all Elections, National, State and Local, shall be by secret
                        Ballot.</p>
                    <p>2nd. That no man shall be ineligible to office by reason of sect of color.</p>
                    <p>3rd. That trial by Jury of peers is a right not to be withheld from any man,
                        and we demand admission to the Jury list as well as the Poll list.</p>
                    <p>4th. That thanking Major Gen. Scholfield for his General order No. 2. March
                        15th, 1867, we demand that the "prohibition of whipping or maiming as a
                        punishment for any crime, misdemeanor or offence," be made part of the
                        organic law of the State.</p>
                    <p>5th. That while we are willing to the utmost of our ability to bear our share
                        of the necessary burden of taxation, we demand equal distribution between
                        person and property, and that careful provision be made in the State
                        constitution, and Legislature hereafter assembled under its provisions, to
                        prevent absolutely, and forever, the payment by taxation, directly or
                        indirectly, of any debt contracted by any State or corporation for the
                        support of the late Confederacy, or the armies thereof.</p>
                    <p>6th. That believing ignorance to be the fruitful parent of crime, wrong and
                        discord, we demand extraordinary State provision for the free education of
                        the young of all classes.</p>
                    <p>7th. That we deprecate the attempt wherever, or however made, to deter us
                        from the free and untrammelled exercise of the franchise, and look with
                        contempt upon any who are willing to sell this dear bought right for "a mess
                        of pottage."</p>
                    <p>8th. That believing we ask no more than Justice and safety demand, we pledge
                        ourselves to support by our votes, men committed to the principles set forth
                        herein, and no others -- and firmly realizing that union is strength, we
                        will lay aside all private dissensions, and unite as one man in support
                        those candidates whose nominations are ratified at mass meetings to be held
                        at the call of the Executive Committee.</p>
                    <p>On motion as Executive Committee was appointed, with power to fill vacancies,
                        and it was mad part of the duties to wait upon Gen. Echols, and other
                        prominent citizens and request them to address the freedmen at such time and
                        places as may be convenient. Delegates were also appointed to the convention
                        to meet at Richmond, April 17th. Rev. N. C. Brackett, Superintendent of the
                        Freedmen's Schools, and Phillip Roselle (colored,) were chosen delegates to
                        said convention.</p>

                <summary>Before a large crowd at the Staunton Lyceum last Monday, the question "Is a
                    falsehood justifiable under any circumstances?" was determined in the
                    affirmative by a "decided majority." Next Monday, Prof. J. H. Hewitt will
                    deliver a lecture entitled "Hints to the Ladies."</summary>
