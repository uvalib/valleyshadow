                    <p>To a people desirous of peace and quiet, and who are bending all their
                        energies to that end, nothing is so unpleasant as to have their intentions
                        and acts misconstrued. The people of this State have, wisely we think,
                        abstained from political agitation and participation from affiliation with
                        any political party. The prominent men in the State have sedulously
                        endeavored to prevent party organizations, counseling whites and blacks to
                        vote for no man because of party considerations, but rather to select good,
                        honest, reliable men for all prominent positions, entirely irrespective of
                        party. Never, in a single instance, have they attempted to array class
                        against class, but have universally deprecated such a result, counseling the
                        greatest possible harmony between all classes. How totally devoid of fact
                        then is the statement made by Gov. Pierpoint, a chapter of which has come to
                        light, that "<emph rend="italic">the great moving object of the leaders in
                            Virginia, at this time, seems to be, to unite all the white men of the
                            State in one party against the colored people to vote them down</emph>."</p>
                    <p>There has been but one party in the State which has sought to array class
                        against class, and that was a small faction led by Hunnicutt, which sought
                        to build themselves up, not by arraying "whites against blacks" but the
                        blacks against the whites. The Governor exhibited little or no sympathy with
                        this faction, untill Hunnicutt unhorsed the more Conservative Republicans,
                        led by himself and Botts, and forced them to endorse him and acquiesce in
                        his platform. Now the Governor tries to throw the onus of Hunnicutt's
                        efforts on his adversaries. This is an old trick and will not win. If the
                        blacks are outvoted it will be due to efforts of those, who have endeavored
                        to array them as a class against the whites, whom the Governor endorses by
                        affiliation with them, but by no possibility can it be charged to the
                        whites, who, this day, are not united in any party. The conservative course
                        of Governor Pierpoint led us to expect better things of him, at least, that
                        he would utter no such damaging statement against so large a portion of our
                        people, the truthfulness of which can not be sustained for a moment.</p>

                            Consideration, &amp;c.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, July 15.--In reply to a resolution of the Senate, the President
                        today sent in to that body the orders, correspondence, &amp;c., with
                        military commanders, &amp;c., &amp;c., and the War Department
                        estimates regarding the amount necessary to carry out the reconstruction
                        measures.</p>
                    <p>In answer to that portion of the resolution which inquires whether the sums
                        of money heretofore appropriated for carrying these acts into effect is
                        probably sufficient, the President refers to an accompanying report of the
                        Secretary of war, and says: "It will be seen from that report that the
                        appropriation of $500,000 made in the act approved March 30, 1867, for the
                        purpose of carrying into effect the 'act to provide for the more efficient
                        government of the rebel States,' passed March 2, 1867, and the act
                        supplementary thereto, passed March 23, 1867, has already been expended by
                        the commanders of the several military districts, and that in addition, the
                        sum of $1,648,277 is required for present purposes.</p>
                    <p>It is exceedingly difficult at the present time to estimate the probable
                        expenditure of carrying into full effect the two acts of March last and the
                        bill which passed the two Houses of Congress on the 13th. If the existing
                        governments of ten States of this Union are to be deposed, and the entire
                        machinery is to be placed under the exclusive control and authority of the
                        district commanders, all the expenditures incident to the administration of
                        such governments must necessarily be incurred by the federal government. It
                        is believed that, in addition to the two millions one hundred thousand
                        dollars already expended, or estimated for, the sums which would be required
                        for the purpose should not be less than $14,000,000, the amount expended
                        prior to the rebellion in the administration of their respective governments
                        by the ten States embraced in the provisions of these acts.</p>
                    <p>This sum would no doubt be considerably augmented if the machinery of these
                        States is to be operated by the federal government, and would be largely
                        increased if the United States, by abolishing the existing State
                        governments, should become responsible for liabilities incurred by them
                        before the rebellion in laudable efforts to develop their resources and in
                        no wise created for insurrectionary or revolutionary purposes. The debts of
                        these States, thus legitimately incurred, when accurately ascertained, will,
                        it is believed, approximate $100,000,000, and they are held not only by our
                        own citizens, among whom are residents of the portion of the country which
                        has ever remained loyal to the Union, but by persons who are subjects of
                        foreign governments.</p>
                    <p>It is worthy the consideration of Congress and the country whether, if the
                        federal government, by its action, were to assume such obligation, so large
                        an addition to our public expenditures would not seriously impair the credit
                        of the nation; or, on the other hand, whether the refusal of Congress to
                        guarantee the payment of the debts of these States, after having displaced
                        or abolished these State government, it would not be viewed as a violation
                        of good faith and a repudiation by the national legislature of liabilities
                        which these States had justly and legally incurred.</p>
