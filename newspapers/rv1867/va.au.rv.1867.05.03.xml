                <summary>The article condemns the efforts of scurrilous politicians who use
                    confiscation of rebel property as a rallying cry to mobilize voters. The
                    practice is particularly detestable when undertaken by designing "white
                    extremists" who appeal to southern blacks as a means galvanize support for their
                    schemes. Moreover, the article contends ominously, confiscation and its
                    consequences will lead the South to the same fate that befell San Domingo sixty
                    years earlier, and will result in "the extermination of whites or Blacks."</summary>

                <summary>Reports that Jefferson Davis' trial, scheduled to take place in Richmond,
                    will likely be postponed because Judge Chase "objects to holding a court whilst
                    martial law exists in Virginia, and unless the Chief Justice is present no court
                    can be held." If Davis is not tried before April 1868, however, the government
                    must file a new indictment because the statute of limitations will expire.</summary>

                    <p>We publish below the address of Wyatt Lewis to his colored fellow-citizens.
                        It contains many plain truths, and will be read with interest by the colored
                        people, emanating, as it does, from one of their own number, who is well and
                        favorably known to the entire community.</p>
                    <p>Fellow-citizens.--An attempt has been made to deprive us of your confidence
                        and good will by ascribing to us improper motives in lately inviting certain
                        white gentlemen of this city -- Mr. Macfarland, Mr. Johnson and others -- to
                        address us on the subject of our political relations towards the white
                        people of the South.</p>
                    <p>We had seen a very industrious effort going on to draw our colored people
                        into a party organization, pledged to oppose the southern whites as such,
                        and chain them to the leadership of a set of men, chiefly white, whose
                        attempts to foster an antagonism and hatred between the two races we deemed
                        unwise, unnecessary, and of dangerous tendency.</p>
                    <p>It was a very clear to us that our colored people were made to array
                        themselves into a party of their own, led by a few white men of violent
                        political feelings and temper, who indulged the habit of severely,
                        denouncing that class of whites whom we had always thought at least as
                        respectable as the one to which these men belonged, so far from promoting
                        the interests of the colored race, they would seriously compromise those
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>If we are citizens and freemen in truth, surely we ought to be allowed the
                        right of free judging who are our real friends among the many professed ones
                        bidding for our favor. If colored men surrender their wills and freedom of
                        political action to leaders of any sort, and deliberately put away from
                        themselves the prerogative of free, individual choice between political
                        parties, the shackles which they thus voluntarily assume will be found more
                        degrading to their minds than the slavery which the law once imposed upon
                        them. We cannot conceive of a bondage more disgraceful than that imposed by
                        freemen upon themselves in surrendering the right to act upon their own
                        judgement and consciences; nor is there any use more base and vile that the
                        colored man can allow himself to be put than the dirty work of party and
                        faction. What is left of the freedom which we have so lately received from
                        our country as a priceless boon if we have already lost the liberty of
                        exercising so plain a right as that of hearing from respectable men,
                        belonging to one party of the whites, explanation of their views on subjects
                        vitally concerning us after listening hundreds of times, even unto fatigue,
                        to the other party? We should be unworthy of our blessed freedom if we
                        should consent to give up the right of hearing both sides of a discussion
                        involving our highest interests, and if we should surrender our right of
                        individually judging how we should act in an emergency so important as the
                        present.</p>
                    <p>there could not be a more conclusive proof of the danger into which our new
                        freedom has fallen that this bold attempt to deprive us of the right to meet
                        in public to hear addresses from whomsoever we please on public questions.
                        And this very attempt to deprive us of so valuable right shows that those
                        who make it are afraid of free discussion, and ready to wage war upon those
                        very political liberties which they boast of having under their own
                        exclusive keeping.</p>
                    <p>These men require of us, moreover, a species of conduct positively
                        dishonorable. Many of us are in the employment of gentlemen who, as we have
                        reason to think, are disposed to deal towards us with fairness and honor in
                        our business relations. But we are expected and required, after receiving
                        employment from respectable gentlemen in the day-time, to go at night into
                        political meetings and societies, where violent abuse of these employers,
                        their class and race, are the principal theme of the speeches. If we are
                        forced into this course of conduct, then the common instincts of honor
                        require that we should quit our employments, leave homes which are pleasant
                        to ourselves and families, in order that we may indulge, without the pangs
                        of dishonor and ingratitude, in the new and unnatural hatred which violent
                        men insist upon kindling in the breasts of the colored people.</p>
                    <p>The impolicy of this course is as palpable as its impropriety. In Virginia
                        the colored race is in a minority. To band them together is to force the
                        white race into a country combination, in which event our race must
                        certainly be outvoted. It is claimed in opposition to this view that the
                        white laborers and mechanics will unite with us against well-off whites. But
                        you know there is less affection and sympathy between our race and the
                        laboring whites them with the richer class. We want many things of the new
                        State government. We want the new Constitution to provide for the education
                        of all children, white and colored, out of the public taxes. We want this
                        Constitution to level and obliterate all distinctions of color before the
                        law. We cannot secure these most desirable and most vital and priceless
                        objects by forming ourselves into a minority party of colored men, and
                        forcing the white majority to vote us down. Our great aim should be, not to
                        create enemies, but to make sure and safe our rights and liberties.</p>

                    <p>The word "female" applied to woman, is none the less, but all the more
                        objectionable on account of its frequent use in speech and print. It is
                        employed adjectively and substantively, when it can be, with propriety, only
                        in the former sense; but in either way it is neither fit nor fine.--The
                        world is rather general than specific, and is, at the best awkward and
                        inelegant, if not vicious and course.</p>
                    <p>"Woman" is the one word of all words that we need and should adopt. "Woman"
                        belongs to the same sweet Saxon class as "home," "heart," "happiness" and
                        "heaven," and is at once the simplest and the most poetic term in the
                        language to express gentleness and tenderness, the devotion and lovableness
                        of the</p>
                    <p>"Fair daughters of old Eden's fairest Eve."</p>
                    <p>Nothing can be more suggestive and pleasant through association than 'woman,'
                        which means what nothing else does or can convey.</p>
                    <p>"Lady," though beautiful in its etymology, meaning in Saxon, "bread-giver,"
                        is merely a term of society belonging to individuals, not a class or kind.
                        It is a species of qualificative, a brief eulogy, a one word criticism --
                        generally conventional, manifestly private and narrow -- and far less
                        wholesome and genuine than "we man" -- the floral crown of expression, the
                        fresh, dewy, vernal word-growth of gentle and exuberant Nature.--<emph

                    <p>Address of Gen. Echols</p>
                    <p>A meeting of the colored people was held in the Court House on Saturday night
                        last to hear an address from Gen. Echols, who had accepted an invitation to
                        address them.</p>
                    <p>Phillip Roselle was called to the chair and we were requested to act as
                        Secretary. The chairman then introduced Gen. Echols, who delivered a very
                        able, plain and candid address to the colored people.</p>
                    <p>We regret that we are unable to give this address entire, but give the main
                        points, as fully as can from the hurried notes we took on the occasion.</p>
                    <p>He commenced by returning his thanks the colored people for the confidence
                        they had reposed in him by inviting him to address them, and said that he
                        would be untrue to himself and unjust to the colored people did he not speak
                        to them plainly, candidly and truthfully. He alluded to the changed
                        condition of whites and blacks, and said that the history of the world
                        contained no record of such a change in the government of any people as had
                        been wrought in that of this country. A most wonderful change to be wrought
                        in so short a time. Four years ago there were four millions of slaves in the
                        South. To-day they stand in as hight a grad as any in the land. By the
                        result of the war the change has been wrought, which as raised them from the
                        condition of slaves to the rights and privileges of freemen. This change
                        brought not only rights and privileges but also responsibilities and duties.</p>
                    <p>He then proceeded to speak of the Congressional legislation, not deeming it
                        necessary at this day to speak of the issues which led to the war. He
                        believed his colored friends, who knew the part he had taken would him
                        credit for sincerity. He had no regrets and came now to pour oil on the
                        troubled waters and counsel them for their good, and ours and that of our
                        common country.</p>
                    <p>He then read a portion of the Reconstruction bill and the bill supplemental
                        thereto and explained candidly and truthfully their purport -- who were
                        voters and who were eligible to the offices of the State and Convention, and
                        explained to them that this was the act under which they were allowed to
                        vote. He knew that the heart of every colored man leaped with joy that he
                        was no longer the slave of another -- that he was free to vote and say who
                        should govern him, but he came to impress upon them the responsibilities of
                        their new position. If he could go with them on the sure way to success and
                        happiness it would be one of the happiest reflections of his life. They
                        could vote. He was worse off than they. He could neither vote nor hold
                        office. The Government in its wisdom had disfranchised him, and forever. He
                        did not complain. His colored friends, however, would thus see that he was
                        unbiased and would understand that, having no office which <emph
                            rend="italic">they</emph> could give him, that there was no reason why
                        he should deceive them, but that that he came simply to aid them in finding
                        what was best for them. They would b e called upon to vote on the question
                        of a Convention. He explained that a majority of all those registered would
                        required to vote on this question, and that if a majority of those voting
                        were in favor of a Convention it would be called, otherwise it would not,
                        (and at the same time they would vote for delegates to a Convention.) He
                        would advise his colored friends, and white friends also, "<emph
                            rend="italic">in good faith</emph>," as it is now so commonly expressed,
                        to go to work and reconstruct the State Government according to the
                        provisions of the Sherman Shellabarger bill. For himself, he said, <emph
                            rend="italic">he accepted the "situation as it is."</emph> Of course he
                        would have preferred things otherwise, but we are all powerless and he
                        thought it our duty, <emph rend="italic">honestly</emph> and <emph
                            rend="italic">earnestly</emph>, to go work to restore peace and quiet
                        and prosperity to the country. Matters might be worse, but let us hope and
                        at the same time work for better times. He would say to all then, white and
                        colored, register and vote for a Convention. Stand shoulder to shoulder in
                        support of the best men. Do not rely on those who promise anything and
                        everything to get your votes, but vote for men to whom you would go advice
                        in any matter of interest to you. Go for honest men. Such as you would go to
                        if you had money to lend or important business to transact. Such as you
                        would go to to write your will or to whose care you would consign you
                        children or their interests when you are about to die. He had no
                        vindictiveness against any one, was anxious to restore peace and would
                        despise himself if he stood there and did no speak to the course which he
                        honestly believed the best.</p>
                    <p>He had heard of efforts being made to array the colored man against the
                        whites of the South, who had ever been his best friends.--Is this politic?
                        You are told that the Northern people emancipated you and that you should be
                        grateful to them and hostile to the Southern people. Let us examine this.
                        Mr. Lincoln and Congress declared that the war was waged <emph rend="italic"
                            >not to free the colored people</emph>, but to preserve the Union and
                        for three years after the war commenced there was no intention to emancipate
                        the slaves, but the mighty result of the war brought it about whether
                        desired or not. If they had belonged to New York or Pennsylvania they would
                        not have been freed. The first slaves were brought to this country by
                        Dutchmen. Massachusetts followed, because she could make money by it, and
                        brought more slaves from Africa than any other State. No Northern State ever
                        emancipated its slaves without compensation. When they found them
                        unprofitable they adopted prospective emancipation would have freed them.
                        The reproach then rests as much upon the North as the South -- upon those
                        who brought you here and enslaved you as upon those to whom they sold you.</p>
                    <p>Presuming on your ignorance, some will tell you if you do not unite with the
                        Radicals you will be enslaved again. This is a miserable bugbear and an
                        insult to you. You can never be enslaved again and no sane man in the South
                        desires, even if he could, to see you re-enslaved. Then what is your duty.
                        Speaking candidly and feeling as nearly as I can as if I were a colored man,
                        my advice is not to mingle with any party <emph rend="italic">as a
                        body</emph>. Act singly as freemen and determine, each for himself, for whom
                        you will vote, and be not trammelled by being bound to vote for <emph
                            rend="italic">any</emph> party <emph rend="italic">as a class</emph>.
                        You can't make any thing by it, but must suffer. If you go as a body for the
                        Radicals you draw the line distinctly between yourselves and the Southern
                        whites and you alone will be injured. You have been raised in the South.
                        Every hope clusters around this land and you want to live here still. Then
                        why array yourself against the whites? There are in this State about 400,000
                        more whites than blacks. Are you going to array yourself against such odds?
                        What <emph rend="italic">could</emph> you make by that? Won't the whites
                        have the decided advantage? If you say by your acts that you are unfriendly
                        to the whites, what will they be forced to do? They must look elsewhere for
                        labor. If you unite with the Radical party the sequel will be an influx of
                        white labor, which must, as experience has proven, result in your expulsion.
                        We must depend on each other for happiness. We are all in one family and for
                        God's sake don't let us have a family quarrel. We are mutually dependent on
                        each other -- the Whites for labor and you for the means of subsistence. You
                        don't want to leave and we don't want you to leave. Here the speaker
                        introduced the very applicable fable of the "Dolly and the members" and drew
                        the sad picture of the result of like action on the part of any of the
                        constituent part of community.</p>
                    <p>Are there no ties -- no affection -- no love for those by and among whom you
                        have been raised? If you have not, than I mistake the colored man. He drew a
                        feeling picture of the colored boy who raised with him and at whose bedside
                        in the hour of death he was present, and the "old mammy," who had nursed him
                        in childhood and whose last wish was to see, as she loved to call him, her
                        "dear child" again, and expressed his utter inability to forget them or to
                        fail to cherish their memories.</p>
                    <p>He then spoke of the subject of confiscation and explained the Stevens bill,
                        and asked if they desired that. (Some one responded "yes," when another said
                        "he don't belong to this community.") He showed that they would be most
                        injured by it and that murder, theft, robbery, &amp;c., would be the
                        result and said that the infernal regions would be preferable to the horrors
                        of this land in such an event. He then said that the Reconstruction bill was
                        claimed by the Radicals as a finality and that confiscation was ignored and
                        could not be obtained.</p>
                    <p>He again urged upon them not ally themselves with any party. Northern or
                        Southern, as a body, but each to judge for himself as white people do, and
                        said, you are not freemen if you are led, pulled, kicked or dragged into any
                        party, and don't let it be said that you are like a flock of sheep and all
                        follow where the bell-wether leads. don't respect any man who says he is
                        going like the balance of them, but act from reason, judgement, and each for
                        yourself. I am anxious to see you prosperous and happy, and desire to
                        impress upon you other duties.--Your duty is the same that each man has owed
                        to himself since the Savior first taught lessons of wisdom to a sinful
                        world. Be honest with each other and the world. Establish a reputation,
                        which is better than gold or silver. Be truthful. Let your word be as good
                        as your bond. I agree heartily with Senator Wilson in regard to temperance.
                        Don't spend your money for liquor which steals your sense while it wastes
                        your earnings. Lay up your means for the use of yourself and family in the
                        future, when sickness and age overtake you. Organize Savings Banks and
                        deposit your savings in them -- even a quarter a week, and you will find it
                        will gather like a rolling snow-ball. Support and cherish your Churches, and
                        your ministers, a very worthy one of whom I see present, who labor for your
                        temporal as well as your spiritual good. Let each get a little home for
                        himself -- a fig and a vine under which he may recline and be free from the
                        cares and annoyances of the outer world. Nothing so protects a man as the
                        attractions and pleasures of home. Be true to your wives. Educate your
                        children. Let the object be to make the coming generation better than the
                        present. Educate them in religion as well -- the heart as well as the mind.</p>
                    <p>Now my friends your destiny is in your own hands, and no Northern or Southern
                        man can work it our for you -- you must do it yourselves. I have endeavored
                        frankly to advise you and as certain as you follow that advice with industry
                        and economy, leaving politics alone, you will better your condition and be
                        prosperous and happy. Political excitement will turn to bitter ashes. Let it
                        alone, and vote when you are called upon for honest men and you will be far
                        happier. If you do not follow this advice your fate is a sad one indeed and
                        you will rush on but to misery and distruction. Your path is beset by snares
                        and quicksands and you must be warned. There are men who hope and expect to
                        mould you, on account of your ignorance, to suit their selfish purposes.
                        Beware of them and advise rather with those whom you have long known as your
                        friends, and work out your destiny for yourselves in the land that God has
                        placed you, uncontroled by those who would lead you only as their selfish
                        interests prompt.</p>
                    <p>The speaker then closed by reciting the beautiful allegory of Abou Ben Adam
                        and returning his thanks for their marked attention.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Dennis Harris, the thanks of the colored people were tendered
                        General Echols for his able speech and kind advice given them.</p>
                    <p>The following colored men were then called upon and responded:</p>
                    <p>Rev. Mr. Lawson, who very properly said he was no politician and did not wish
                        to engage in politics. (A very good course and it severe rebuke to those
                        ministers who preach politics and not Christ and him crucified.)</p>
                    <p>Henry Davenport, said he felt himself incompetent to return the thanks of the
                        colored people to Gen. Echols, that he as no speaker but nevertheless would
                        tender the kind thanks of the colored people to General Echols. He rejoiced
                        that the time had come when the white people and colored people could meet
                        and counsel together on equal terms.--God help us to live together as
                        brethren! My brethren, my fellow-citizens, my fellow-travellers to the bar
                        of God I greet you.</p>
                    <p>James Scott, complimented Gen. Echols but wanted to know how they were here.
                        He knew his friends -- even a dog knew his friends. He applied the fable of
                        the boys and the frogs to the speech of Gen. Echols and closed by calling on
                        the colored people to stand firm and praise the bridge that carried them
                        over safely.</p>
                    <p>Benjamin Downey said he was independent happy. Gen. Echols had drawn some
                        mighty fine pictures, but while he looked on one side then on the other he
                        wanted to "<emph rend="italic">bust</emph> the picture open and look on the
                        inside." The white people were mighty slow about their advice and the only
                        objection he had to Gen. Echols' speech was that he commenced too late. Why
                        did the Southern people wait so long before showing their friendship? He was
                        about to bring the music out of it. The Northern ladies came down and taught
                        us, but no Southern ladies had learned us to say A. B. C. Gen. Echols was a
                        great orator -- great scholar and he didn't believe that some of the white
                        folks understood it neither. The nigger had taken care of the families of
                        the white families of the white folks during the war and the white people
                        wasn't as thankful as they ought to be he didn't think.</p>
                    <p>Phillip Roselle -- Chairman, said that he was in favor of the colored people
                        behaving themselves properly. He belonged to a set of people, who, if
                        anybody troubled him, were very apt to whip them for it, but since he was
                        free he had not been so rabid as he used to be, as he didn't have anybody to
                        fight for him, but was particular to treat everybody with respect. Some said
                        the North had set him free and some said the South did because if the South
                        hadn't <emph rend="italic">fit</emph> he wouldn't have been free, but for
                        his part he was too glad to be free to quarrel about who set him free. Any
                        how he used to belong to Maj. Garber and his father, and, looking at Maj.
                        G.-- said, I don't think Mr. Garber would have fit if he'd a thought I was
                        going to be set free." He didn't want no confiscation and voted against it
                        in the Richmond Convention. He didn't want nobody's land. If any body was to
                        tell him there was Gen. Echols' land -- it's yours now, go and take it, he'd
                        sell him he didn't want it. But if it was a little slice of Mr. Garber's or
                        Col. M. G. Harman's who had formerly owned him, he didn't know but what he
                        might take it.</p>
                    <p>After he concluded the meeting adjourned.</p>
                    <p>The Court House was crowded with colored people and we never saw better
                        attention paid to any speaker than Gen. Echols received. Everything passed
                        off smoothly -- the large number of whites enjoying in a great degree the
                        remarks of the colored speakers, who with one exception exhibited a very
                        friendly feeling. Jas. Scott, however, exhibited a rather bad feeling, which
                        we think can be accounted for by the presence of a white man, which served
                        to stimulate him not to fall below his teachings.</p>

                <summary>Noting that the residents of Harrisonburg, the county seat of Rockingham
                    County, have taken strides to improve their town, the article applauds their
                    efforts, but points out that they have a long way to go before their town can
                    compete with Staunton.</summary>

                    Christian's Saloon last Saturday night. The trunk was found the next day near
                    the depot, its contents strewn about J. Moran's hog pen. Although Gibson
                    recovered most of the stolen property, much of it is damaged; Gibson's Colt
                    revolver, which was contained in the trunk, is still missing, however.</summary>
