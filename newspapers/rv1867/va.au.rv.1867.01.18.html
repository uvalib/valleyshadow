<b>Manufacturing in the South</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Among the changes taking hold in the South since the end of the war,
                    relates the article, is the appearance of a growing number of "commercial and
                    manufacturing" industries. As this trend continues, the region will be able to
                    satisfy an increasing amount of its needs locally, and, in the future, may
                    export its surplus.<br>

<b>The "Old Issue"</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Relates the story of a disagreement between two blacks, illustrating the
                    divide between the "old issue," those who were free before the war, and the
                    freedmen.<br>

<b>"Whining Women"</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article relates some of the more severe pronouncements made by Brigham
                    Young concerning women. According to the Mormon leader, "'women expect too much
                    of the Saints.'" Accordingly, they should stop "'whining'" about the "evils of
                    polygamy and such like 'blasphemous twaddle.'"<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors endorse the Stay Law as the best way to ensure that "debtors
                    will generally be able to pay principal and interest and still have enough to
                    secure an honest livelihood." Currently, a court in Richmond is examining the
                    constitutionality of the law.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that the legislature overwhelmingly rejected the proposed
                    "'Constitutional Amendment'"; in the Senate the vote against it was unanimous
                    and in the House only W. D. Lewis, of Fairfax County, cast his ballot in support
                    of the measure. According the article, the result was never really in doubt,
                    since "Virginians are not so lost to self-respect as to brand with infamy the
                    men whom she and they called to the forefront in the hour of necessity."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Relates that, in a ruling on Jan. 11, the U. S. Supreme Court declared the
                    Missouri Test Oath unconstitutional, a decision that casts doubt on the validity
                    of the test oaths required by other states.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article contends that Thad Stevens and his supporters were overly
                    confident of receiving the Republican nomination for U. S. Senator, and
                    "demolished" once the result of the contest was announced.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>National Intelligencer</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"Thad Stevens, backed by 'Dead Duck' Forney, repaired to Harrisburg to
                    secure the position of U. S. Senator, from Pennsylvania. Suites of rooms were
                    taken at a prominent Hotel and all the 'applicances' applied but to no effect.
                    In the Republican caucus, Cameron received 43 votes, Curtain 23 and Stevens 7,
                    when the nomination of Cameron was made unanimous. This will rule out Thad
                    though he went expecting to 'rule the roast." The National Intelligence says:"<br>

<b>Returning to "Massa"</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on a group of slaves who moved to the Lynchburg area from Fauquier
                    County at the end of the war, then wrote to their former master asking him to
                    take them back. Owens, the former master, consented to their request and sent
                    money to pay for their travel.<br>

<b>General Assembly of Virginia</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article gives a summary of the proceedings from the legislature,
                    including a copy of the Homestead bill. The bill protects citizens from having
                    their homes or farms seized for debt, provided the value does not exceed $1,500
                    or 160 acres.<br>

<b>Decision of the Supreme Court on the Missouri Test Oath</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses the Supreme Court's rejection of the Missouri Test Oath and
                    another ruling that permits a lawyer who fought with the Confederacy to return
                    to his practice.<br>

<b>The Negro Population</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Contains the latest figures available on the population of blacks in
