                    <p>We have the statement from an unquestionable source, that at one of the
                        precincts in Amherst county, on election day, a negro after voting, said to
                        the officer in charge that he wanted his "forty acres of land and his mule."
                        An explanation being asked for, he stated that he had been told that every
                        negro who voted was to have forty acres of land and a mule given him,
                        immediately after voting, and he wanted his then and there. The
                        disappointment, disgust and indignation of the deluded darkey were intense,
                        when told that he had been fooled, and that neither land nor mule were there
                        for him. The old negro further said that numbers of others on the ground had
                        also been told the same that he was, and had come to the election with the
                        same bright anticipation of the riches that were to be their.</p>

                <summary>The article relates the story of an elderly black man in Amherst County,
                    who, after voting in the late election, asked the officer in charge for his
                    "'forty acres of land and his mule.'" Apparently the man had been told that he
                    would receive those items once he cast his ballot. When informed that no such
                    policy existed, the man expressed his "disappointment" and explained to the
                    officer that many blacks in the area had been promised as much.</summary>

                    <p>The question as to how the people of Virginia shall treat the Constitution,
                        to be framed by the Radical Convention, seems to be a bond of contention
                        among the press of the State at present. Some argue that the apathy
                        exhibited at the late election should be utilized and that all conservatives
                        should remain away from the polls and thus defeat the constitution, by the
                        failure of a majority of registered votes to be cast on the question of its
                        ratification. One objection to this is that it is not likely to work. Some
                        of the 18,500 white majority will vote for the ratification of any
                        constitution framed. That is certain. There are also some conservatives,
                        who, without perfect concert of action, will cast their votes against it,
                        and thereby swell the vote on the question to more than a majority of the
                        registered voters in the State and the result will be its ratification by a
                        majority of the votes cast.</p>
                    <p>The true policy, we think, to pursue is to organize in every City, Town,
                        Precinct and Neighborhood. Let there be thorough organization of the
                        conservatives of Virginia, as was the custom in days gone by, and there will
                        be no laggards at the polls.--Virginia will then place her protest of an
                        emphatic majority against any iniquity attempted to be thrust upon her. This
                        would be far preferable to Virginians to lying dormant while dearest rights
                        are dallied with.</p>
                    <p>It may be objected that the places of voting are so few and distant and the
                        apathy of the people so great, as just exhibited, that the full vote can not
                        be polled. We know a number who failed to vote on the convention question,
                        being undecided on account of the multiplicity and variety of advice given,
                        who have since expressed, in measured terms, their regret and who will never
                        again fail to cast their suffrage.--This, we take it, is the feeeling of all
                        those conservatives who failed to vote at the late election and who will
                        need but little incentive to be present at the next election.--However, to
                        trust the defeat of an objectionable constitution to "remaining away from
                        the polls" or to "voting it down," without organization to that effect,
                        would be the height of folly.</p>
                    <p>There must be organization -- thorough organization in either instance to
                        ensure success.</p>
                    <p>We are decidedly in favor of voting it down as the more feasible plan and far
                        more to be desired by Virginians, but we are willing to act in concert with
                        any plan to defeat the attempted radical sway in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>We urge, <emph rend="italic">under any circumstances</emph>, the necessity of
                        a one-ness of purpose on the part of the conservative press and people on
                        the part of the conservative press and people of Virginia, and thorough and
                        complete conservative organization throughout the State. We therefore
                        suggest to our City cotemporaries to take the initiative and call a meeting
                        of the Conservative Press of the State at the most accessible point, to
                        unite all in one well devised and predetermined course, and to perfect a
                        plan for thorough conservative organization, without which it were worse
                        than folly to go into the next election.</p>

                    <p>The question of immigration is being more casually considered by the people
                        of Virginia [unclear] at any former period. All [unclear] necessity of
                        introducing white immigration into this State speedily in order to restore
                        the State to the hight degree of material and political prosperity, which it
                        enjoyed anterior to the extinguishment of her former reliable system of
                        labor. The demoralization of her former laborers, by incompatible conditions
                        thrust upon then, renders it absolutely necessary that white labor should be
                        brought and retained within her border to develop her resources, cultivate
                        her waste places and aid in controling the destiny of our beloved "Old
                        Dominion." Whether from the densely populated neighborhoods of Europe or the
                        farms and manufactories of the Northern States, white labor can find
                        employment here and will be heartily welcomed.</p>
                    <p>We publish below the resolutions of the State Board of Immigration, ans ask
                        for them the careful consideration and hearty co-operation of our readers.
                        let us prepare to sell as at reasonable prices, whatever lands we can not
                        use profitably, to those desiring to settle among us, and let us one and all
                        aid the Board of Immigration by what pecuniary assistance we can afford and
                        thus assist in bringing about speedily that influx of white labor,
                        acknowledged by all to be so essential to the interest and prosperity of
                        Virginia and Virginians. Read and consider the resolutions appended and let
                        us give that impetus to immigration, which the times, circumstances and our
                        necessities imperatively demand.</p>
                    <p>At the meeting of the State Board of Immigration, held on the 2d day of
                        November, 1867, at the capitol of the city of Richmond, the following
                        resolutions were adopted:</p>

                        themselves together against the whites: others [and these in our judgement
                        hit on th right plan -- Whig] wish first to lay down the terms on which the
                        whites will continue to give them employment, viz: That they withdraw
                        themselves in hostility against the Southern people; and others are anxious
                        to inaugurate prompt measures for the introduction of labor from Europe.
                        These are the subjects which it is proposed to discuss and determine in a
                        public meeting. They are important and deserve grave consideration.</p>

                <summary>With blacks increasingly exhibiting their political independence, many
                    whites in Lynchburg are mulling over their options. Some have suggested "cutting
                    loose" their black employees outright. Others have offered black workers the
                    option of retaining their positions, but only if they withdraw from the newly
                    formed Union Leagues and "cease to array themselves in hostility against the
                    Southern people."</summary>

                    blacks will be elected to Congress to represent the South. Although this may
                    satisfy northerners initially, it predicts they will soon come to lament this

                    Committee upon the impeachment" indicates that, until the Spring of 1866, Gen.
                    Grant was fully in support of President Johnson's policies. Moreover, it claims,
                    Johnson's proclamation relative to Reconstruction was identical to the policy
                    Lincoln intended to adopt.</summary>

                    who failed to vote was 192. Apparently, the results in the last issue were
                    skewed because some individuals cast multiple ballots.</summary>

                <summary>The article reports that C. L. Thompson, of Albemarle, and Major S. B.
                    Seay, of Amelia, have announced their decision to vote with the Conservatives at
                    the convention, despite the fact they were both elected on Radical tickets. A.
                    W. Harris, of Nelson, having been elected under similar circumstances is
                    expected to do the same.</summary>
