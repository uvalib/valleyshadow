                    <p>It is indeed a sad thing for Virginians to realize that the State of Virginia
                        -- the "Old Dominion" -- the "Mother of States and of Statesmen," has no
                        longer an independent existence, but that her Government and laws [unclear]
                        merely at the will of a military commander, and all for attempting to
                        maintain the rights for which she and her sister colonies contended in the
                        Revolution, and which were seized from the reluctant hands of the mother
                        country by the result of war.--It is a sad realization that her sovereignty
                        is overthrown -- her laws set aside, and, at the mercy of a single
                        individual, she is to exercise only such meagre political privileges as may
                        be vouchsafed [unclear] her, until a dominant radical majority shall choose
                        to allow her again to enjoy those privileges which Virginia, in no slight
                        degree, aided to secure to every State in the Union, and all this by the
                        voice of many of her sister in that memorable struggle, aided by the voice
                        of her recreant children, who, having arrived at maturity and about to
                        launch forth on the sea of political life, found, owning to the watchful
                        care of their mother, Virginia, their sovereign independence guaranteed.</p>
                    <p>We repeat, this is a sad realization for Virginians, and, although the cloud
                        which lowers about us is dark indeed, we console ourselves that it has
                        somewhat of a silver tinge. We might have had a tyrannical upstart placed in
                        command of our State, who would have made our position more unpleasant than
                        was even contemplated by those who planned and advocated the military scheme
                        of re-construction. As it is, we should rejoice that no such tyrannical
                        military commander has been placed over us. Judging from the tone of the
                        General Order of Gen. Schofield, in assuming command of this district, which
                        we publish elsewhere, he feels that he is performing a disagreeable though
                        obligatory duty. He expresses a desire to exercise the military power only
                        so far as is necessary to accomplish the object for which it was conferred,
                        and appeals to the people and civil officers of Virginia to aid in rendering
                        the necessity for the exercise of military power as <emph rend="italic"
                            >slight as possible</emph>. This is praiseworthy in a military
                        commander, whose will within his district is almost supreme, and who might
                        make our burdens intolerable.</p>
                    <p>We call the attention of our people to the tenor and tone of the above
                        mentioned order, not that we believe any such appeal was needed, for our
                        people are and have ever been a law loving and law abiding people, but that,
                        however distasteful the Military Re-construction bill -- however
                        disagreeable the knowledge that Virginia's existence is thus ignored, they
                        may, with us, enjoy even the little, pleasure it affords to know, since a
                        military governor is decreed and appointed, that we have one who, at least,
                        feels for the people over whom he is called to rule, and will, as far as he
                        can, endeavor to lighten the burdens of military government.</p>

                <summary>Although the editors lament the loss of the state's sovereignty under the
                    terms of the Reconstruction Act, they acknowledge the situation could be worse;
                    the state could have been saddled with a tyrannical military commander rather
                    than Gen. Scholfield, for whom they offer tepid praise.</summary>

                    selling or giving away liquor near polling stations on the day of elections. The
                    penalty is a fine of $20 to $100 and imprisonment not exceeding two months.</summary>

                    Congress had passed an amendment to the Military Reconstruction Bill. The

                <transcript>
                    <p>At the suggestion of many of our readers we re-publish the following, showing
                        what persons are effected by the provisions of the Constitutional Amendment
                        and the Sherman bill in regard to exclusion from office and from the ballot
                        box. The following persons are excluded:</p>
                    <p>1st. All persons who before the war, were members of Congress, or officers of
                        the United States, and afterwards engaged in the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>2nd. All persons who, prior to the war, were executive, legislative or
                        judicial officers of the State, and took the like oath, and engaged in the
                        rebellion.</p>
                    <p>This embraces Governors, members of the Legislature, and judicial officers
                        from a Judge of the Supreme Court down to a Justice of the Peace, who, at
                        any time held the office and took the oath and afterwards engaged in the
                        rebellion.</p>
                    <p>Who, then, are not excluded? 1st. No one is excluded because he held an
                        office under the Confederate States from President down, if he does not fall
                        within one of the excluded classes above specified. The simple fact that he
                        was a Confederate Senator or Confederate General, or that he took a an oath
                        to support the Constitution of the Confederate States, does not exclude him.</p>
                    <p>2nd. No State or County officer is excluded on account of his having held the
                        office and taken the oath and engaged in the rebellion, if he were not an
                        executive, legislative or judicial officer; therefore, neither a lawyer,
                        sheriff, clerk, tax collector, receiver, county treasurer, coroner,
                        surveyor, constable, or road commissioner is excluded.</p>
                    <p>As no man under twenty-one years of age, when the war began, held any such
                        office as disqualified, and none of them took the oath to support the
                        Constitution of the United States during the war, and as the war commenced
                        nearly six years ago, no man under twenty-seven years of age can be
                        excluded.</p>
                    <p>4th. Militia officers are not excluded.</p>
                    <p>5th. The whole mass of our people who fall within none of the excluded
                        classes above mentioned are free from the disqualification, and may vote and
                        hold any office in the State without regard to the part they took in the
                            war.--<emph rend="italic">Petersburg Express</emph>.</p>

                    <p>Columbia, S. C., March 18. --One of the most remarkable colored meetings ever
                        held in South Carolina was held here to-day, the occasion being the
                        celebration by the negroes of the passage of the bill enfranchising their
                        race. By invitation, General Wade Hampton, Ex-United States Senators W. F.
                        Desaussure and Edward Arthur, Hon. W. F. Talley, and James W. Gibbs,
                        addressed the meeting; also the Rev. David Pickett and Beverly Nash, both
                        colored. The sentiments expressed were honorable to both sides. The negroes
                        were gratified with the spirit of political affiliation with which they have
                        been met, and the citizens are equally pleased to find the colored men
                        identified with the true interests of the State. Should a convention be held
                        the latter will probably nominate and support the best men in the country,
                        and as declared by Nash, will urge Congress to repeal the disfranchising
                        clause, which deprives them of the services of those in whom they have the
                        greatest confidence.</p>
