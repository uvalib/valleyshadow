<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Monday next, Court-day, it is proposed to hold a meeting of the
                        Conservative citizens of Augusta County, to select delegates to represent
                        them in the Conservative Convention proposed to be held in Richmond on the
                        11th day of December next. The object of the Richmond Convention is to
                        organize thoroughly the Conservative voters of the State and adopt some
                        general plan of action to defeat, if possible, the attempted Radical
                        domination in this State. That any attempt of the Radicals to rule in the
                        "Old Dominion" can be defeated, needs only a reference to the re[unclear]
                        lists in the State, which exhibit a white majority of 13,000. The Statistics
                        also show that 14,000 whites failed to register. A small number of those who
                        failed to register, may do so previous to the
                        election on the ratification of the Constitution. But the question is, how
                        can the whole known white majority of 27,000 be secured on the registered
                        lists? In no way save by a general Conservative organization throughout the
                        State, looking to that as well as to the casting of the entire Conservative
                        vote of the State on the question submitted by the Convention. Then will the
                        prominent men of the State canvass every county and district in the State,
                        on the issues presented and the people of Virginia will be aroused from that
                        apathy which has been so disastrous to them in the late election. This
                        Conservative organization can be secured if the counties will move promptly
                        in the matter. Already a number of counties have selected delegates. Let not
                        Old Augusta and her sister counties in the Valley be dilatory in the good
                        work.--The importance of thorough Conservative organization is conceded by
                        all. It is a matter that vitally interests every Conservative in the State.
                        Let our people respond generally to the call for a meeting in the Court
                        House on Monday next. Let us have no such sickly affair as that which made
                        nominations for the Convention, but let every good citizen, who can possibly
                        do so, be present. If we would have Virginia take her place along side of
                        her sister States of the North, who have so lately, and significantly,
                        declared in favor of upholding the Constitution and Laws [unclear]make our
                        county meeting one worthy of "Old Augusta" and the delegates selected such
                        as will meet the hearty approval of every Conservative in the county.</p>
                    <p>REMEMBER MONDAY NEXT and let every good citizen be
                            present at the meeting of the Conservatives of Augusta on that
                        day.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the Constitution, candidates for Congress must be U. S.
                    citizens for seven years before they are eligible to serve in the House and ten
                    years for the Senate. Consequently, relates the piece, blacks, who "were not
                    citizens, at least until Mr. Lincoln's proclamation in 1862," should be
                    ineligible to hold office. Since the Radicals came to power, however, the true
                    test for eligibility has become "loyalty to Radicalism."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The New York Herald quotes the Federal Constitution to show that no person is
                        eligible to a seat in the Lower House of Congress unless he has been a
                        citizen of the United States for seven years, or to the Senate unless he has
                        been a citizen for ten years. Assuming that, according to the decision in
                        the Dred Scott case, negroes were not citizens, at least until Mr. Lincoln's
                        proclamation in 1862, it concludes that they are not now eligible to seats
                        in Congress. We are surprised at the Herald quoting the Constitution on a
                        body which has ignored it. Does it no know that the only test of eligibility
                        is loyalty to Radicalism? Citizenship is out of question, and
                        negro-representation from the South is a fixed fact under the Congressional
