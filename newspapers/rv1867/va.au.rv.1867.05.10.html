<b>Interesting Incident</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Recounts the story of a group of former slaves who visited the grave of a
                    young man for whom they had once worked; the man died while in the Confederate

                    the "tender relations" that exist between "the two races."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We regret exceedingly to see so much agitation in the South at present -- so
                        many efforts to build up parties and to divide, disturb an distract our
                        people. Party lines will inevitably be drawn but we think that time has not
                        arrived yet. There is by far too much talk about "dirt eaters,"
                        "Passivists," &amp;c. No man can tell exactly what to do or how to do
                        it. What is the interest of one in this Southern land is clearly the
                        interest of all, without distinctions. We are all afloat in the same little
                        bark (?), and are, fortunately or unfortunately bereft of rudder and
                        compass, and, whether we will or not, must sink or swim together. There is
                        no necessity -- in fact it is down right madness for us to quarrel about the
                        course we must steer which all see but through "a glass darkly."</p>
                    <p>We have advocated to give our readers from time to time the views of
                        prominent Radicals, Republicans and Democrats, in order that they might
                        judge for themselves as to the proper course. The Radicals declare that if
                        we do not adopt the plan they have laid down, which in the same breath they
                        assert is not a finality, it will be th last chance, and the reconstruction
                        of the Southern States will be turned over to the known "loyalists" and
                        freedom in our midst and perhaps confiscation may be restored to.--The
                        former might occur, but the latter finds but few advocates in the Northern
                        States and we have never dreaded it. The Republicans scout the idea of
                        confiscation, while they beseech us to accept the reconstruction plan and
                        claim it as a finality -- a failure to do so they say will insure a
                        continuance of the present condition ad
                        infinitum. The Democrats cry out, stand firm to your rights -- yield
                        nothing -- accept nothing less, and in the end you will obtain them,
                        otherwise they are lost forever.</p>
                    <p>In the multiplicity and diversity of advice and threats we are utterly
                        confounded. We know not whom to believe. We can not see for ourselves
                        whether it is better to reconstruct on the Congressional plan or be blessed
                        with the continuance of military domination. One thinks we should
                        reconstruct and is hailed as the "dirt eater." Another thinks we should not
                        accept the unpalatable terms by voting for a convention and is immediately
                        styled a "passivist." We think this is all wrong. We have never inclined to
                        the Reconstruction and Supplementary bills as magnanimous in the victors and
                        we think them unconstitutional, unjust and totally uncalled for. We have
                        never believed, vote as we will, that they would
                        be realized as a finality, for there are too many "ifs" to be accomplished,
                        as we stated when we published the bill and supplement, for them ever to
                        reach that realization. Yet we do not see that the occasion exists to engage
                        in bickerings, one with another, because we entertain the one or the other
                        opinion. Each and all of us will act, as we believe for the best interests
                        of all and while all are striving to reach a common goal -- the peace and
                        prosperity of our country, no one knows exactly whither the road he proposes
                        to take will lead.</p>
                    <p>It is indeed a sad condition in which the Southern people find themselves
                        to-day -- neither in the Union nor out of it -- neither possessed of rights
                        and privileges nor totally deprived of them -- certain only of the rest,
                        discussing the present and without any experience by which to reach an
                        approximated judgement as to the future. The old landmarks obliterated or
                        overridden by the surges of passion and prejudice which swell and foam
                        around about us, and the which way we turn we may find breakers ahead. Will
                        bickerings and contentions avail? We think not. Let each then act as he
                        conscientiously believe for the best, reasoning from the narrow premises
                        allowed, and hoping that our little craft will reach a haven of safety,
                        trust in Him who holds the tempests in the hollow of His hand and who alone
                        rules with justice tempered with mercy.</p>

                    <p>We think the Lynchburg News "states the case, plainly, forcibly, and calmly
                        -- and assumes the proper ground with regard to our duties under the
                        Military Reconstruction act:"</p>
                    <p>Congress demands of us certain conditions as indispensable in admission into
                        the Union. These are briefly, we know, the acceptance of the constitutional
                        amendment, and the enfranchisement of the colored race. They do not demand
                        that the negro or the "loyalists" shall monopolize the offices or control
                        the legislation of the State. They only demand that all classes and color
                        shall be made equal before the law. To contend that Congress requires that
                        the majority shall bow before the minority , and surrender to their keeping all political rights, and the
                        monopoly of all political offices, under penalty of confiscation and
                        perpetual disfranchisement, is in direct contravention of the provisions of
                        the act of Congress, under which the process of reconstruction is required
                        to be consummated. Had such been the determination of Congress, it is fair
                        to presume that it would have been to have
                        prescribed a constitution for us, and required its acceptance by the people
                        as a condition precedent to re-admission. We therefore assume that a convention called in accordance with the
                        provisions of the S. S. S. bill, which shall form a constitution embodying a
                        recognition of the perfect equality of whites and blacks before the law,
                        including the right of suffrage, and the ratification of the proposed
                        constitutional amendment, will have complied with every requirement of
                        Congress, will have fulfilled every condition demanded, and so far as its
                        action is concerned, would be entitled to admission. True we doubt very much
                        whether so action would secure admission. Mr.
                        Wilson's assertion to the contrary notwithstanding but we would nevertheless
                        have complied with the terms demanded.</p>
                    <p>Why then should we go a bow shot beyond this, and in addition elect as
                        Governors, Judges and Legislators, men who have no claim to these positions,
                        except that they represent a minority, and are taken from a class which
                        controls the elections in the North?"</p>
