<b>The President's Views of Military Republics</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the correspondent, President Johnson is opposed to holding
                    elections in areas of the South under "military control" because it is in
                    "conflict with the spirit of republican institutions." Johnson justifies his
                    position by drawing upon the words of Daniel Webster.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors discuss the potential ramifications of the Supplementary
                    Reconstruction Bill, which passed over the president's veto, and argue that the
                    law, in combination with the Military Reconstruction Bill and the proposed
                    Constitutional Amendment, will make the South "more republican than when the
                    Union was originally formed."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We publish elsewhere the Bill supplementary to the Military Re-construction
                        Bill, which was passed over the President's veto by a vote of 40 to 7 in the
                        Senate and 114 to 25 in the House, and is, therefore, a law. In this bill,
                        together with the proposed Constitutional Amendment and Military
                        Re-construction bill, the South has the programme of re-construction, to the
                        completion of which the time and labors (we will no say wisdom) of Congress
                        has been devoted for the past two years. The best comment on the various
                        acts of Congress, on this subject, have been the veto message of the
                        President, which for clearness, conscience and critical analysis, and a
                        desire to preserve the Government of Fathers, are remarkable State
                        documents. The message vetoing the Supplemental Bill, which we publish in
                        connection with it, is an able paper and forcibly shows up this bill. Our
                        readers will, no doubt, read the message carefully, but we desire to call
                        their attention to a point made by the President that the present
                        Constitutions of the Southern States are, if possible, more republican than
                        when the Union was originally formed, and that Congress demands no change to
                        be made in their provisions, except those which confine the suffrage to
                        whites, and draws this patent conclusion, that, in the exercise of the
                        Constitutional provision to guarantee a republican form of government to
                        every State in the Union, if Congress makes (as seems to be the case) negro
                        suffrage a sine qua non, then re-construction
                        might as well commence in Pennsylvania or Ohio (both having lately refused
                        to allow negroes to vote) as in Virginia or North Carolina.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In the wake of the passage of the S. S. S. Bill, which calls for a state
                    convention to be held, the editors refute the notion that all members of the
                    Virginia Senate who voted in favor of the measure based their decision on
                    nefarious motives. Sometimes, they explain, legislators, like editors, are
