<b>Singularities of Suffrage</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article calls attention to the apparent disconnect between what
                    Radicals preach and how they govern, noting that only eight of the twenty-two

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A nice commentary upon the Radical demand for impartial suffrage in the South
                        is found in the fact that only eight of twenty-two States controlled by the
                        Radicals permit such suffrage. Of the New England States Connecticut is the
                        only one that refuses the ballot to colored men. Maine, New Hampshire and
                        Vermont make no distinction whatever in respect to suffrage, but
                        Massachusetts and Rhode Island do. The laws of Massachusetts requires the
                        voter to be able to read the Constitution of the United States in the
                        English language and to write his name.--Know-Nothingism in the its suffrage
                        law, by declaring that every native male citizen may vote. In New York
                        negroes with certain qualifications are allowed to vote; that is, such as
                        are worth two hundred and fifty dollars, and have been in the State three
                        years. In Wisconsin negroes are allowed to vote by virtue of a decision by
                        the Supreme Court of that State upon a technicality. In Ohio the greater
                        part of the negroes vote, although the law gives the ballot only to those
                        who have more than half-white blood. Darkeys who are black as charcoal can
                        vote there in the Radical districts under the half-white law. In nearly all
                        of the other States, however, the Radicals have declined, by tests in
                        popular elections, to give the negroes that which they so strenuously insist
                        the Southern people shall give them.--New York

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Recently, note the editors, Senator Wilson, a Radical Republican from
                    Massachusetts, spoke in Petersburg to an audience composed primarily of blacks.
                    In his speech, Wilson asserted that it is unfair that only the South has been
                    forced to suffer the consequences of the late war because both the North and
                    South had been at fault. Though the editors admire his sentiments, they argue
                    that there is "a conflict" between his "words and acts" because he is a Radical
                    and thus partly responsible for the present conditions in the South.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, delivered an address to the people of
                        Petersburg on Thursday, 4th inst.. Although a number of whites were present,
                        among whom were some of the prominent citizens, yet the colored people were
                        more numerously represented. He spoke plainly and candidly, boldly declaring
                        that he was a Radical Republican, and defended the acts of his party, while
                        he denounced the Democracy. He asserted that the late war was "unavoidable,"
                        for which "the North and South were both responsible and both were alike
                        guilty."--We doubt not he uttered his candid opinions, but when we remember
                        that Mr. Wilson has acted, as he asserts, with the Radical Republicans in
                        Congress, and has had no small share in the passage of bills inflicting
                        punishments on the already sorely punished South, for the part she took in
                        th war, which he declares "was unavoidable," and recall the fact that he was
                        lately instrumental in imposing unjust conditions on the Southern people for
                        the course they pursued, we can not convince ourselves that his acts have
                        not grossly belied his words. For why vote to inflict punishments on the
                        South and not on the North as well -- why exact conditions from the South,
                        which according to this assertion, are more manifestly unjust, since they
                        are not demanded of the North, and yet the "North and South are both
                        responsible and both alike guilty." Really there is such a conflict between
                        the words and acts of the Massachusetts Senator, that we fear his efforts
                        will be fruitless here, while his Northern friends will read him off of the
                        Radical list for proclaiming that the North was equally guilty with the
                        South, and thus condemning his own and the acts of his party friends. We
                        always knew that the Southern climate had a powerful effect in modifying and
                        even changing the sentiments of Northern men who came this way, but we did
                        not expect Mr. Wilson, a Radical leader in Congress, to be so biased by a
                        short visit. We advise Thad and Sumner to keep their cohorts well in hand,
                        or in their stump speeches in the South they will be letting out the whole
                        truth, that the North was responsible for the
                        late war, and alone guilty, and now desires to
                        destroy the Southern lamb because it did not muddy the stream.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A correspondent of a Northern Republican paper, writing from Charleston,
                        says:</p>
                    <p>It is very clear to any one who has watched the political current in this
                        quarter of late that the colored men will vote as a unit.--There is quite a
                        large number of them who were free before the war, and who hold themselves
                        partially aloof from the rest.--These, to a man, announce their
                        determination to stand by the old white residents in whatever action they
                        may take. On the other hand, there is more numerous party, composed chiefly
                        of idlers from the plantations, who have found their way into the city,
                        where they live from hand to mouth, who are convinced that their release
                        from daily toil was accomplished by the Radical party of the North, and who
                        may therefore be relied upon to vote and act with the men who represent and
                        are endorsed by that party.--But the most numerous class of all is made up
                        of sensible freedmen, who are now earning a living by honest labor, who are
                        intelligent enough to think for themselves, and to act as they believe their
                        own interest dictate. Perhaps if they followed their own impulse merely,
                        they might imitate the example of their shiftless and improvident brethren
                        from the country, and give their support to the Radical candidates. But it
                        must be borne in mind that these men derive their subsistence almost
                        entirely from white employers, and they will take heed how they put their
                        livelihood in jeopardy, for the sake of what, to them, is now a mere
                        political abstraction. In view of these facts I find that the shrewdest
                        observers here are of opinion that either a majority of the blacks will be
                        found supporting the whites at the polls, or that if this should not be the
                        case, the freedmen's vote will be divided so as to become a matter of little
                        comparative importance. If this be true in Charleston and along the
                        seacoast, it is even more so in the interior, where the freedmen are less
                        exposed to the influence of political agitators. The gathering of negroes
                        that have lately taken place, to listen to harangue from orators, white and
                        black, were rather tame affairs, having been gotten up in the interest of a
                        few would-be leaders of the colored population.</p>
