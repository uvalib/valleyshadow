<b>For The Girls--How To Get A Husband</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>

                    <p>From an excellent communication published in the Columbus (Miss.) Index, of
                        the 8th of June, we copy the following, "expressly for the girls:"</p>
                    <p>Being old, and therefore allowed license for teasing the girls on matrimonial
                        subjects I consult them about their future prospects often, and find that
                        the opinion obtains with them, that the young men were never so slow in
                        proposing as in these days; which, we must admit, gives them a good, not to
                        say all-powerful reasons, for not taking a husband. Now, young ladies, the
                        whole secret with nine-tenths of you, of not being able to get off your
                        parents' hands, is simply this; You don't know how to work. you can't keep
                        house. You can't make a pair of breeches. you can't tell, for the life of
                        you, the difference between bran and shorts or which cow gives the
                        buttermilk. The young men generally came out of the war "with the skin of
                        their teeth," with no fortune, I might say, but their wardrobes of gray and
                        their canteens, and to marry with them now, rest assured, relates more to
                        making a living with the assistance of a love, industrious helpmate, than
                        indulging in opera music, moonshine, and poetry. Do you know what they say
                        of one of your butterfly young ladies who has held them in the parlor
                        engaged by the hour listening to "elegant nothings?" Nineteen times out of
                        twenty is this--"Well she is all right for an evening's entertainment, but
                        she will not make a good wife."</p>
                    <p>There is no possible objection to the accomplishments of music, painting, and
                        the like, as such, but the idea is to be able to set these parlor amusements
                        aside for the period, when the stern duties of married life, all for your
                        practical knowledge. Show the young men that you can do your part of double
                        business; that you can cook a meal's victuals on a pinch; that you can sweep
                        up, and dust, and darn old stockings, and save a penny toward an accumulate
                        pound; that you will not be a dead expense to him through life. Believe me,
                        my young friends, as many true heroic, womanly hearts beat over household
                        duties, as flutter beneath the soft light of a parlor chandelier. your kiss
                        is just as sweet, your smiles just as bright, your heart as happy and
                        tender, after a day's exertion in a sphere worthy of true womanhood, as in
                        places of dissipation, frippery, and silly amusement. Have an ambition to do
                        your part in life; cultivate industrial habits, and let the parlor
                        accomplishments go with the higher accomplishments I have roughly
                        enumerated. it is astonishing how soon a domestic young lady is found out
                        and appreciated. It is because she is such a rare exception to the general
                        rule.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A meeting of "respectable" citizens of Albemarle was held in Charlottesville
                        on the 1st inst., in which a series of resolutions were passed, declaratory
                        of their purpose to co-operate with the Republican party, on the ground that
                        it was the only party that could secure to the people of Southern States
                        protection to life and property, and affirming that they considered
                        themselves "in honor bound to the unconditional maintenance of the Union of
                        the States." as to their desire to co-operate with the Republican party,
                        from conviction of the truth of their principles, or from policy, expediency
                        or fear, we have nothing to say, but when they declare, as it were, that the people of the Southern States "are in honor
                        bound to the unconditional maintenance of the
                        Union of the States," we are indisposed to let such action pass without a
                        notice, however respectable or intelligent the promulgators of such a
                        doctrine. No such idea obtained in the days of the formation of the
                        Republic, or to-day would have witnessed no such Government as we have, for
                        the States would have delegated no powers to a general agent, but have
                        reserved all, and there would have been to-day as many small Republics, at
                        least, as there were colonies. It has remained for these gentlemen, in sight
                        of the last resting place of the "Sage of Monticello," to promulgate this
                        doctrine terrible to the prospects of our country and totally destructive of
                        Republican Government on this Continent. We maintain that no man, be he from
                        the North or South, be he White or Black, is in "honor bound" to the unconditional maintenance of the Union of the
                        States. Our ancestors framed and gave their adherence to no unconditional Union, but to a constitutional Union.
                        In yielding our cause as lost, we sore to support no unconditional Union, but the Constitution and the laws made in
                        pursuance thereof, excepting therefrom the Emancipation Act. No man has been
                        disfranchised for participation in the late war, on account of thus
                        endeavoring to destroy an unconditional Union,
                        and no one is required now to swear allegiance to an unconditional Union. The idea which the majority in the North
                        maintain is that the Union is indissoluble, but, however their acts may
                        belie their profesions, they claim it still as a Constitutional Union. We
                        submit therefore that we, one and all, are bound in honor to support no
                            unconditional Union, but a Union under a
                        written Constitution. A few malcontents, months ago, proclaimed themselves
                        unconditional Union men, but so little of intellect and influence heralded
                        this cry that it was of no moment to combat the heresy, but when men, who
                        lay a just claim to respectability and intelligence, proclaim such a
                        doctrine, it is time that all parties should arise to dispel this political
                        dogma, which contains within it, that which will sap the foundations of
                        Republican Government in this country.</p>
                    <p>We claim to have ever revered the Union under the Constitution, but never do
                        we expect to counsel, advise or give aid to a Union of these States, without conditions, and we opine that the day will
                        come, if it has not already, when the respectabilities of Albemarle will
                        hide their heads for shame over the doctrine promulgated in their 1st of
                        July Resolutions.</p>
                    <p>The people of the South yielded to the stern arbitrament of the sword, and
                        without a murmur have done, and are doing, all that was required of them to
                        restore peace and prosperity to the country, and guarantee equal rights to
                        all classes, but they have not been required to do that which would render
                        nugatory their oaths to support the Constitution, and they will not
                        voluntarily do so by declaring themselves supporters of an unconditional Union. The Albemarle gentlemen are
                        too eager to affiliate with the Republicans, and we suggest to the latter
                        that before they are admitted they should again be required to take an oath
                        to support the Constitution of the United
                    States.</p>
