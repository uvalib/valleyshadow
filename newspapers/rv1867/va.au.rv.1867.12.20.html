<b>Making The Application</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article relates the details of a "conversation" between a "Black
                    Republican and a Democrat" on the topic of black suffrage. In the course of the
                    discussion, the Democrat asserts that the inevitable consequences of political
                    equality will be social equality and interracial marriages, "a point all men
                    should thoughtfully think over before they vote."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Several days ago a Black Republican and a Democrat got into conversation on
                        the subject of making voters out of negroes.--The Black Republican contended
                        that the negroes should be allowed to vote as a matter of right.</p>
                    <p>"But," replied the Democrat, "that will lead to social equality."</p>
                    <p>"Let it," rejoined the Republican, "the only difference between the negroes
                        and the whites is in color of skin and in hair."</p>
                    <p>"Then you think," said the Democrat, "that the negroes should have the same
                        social, as well as the same political privileges the whites enjoy."</p>
                    <p>"Certainly," replied the Republican.</p>
                    <p>"Now, suppose a negro and your daughter should conclude to contract marriage,
                        what would you do in regard to that?" asked the democrat.</p>
                    <p>"Why I should let her, of course," responded the Republican.</p>
                    <p>"And you would enjoy daudling on your knee a mulatto grand-child, would you?"
                        queried the Democrat.</p>
                    <p>"Oh no, I should not do that. If my daughter married a negro, I should
                        discard [unclear] the Republican spirit.</p>
                    <p>"What," asked the Democrat, "discard your daughter for believing and
                        practicing the doctrines you teach? Come neighbor, don't you think you are
                        carrying this negro business too far? If there is no difference really
                        between a negro and a white man, excepting the color of his skin and in the
                        matter of hair, why would you discard your daughter for marrying a negro
                        instead of a white man?"</p>
                    <p>The Republican hung his head thoughtfully. This is a point all men should
                        thoughtfully think over before they vote on the subject of making negroes
                        the political equals of the whites.</p>

<b>Denied Admittance</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After accepting an invitation to stay at the home of a white Radical
                    legislator from Pennsylvania, Fred Douglass was asked to leave the premises by
                    the man's wife. This incident, declares the article, underscores the fact that
                    "however much some men may prate about 'equality of the races,' white women
                    cannot and will not become advocates of the destitute doctrine."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Wednesday and Thursday of last week the Great Virginia Conservative
                        Convention was in session. The call, by the Executive Committee of Richmond,
                        was responded to from every county in the State and Virginia had the proud
                        satisfaction of seeing once again may of her ablest and most trusted
                        citizens counseling together for the salvation of their beloved Old
                        Dominion, if not of their entire country. It is said to have been th largest
                        convention ever assembled in the State and was, without doubt, characterized
                        by more unanimity of sentiment and purpose. As our space precludes our
                        giving the action of the convention in detail, we confine ourselves to that
                        portion which will most interest our readers.</p>
                    <p>Temporary Organization</p>
                    <p>At a quarter past 11 o'clock Wednesday the convention was called to order by
                        the Hon. Willoughby Newton on whose motion the Hon. Thomas Jefferson
                        Randolph was appointed temporary chairman.</p>
                    <p>On taking the chair, Mr. Randolph said that some forty or fifty years ago, he
                        happened to be present at a caucus, when an old gentlemen was made temporary
                        chairman, and it was said that if old gentlemen were not fit for anything
                        else they were fit [LINE MISSING; MUST RE COPY EDITION] for temporary
                        chairman, and he supposed he was entitled to the position assigned him.</p>
                    <p>When the so-called constitutional Convention assembled in the Capitol of
                        Virginia, the fact was made known of the intended array or race against
                        race, under the conduct of a few renegade white men; and the necessity of an
                        organization to form a white man's party was the cause of the assembling of
                        the body before him.</p>
                    <p>There had never been a period in the history of the country when the talents
                        of silence was so necessary. When General Lee surrendered, the people
                        submitted in good faith. Whatever opinion they may have entertained in
                        regard to secession was abandoned as impracticable, and the people had from
                        that time forward proved themselves law-abiding citizens. The idea was not
                        to be entertained that perfect submission would secure to them their
                        liberty,--a thing in the heart of every Virginian unimperishable.</p>
                    <p>The old grand-dames recounted with pride to the children at their knees the
                        fame and achievements of their ancestors; the mother taught the love of
                        liberty to her daughter; the father taught it to his son. They could all go
                        home and tell parents to bring up their daughters as chaste as their
                        mothers, their sons as brave and faithful as their fathers. Virginia valor
                        had been evinced upon every battle-field of the war; it was proved
                        unconquerable by the desolation of the country.--They must all look forward
                        to a brighter, better day. He thanked the Convention for the honor they
                        conferred upon him in making him their chairman, and took his seat.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Hoge, being requested to do so, came forward and made an eloquent and
                        appropriate prayer.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Col. Christian, of Augusta, the Richmond Editors were appointed
                        Secretaries of the Convention.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Turner, of Rappahanock, moved that a committee of thirteen be appointed
                        to report permanent officers of the convention, which being adopted the
                        chairman named the following gentlemen to constitute the committee, viz:</p>
                    <p>Zephaniah Turner, of Rappahannock; O. R. Funsten, of Clarke; Bolivar
                        Christian, of Augusta; Waller R. Staples, of Montgomery; David R. Burk, of
                        Bedford; Wm. Martin, of Henry; Asa D. Dickinson, of Prince Edward; Robert
                        Whitehead, of Nelson; R. T. Daniel, of Richmond; R. H. Coleman, of Carolina;
                        James M. Wilcox, of Charles City; John Goode, of Norfolk; and M. R. Garnett,
                        of Essex.</p>
                    <p>The committee retired but a few minutes and on their return reported the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>Permanent Officers of the Convention</p>
                    <p>President--Hon. A. H. H. Stuart.</p>
                    <p>Vice-Presidents--Hon. R. M. T. Hunter, Hon. Samuel McDowell Moor, Hon. Thos.
                        S. Bocock, Hon. Robert S. Preston, Hon. Thomas S. Flournoy, General James L.
                        Kemper, C. W. Newton, Esq., Hon. W. H. Macfarland, Colonel George W.
                        Bolling, Wood Bouldin, Esq.</p>
                    <p>Secretaries--Henry K. Ellyson, Wm. R. Coleman, James McDonald and J. Bell
                        Bigger.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart, on being conducted to the chair by Messrs. Funsten and Turner
                        said:</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen of the convention: I thank you for the honor you have done more
                        calling me to preside over a convention which embodies so large a share of
                        the virtue, intelligence, and patriotism of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>We have assembled, gentlemen, under circumstances of peculiar interest and
                        solemnity. This is no convention to advance the interests of a mere party.
                        Thank Heaven, if the late fearful conflict has done no other good, it has
                        effected all old party animosities. We come together not as Whigs or
                        Democrats, but as Virginians, earnestly devoted to the promotion of the
                        interests and humor of our common mother.</p>
                    <p>Nor have we come together in any factious spirit or with any aggressive
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>Whatever opinions individual members of this Convention may have entertained
                        in the past as to the right of a State to withdraw from the Union, I think I
                        may safely affirm that they have been abandoned as impracticable. The
                        question arising out of those opinions have been referred to the arbitrament
                        of arms, and having been decided adversely, all now feel that they are bound
                        in honor, as well as impelled by interest, to stand by the award.</p>
                    <p>The people of Virginia now desire repose, and they earnestly seek a
                        restoration of their constitutional relations to the Union as to the best
                        means of affording it. They feel, too, that the material interests of all
                        parts of our widely extended country are impaired, and our liberties
                        imperilled by the longer continuance of the present unhappy strifes, and we
                        seek a restoration of the Union as the most efficient remedy for all the
                        evils of which we complain.</p>
                    <p>When the war ceased we were told that if we annulled our ordinances of
                        secession, and repudiated the Confederate debt, and perfected the
                        emancipation of our slaves by adopting the constitutional amendment, we
                        would be restored to our constitutional rights. To these conditions we
                        promptly acceded, because they involved no sacrifice of our self-respect and
                        were attended by no national degradation. We have faithfully fulfilled all
                        these conditions, and yet our rights are withheld. May we not, under these
                        circumstances, appeal to the justice and good faith of the North for the
                        redemption of the promises thus made to us?</p>
                    <p>Looking to events which have happened in other Southern States, the people of
                        Virginia have been led to fear that a policy is to be inaugerated here which
                        tends, if it be not designed to subvert our whole social fabric and to bring
                        the land of Washington. Henry, Jefferson, Madison and Marshall under the
                        dominion of an alien and inferior race. We should be false to all the
                        instincts of humanity -- false to the blood which courses through our veins
                        -- false to every obligation of duty to ourselves, our kindred, and our
                        country, if we did not earnestly protest against and seek to arrest so
                        fearful a calamity.</p>
                    <p>We hope our fears may be unfounded.--We hope we may be spared this attempted
                        degradation. But it is the part of prudence to guard against all
                        contingencies. It is for this purpose that we have met to take counsel
                        together to-day. We wish with one united voice to appeal to the patriotic
                        people of the North to come to our relief and stay the hands of those who
                        would oppress and degrade us.</p>
                    <p>We desire further to perfect our organization, so that all who desire that
                        this shall continue to be a white man's government may be able to act in
                        concert, and by one vigorous and united effort save ourselves from ruin and
                        disgrace. We prefer military rule to the despotism of an arrogant rabble.
                        And we wish to declare, with earnestness and emphasis, that, come what may,
                        we and those we represent can never agree that this shall be any other than
                        a white man's government. Our rights may wrested from us by violence, but we
                        will never agree that our proud old mother shall be presented in the attitude of consenting to her own degradation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Daniel, of Richmond, moved that a committee of thirteen be appointed to
                        prepare business for the Convention to which all resolutions and
                        propositions should be referred. Several substitutes were offered and
                        defeated and the motion of Mr. Daniel was then adopted, and the President
                        named the following gentlemen to constitute the</p>
                    <p>Committee of Business</p>
                    <p>R. T. Daniel, R. M. T. Hunter, William Martin, Z. Turner, Waller R. Staples,
                        John B. Baldwin, Thomas S. Boacock, Jas. M. Wilcox, Robert H. Whitehead,
                        George W. Bolling, John Goode, Jr., John Randolph Tucker.</p>
                    <p>At the request of Mr. Whitehead, Mr. James Barbour was placed upon the
                        committee in his stead.</p>
                    <p>On the motion the Convention adjourned until 7 o'clock P. M.</p>
                    <p>The Convention assembled at 7 o'clock. Mr. Daniel stated that the committee
                        of 13 were not ready to report and asked for an enlargement of the committee
                        and further time which was agreed to and the following gentlemen added to
                        the Committee.</p>
                    <p>Governor Letcher, Hon Fayette McMullen, Dr. S. P. Kelso, W. W. Massie., O. B.
                        Finney, Nathaniel Alexander, Moses Walton and W. W. Flemming.</p>
                    <p>On motion the Convention adjourned to meet at 11 A. M., on Thursday.</p>
                    <p>A number of distinguished gentlemen were called upon, none whom responded
                        save Gov. Letcher, who came forward and said that he had learned, years ago,
                        a maxim, which he deemed very appropriate to the occasion, which says.</p>
                    <p>"A still tongue makes a wise head" and thanking
                        the assembled multitude, retired, whereupon the throng, satisfied with the
                        Governor's wise silence, quietly withdrew.</p>
                    <p>At 12 P.M., Thursday, the Convention was called to order by the President,
                        and was opened by prayer by the Rev. Dr. Peterkin.</p>
                    <p>The reading of the journal was dispensed with.</p>
                    <p>The business Committee, through their Chairman. Mr. Daniel made their report;
                        as follows:</p>
                    <p>The Committee on Business beg leave to report:</p>
                    <p>That they have prepared a series of resolutions which they submit for the
                        approval of the Convention.</p>
                    <p>They report a plan of general organization of the Conservative voters of the
                        State, which they submit, in like manner, the details of which are numerous
                        and need not be set forth.</p>
                    <p>They recommend to the convention that a committee of five be appointed by the
                        President of the convention, whose duty it shall be to prepare and publish
                        ast such times as the STae Executive Committee (if one be appointed) may
                        deem advisable, an address on behalf of the people of Virginia to the people
                        of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Several other important matters have been referred to the committee.</p>
                    <p>An address to the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States;
                        another address to the Senate and House of Representatives in Congress
                        assembled, from Col. Moore, of Rockbridge.</p>
                    <p>A series of resolution submitted by Mr. W. W. Hancock, of Chesterfield.</p>
                    <p>A resolution proposing a committee to confer with General Scholfield, upon
                        the propriety of disarming the negroes of the Commonwealth and suppressing
                        military drills among them; and other matters connected with that subject.</p>
                    <p>A resolution to the effect that this is a White Man's government, and that it
                        is the mission of the Conservative party, North and South, to preserve it as
                        such.</p>
                    <p>A series of resolutions adopted by a public meeting in Hanover.</p>
                    <p>A resolution that it is expedient for the convention to memorialize Congress
                        on the subject of our grievances, and also to address the people of the
                        Northern, Western and Eastern States on the same subject.</p>
                    <p>A resolution by Mr. Turner, of Richmond that an address to the people of
                        Virginia be prepared by the committee and reported to the convention, and
                        also a plan of organization of the State at large.</p>
                    <p>All of which the committee have had under consideration; but from the extent
                        and magnitude of the topics presented, and the shortness of time which could
                        be employed in maturing such measures as they suggest, (farther than they
                        are embraced in the former part of this report,) the committee recommended
                        that these several matters be referred to the Central Executive Committee,
                        should one be appointed, to be properly disposed of.</p>
                    <p>All of which the committee respectfully submit.</p>
                    <p>R. T. Daniel, Chairman.</p>
                    <p>Hon. John Randolph Tucker, then read the resolutions reported by the
                        committee, of which it was understood he was the author, which we commend to
                        the careful perusal of our readers, and which are as follows:</p>
                    <p>This Convention doth adopt the following Declaration of principles.</p>
                    <p>1. This Convention doth recognize that, by the result of the late war,
                        slavery has been abolished, and doth declare that it is not the purpose or
                        desire of the people of Virginia to reduce or subject again to slavery the
                        people emancipated by the events of the war, and by the amendment to the
                        Constitution of the United States.</p>
                    <p>2. This Convention doth declare that Virginia, of right should be restored to
                        her federal relations with the Government of the United States; and that it
                        is not in the contemplation of the people of Virginia to violate or impair
                        her obligations to the Federal Union, but to perform then in good faith.</p>
                    <p>3. This Convention doth solemnly declare and assert that the people of
                        Virginia are entitled to all the rights of freedom an all the guarantees
                        therefor provided by the Constitution of the United States, and they insist
                        on the same as unquestionable; and the said Constitution, which all are
                        sworn to support, does not justify the governing of Virginia by any power
                        not delegated by it, nor ought she, under it, to be controlled by the
                        Federal Government, except in strict accordance with its terms and
                        limitations.</p>
                    <p>4. This Convention doth declare, in the language of a resolution adopted by a
                        public meeting held at the Cooper Institute, in the city of New York, that
                        the policy which continues to subject the people of ten States of the Union
                        to an irresponsible government carried on by military power, is inconsistent
                        with the express provisions of the Constitution of the United States, and is
                        subversive of the fundamental ideas of our Government and of civil liberty;
                        and the object for which this great wrong has been persisted in, as now
                        being disclosed to the people and to the world, to wit: To subject the white
                        people of these States to the absolute supremacy in [maybe line missing]
                        their local government and in their representation in the Senate and House
                        of Representatives, of the black race, just emerged from personal servitude,
                        abhorrent to the civilization of mankind, and involves us and the people of
                        the Northern States in the consequences of surrendering one-third of the
                        Senate and one-quarter of the House of Representatives, which are to
                        legislate over us, to the dominion of an organized class of emancipated
                        slaves, who are without any of the training, habits or traditions of
                        self-government.</p>
                    <p>5. This Convention, for the people of Virginia, doth declare that they
                        disclaim all hostility to the black population; that they sincerely desire
                        to see them advance in intelligence and material prosperity, and are willing
                        to extend to them a liberal and generous protection; but that while in the
                        opinion of this Convention any Constitution of Virginia ought to make all
                        men equal before the law, and should protect the liberty and property of
                        all, yet this Convention doth distinctly declare that the Governments of the
                        States and of the Union were formed by white men, to be subject to their
                        control, and that suffrage should be still so regulated by the States as to
                        continue the Federal and State systems under the control and direction of
                        the white race.</p>
                    <p>6. That in the opinion of this Convention the people of Virginia will
                        sincerely cooperate with all men throughout the Union, of whatever name or
                        party, who will labor to restore the Constitutional Union of the States and
                        to continue its Government and those of the States under the control of the
                        white race.</p>
                    <p>John B. Baldwin, the author, then read the plan of organization adopted by
                        the committee, which is substantially the plan adopted in our Augusta
                        meeting, amplified, to meet the necessities of a State organization.</p>
                    <p>The report of the committee, the resolutions and the Plan of Organization
                        were severally, almost unanimously adopted.</p>
                    <p>On motion of John T. Anderson, of Botetourt, it was resolved that the
                        executive committee, when appointed by the Chair, take speedy means to test
                        the validity of the reconstruction acts before the Supreme Court.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Aylett and the mover of the resolution advocated its passage.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Hon. John B. Baldwin, the chair was given time to appoint the
                        committee of thirteen, as provided by the report of the committee above
                        mentioned.</p>
                    <p>Hon. Samuel McDowell Moore stated that as the Convention had done all the
                        good it could, and if it remained longer in session might do harm, he moved
                        an adjournment sine die.</p>
                    <p>The motion was agreed to and, in the language of our contemporary of the
                        Whig, "thus closed the ablest, wisest and most prudent convention we ever
                        saw assembled in Virginia."</p>

                    <p>Mr. Hunnicutt offered a resolution that the convention take steps to
                        alleviate the condition of those laboring men who have been deprived of
                        employment for voting the Republican ticket. Several amendments to this
                        motion were offered, none of which proposed to make it a misdemeanor,
                        punishable by law, to discharge employees for political opinions, all of
                        which, together with the original resolution were tabled by a decisive vote.</p>

                        the petition of Mr. Tukey on contested seat to committee on Privileges and
                        Elections, caused a motion to refer all cases of contested seats to that
                        committee which was adopted.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Mr. Woodson the Convention adjourned till Thursday at 12 M.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Hodges, (colored) from Princess Anne, offered the following resolution:</p>
                    <p>Whereas, There have been many loyal Union laboring
                        men in this State who are not landholders who have been distressed and
                        intimidated on account of their voting and supporting the Union Republican
                        ticket at the late election by disloyal and disunion landholders, therefore</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That this Convention appoint a committee
                        of vie to take the subject into consideration and report what necessary
                        steps in their judgement should be taken to put a stop to late distressing
                        and intimidating of loyal Union laboring men, by disloyal landholders in
                        this State.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hodges made a speech on the "revival" order in favor of his resolution.
                        He said that these men were met after the close of the war by these disloyal
                        men who told them that they owned the lands and they must leave it. These
                        men had fought for this glorious flag, and he hoped they would sustain his
                        resolution. Their constituents were looking to them for the support of
                        them.--His grandfather fit [unclear] in the army of Gen. Washington, and

                    <p>Mr. Williams of Amherst moved the following amendment which was accepted.</p>
                    <p>"Resolved. That the committee take also into

                        time into the case of those who have been intimidated by their brethren from
                        voting with those whom they conscientiously believed their friends, of
                        conservative political principles, that the remedy devised by the
                        constitutional enactment may be comprehensive, and not discriminating in its
                        provisions; so that voters of all opinions may be duly protected in the
                        exercise of the elective franchise."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hunnicutt delivered a partizan hargangue this subject which was replied
                        to by Messrs. Marye and Gibson, of Giles, in which Mr. Hunnicutt was handled
                        with gloves off, Mr. Gibson introducing some of Mr. Hunnicutt's editorial
                        articles prior to the war which were particularly severe on colored people.</p>
                    <p>Friday, 13th -- Mr. Marye moved the Committee on printing be required to
                        report any contract proposed to be made to the Convention for ratification;
                        which was carried.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Norton (colored) presented [line missing] ... for the relief of
                        homesteads which was simply to repudiate all private debts and begin afresh
                        so far as money mattery were concerned, and which on account of its abusive
                        tenor and scurrilous language, was refered to the Committee on the
                        Judiciary, with the express understanding that it was not to be printed.</p>
                    <p>Lewis Lindsay, negro, of Richmond, offered the following preamble and
                        resolutions:</p>
                    <p>Whereas, This Convention now assembled under the acts of Congress of the U.
