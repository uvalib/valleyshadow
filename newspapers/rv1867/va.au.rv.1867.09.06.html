<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Blaming the "Abolition party of the North" for the current predicament in
                    the South, the editors allege that Republicans sabotaged the bond between

                    "real sympathy" for blacks.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Abolition party of the North set up a vast claim of friendship for the
                        colored man, in which there is no justice, but on the contrary the truth is
                        that their hatred to the colored man based upon extreme selfishness has
                        brought about the existing state of things. In earlier days there was a
                        considerable desire on the part of Southern men to bring about a gradual
                        emancipation, in the view of bettering the condition of the then slave,
                        without damaging the interests of owners and the country. This was too slow
                        a process for the North an was overshadowed by a desire there to abolish the
                        institution. The advocates of abolition, it is true, endeavored to increase
                        their numbers and power by sympathetic appeals, but they showed their hand
                        plainly in the effort to unite with them the white laboring classes. Then
                        they asserted that the labor of the colored man, as a slave, who, in that
                        condition, would ever be the preferred laborer in the South, stood in the
                        way of Northern labor finding renumerative employment here. Then the truth
                        exposed and the doctrine of the "irrepressible conflict" enunciated. There
                        was no love -- no real sympathy for the slave, but he stood in the way of
                        Northern white labor and must give way if extermination should follow. This
                        pet scheme was carried out but the white laborer found a competitor still in
                        the freedman, who, innocent of the change in his relation to his former
                        master, continued to find employment and a sustenance among his Southern
                        friends in preference to the white stranger. Old friendships were too strong
                        and a chasm must be made in them or the result so long desired would be lost
                        in the only "irrepressible conflict" possible -- between white and colored
                        labor. Then were words of friendship breathed into his confiding ear until
                        he was ready to believe the insidious doctrine that his interests were in
                        conflict with his late master's. There the seeds of distrust were sown on
                        the one side, to be nourished by that immense act of friendship (?) the
                        elevation to the right of suffrage, which, while intended to humiliate the
                        Southerners, would accomplish that other purpose, the alienation of the
                        master from his former slave. This accomplished, competition to white labor
                        would be destroyed and it would even be sought after. This result all can
                        plainly see stalking on to the ultimate detriment if not destruction of the
                        colored man. And this result, who can look at the facts and fail to see was
                        the object sough, and who can find therein one act of genuine friendship to
                        the colored man? But a friendship which gives the franchise to the ignorant
                        freedmen of the South as a right and yet withholds the suffrage from the
                        educated colored men of the North. A friendship that would, to-morrow,
                        reverse the tables and send the freedmen back to servitude had a purpose to
                        subserve. A friendship, the counsels of which, the colored man, when he
                        fully comprehends it, will disregard, if he values the perpetuity and
                        propriety of his race in this country.</p>
