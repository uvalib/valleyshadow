                <summary>The editors inform readers that Gen. Scholfield has named Oct. 22 as the
                    date for the election on whether to call a constitutional convention. According
                    to the latest apportionment, Augusta will lose one delegate while representation
                    for the Valley, as a whole, will drop to 18 from 33. In an effort to raise the
                    county's representation, the editors urge those made eligible to vote by the
                    latest amnesty proclamation to petition the Board of Registration.</summary>

                    <p>Richmond City voted on Monday last, on the question of a corporate
                        subscription of $2,000,000 to the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad and it
                        was decided by an overwhelming majority in favor of the subscription. This
                        is the first gun in Virginia, in response to the call of West Virginia for
                        the completion of this great artery, which is to tap the fertile prairies of
                        the great West and carry their trade and travel to the Atlantic coast
                        through our borders, which now seeks its outlet by circuitous routes. In
                        addition it will open up one of the finest mining sections in this country
                        and throw its riches into the lap of Virginia, so long deprived of them by
                        their inaccesibility. Then will our manufacturing interests take a vigorous
                        forward stop and our agricultural interest be enhanced correspondingly. Then
                        will we see the influx of a sturdy laboring class so much desired at
                        present, and the increase of Virginia's wealth and prosperity will put to
                        shame that of her sisters in the past. Richmond has acted nobly in this
                        matter and it now remains for the counties along the line to keep the ball
                        in motion and make Virginia what she should have been long years ago, but
                        for an inert old fogyism which possessed her.</p>

                <summary>At a meeting in Richmond last Monday, reports the article, an "overwhelming
                    majority" of those in attendance voted in favor of supporting a $2,000,000
                    subscription to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. The editors endorse this
                    decision on the grounds that the railroad will "tap the fertile prairies of the
                    great West" and transport its "riches into the lap of Virginia."</summary>

                    <p>There is nothing more cheering to us than the notices of the division and
                        sale of lands, in every portion of Virginia, to Northern men of capital and
                        enterprise and of good reputation at home, who propose to come and live
                        among us. In the past few months we scarcely pick up an exchange that does
                        not chronicle the sale of lands &amp;;c. to some worthy Northern
                        gentlemen. We may therefore conclude that prejudice and passion have "had
                        their day" in circulating base rumors of bad treatment to Northern
                        immigrants, and that this tide of immigration, so long restrained by idle
                        stories and otherwise, has turned in this direction. We trust that it has
                        and would desire to impress upon the people of that section to investigate
                        the advantages Virginia offers, far out-reaching those of newer States, and
                        assure them that worthy immigrants will meet with a kind reception at the
                        hands of all Virginians. We want such men among us to help us by their
                        energy and capital to develop the resources of our State and will welcome
                        and treat them as neighbors and friends.</p>

                <summary>The editors rejoice at the fact that growing numbers of northern men have
                    come to the South to relocate and invest their capital. This trend, they note,
                    indicates that the rumors of ill-treatment of northern immigrants have subsided.</summary>

                <summary>The article relates that a "distressing" accident occurred last Saturday as
                    A. Stuart McGuffin and James Apple were "going thro' the manual of arms with an
                    old gun, which neither one supposed to be loaded." McGuffin, 23, suffered a
                    fatal head wound after the gun fired while the young men were handling the
                    weapon.</summary>
