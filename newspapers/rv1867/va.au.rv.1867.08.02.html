<b>Abolitionists</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article sarcastically reveals the various things beside slavery that
                    Abolitionists have "abolished."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The word "Abolitionist" is derived from the transitive verb abolish, which Webster defines as follows;

                        appropriately to established laws, contracts, rites, customs, and
                        institutions. 2. To destroy." Now let us see what our Abolitionists have

                    <p>They have abolished low prices, cheap living, good times and the general
                        prosperity.</p>
