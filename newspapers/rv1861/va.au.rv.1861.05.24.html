                    emigrate to the South if they could. The article also claims that Northerners
                    are joining the army for bread, not because they support Lincoln.<br>(Names in announcement:  W.H. Garber)</blockquote>
<b>Virginia Forces</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Very cutting article about B.F. Butler, who was recently put in command of
                    Federal forces at Fort Monroe. The article calls him a "crave-hearted coward"

                    fleets to the American coast to protect their commercial interests and expresses

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Diocese of
                    Virginia met in Richmond last week. At the meeting, Bishop Meade stated that the
                    South would be fighting a war of self-defense, so its position was justifiable
                    before God.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In a letter from a New York broker to a friend of his in the South, the man
                    stated that he had lost twenty thousand dollars in the last few months. He fears
                    that the South cannot be subjugated, and he is "convinced of the foolishness of
                    continuing the state of affairs now existing." The Gazette calls this letter
                    "the first and only instance of returning reason among the deluded people of the
                    North" that it has seen in a long time.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Election.</p>
                    <p>The full returns of the election held yesterday have not come in, and
                        therefore we do not give a table. It is ascertained, however, that about
                        twenty-three hundred votes were cast, and not more than ten against the Ordinance of Secession. Taking into
                        consideration that about 1200 of the voters of the county are absent in the
                        service of the State, this is the usual vote of the county. There will not
                        be over ten votes out of thirty-five hundred,
                        cast against "Ratification." Christian is elected to the Senate, and Sheffey
                        and Walker, and probably W.M. Tate, to the House. The contest is between
                        Tate and J.A. Harman, and is very close. Broun leads Holliday for the Board
                        of Public Works from 1200 to 1500.</p>
                    <p>We will publish the full returns hereafter.</p>
                    <p>In Rockingham a very large vote was polled, and not over twenty against the
                        Ordinance. Hopkins, Woodson and Grattan are elected to the Legislature.
                        Broun beats Holladay for Board of Public Works.</p>
                    <p>In Shenandoah, a very large vote was cast, and unanimous for ratification.</p>
                    <p>In Rockbridge a large vote cast, and one only against ratification. Anderson
                        and Dorman elected to the Legislature. Broun leads for Board of Public
                        Works.</p>
