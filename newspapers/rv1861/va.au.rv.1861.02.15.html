<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Spectator</p>
                    <p>The Spectator, seeking an excuse to compliment its editor in the last issue
                        of that paper, says it "understood that some of the extremists in this and the adjoining counties say that the
                        Staunton Spectator is doing more harm than any paper in the State." The
                        editor then proceeds to pay himself a high complement for his very efficient
                        efforts in the recent canvass, and to associate himself with some of the
                        ablest papers in the State, assuming that they have taken alike positions
                        with himself.</p>
                    <p>We have no objections to this little piece of egotism on the part of our
                        neighbor. It is one of those self-congratulatory twits, which, while they do
                        no one else harm, are calculated to tickle one's self under the fifth rib.
                        But we cannot permit the other misapprehensions contained in his article to
                        pass uncorrected. Some wag evidently perpetrated a hoax on our credulous
                        neighbor when he was made to understand that his positions during the
                        canvass just closed were anything more than misrepresentations of the popular sentiment of this section of
                        the country. For although the "Staunton Spectator" was no doubt gratified by
                        the election of Col. Baldwin and Mr. Stuart, yet no line of policy that
                        either of them indicated as pertinent to be adopted by the Convention now in
                        session was either discussed or endorsed by that paper. No more did it
                        discuss or endorse the positions either of Col. Baylor, Gen. Harman, or
                        Capt. Imboden. The cry was with it, unconditional Union, without giving any
                        reason, and an occasional convert and unfair and unjust (to be no harsher)
                        attempt to insinuate into the popular belief that there was a "disunion"
                        party in the county. The editor well knows that there is no such party here,
                        nor were there disunion candidates running. All assumed nearly precisely the
                        same positions, and agreed entirely as to the end that should be
                        attained--the preservation of the Union--and only differed as to immaterial
                        points of policy to accomplish that result. To this extent did the "Staunton
                        Spectator" do harm, and no further, for we venture the assertion that there
                        are not one hundred men in the county who endorse its extreme submission views--its continued and persistent
                        inveighing against the South, and its mute silence as to the aggression,
                        treason and crimes of the North.</p>
                    <p>Again is the apprehension of the editor at fault, when he flatters himself
                        with the belief that any observant reader would be guilty of the
                        inconsistency of identifying his position and arguments with those of the
                        Alexandria Gazette, Richmond Whig, Charlottesville Review, &amp;c. But a
                        few weeks ago we took occasion to compliment the Gazette upon its warnings
                        to the New York Tribune, that the North must
                        yield to the just demands of the South--must give
                        us guarantees of future peace and the observance of our rights, or the South
                        would be a unit. When did the "Staunton Spectator" ever take such high
                        Virginia ground? We have before us now the following striking and loyal
                        sentiment from the Richmond Whig: "We know we express Virginia sentiment,
                        when we say that unless the North recede the South will secede. We do not
                        mean that the Southern States will withdraw, go out, and leave their rights
                        behind; but they will, upon separation, carry with them all their rights."
                        The Whig also tells the North plainly that Virginia intends to demand every
                        right that is guaranteed under the Constitution, and it will be a fatal
                        delusion if the North thinks she will be satisfied with anything less. When
                        did the "Staunton Spectator" do this? The Charlottesville Review, not with
                        the same nervousness, but with equal ability, has warned the North not to be
                        deluded with the belief that Virginia would in any contingency permit an
                        abridgment of one single right she had, or tolerate a settlement of our
                        present difficulties without the most ample security for the future. When
                        did the "Staunton Spectator" do this? Echo answers, when?</p>
                    <p>Then, we ask in all candor, whether there is a justification found in reason
                        for the designation as "extremists" by the "Spectator," of those who may
                        differ from that paper? Is it extreme to pride in the glory and honor of a just Union, founded upon the equal rights of all its parts, and
                        observing those relations of equity and right which the [word illegible] of
                        the compact guarantee? Is it extreme to stand
                            upon the Constitution, and gazing at the
                        stars that glitter in the flaunting ensign of our country's glory, claim
                        that no sister hand shall mar the beauty and brightness of the one that
                        represents our own Virginia? Is it extreme to say
                        to the surging waves of fanatical hate at the North which would madly
                        submerge our own homes and hearts in universal ruin, "thus far shalt thou go
                        and no farther?" Is it extreme to say, when our
                        equality has been demanded and indignantly denied us, to the State of our
                        nativity, where rest the bones of our fathers for generations past, and
                        where cluster and cling the endearing affections of the heart, as did Ruth
                        to Naomi: "Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after
                        thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest I will
                        lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God." If this be extreme, then we are "extremists!" If this be extreme,
                        then are those who are for demanding the rights of Virginia to the
                        "uttermost farthing," "extremists." If this be
                        extreme, then are Cols. Baylor and Baldwin, of Augusta, Messrs. Lewis,
                        Coffman and Gray, of Rockingham, Messrs. Dorman and Moore, of Rockbridge,
                        Col. Hull, of Highland, and all who were elected as genuine conservative Union men, as well as many who were
                        defeated, including Gen. Harman and Capt. Imboden.</p>

                    <p>A Fight or a Foot Race</p>
                    <p>A man, whose name we did not learn, borrowed without leave on last Tuesday
                        evening a piece of bacon from the store house of A.M. Bruce, Esq. He was
                        pursued by Messrs. Bruce and J.C. Marquis, overtaken, brought back, made to
                        deposit the bacon whence he had taken it, and then turned over to the boys.
                        After mature deliberation and consultation, it was determined by them that
                        if he would start and run as fast as his legs could carry him, he might go
                        free. No sooner was the proposition made, than off started the thief at
                        greyhound speed through our principal streets, followed by the boys with
                        "Hark and hoop and wild haloo," over hill and through vale until lost amid
                        the "heathery couches" of our mountain spurs.</p>
                    <p>The reason why he was not handed over to the legal authorities, was the

                    <p>For the Vindicator: The Spectator and the Clergy</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor: The Spectator publishes the concluding paragraphs of an address
                        to the Clergy and Laity of the Christian Churches of the country, recently
                        issued by the Revs. Wilson, Atkinson, Smith, Dabney and others of Virginia,
                        "touching the duties appropriate to the people of God," in the present
                        distracted condition of public affairs.</p>
                    <p>In order that the people may not be misled by these extracts, as to the true
                        position of the Reverend gentlemen, I must ask you to publish the following
                        emphatic declaration from the same address:</p>
                    <p>"Do these causes then exist? We would distinctly say, to avoid creating a
                        mischievous mistake, that if the Southern States of the Union are
                        persistently refused their just rights in the Confederacy and its common
                        territories, and the peculiar property, then, in our
                            opinion, the Southern people must conclude that these causes do exist,
                            and that the catastrophe, however lamentable, must be met, sorrowfully
                            indeed, and yet with the resolution of Freemen."</p>
                    <p>Thus you will see the Reverend gentlemen are far from being the tame
                        submissionists the Spectator would make them by
                        its isolated extracts. They are peace-loving and God-fearing men; but at the
                        same time patriots. Common justice, therefore, requires that they should
                        have the benefit of the foregoing declaration, made, as they distinctly say,
                        "to avoid creating a mischievous mistake."</p>
                    <p>FAIR PLAY</p>
