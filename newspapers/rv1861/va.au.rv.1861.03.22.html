<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Meeting on Monday Next.</p>
                    <p>We again remind the Democracy of the county, that a meeting will be held on
                        Monday next to appoint delegates to a Congressional Convention to assemble
                        in Harrisonburg on the 25th of April. This day is fixed upon, because it
                        will not interfere with the Courts of any county in the District that we
                        know of. We trust there will be a full meeting, for we deem it of the
                        highest importance that prompt and determined steps be taken to organize the
                        party and prepare for the triumph of the Democracy in May next. The contest
                        is emphatically to be between State Rights and Federalism, and the quicker
                        we draw the lines, the better. It is a time when every man should take his
                        position, and maintain a fixed stand in support of the principles of the
                        Constitution and the government as understood and explained by their
                        founders, or subscribe to a latitudinous idea that will in the end lead to a
                        surrender of our rights and the subordination of our section to Black
                        Republican and abolition aggression and outrage. The issue is before us, and
                        we cannot escape from its consideration. We must
                        either identify ourselves with the North or the South. The question of Union
                        or Disunion is dead and buried. Dissolution has already taken place, and
                        whether the people of Virginia can realize it or not, it is most certainly
                        so. The only question is, where will Virginia go--with her sister States of
                        the South on terms of perfect equality, where the Constitution, the laws and
                        legislation, the feelings and affections, harmonize with her interests and
                        institutions, or with the North, where every act discriminates against her,
                        proscribes her as inferior, and where the sentiment of the people is hostile
                        to her rights and the rights of her citizens? We beg the Democracy and all
                        State Rights men, to remember these things, and come forward on Monday next
                        to take a firm stand for the organization of the State Rights party in this
                        District.</p>

<b>The Programme</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the "submissionists" of the State Convention, who have agreed to
                    hold a Border State Convention in Kentucky. The Vindicator believes that the
                    members of the State Convention "are determined to make all they possibly can
                    out of their present position."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Corporation Election</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reminds voters that the Staunton election is next Wednesday week and urges
                    the city authorities to fix the streets.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Southern Express</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Legislature has passed a bill creating the Southern Express Company,
                    which will establish express lines through the Southern States. Harman and
                    Ficklin are the incorporators.<br>(Names in announcement:  B.F. Ficklin,  J.A. Harman)</blockquote>
<b>District Convention</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator once again urges voters to support the holding of a district
                    Democratic Convention. The paper supports this course because it is angry at
                    Congressman Harris, who is nominally a Democrat, but who has placed himself
                    "above every consideration of party interest." Harris has adopted a policy that
                    "cannot fail to demoralize and hopelessly break up our organization, and
                    eventuate in turning the District over to the Opposition."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator chides the Spectator for its expressed belief that a fusion
                    will occur between Douglas and Bell supporters. The Vindicator argues that
                    "Never was a delusion more complete."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In reply to the Spectator's statement that "'States-Rights Democracy' now
                    means Secession," the Vindicator states that "submission means Black
                    Republicanism."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Baltimore Conference</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Laymen's Convention of the M.E. Church has declared itself in favor of
                    the separation of the Baltimore Conference from the General Conference of the
                    Church. The Vindicator believes that the ministry must follow the lead of the
                    laymen.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Staunton Station</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Disputes an article from the Baltimore American, which claimed that the
                    people in Staunton perceive the Methodists to be so abolitionist that the local
                    preacher is "supported almost entirely by the contributions of the colored
                    people."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Staunton Station.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Mr. Veitch, in the Conference, on Tuesday last, rose to a privilege
                        question, for the purpose of denouncing as a falsehood the following
                        statement from the Staunton Correspondent of the Baltimore American:</p>
                    <p>"The Methodists have the sympathy of other denominations here, but so great
                        has the prejudice become against their supposed abolition tendency that the
                        preacher in charge is supported almost entirely by the contributions of the
                        colored people."</p>
                    <p>The preacher in charge of Staunton Station, Rev. J.R. Wheeler, is not only
                        liberally supported by his congregation, but is universally beloved, both in
                        and out of his Church, for his high character as a minister and gentleman.
                        He preaches every Sabbath to a crowded church, composed of persons of nearly
                        all religious persuasions, no one of whom has ever heard fall from his lips
                        anything that could raise a suspicion of his loyalty to the institutions of
                        the South. Indeed, there has never been a minister of any denomination who
                        enjoyed a more unrestricted and implicit confidence from an intelligent
                        public, than does the Rev. Mr. Wheeler from the people of Staunton. The only
                        regret with his congregation is that they cannot have him stationed here for
                        life. The writer of the above paragraph, from the American, is most
                        egregiously ignorant, to say the least.</p>

<b>Can the People Bear It?</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the "pride and manhood of every Virginian" has been humiliated
                    by the cowardly policies the state has adopted.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Replies to the Spectator, which criticized the Vindicator for changing its
                    policy on putting the question of secession to the people. The Vindicator claims
                    that it didn't support a popular referendum before Lincoln's inauguration
                    because the time was so short. Now that Lincoln is in power and the State
                    Convention is in session, however, the Vindicator wants the people to vote on
                    the question.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Artful Dodgers</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the Virginia Unionists for their repeated delays and failures to
                    act. They first supported separate state action, then a Peace Conference, and
                    then a Border State Conference. The Vindicator argues that these are all dodges,
                    and the paper hopes that the people will "discard from their councils such
                    miserable tricksters."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Mr. Goggin's Plan</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator directs its readers' attention to the plan of ordinance for
                    Virginia written by Hon. W.L. Goggin, the former Opposition candidate for
                    governor. The paper supports the "tangible points in the proposition" and
                    wonders if the Spectator will say the same.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The two Tariffs</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Compares the Morrill tariff, recently adopted by the Federal Government,
                    with the tariff policies adopted by the Confederacy. The former raises the
                    prices of "every article of consumption used by the farming and laboring classes
                    of Virginia" and protects the interests of Northern manufacturers. The latter
                    reduces the taxes on goods by about one-fourth.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that, as soon as the Morrill tariff goes into effect in the North
                    and the Southern Confederacy is recognized by foreign nations, trade and specie
                    will begin to flow into the South because of the Confederacy's lower tariffs on
                    foreign goods.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Claims that the "Whig and Know Nothing fossils" in the State Convention
                    don't want Virginia to unite with the Confederacy because they know that such a
                    shift would destroy their political power.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Nailed to the Counter</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Claims that the letter that the Spectator published purporting to be from
                    Judge Robert Lyon of Abbeville, South Carolina was a "tissue of the most
                    unmitigated falsehoods."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator believes that George Rye of Shenandoah will be named the new
                    U.S. Marshall for the Western District of Virginia. The paper fears that the
                    Lincoln administration will use all its power and patronage to "abolitionize"
