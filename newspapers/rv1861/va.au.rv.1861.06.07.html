<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Condition of the N.W. Border.</p>
                    <p>The present condition of things in our State, which was anticipated by those
                        who in February last voted against the reference back to the people, of the
                        ordinance of secession, proves the wisdom of that vote.--They loved the
                        people and their rights better than to expose them to the dangers of such a
                        reference,--and it is remarkable that here, and all over the State, the vote
                        against reference was given by the constant and earnest advocates of popular
                        rights--but who were unwilling that their liberties and lives should be
                        jeopardized by the exercise of that right in a way to endanger them. What is
                        the result? The vote on ratification has been taken in the midst of war, and
                        in the face of a vigilant and unscrupulous enemy, who had the whole State
                        filled with his spies, and that enemy thro' information derived from the
                        polls has been made aware of every opponent of State Rights, and his
                        location. It would have been just as wise to have furnished Abraham Lincoln
                        with a list of his friends in Virginia--their names, locality, and showing
                        where he could find aid and comfort among us. The noble old State has gone
                        by a majority of some 150,000 for Secession, but Lincoln has been told by
                        the pretended lovers of popular supremacy, that
                        one little corner of our State is by heavy majorities opposed to her
                        sovereignty, and that too on its border most exposed to invasion.</p>
                    <p>By that fatal vote on Ratification, the record of the North West shows Mr.
                        Lincoln the names of his friends, and how quickly has he availed himself of
                        the information. His armies are already there, and our brave defenders--our
                        own sons and brothers, are in imminent danger. The latest intelligence from
                        that quarter informs us that our little force at Grafton have been compelled
                        to retreat from that place to Phillippi, before superior numbers of the
                        Northern forces, thus leaving the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road from Wheeling
                        nearly to Harper's Ferry in undisputed possession of the enemy, and that on
                        Monday morning last, our men were surprised and driven from Phillippi, with
                        the loss of several lives, many arms and all their stores, and that they
                        have now retreated to Beverly, in Randolph county. This news is somewhat
                        mitigated by the intelligence that by a brave stand of Capt. Moomaw's
                        company, and perhaps others, in a wood some two miles from Phillippi, the
                        enemy were surprized in turn, and driven back with great loss. Five of our
                        men are said to have been killed, and about sixty or eighty of the enemy in
                        the conflict. But we have lost our position, and the loss of arms and
                        provisions must have left our little force in bad condition. There is an old
                        saying that holds good in all the affairs of life, but especially in war,
                        that "whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well." If our North
                        Western border is not to be given up to the Northern enemy, surely some
                        efficient reinforcements should be sent there at once.--We are informed that
                        the condition of our little force there has been hitherto most
                        disheartening. With no artillery, and not more than ten rounds of powder for
                        the small arms, our men too, raw and undisciplined, and badly officered. One
                        of the brave men who brought the news of the retreat from Phillippi,
                        expresses the conviction that a well-appointed force of 2,500 men could
                        master in sheir [sic] mountain passes any number that might be sent against
                        them.</p>
                    <p>We appeal to our rulers to know whether the protection of the loyal men of
                        our border, and the relief from alarm, and the danger of incursions, of
                        those further in the interior would not justify such a force in the
                        Northwest, and another of the same size in the West. Our fighting men have
                        been drawn from among us to the East and to Harper's Ferry, so as to leave
                        all West Virginia in a very defenseless condition. Will not this fact,
                        without more vigilance on the part of the War Department, invite our
                        invasion, or at least expose our population to alarm and panic? We hope the
                        able heads of our War Department will have an eye to these things.</p>
