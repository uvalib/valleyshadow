<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For the Vindicator.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--A few thoughts have presented themselves to my mind, of a local
                        character, whilst enjoying the luxury of a blazing fire and a rich Havana,
                        during the inclement weather, which has so sorely afflicted us for the last
                        week; and for the benefit of our community, as well as to gratify myself, I
                        have determined to ask your permission to print them.</p>
                    <p>Cemetery Fund</p>
                    <p>About a year ago, I believe, a Fair was held by the ladies of Staunton, for
                        the purpose of raising funds to improve the Cemetery. It is understood that
                        the means thus raised through the energy of our fair ladies, have never been applied to the object originally
                        designed, on account of some legal disability, or other sufficient cause. If
                        this be true, and the fund is still lying idle, I respectfully suggest that
                        it be loaned to the two military companies of Staunton, for the purpose of
                        aiding them in purchasing the necessary equipments, such as tents,
                        knapsacks, &amp;c, for active service in the field. The unsettled state
                        of our national affairs may render a call for the services of our volunteer
                        companies by the State necessary at any moment, and in order to enable them
                        to be prepared for marching, this suggestion is made. If complied with, a
                        praiseworthy object will have been materially advanced, and the Cemetery
                        fund be made interest-bearing.</p>
                    <p>Home Guard</p>
                    <p>Our two military companies have offered their services in case of war, and in
                        the event of need, will doubtless be called away--that would leave our
                        property and wives and children without organized protective force. This
                        should not be, as in the kind of warfare which
                        will prevail, if there should be war, every place is liable to attack or
                        disturbance. I suggest, therefore, the formation of a Company, to be called
                        the Staunton Home Guard, who are to act merely on the defensive, and not to
                        act except in the absence of the two companies now existing. Men past
                        military age, ministers and others, might join this company. It need have no
                        uniform, but a simple badge, and need drill but little. Having organized
                        selected arms and badge, they might agree that a certain alarm-signal should
                        at any time summon them to an appointed place.</p>
                    <p>Lewis Street</p>
                    <p>All our streets are bad enough, in all conscience, but Lewis street, from
                        Frederick street out, is my far too bad. It is all mud, with a ditch for
                        sidewalks. On said street live many poor persons, who can't afford boots and
                        shoes, and they get to church and their daily work (when they can get there) at the expense of health; and at the
                        risk of their lives. I doubt not that some girls have, from wading along
                        this street, gotten the seeds of death in their constitutions. Every
                        Corporation owes it to its citizens to abolish nuisances, and Lewis street
                        is certainly a nuisance. It has been said, "a Corporation can't sin;" but I
                        say this Corporation is a grievous sinner, if it don't [sic] do something
                        for Lewis street.</p>
