<b>Submission is Ruin</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Seeks to prove that slavery is an economically productive system for the
                    South. The Dispatch argues that cheap immigrant labor serves the same purpose
                    for the North that slave labor does for the South.<br>

                    <p>Submission is Ruin.</p>
                    <p>Nothing could be more preposterous, nothing more stupid, than the dogma that
                        slavery is a curse to the country. On the contrary, the heaviest calamity
                        that could befall any slave State on this continent, the greatest curse that
                        an angry Providence could inflict upon the South, would be the destruction
                        of its slave institution. The North ascribe its own rapid increase in
                        population and wealth chiefly to the immigration of foreigners; and does so
                        with reason. The foreigner comes over, in the general, destitute, obliged to
                        work, and willing to labor with his own hands. The Yankee lives upon his
                        wits; but the foreign laborer is a real producer--he works with his own
                        hands, he digs the earth, and he produces food for his own consumption as
                        well as for that of his Yankee taskmaster. Well may the North ascribe its
                        prosperity in a great degree to the immigrant; for that individual becomes a
                            producer from the outset, and not until he
                        accumulates a little capital by his manual industry, does he imitate the
                        Yankee, resort to his wits for a livelihood, and resolve himself into a
                            consumer.</p>
                    <p>It is from immigration that the North derives its chief want, its most
                        exigent desideratum--labor, manual labor; dirt digging, soil tilling labor;
                        the labor decreed against man by the curse of Eden; the labor that brings to
                        his brow the dust and the sweat. Various are the devices which the Yankee
                        contrives to avoid, himself, this sweat of the brow--machines without
                        number, factories where women and girls are made to work in droves; ligneous
                        nutmegs and hams; protective tariffs, and like inventions. But the influx of
                        penniless immigrants from Europe, was the Yankee's godsend--poor,
                        necessitous, stout, sinewy immigrants, used to privation and toil, willing
                        to labor with their hands, anxious to barter their service for mere bread.
                        But the evil of immigrant labor is, that it is not permanent. Industry in
                        our flourishing country soon brings its reward of accumulated means and easy
                        competency. The humble, industrious immigrant soon grows too well-to-do to
                        be willing or obliged to sweat and toil longer. His service at the shovel
                        and the hoe is but an apprenticeship of a few years, at the end of which he
                        becomes, in his turn, an imployer [sic] and consumer, rather than a laboring
                        producer.</p>
                    <p>It is this windfall of labor by the millions, pouring into the North during
                        the last twenty years, that has been the leading agent in the rapid
                        development and great prosperity of that section. It remained at the North
                        because it was wanted there. It did not come South, because we had it
                        already.--The defect of this species of labor is its want of permanency--is
                        the fact that it is not (as to the individual) a life time service, but a
                        mere apprenticeship of a few years--Virginia contains half a million of life
                        time laborers, descendants of Ham, doubly decreed to service by the divine
                        edicts pronounced against Adam and Canaan--to service for life, service in
                        perpetuity--Suppose that, by some fell decree, every laboring immigrant in
                        the North were suddenly swept from that stiff necked land, who will estimate
                        the thousand millions of loss that would be instantly inflicted upon all its
                        busy interests? Labor, labor, is the jewel of great price in a nation's
                        casket.--Labor is the bread and breath of a State.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed to bind Virginia to a political association that will impede
                        her labor like a pestilence. It is proposed to chain her to a destiny that
                        at once exiles from her borders the grandest body of productive labor to be
                        found in any State upon the globe. It is proposed, by allying the mother of
                        States to the emigrants of New England, not merely to make her an alien and
                        an enemy to her daughters of the South, but to bereave her of her
                        institution of African labor, a handmaid that was born and fostered with
                        her, that has attended her from youth to age, and to whose faithful and
                        efficient service she owes all her comeliness and comfort.</p>
                    <p>To show the productive value of this slave system to Virginia, we have only
                        to contrast the property values of those counties within her borders which
                        have few slaves, with those which have many slaves. There could not be a
                        better exponent of the wealth of each than the taxes levied upon them by the
                        Commonwealth; for except the inconsiderable stipend which is levied per capita, these taxes are all levied directly in
                        proportion to the values existing in the counties, which values are the
                        product exclusively of the labor operating in those counties. For the
                        purpose of exhibiting this contrast we have coupled together in eight or ten
                        pairs, a county from the nonslaveholding portion of the State and a county
                        from the slaveholding, bringing together such as contain nearly equal
                        numbers of white inhabitants. It will be found that in every one of the
                        cases adduced below, (and we will extend the remark without fear of
                        contradiction that in every case which can be adduced at all,) the amount of
                        the taxes paid by the slaveholding county is more than double, often treble,
                        that paid by the county having few or no slaves. In each couple given, the
                        first is a Western, the second an Eastern county:</p>

                        annually contributed to the Treasury of the Commonwealth, in which every
                        citizen, be he resident upon the Ohio or the Holston, has as direct an
                        interest as the Eastern planter. And yet the submissionists of Virginia
                        propose to fix her in a condition to be abruptly robbed of this labor. Worse
                        than Abolitionists, they are willing to be parricides.--Richmond Dispatch</p>

                    <p>The Episcopal Church.</p>
                    <p>The New York Church Journal states that there will
                        be no schismatical division of the Episcopal Church in consequence of the
                        separation of the Confederacy. In the organization of that Church each State
                        composes a Diocese, and each Diocese, like each State, is sovereign and
                        independent. Their natural organization resembles the Federal organization,
                        and consequently, according to the Journal, not
                        only will the effects of State secession upon the diocesan relations of the
                        Church in the seceded States be at once recognized, but where, as in the
                        case of the Bishopric of Alabama, the concurrence of the National Episcopate
                        may be necessary to fill a vacancy, the promptest measures will be taken by
                        the Northern Bishops to give the requisite sanction to the election in
                        Alabama, and to every other act necessary for the entire independence of all
                        the dioceses in the seceded States. This is in perfect harmony with the
                        noble attitude of the Episcopal Church in the North from the beginning,
                        which has always and everywhere set its face as a flint against
                        abolitionism, and every other ism, and which is
                        composed of a body of clergy and laity which would have done honor to any
                        age and any nation of the Christian Church.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Wanted--A Policy.</p>
                    <p>Under the above caption, the N.Y. Times (Black Republican) devotes two
                        columns to the discussion of the "policy" of the
                        Lincoln Administration at Washington in keeping the country so long in
                        suspense as to what course that government is going to pursue in the crisis
                        in which our national affairs now stand. The Times first expresses great
                        regret at the idea that there should be any embarrassment in the mind of the
                        President at the course he should pursue in the Fort Sumter [sic] matter.
                        Such things, it admits, "require grave and serious attention," but such
                        attention should long ago have been given to so important a subject, and the
                        country at large, set at ease upon the subject, one way or the other. The
                        time that has been spent in apportioning the patronage of the administration
                        to the greedy sharks of the "Carpet-bag Volunteers," would have been more
                        profitably spent in devising some plan to avoid the horrors of civil war,
                        which the Administration is determined to inflict upon our country. In a
                        military point of view, we look upon the surrender of Fort Sumter as a
                        necessity, according to a fixed rule of military affairs, which is, we
                        believe, to give up a post that is either no longer tenable, or that cannot
                        be reinforced, except by so great a sacrifice of life as to render its
                        succor almost as disastrous as a defeat. Even if the attempt to relieve the
                        garrison at Fort Sumpter were successful, (and it can only be so to a
                        limited extent) does any one believe for a moment that the Carolinians would
                        cease in their efforts for its reduction, even if the siege were prolonged
                        to the extent of the famed siege of Troy, or the Thirty Years War? We do
                        not--for well we know the gallantry of the brave sons of the Palmetto, and
                        we feel satisfied that the last son of South Carolina will perish in the
                        breach before they will give up the attempt to place the flag of the
                        Confederate States upon its walls. Mr. Lincoln has, we fear, determined upon
                        making the attempt "to hold all the Forts and Arsenals, and collect the
                        revenue," proclaimed in that enigmatical production which he gave to the
                        country on the 4th of March; and ere this reaches our readers, the telegraph
                        may bring us the news of a bloody battle, upon the scene of that gallant
                        defense of Fort Moultrie in '76, Charleston harbor.</p>
                    <p>The Times goes on to acknowledge that the "country" (Abolition-dom) has been
                        very much deceived in the expectations conceived of the administration of
                        Mr. Lincoln. It complains that affairs at Washington are managed with too
                        great a display of "masterly inactivity"--that the country knows nothing of
                        the future, and that commercial affairs are thereby greatly damaged,-- that
                        there is no policy evinced, but only a "a listless waiting for something to
                        turn up." After complaining that such a course at present is particularly
                        unwise, it pays the following high complement to our young sister Republic:</p>
                    <p>The new Confederacy is moving forward, towards the consummation of its plans,
                        with a degree of vigor, intelligence, and success, of which, we are sorry to
                        say, we see no indications on the part of the Government at Washington. In
                        spite of the immense difficulties with which they have to contend, --the poverty of the country, its utter lack of commerce, of
                            an army and navy, and of credit,--the hostility of its fundamental
                            principles to the sentiment of the Christian world,--the utter
                        hollowness of its reasons for revolution, and the universal distrust which
                        it encounters everywhere,--in spite of all these obstacles and
                        discouragements, we cannot conceal the fact that the new Government of which
                        Jefferson Davis is at the head, has evinced a marvelous degree of energy,
                        and is rapidly assuming the proportions of a solid and formidable Power.
                        Within less than six months they have adopted a Constitution, organized a
                        Government, put all its machinery into working order, established a
                        commercial system and put it in operation, laid the basis of a financial
                        department, organized an army, secured enormous stores and munitions of war,
                        and put themselves in a position to offer a very formidable resistance to
                        any attempted coercion on the part of the United States. </p>
                    <p>The italicised portions of the above are our own. The poverty of the
                        country--rather amusing that--the poverty of that portion of the country
                        that by its single product of Cotton keeps starvation away from the doors of
                        thousands upon thousands, both in our own and other countries--the failure
                        of which crop would almost bankrupt England, both Old and New. "Lack of
                        credit!" We have reason to know and believe that any amount of money
                        required for the treasury of the Confederate States can and will be, raised
                        by its own people--without their bonds being hawked about the markets of
                        Yankeedom and Europe--as those of the United States have been, and still
                        are. They are, it is true, without commerce now;
                        but how long will it be before the necessities of Europe and the North will
                        furnish her with that item of a nation's prosperity. Of the army and
                        navy--if Mr. Lincoln carries out his "coercion policy," our friend of the
                        Times will be very well satisfied before long that they are making tolerable
                        progress in that line; and he, if he desires ocular proof, may find himself
                        in a position that will require "faster time" than he made on the "Solferino" track to get out of the way of a
                        Southern bullet.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that Lincoln's "peace policy" has been, in our belief, a sham--a
                        miserable lie--from the first, and everything that has emanated from him or
                        his Cabinet a tissue of falsehood and deceit, from the famous inaugural down
                        to the letter of the Hon. Simon Cameron to Maj.
                        McCue, in reference to the removal of the guns from Bellona Arsenal--and for
                        the one sole purpose of defeating any attempt of Virginia to assume her
                        sovereignty. How successful that is to be, a few days must show us--for we
                        do not suppose that the "Grand Council" can prolong its sessions beyond the
                        end of next week. What effect the "warlike movements" of the past week may
                        have upon their deliberations, we know not; but from their past we do not
                        augur much good in the future. The Commissioners appointed a few days since
                        to visit Washington and enquire of Mr. Lincoln his "policy" will, we have no
                        doubt, be very blandly received by that Arch Priest of Abolitionism, Seward,
                        and be as completely hoodwinked by him as the various members of the
                        Convention, who have visited Washington, have heretofore been. They will no
                        doubt call upon "King Abram," who will amuse them prodigiously with "flat
                        boat yarns," and again assure them that "nothing hurts anybody"--"nobody is
                        going wrong"--gracefully bow them out, adding, by way of a parting
                        assurance, the fact that if the "policy" is enquired of when they return to
                        Richmond, they can "tell 'em you don't know!"</p>
                    <p>We pray we may be mistaken, but we do not see a hope--a ray of light--a straw
                        to grasp at-- nothing but war will satisfy the intense hatred that is borne
                        at the North to the institutions of the South--nothing can satisfy their
                        hatred but the shedding of "their brother's blood." It is too late now to
                        talk of "Compromise," "Conference," or "Commission." The golden hour, when
                        all this train of horrors could have been avoided has been lost, by the
                        miserable submission policy that rules in the Convention at Richmond. If
                        Virginia, or rather that Convention, had have fearlessly told the
                        Administration--"you shall not make war upon our sister States--you shall
                        not shed a drop of Southern blood--that moment the match is applied to the
                        first gun to be fired upon the South, that moment Virginia goes out and
                        unites herself with them, to conquer or die"--there never would have sailed
                        the first man from New York against the South. Separated those States would
                        have been, 'tis true, (for nothing will ever bring them back,) but the
                        country would be saved what is now inevitable--internal war. And at whose
                        hands but those of the Submisssionists of the Virginia Convention, can every
                        drop of blood that is shed in this contest be demanded?</p>

                    <p>The Alternative--North or South.</p>
                    <p>A dissolution of the Union on the slave line, it is contended, would destroy
                        the institution in Virginia. We do not think so. But admit it did. In that
                        case, the slaves would be gradually removed South, and the change would not
                        so seriously affect the private fortunes of individuals, or the general
                        prosperity of the State.</p>
                    <p>Suppose, however, Virginia should become a Border State of the Northern
                        Confederacy. How then? Could we hope abolitionism would be more considerate
                        of our interests? Assuredly not. Fanaticism never relents. Then what would
                        be our condition? With six hundred thousand Negroes amongst us, denied all
                        outlet, and rendered worthless and uncontrollable, a nuisance and a pest,
                        not only their whole value as property would be annihilated, but Virginia
                        herself, ere long, would cease to be a house for the decent, industrious
                        white man. Her lands and houses would rapidly depreciate, a degraded race of
                        negroes and mixed bloods would huddle into the deserted homes of her people,
                        and a desolation and ruin spread out around them, like that which, under
                        British emancipation, has blasted the most fruitless isles of the Indies.</p>
                    <p>What son of Virginia can hesitate as to his duty, when such a choice is
                        presented to him? Nay, is it not an insult to our manhood to speak of it as
                        a choice? War is an evil, but not the worst. Life itself has limits to its
                        value. And he must be a dastard indeed who will not defend his friends and
                        his home.</p>

                    <p>High Water.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the recent heavy rains, the various streams in this county have been
                        very much swollen, and some of our farmers have sustained considerable
                        damage in consequence. A correspondent, living near West View, writes as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--I hasten to drop you a line to give
                        you the true details of our destructive flood of this week. Middle River was
                        higher than it was ever known to be by the "oldest inhabitant--it was 3 1/2
                        feet above high water mark. Our damages cannot be ascertained at this time.
                        I have lost considerable fence, and it did me much damage in and about my
                        foundry. Most of the farmers have lost all their low-ground fence--some say
                        they have lost 10,000 rails.--Mr. O.C. Morris has suffered much. His dam, in
                        part, is gone, and much fence.--Mr. Geo. Cook lost a fine Spring House,
                        which went about a mile before it fell to pieces. I hope you have full
                        information of the damage lower down the river, which I fear is
                        considerable.</p>
                    <p>Yours, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>P.O.P.</p>

                    <p>The Concert on Thursday Night.</p>
                    <p>The Concert of the Staunton Musical Association, on Thursday night last, was,
                        as usual, attended by a large and fashionable audience of ladies and
                        gentlemen. All the performers acquitted themselves admirably, and the
                        Concert was in every respect a decided success. We have always regarded
                        these Concerts as among the most entertaining ever given in Staunton, and
                        are glad to see that they are so well appreciated by our citizens. An
                        additional attraction in this Concert was Prof. J.E. D'Alfonce, of
                        Charlottesville, who had kindly volunteered his services for the occasion.
                        He is a singer of remarkable power, and sang several pieces, including the
                        celebrated "Marseilles Hymn," with great effect, and was rapturously
                        applauded and encored.</p>
