                <excerpt>"Be brave men, we implore you, worthy of the character of our glorious old
                    county, fit brothers of those who have already left their homes, and wives, and
                    children, and business, to defend the State--to sustain our cause--to establish
                    independence from the mercenary hordes--the bands of armed robbers--the terrible
                    fiends who deny the existence of God--the virtue of woman, and ignore the great
                    right of self government--the principles fought for, and obtained by our
                    revolutionary ancestors."</excerpt>

                <summary>The Vindicator does not know what is happening in the war, but it is sure
                    that "Something grand in war is on the tapis." Confederate leaders are
                    concealing current events both from the soldiers and the civilians.
                    Nevertheless, the paper has great confidence in their leaders' plans.</summary>

                <summary>Another volunteer company was recently organized and elected the men listed
                    above as officers. It numbers sixty men, but the members hope to increase it to
                    one hundred. Professor J. Hotchkiss is also in the process of raising another
                    company that will go into service after the harvest. It will be composed largely
                    of farm boys who cannot leave until after the crops have been gathered.</summary>
