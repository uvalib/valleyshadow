                    <p>A Patriotic Letter.</p>
                    <p>Robertville, Branfort District, S.C.</p>
                    <p>February 25th, 1861</p>
                    <p>My Dear Cousin: The reception of this letter will
                        be so unexpected that it will astound you--but really I cannot help writing.
                        I have for some time intended it, and now hasten to carry out my intentions.
                        The great agitation of our once glorious Union fills the heart of every
                        lover of liberty with gloom and dismay on the one hand, and determination
                        and sacrifice, if needed, to retain that principle which inhabits every
                        Southern heart--independence--on the other. O, could we, my Cousin, for one
                        moment crouch to Yankee tyranny? No, never!
                        never! I for one, woman as I am, would willingly spend my last
                        breath, if need be, in behalf of the Southern Confederacy. I have three
                        sons, whom God knows I would bid farewell and cheer them on to the field of
                        battle, should their services be required; I [line illegible] A mother
                        cannot help that tenderness of feeling with which God has endowed her. I
                        know my heart would fill to overflowing--still I should commit them to Him
                        alone who rules our destines, and trust to the final result.</p>
                    <p>What is my own native Virginia about? Why has she acted so tardily and shown
                        such a lack of independence? I feel particular concern in her welfare, for
                        within her borders are nearly all of my relations. Can there be one of them
                        who intends to submit to Black Republican rule? I cannot, will not believe
                        it, until I hear it direct from some one of you, for in my veins still runs
                        that blood which has always been opposed to imposition and insult. Both of
                        these we have been receiving from the Yankees for the last 35 years. I am
                        surprised that Virginia should be so slow to act when she has been most
                        injured and insulted.</p>
                    <p>I have read all the papers I have been able to get my hands on, but have seen
                        nothing said of my brother, except that he has been detained at home on
                        account of sickness. How does he stand in the midst of this momentous
                        crisis? How do you all (I mean my relations) stand? Are you in favor of your
                        independence, even if gained at the mouth of the cannon or the point of the
                        sword? Come South, if you want to see noble spirits, not only in men and women, but in
                            every child who reads and knows his
                    rights.</p>

<b>This District</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator argues that the key issue in the next Congressional election
                    is whether the destiny of Virginia lies with the hostile North or the "sister

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This District.</p>
                    <p>We anticipated that the lines of party, as heretofore existing, would be
                        drawn in the approaching Congressional canvass, not only in this District,
                        but the State, and hence we were in favor of a Convention of the Democratic
                        party to nominate a candidate who would represent the principles of its
                        organization, and the true interests of Virginia in this important crisis.
                        The course of the present incumbent and the positions he has assumed,
                        however, render it unnecessary and inadvisable to adhere to our original
                        purpose of a Convention. The line of policy to be adopted is so very plain
                        that he who runs may read. The question that looms up above all others and
                        claims the paramount consideration of the people of the State, is, whether
                        the destiny of Virginia shall be cast in future with the hostile section of
                        the North, or, breaking asunder from her oppressors and enemies, plant
                        herself firmly and eternally upon a basis of congenial fraternization with
                        her sister States of the South, with whom she is linked by every tie of
                        interest and blood. It is not, therefore, we are candid to admit, a
                        discrimination in favor of any particular person on account of his past
                        political associations, but a patriotic purpose to bury beneath the waves of
                        oblivion party nomenclature, and elevate superior to the behests of placemen
                        the momentous issues involving the honor, the rights and the peace of the
                        country, which press upon the consideration of the people.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harris, having enunciated his purpose, in effect, of unconditional
                        submission to the aggressive and insulting policy of Northern abolitionism,
                        as represented by Mr. Lincoln, and the Staunton Spectator, as the organ of
                        the extreme submissionists, having indicated a purpose to support him, there
                        is but one course for the friends of State Rights and the honor and equality
                        of the South to adopt, and that is to unite upon some one man who represents
                        their views to carry the flag and keep step to the music of the Constitution
                        of our fathers.</p>
                    <p>With partiality for no man in this contest, but an earnest and determined
                        purpose to support any one, be he Whig or Democrat, who is true to Virginia
                        and the South, we call upon the friends of State Rights and the enemies of
                        Federal and Black Republican oppression and tyranny, to rally as one man
                        upon a proper person, and raising the banner of our faith to the breeze,
                        march to victory.</p>
                    <p>The question involved is narrowed down to that of North or South. It is
                        paramount to all others, and is the only living issue upon which the people
                        are called to decide. We entertain not the shadow of a doubt as to what will
                        be the judgment of the voters of this District, if left free to give
                        expression at the ballot box to their honest opinions.</p>
                    <p>Who the person to be supported against Mr. Harris shall be is a matter of
                        small moment to us, so he represents the principle of State Rights. In
                        to-day's issue will be found calls upon two gentlemen [Samuel Goode and M.G.
                        Harman]--one a Whig and the other a Democrat--either one of whom we would
                        cordially support. There are many others in the District eminently entitled
                        to the confidence of the people, whom it would afford us pleasure to
                        co-operate with, in vindication and defense of the true interests of
                        Virginia. We defer to other sections to suggest a proper person, promising
                        however that if the partiality of no other county will bring out a
                        candidate, old Augusta will furnish one upon whom all good and true men can
                        rally with enthusiastic ardor and a reasonable assurance of success.</p>
                    <p>We are [illegible] then, to the people of the precinct, in whose hearts still
                        linger a sentiment of devotion to the honor of Virginia, to indicate their
                        purpose at once, so that we may present an unbroken front to the detestable
                        positions of Mr. Harris and the Staunton Spectator--hostile as they are to
                        Virginia and the South. That paper has taken Mr. Harris under its
                        protection, and represents his views, and it is against such sentiments as
                        it weekly sends forth to the public, and the policy it advocates, that the
                        people must unite. Its positions are only important, as they represent Mr.
                        Harris. Thus far and no farther, for the thick-headed editor never had an
                        idea of his own in his life.</p>

                    <p>The Union and Our Liberties.</p>
                    <p>The idea is entertained by many that the Union is necessary to the
                        preservation of our liberties. In the conflict of the Revolution, when the
                        Colonies were weak, Union, in a common cause, was essential to success. The
                        necessity then, however, by no means makes it an
                        axiom now. Our liberties are dependent upon
                        ourselves. If we have the virtue and the spirit, we will not want the
                        ability to maintain them.</p>
                    <p>In some remarks lately made by Mr. Moore, in the Convention, he intimated the
                        opinion that the experiment of free institutions in the North was nearly run
                        out. If so, (and there is reason to fear it;) separation is our safety. It
                        is impossible that free institutions can survive when the ignorant and
                        vicious masses obtain the preponderance--a point to which they are rapidly

                        of the recruits they were gaining by foreign importation!--Seward, the
                        bastard conservative, with whom some in our midst are willing to affiliate
                        in a new party.</p>
                    <p>We do not doubt that, under the influences of our social system, if we are
                        true to ourselves, Liberty will here find a home long, long after it has
                        perished at the North. Well might Webster exclaim, "Liberty and Union, now
                        and forever, one and inseparable." He spoke as a Northern man. Strike out
                        the South, and the great conservative element, the balance wheel of the
                        Union will be gone--and with it, ere long, the liberties of the North.</p>

                    <p>Destructive Fire.</p>
                    <p>On Friday evening last, the village of Mt. Solon, in this county, was nearly
                        destroyed by fire. We learn that thirteen
                        buildings, including dwellings and stables, were burned. The fire commenced
                        about 12 o'clock M. and burned all evening. The wind was blowing so
                        violently that it was impossible to arrest the progress of the fire. It
                        originated in a box into which ashes had been thrown.--Spectator.</p>

<b>The Right Sentiment</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator directs the attention of the Spectator to a recent article
                    from the Richmond Whig. In it, the Whig argues that Lincoln cannot continue his

                    Virginia and the other border states are only delaying their secession to see if

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Right Sentiment.</p>
                    <p>We commend to the careful and prayerful perusal of our amiable neighbor of
                        the Spectator, the following very pertinent remarks from the Richmond Whig
                        of the 2d instant:</p>
                    <p>But the conclusion to which we would, if possible, direct the attention of
                        the President and his friends is that if it were possible for him to adhere
                        to his do-nothing policy, without coming into collision with the seceded
                        States--so far from accomplishing the restoration of the seceded States, the
                        certain consequence will be the loss of all the remaining slave States.
                        Virginia and her border sisters will not be content with being unmolested
                        themselves, nor with having the Confederate States unmolested. If they have
                        demanded peace and the status quo from the
                        Federal government, it has been only for the purpose of ascertaining whether
                        it is possible to obtain from the North guarantees that will justify their
                        remaining longer in association with that section. And these guarantees must
                        be of a nature that will necessarily disband the Republican party, and
                        prevent hereafter any organization based upon such
                        principles.--Republicanism, which is but another name for Sectionalism, must
                        go down. There is no Southern State that will remain in any Union under the
                        domination of a sectional party foreign at once to its politics and hostile
                        to its institutions. It will not answer the emergency then for the Lincoln
                        Administration merely to do nothing hostile or obnoxious to the South. The
                        Southern people do not desire and will not be content with non action. On
                        the other hand they demand that there shall be action--such action as will
                        place their interests under their own protection--such as will take it out
                        of the power of the North to do them injury.</p>
