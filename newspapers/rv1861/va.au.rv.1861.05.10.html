<b>Apologetic</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator will once again be only two pages long this week because
                    much of the staff is away at Harper's Ferry, while the editor is busy with State
                    army business.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Be Patient</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges readers to remain patient in their quest to discover what policy
                    Virginia will adopt in the present war. The state is resisting aggression, so it
                    will not adopt an aggressive policy toward the North.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Warning</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Warns that it is the duty of every man to prepare for war.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Important Fact</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges readers to realize that every vote cast against the Ordinance of
                    Secession, which will be voted upon on the 4th Thursday in May, is "an
                    invitation to Lincoln to march his army of cut-throats and robbers into and
                    through Virginia!" The paper believes that a negative vote is a treasonous act.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Spirit of the South</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Claims that many residents of the deep South are showing great affection
                    for Virginia and her current plight. Soldiers are pouring into the State to help
                    aid Virginia's defense.<br>

<b>Our Ladies</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The ladies of Staunton are busily making clothing for the local volunteers.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Goths and Vandals</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Vindicator reprints an article from the New York Herald that states
                    that Northern cities are filled with "the most reckless, desperate men on the
                    face of the earth." These men desperately want to conquer and plunder the South.
                    The Herald believes that, as a result of such men, "The character of the coming
                    campaign will be vindictive, fierce, bloody and merciless, beyond parallel in
                    ancient or modern history."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Crops.</p>
                    <p>Having travelled during the past week through Rockingham and Augusta, we are
                        pleased to be able to say that the wheat crop never was more promising. If
                        the ordinary growth is not checked, the supply will be more abundant than
                        has been known for many years. Our people need not, therefore, fear any
                        great increase in the price of flour. There is enough of Flour in Virginia
                        now to answer all demands until after harvest, and the Governor having
                        wisely prohibited its exportation, we would not be surprised, in less than
                        sixty days, to find the price of Flour much lower than at present.</p>
                    <p>Our farmers are now about finishing corn planting, a large quantity of land
                        having been thus appropriated. If we have a good season, and Providence
                        smiles upon us, we will have the substantials of life in abundance.</p>
                <br>

<b>General Orders</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The State Convention has decreed that all Volunteer officers above the rank
                    of Captain will be replaced by new appointments made by the Governor. Major Gen.
                    Kenton Harper has thus been removed and his replacement is Col. T.J. Jackson of
                    the Virginia Military Institute.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Stupendous Lie!</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the N.Y. Commercial Advertiser for its lies. The paper claimed
                    that Richmond residents "placed a Negro astride of the Statue of Washington!!"
                    Another New York paper grossly exaggerated Southern casualties at the
                    bombardment of Fort Sumpter.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Harper's Weekly</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Calls on Southerners to stop purchasing Harper's Weekly because the
                    magazine has called for the conquering of the Confederacy and the freeing of the
                    slaves.<br>

<b>Great Britain and France</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>States that Great Britain and France want the South to part from the North
                    peacefully and without bloodshed. The Dispatch compares this "civilized" desire
                    with the barbarism of the North, which is "not only insisting upon blood, but
                    sending their worst criminals, thieves, cutthroats and murderers, sworn to give
                    no quarter."<br>

<b>The Massachusetts Shoemakers in Virginia</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>G.S. Raymond, former foreman of the Staunton Shoe Company, wrote to the
                    Boston Journal informing them that the paper was mistaken in its report that the
                    Massachusetts shoemakers had been imprisoned in Staunton. Some of the men had
                    not been able to take the train because Gov. Letcher had taken control of the
                    railroad for the military, but the shoemakers were free to go whenever they
                    could. They did receive state protection while they were stuck in Staunton.<br>

<b>Corn and Wheat</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges local farmers not to plant an extensively large corn crop because
                    farmers in the cotton states are devoting much of their land to staple crops.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Corn and Wheat.</p>
                    <p>Some of our contemporaries are exceedingly nervous relative to the corn crop,
                        and advise extensive planting. We are entirely ignorant of the source of
                        their apprehension. The Cotton States, this year, are devoting much of their
                        land heretofore used for Cotton, to raising corn, exportation of all cereals
                        is prohibited from Virginia and to our mind, the prospect is that we shall
                        have more than an abundance of corn and wheat (should the season prove
                        favorable) in Virginia and the South, even should the war continue. Flour,
                        after harvest, cannot be over from $4 to $6, and corn, after October, must
                        be much lower than at present.</p>

<b>Died</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Jane Schreckhise died on May 2 at age 52. She was a member of the Lutheran
                    Church.<br>(Names in announcement: Mrs. Jane Schreckhise,  George Schreckhise)</blockquote>
<b>Sketch of the Proceedings of the Council of the Town of Staunton</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Staunton Town Council passed an ordinance allowing it to issue bills of
                    small denominations.<br>
