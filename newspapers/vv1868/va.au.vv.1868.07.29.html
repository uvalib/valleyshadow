<b>The Last Outrage! The Devil Loose Again</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reacts in outrage to an act of Congress giving governing power to
                    southern state conventions. The editors call it a desperate last grab for power,
                    and "an act giving the trash of the State of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas

<b>Presidential Prospects</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author of this article suggests, with a great deal of confidence, the
                    upcoming presidential election will go to the Democratic Party. Not only
                    Democrats, but also moderate Republicans disgusted with corruption will join
                    forces to defeat the Radical ticket. The article further suggests that Radicals
                    have been plotting to exacerbate divisions among the people or form a third
                    party that would naturally take votes away from Seymour and Blair. Unanimity
                    among the Democrats, however, essentially "guarantees" Democratic victory in
                    1868.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The signs of the times are everywhere favorable to Democratic success. In all
                        parts of the North and West the earnest, passionate resolve of the people to
                        rid themselves of the infamous Radical despotism is becoming more apparent.
                        The press, representing every shade of conservative sentiment, from the
                        moderate Republicans--disgusted with the corruption and fanaticism of his
                        party--to the peace Democrat, speak out with an enthusiasm and unanimity in
                        support of the New York nominations that dispels every vestige of
                        apprehension of defection from the conservative ranks.</p>
                    <p>None know better than the Radicals that nothing but defection from the
                        conservative party could defeat the mighty uprising of the people against
                        radical rule and ruin, and in defense of the Constitution and the liberties
                        of the people. Hence, the bitter denunciation by the Radicals of Seymour and
                        Blair, as Copperheads and Revolutionists--hence, their persistent efforts to
                        persuade the Western Democrats that their favorite statesman had been
                        slaughtered by a "trick" of Wallstreet, and hence their frantic attempts to
                        form a "third party," in the hope of drawing votes from the regular ticket,
                        or throwing the election in the Radical House of Representatives, where
                        Grant's election would be sure. But every attempt to divide and distract the
                        defenders of the Constitution has signally failed, and to-day the Democratic
                        party stands intact, and inspired with an enthusiastic unanimity which makes
                        the election of Seymour and Blair so certain as any future event can be.</p>

<b>Why Not?</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article suggests the political pragmatism of southern whites against
                    the radicals. The emphasis here is on a reach across sectional divides to join
                    hands with Northern Democrats and secure a formidable opposition against the
                    imposition of "thralldom." The lessons of the past--unity--are evoked to protect
                    the future. Thus, the author suggests differences with the North, even the term
                    "conservative" should be pushed aside for the greater good.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The question has been mooted in several of the Southern States why we should
                        not identify ourselves with the Democracy of the North in name as well as in principle. In itself the
                        question seems to be an immaterial one; but, as we see it, the only way to
                        judge of the future is by the past, which clearly shows that unity of action, with out friends in the North and
                        South, alone can redeem us from the thralldom which is sought to be imposed
                        upon us. The only earthly help that we can expect is from the Democratic
                        party--our ends are their ends and theirs ours. They offer their hand in our
                        hour of need, and why should we refuse to co-operate with them to the utmost
                        extent of our ability? We would suggest that the word "Conservative" be
                        dropped, and that until, at least, we are again a free people, we fight our
                        battles under the proud old banner of Democracy. We know of no good reason
                        why this should not be done at once. What say the press of Virginia?</p>

<b>Educational Advantages of Staunton</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This account of the various educational institutions in Staunton works to
                    promote the area's schools as among the best in the South. Each description
                    lists the school's chief administrator and briefly conveys that person's
                    education and/or qualifications. It is important for the author to let his
                    readers know that these administrators are among the most esteemed citizens of
                    the area, and that their roots run deep into Staunton's history in fraternal
                    organizations, churches, and service to the Confederate States. One of the most
                    significant achievements of all these schools, an important point showing the
                    schools' vitality, is that they survived the "vicissitudes of war" and
                    flourished soon after the war's conclusion. Clearly, the author holds Staunton's
                    schools in the highest regard.<br>(Names in announcement: Rev. R. H. Phillips, Rev. J. C. Wheat, Prof. E. Louis Ide, Prof. C. Louis Therry,  M. J. Baldwin,  Joel Ettinger, Rev.

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Almost every traveler who visits our Mountain City has been surprised at the
                        activity and business appearance of Staunton, and we have seen frequent and
                        gratifying allusions in our exchanges to its rapid growth and prosperity.
                        Turn where you will, and you can hear the busy hammer of the mechanic, and
                        the hum of foundries and shops. Idle loungers are seen less frequently here
                        than in any other place of the size of Staunton, and we venture to say,
                        without fear of contradiction, that Staunton stands unrivaled in the amount
                        of trade carried on by its sagacious merchants in proportion to its
                        population. All these, with a delightful climate and fertile lands, have
                        given to Staunton a preponderance over any town in the South.</p>
                    <p>But these are only the effects of the great lever--education. And to the
                        unusual advantages which Staunton presents to the sons and daughters of the
                        South, we refer with pride and satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the allurement of a city life, in a most salubrious climate, in a
                        community known for its correctness of morals and Christian principles; easy
                        of access by rail, she stands, proud and peerless, sending forth the
                        influences of her schools--like the sun its rays--a blessing over our
                        Southern land.</p>
                    <p>The Virginia Institute, Rev. R.H. Phillips, Principal, is perhaps the oldest
                        and most commodious of our schools for young ladies. No school in the South
                        enjoyed a greater confidence or larger patronage before the war than this.
                        The vicissitudes of war closed its doors, however, to the purposes for which
                        it was intended.</p>
                    <p>But nothing could baffle the energy of its Principal, after the close of the
                        strife. In a short time he was "reconstructed" and again "in the field,"
                        with a corps of able assistants, to impart to the mind knowledge and wisdom.</p>
                    <p>The few clouds of doubt that were hanging over its former prestige have been
                        dispelled by its most flattering success, year after year has added to the
                        list of its pupils, until it has become necessary to provide accommodations
                        for the largest number of boarders the buildings will hold. The buildings
                        were especially designed for a young ladies' school; the grounds are
                        ample--embracing four acres--and have been laid out and adorned in a
                        beautiful manner.</p>
                    <p>This is the school of the Diocese of the Episcopal Church of the State. Its
                        corps of instructors is fourteen, embracing some of the best talent in the
                        town. Rev. J.C. Wheat, the Vice-Principle, has been one of the most
                        successful teachers of youth. Prof. E. Louis Ide's musical soirees and
                        exhibitions have been the best it has been the privilege of our citizens to
                        attend. The department of French languages is in the hands of Prof. C. Louis
                        Therry, a native of France and an accomplished scholar. With all these
                        advantages, the success of the Virginia Female Institute is beyond doubt.</p>
                    <p>The Augusta Female Seminary, presided over with great success by Miss M.J.
                        Baldwin, is the school of the Presbyterian Church. The course of instruction
                        in this school is large and comprehensive, and the patronage which it has
                        enjoyed is sufficient evidence that her efforts are appreciated by the
                        public. Struggling under many disadvantages during the war, as most schools
                        were, it has come out with success. To Prof. Joel Ettinger is due the credit
                        of having raised music to the standard which it takes among our schools and
                        is generally admitted that it never was so high in the Augusta Female
                        Seminary as now. The other branches of learning are entrusted to faithful
                        and experienced teachers. We understand that it is contemplated to erect a
                        new hall, on the grounds recently added to the property of this school.</p>
                    <p>The Wesleyan Female Seminary is the school of the Methodist Church. This
                        might be called a new school, for it was raised from almost nothing to the
                        level of prosperity by its present Principle, Rev. Wm. Harris. In the
                        present attitude of affairs, we think it is the duty of every citizen of our
                        State to patronize home institutions, and we doubt not that the Wesleyan
                        Female Seminary will continue to receive the support which it so well
                        deserves, if its merits are know to the good people of the South. Prof.
                        Yancey, a graduate of the University of Virginia, is connected with this
                        school, and Prof. J.H. Hewitt, the well-known musical composer, takes charge
                        of the musical department.</p>
                    <p>The "Kalorama" is strictly a family school. The number of pupils is limited,
                        and for many years it has enjoyed an undiminished patronage. Many are the
                        pupils, in and of Staunton, that still speak with affection and gratitude of
                        the Kalorama. For a "home school," where teacher and pupil come in contact,
                        not only in the recitation room, but at all times, none can compare records
                        with the Kalorama.</p>
                    <p>One of our schools is the Masonic Female Seminary, conducted by the widow of
                        our most esteemed citizen, Gen. W.H. Harman, who lost his life in the battle
                        of Waynesboro. Gen. Harman was Grand Master of all the Masons of Virginia at
                        the time of his death, and the school of Mrs. Harman has thus a particular
                        claim upon the members of the mystic tie. None can doubt the superior
                        qualification of the Principal of this school, and so we hope to see the day
                        when the Masonic Female Seminary shall rank among the largest schools of our
                        country.</p>
                    <p>For the education of boys we mention the fine and flourishing Academy of P.
                        Powers, Esq., situated half a mile from Staunton.--Mr. P. having taught
                        mathematics at Hampton Sidney College and at the University of Virginia, we
                        know of no school where this important branch of a young man's education
                        would have been better attended to than at Mr. Power's school. Those
                        desiring to enter the University cannot do better than spend a few sessions
                        with Mr. Powers.</p>
                    <p>Chas. Young, Esq., has charge of the Old Academy. The number of people were
                        as many as Mr. Young could attend to. Mr. Young proposes to receive a small
                        number of boarders during the coming session, and we can assure parents that
                        their sons will be in able and faithful hands should they trust them to the
                        hands of the Principle.</p>
                    <p>The St. Francis Hall Catholic School has become an institution in our midst.
                        The male department is presided over by Judge Nick Cleary, of Washington,
                        and the female by Miss Collins, of Staunton. The marked improvement in the
                        scholars, is but an earnest of what will be done in the future by the active
                        agency of the Catholics here. We expect to see St. Francis Hall second to no
                        school in the South.</p>
                    <p>With such an array of talent, and such opportunities of education, we ask,
                        where is the place that offers superior educational advantages to
                    Staunton?</p>
