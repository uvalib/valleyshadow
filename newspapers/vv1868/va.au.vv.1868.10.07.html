<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author suggests that the political situation, although seemingly dire,
                    nevertheless offers a ray of hope for white southern people. A letter of the
                    Hon. B.H. Hill illustrates that despite maltreatment of white southerners, they
                    are not without power. Supposedly, this message is making an impact in northern
                    states.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The political contest  which lately enshrouded the friends of Seymour
                        and Blair has been, in a measure, dispelled, and greater confidence now
                        animates the Democratic masses. General Reynolds has issued an order
                        forbidding an election in Texas; and the same policy may be anticipated in
                        Virginia and Mississippi.</p>
                    <p> The last political sensation is a controversy between Hon. B.H. Hill, of
                        Georgia, and Horace Greely. Mr. Hill's letters are having a good effect
                        North and have cleared up matters a little. Mr. Hill closes with the
                        following vigorous, truthful, and spirited paragraph: "Ten millions of white
                        people (Americans)--wearied with repeated offers of Union, exhausted with
                        protestations of good faith and sincerity, voiceless with vain pleadings for
                        peace, hopeless of the redemption of pledges, impoverished with insatiate
                        exactions, sick with fruitless concessions to malignity, distracted because
                        they will not consent to dishonor, despised because they will not be ,
                        oppressed because they will not agree to be ruled by slaves, maligned as
                        rebels because they will not submit to pillage by negroes led on by
                        strangers, and driven by a terrible experience to the final conviction that
                             in themselves alone is their protection--such a
                            people, though deserted by all mankind, are not POWERLESS."</p>
                    <p>The election soon to come off will decide who is to be President. Till then
                        the best judges know nothing, and we can only say watch and wait!.</p>

<b>A Mystery</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This vehement attack on "idle young gentlemen" shows the dismay expressed
                    by laborers against members of the upper class who, according to the author,
                    somehow feel above honest labor. The mechanic who wrote this short and direct
                    article suggests the lazy "gentlemen" should be severely punished.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> How the young gentlemen of our town, who walk
                        about the street and lean against pumps and street corners from morning till
                        night manage to dress so nicely. We are quite sure that their parents are
                        not able to support them in their idleness, as the most of them are
                        compelled to work. These gentlemen, for the most part, look upon honorable
                        labor as something never intended for them, but loaf around stores and
                        offices for the purpose of sponging off of men who work hard in order to
                        keep out of debt, and to contribute something to the support of their aged
                        parents, whose lives have been devoted to their interests. The poor,
                        ignorant, lazy young "gentlemen" who turn up their nose at mechanics as they
                        pass them from a day of hard labor should be arrested and placed in a work
                        house or kicked out of a community which they disgrace by their damnable
                        presence. A Mechanic. </p>

<b>Guard Your Civilization</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article defends the idea of a superior southern civilization. Although
                    speakers in the North, such as the Dr. Sears mentioned here, have suggested that
                    the South wishes to introduce "elevating influences" of northern civilization,
                    the author denies this emphatically. Virginia, he claims, will only adopt
                    northern ways once its citizens become a "fawning race of cowards." This has not
                    happened and, implies the author, never will.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Peculiar dangers threaten the civilization which Virginia received at
                        Jamestown and our fathers have nourished through successive centuries. Our
                        enemies seek to impose new systems upon us, and obliterate the proud
                        landmarks which were our colonial glory.--The inequality of man has been
                        recognized through ages save in New England. We know nothing of man's
                        equality beyond what has been told us in a modern school. Let no one be
                        deceived by such popular clap trap.--God Himself has impressed a distinction
                        in race upon the whole human family. It is idle to assert the contrary.
                        Guard well your portals against the introduction of novelties which will
                        disturb our peace.--Virginians nourish a noble history--a noble blood--a
                        noble civilization! Cling to it with a tenacious grasp. Defend it against
                        intrusion. It was the richest legacy of our fathers--it will prove the most
                        precious inheritance we can transmit to our children.</p>
                    <p> Dr. Sears, General Agent of the Peabody Fund, in a recent speech at Boston,
                        gave those Athenian boosters his impressions of the South as obtained while
                        visiting our section on business connected with his agency. His address
                        taken as a whole, was honest and manly--a pretty fair reflex of Southern
                        sentiment. But he libeled the South when he declared that he discovered
                        amongst us "a desire, which the people scarce dared to
                            whisper, to have introduced the elevating influences of Northern
                        civilization." Observe the words which we have italicized and tell us, dear
                        Mr. Sears, where did you obtain your information? When you were endowed with
                        that divine penetration which grasps an idea before it is uttered? You are
                        greatly mistaken, Mr. Sears. Virginians do not credit the "elevating
                        influences of Northern civilization," and we will have none of it. Powerful
                        as is the sword it can create a new civilization only when the old is in the
                        custody of a cringing, fawning race of cowards, demoralized by defeat and
                        stripped of manhood.--Virginia has not yet reached that point.--brave men
                        still are reckoned among her jewels. While these remain we shall cherish the
                        civilization of our fathers.--Petersburg,
                    Express</p>
