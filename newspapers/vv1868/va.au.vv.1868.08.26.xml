                    <p> People of Augusta, "the great question," the most momentous of the age, will
                        be submitted to you to-morrow! <emph rend="italic">Read, reflect, and act as
                            becomes the descendants</emph> of honored sires!</p>
                    <p>Workingmen, do you want good wages, plenty of work, and a prosperous county?
                        If so, vote for the Chesapeake and Ohio subscription.</p>
                    <p>Small farmers, do you want a double market for your crops and produce? Do you
                        want your land doubled in value? Do you want your children educated and your
                        house made happy? Then vote for the great enterprise--the Chesapeake and
                        Ohio Railroad.</p>
                    <p>The Blue Ridge and Alleghany mountains, those grandly silent sentinels, which
                        for years have kept watch and ward over your county, could they speak, would
                        thunder forth: "For ages untold wealth has been laid hidden, undeveloped, in
                        our bosoms. You need but the coal of Kanawha to make you rich, strong and
                        prosperous. Will the people we have watched over, be so lost to all that is
                        worthy of them, as to reject the only means afforded to accomplish this
                        great object? Be up and doing: live, move and have your being in the great
                        world, as its car of progress speeds along.--Cling not to the selfish ideas
                        of a dead and buried past, but show you are worthy of the priceless
                        treasures bestowed upon you by a bountiful Providence, in voting to pay your
                        part towards completing the grandest enterprise of the 19th century--the
                        great through line from the Atlantic to the Pacific." Rich men, wealthy
                        farmers, if you are so blind to your own interests as to oppose the
                        subscription to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, think, for a moment, of
                        your duties to the honored dead and the "poor ye always have with you." The
                        honest laborer, the mechanic, the artisan, left home, wife, children--all,
                        to brave danger and death for you.--Alas! but few returned--broken down,
                        maimed, tired, footsore and weary. They have nobly faced the work before
                        them--have worked for you and with you, as men never worked before. Now do
                        they ask too much when they say! "Give out of your ample means and small
                        pittance required to complete this great work, which will develop the untold
                        wealth of your county, make labor honorable, diversify it and give us a
                        chance to educate our children, and leave an independence for them when we
                        die!" we think not, and in your hearts you can but feel that your duties are
                        but poorly performed if you resist this earnest appeal. Vote the
                        subscription; be men--liberal, generous hearted men--men worthy of
                        Augusta--worthy of the name "Virginians of the Valley!"</p>
                    <p> "We want the Great Valley Railroad."--Certainly we do, and the only way to
                        get it is to build the Chesapeake and Ohio. The law expressly says the
                        Valley road cannot be built to Salem until the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad
                        is completed. We have every assurance that as soon as Augusta votes the
                        subscription to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio
                        will <emph rend="italic">at once</emph> commence the work from Harrisonburg
                        to Salem. Unless we do so, she has no interest in coming farther than
                        Harrisonburg and never will. These are <emph rend="italic">facts, stern
                            facts!</emph>--Recollect them tomorrow!</p>
                    <p>Some people talk about "waiting until the country is settled before we vote
                        for the Railroad Subscription." They might as well have "waited" before
                        planting crops after the surrender. Bah! "The Gods help those who help
                        themselves." Put your shoulders to the wheel and Democratic "help" North
                        will soon settle matters. Then it is well, and if Grant's elected--what's
                        the difference?</p>
                    <p> Peace and Plenty--a war desolated county built up; a divided Commonwealth
                        reunited; a populous, thriving, brave people, educated to know the <emph
                            rend="italic">right</emph> and strong enough to maintain it!--all these
                        blessings will flow from the completion of the grand through line--the
                        Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Augusta it depends on you to heap these
                        blessings on our beloved Virginia! Do your duty fearlessly, and vote the
                        paltry subscription!</p>

                <summary>This article is a last attempt to inform voters of the benefits of the
                    Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Subscription. The author argues that a vote for the
                    subscription, which will take place the following day, will bring prosperity to
                    the county in the form of more work, and an increased value in crops and
                    produce. In turn, increased wealth will benefit education and overall happiness.
                    The railroad is an imperative in a county desolated by war--many "blessings will
                    flow" from its completion. The anxiety expressed in this article suggests that
                    this vote is among the most important in a long while. It will bring prestige
                    back to a war-torn region.</summary>

                    <p> Staunton has the honor to-day of holding among its many distinguished
                        visitors, General Geo. E. <sic>Picket,</sic> he of the "forlorn hope" on the
                        bloody field of Gettysburg. As we gaze on the placid countenance of this
                        iron-carved man, our thoughts revert to his <sic>unparalelled</sic>
                        charge--an event which will chronicle southern bravery and devotion in song
                        and in story so long as historians and poets shall live. We weep, alas! o'er
                        the memory of the brave boys who died for us--and who, when the stern
                        arbiter of Fate decided against us--having done their duty, "leave the rest
                        to God." May our heroic general live to a great old age, long to wear the
                        laurels he earned so well at Gettysburg.</p>

                    "arbiter of Fate" decided against the Confederate attack, Pickett remains
                    regarded in the highest esteem to the citizens of Staunton.</summary>
