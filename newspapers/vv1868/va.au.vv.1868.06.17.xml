                    <p>The Coronach</p>
                    <p> He is gone on the mountain, <lb/> He is last to the forest, <lb/>Like a
                        summer-dried fountain, <lb/>When our need was the sorest. <lb/>The font,
                        reappearing, <lb/>From the rain-drops may borrow, <lb/>But to us comes no
                        cheering, <lb/>To Duncan no morrow! <lb/> The hand of the reaper <lb/>Takes
                        the ears that are hoary, <lb/>But the voice of the weeper <lb/>Wails manhood
                        in glory. <lb/>The autumn winds rumbling, <lb/>Waft the leaves that are
                        searest,<lb/>But our flower was in flushing <lb/>When blight was nearest.
                        <lb/>Fleet foot on the corral <lb/>Sage counsel in cumber,<lb/>Red hand is
                        the foray, <lb/>How sound is thy slumber! <lb/>Like the dew on the mountain,
                        <lb/>Like the foam on the river, <lb/>Like the bubble on the fountain
                        <lb/>Thou art gone, and forever.</p>
                    <p>Last Saturday the people of Augusta paid fitting tribute to the "loved and
                        lost." The programme, published in the Valley Virginian of last week, was
                        generally carried out. We cannot think of a more appropriate heading to this
                        article than the "Coronach"--the Scottish wail for the dead. We think it
                        will strike the key-note of every true Southern heart, which pulsated to the
                        music of the past last Saturday.</p>
                    <p>The procession was the largest that ever honored the streets of Staunton.
                        Early in the morning the people--the women, children and the old and young
                        men commenced coming into the town. Their hands were full of flowers and
                        their hearts were full of love. At 9 1/2 o'clock all who could get in the
                        spacious Methodist church listened to an earnest address from Rev. F.H.
                        Bowman. A higher compliment could not be paid to it than that of a lady
                        manager, who pronounced it "the finest ever delivered upon such an
                        occasion." Maj. Lacy made some striking remarks after Mr. Bowman. After
                        which the procession was formed by Chief Marshall Baldwin and his aide--the
                        Stonewall Band heading it. From the top of Cemetery hill, along down the
                        winding paths, down Main street to the church, the line of flowers extended.
                        The Augusta Fire Co., and D.D. &amp;B., in full uniform, added no little
                        to the interest of the occasion, by their soldierly and gentlemanly conduct.
                        The scholars of St. Francis Catholic school, under the charge of Col. Nick
                        Cleary, numbering 52 boys and 25 girls, with their banner draped in
                        mourning, were the most conspicuous part of the procession. The Colonel had
                        his "battalion" in complete order and the conduct of his charge did honor to
                        him, the Cause and the Church.</p>
                    <p>After the decoration the procession was reformed at the gate of the Cemetery.
                        Col. M.G. Harman made a sensible and practical speech. He spoke freely of
                        the neglected condition of our Cemetery. Said it was a disgrace to our
                        county and State. He offered to head a subscription by $100 for the Cemetery
                        and $100 for a fund to the support of widows and orphans of the gallant
                        dead. Col. Baldwin was called on and expressed his willingness to contribute
                        to the extent of his means. He thought every one should go down and that
                        Mrs. Robert Cowan, (that true Sister of Charity, the Mother in Israel to
                        Confederate soldiers) should take the matter in hand and so the work, as she
                        always did everything for our loved dead and maimed living.</p>
                    <p>The common machine "writing up" of the incidents of such an occasion is
                        simple work to a newspaper man, but when the heart is full of memories of
                        the past; when the dearest, the bravest, the most loved and honored of all
                        that is dear to us, lie seemingly uncared for; when every family is in
                        mourning--when we think of all that has been done and how little
                        accomplished; the ready pencil refuses to move obedient to our will and we
                        can only say, with Albert Pike;</p>
                    <p> "Conquered, we are not degraded, <lb/>Southern laurels have not faded, <lb/>
                        Mourn, but not in shame for Dixie! <lb/>Deck your heroes graves with
                        garlands, <lb/>'Till the echo comes from far lands <lb/>'Honor to the dead
                        of Dixie!'" </p>

                <summary>While this article begins as an account of the Memorial Day proceedings of
                    the previous week, the principle purpose of the author is to motivate the
                    citizens of Staunton to properly care for the city's cemetery. The speakers
                    cited are concerned about how the cemetery has fallen into disrepair despite the
                    great number of Confederate soldiers buried there. The article includes two
                    sentimental poems honoring the dead.</summary>

                    <p>This is the word used by every scalawag and dog in the South. "Forget" what?
                        "Forget" that you honestly went into the war for Southern
                        Independence!--"Forget" that you carry in every fibre of your body an ache
                        or a pain for every weary mile and every hour of exposure! "Forget" the
                        glorious memories of LEE and JACKSON! "Forget" that you were a man and turn
                        dog--tell a lie and take the "test oath." Forgiveness is a Christian virtue
                        and "Vengeance is mine saith the Lord." <emph rend="italic">We</emph> may

                <summary>This article briefly summarizes the sentiments of the "unreconstructed,"
                    emphasizing the word "forget" to underscore the fact that those who do so are in
                    essence traitors to the southern bid for independence as well as the memory of
                    the most famous Confederate leaders. A short poem reiterates the author's

                        whites settle this question. It is for you to hold on to what you have--your
                        freedom and rights under the law. That you have, and may lose by mixing up
                        in politics. During the war the white people of the South had you; they
                        could have forced you into the army and made "breastworks" of you, as the
                        Yankees did.--They did not do so, but let their sons bare their breasts to
                        the storm, alone and unprotected. They simply ask you now, as they did then,
                        to say and act "hands off" and we tell you, in all earnestness, your fate
                        depends upon your doing.</p>

                    the polls. The author recounts wartime "protection" of bondsmen as a way to show
                    how white southerners have blacks' best interest in mind, and that Yankees
                    simply used them as "breastworks." The implication here is that whites will look
                    after the interests of black citizens if, and only if, they refrain from voting.</summary>

                <head>The Correspondent of the Richmond Enquirer on Staunton</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Your correspondent was kindly received and most hospitably entertained by Mr.
                        Robt. Burke, former doorkeeper of the House of Delegates, and now one of the
                        largest merchants in this thriving place. In the evening, after teas, I
                        visited Maj. Jed Hotchkiss, whose name and fame are familiar to your
                        readers, and spent several hours pleasantly in looking over his publications
                        (particularly the truly valuable contributions to the history of war, which
                        relates and illustrates by perfect maps the transactions of each of the
                        memorable days of Chancellorsville) and his cabinet of minerals--a
                        collection well worth studying, since it discloses at a glance the great
                        mineral worth of Virginia. Cabinets of minerals ought to be found in every
                        cultivated gentleman's house. In fact, however, there are not a dozen in the
                        whole State. The result, is, that while our men have a smattering of dead
                        languages, the earth around them, which is alive, in a sense they never
                        dream of, and instinct with marvelous and beautiful meanings, is (for them
                        at least) "without form and void" almost as when the creative fiat went
                        forth. I have long been satisfied that man must, for knowledge, and the
                        happiness which comes of knowledge, in contradistinction to speculation, go
                        to the source from which he derives his life--the dust of the earth. In
                        stronger terms, the study, close and profound, of God's footstool is the key
                        to the right comprehending of God's throne.</p>
                    <p> "That was not first which is spiritual, but that which is <emph
                            rend="italic">natural;</emph> and <emph rend="italic">afterward</emph>
                        that which is spiritual.</p>
                    <p>I do not disparage the scriptures, but I do, if forced to it, disparage the
                        excess of classics and belle letters, according to the monkish system of
                        instructions, which has had its full day, and I do contend that nature is
                        revelation. About that there can be no dispute.</p>
                    <p>Pardon my little sermon. Hotchkiss is a marvel of information and of energy,
                        a positive gain to Staunton and to the whole State. He could not have
                        selected a fitter place to reside in, for here energy is the characteristic
                        of the people and the quality most prized--perhaps too much prized, for Mr.
                        Bledsoe, I hear, complains that he has not in Staunton a single subscriber
                        to his able quarterly, and General D.H. Hill found it necessary, by
                        statistics of the relative sales here of Yankee and Southern publications,
                        to rouse the people up to their sense of the duty in sustaining their own
                        literature. That done, he succeeded very well. Since the war, more than two
                        hundred houses have been built here, and fifty or sixty others will be built
                        this year. Mr. B.T. Bagby, the great contractor, has his hands full of
                        public and private contracts. The town is to be newly paved, the court-house
                        is being repaired, large woolen, cotton and flouring manufactories are to be
                        greeted this summer, thirty thousand dollars have been raised to adorn and
                        improve the county fair grounds, a movement is on foot for the establishment
                        of a free school, and turn which side you will the evidences of individual
                        and corporate thrift and energy meet you. Of the four female schools, Mr.
                        Pike Power's male academy, the public institution for the insane, the blind
                        and the deaf mutes, the eminent men who make this their home, the two
                        excellent hotels and the three flourishing newspapers, it is scarcely
                        necessary for me to speak. The healthfulness of the place, the attraction of
                        its society, and the prosperity which rewards industry, have made Staunton a
                        rallying point for Eastern Virginians, for Northerners and for Southerners.
                        One is surprised at the number of Virginians, who have come here from
                        Fredericksburg, Richmond, Halifax, the Eastern Shore and other points, and
                        the whole--souled autochthones will not, I trust, object if I claim these
                        Eastern folk impart an additional charm to their society. More Southerners
                        than Yankees have settled here, and that, to say the least, is not a bad
                        thing. Of the beauty of the ladies I cannot speak decisively, having seen
                        but few of them on the street, but as I ascended Gallow's hill yesterday
                        evening, I passed one dressed in black who, from the brief glance I allowed
                        myself, seemed equal to any in Virginia, and that is saying as much as well
                        can be said for any lady. Just here, I must not forget to mention among the
                        recent accessions to the society of the place, the daughters of two of the
                        prominent of Richmond, one the wife of an artist full of promise, and the
                        other an accomplished teacher of music. And before I quit the subject of
                        Augusta enterprise I must allude to the extensive foundries and iron works
                        of Mr. W.A. Burke, and Messrs. Parkins, Nelson &amp; Co., establishments
                        where all manner of work is done, and which would do credit to large cities.</p>
                    <p>The gentlemen connected with the three newspapers here received me very
                        cordially for my own sake and that of the Metropolitan paper which I
                        represent, showing me every civility and kindness in their power, and I take
                        pleasure in making this acknowledgement of their courtesy. BOLIVAR</p>

                <summary>A Richmond newspaper correspondent, after visiting Staunton, describes the
                    several attributes of the city. Including, after a brief "sermon" on the mineral
                    worth of Virginia, are accolades heaped upon Staunton's industry, civic growth,
                    educational institutions, and women. He points out that the city is a principle
                    area of settlement for people from all areas, including the North. (He does note
                    that he is happy more southerners than Yankees live in the city). Equally
                    important, the author thanks the many Staunton citizens he has met for their
                    hospitality.</summary>
