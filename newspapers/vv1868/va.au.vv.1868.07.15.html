<b>National Democratic Ticket</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

                    Frank P. Blair for vice president on its column-head.<br>

<b>"Reunion-Peace."</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article sings the praises of sectional reunion and peace. Most
                    importantly, the author calls to Northerners to renew the spirit of the pledge
                    made at Appomattox. The election of Grant and the Radical party would render the
                    federal government one supported by hate and fanaticism. The article suggests
                    that Southerners mourn their dead, revel in the glories of the past, and at the
                    same time, renew sectional ties with political allies that will work to defeat
                    the radicals.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>From the top of our office, as well as the masthead of our paper, we hoist
                        to-day this flag, bearing the names of the nominees of the National
                        Democratic Convention--SEYMOUR and BLAIR. The detailed account of the
                        proceedings of that mighty outpouring of the gallant representatives of the
                        people--(of a people tired, sick, and weary of the diabolical oppressions of
                        Radicalism) are too long, though deeply interesting, for our limited space.
                        The Platform will be found in another column and speaks for itself. The
                        Soldiers' and Sailors' Convention, composed of representative men, who
                        really fought for the Union and the Constitution as they understood it, and
                        the action of such Confederates as Generals Forrest, Hampton, and a host of
                        others, in return should leave no shadow of doubt on the mind of any true
                        Southern man, no matter what his former political views were, as to where
                        his duty lies. It is, to vote the ticket and accept this proffer of Reunion
                        and Peace, as honestly as it was given.</p>
                    <p>We accept it as the generous voice of the Northern people, rising above
                        prejudice and fanatical hate! We accept it as the renewal of the pledge made
                        at Appomatox, at Greensboro, in the Trans-Mississippi, and basely
                        broken by General Grant and the Radical party. We hail it as an omen of
                        peace, and thank GOD for the words of cheering hope it sends forth!</p>
                    <p>The eminent citizens and soldiers--among them our General Kemper and Colonel
                        Baldwin--who met in that Convention, canvassed the whole question
                        thoroughly, and knew what was best to do to make certain the great
                        end--Reunion and Peace! Let there be no division among the people of the Old
                        Dominion--but let us, as our fathers did, stand as one man for the ticket
                        and party which is to save us and the Right! We are cheered by the action of
                        this great Convention; cheered at the sentiments expressed and the unanimity
                        of feeling exhibited; cheered to see soldiers, who fought each other
                        bravely, shaking hands; cheered to see the "hatchet buried," we hope
                        forever--and we smoke "the calumet of peace" with renewed pleasure as we can
                        think better of our fellow men--better of our race--as we see the "rainbow
                        of promise," to republican Institutions reappear once more.</p>
                    <p>Mourning the heroic dead, who fought for principle--cherishing the memories
                        of the loved and lost sacredly in our hearts--sadly brooding at times, over
                        the glories of the past, we, as Confederates, raise our banner of
                        "Reunion--Peace," and, for the sake of those who are to come after the
                        battered wrecks of this war have "gone to that bourne from whence no
                        traveler returns," we shall re-echo the sentiments of a Forrest and a
                        Hampton until the campaign closes.</p>

<b>Sibert's Steel</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This letter between Sibert and Imboden discusses the recent innovations in
                    the steel making process. Sibert, the inventor of the process by which steel is
                    made directly from iron ore, has developed a way to produce malleable steel on a
                    large scale. He writes that this process will be tested in the near future at
                    the Tredegar Works in Richmond, and he expects complete success. Significantly,
                    Sibert suggests that this new process will elevate Virginia to a high position
                    within the general "progress of civilization."<br>(Names in announcement:  Lorenzo Sibert,  John Imboden)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The following letter, says the Richmond Whig,
                        which was intended only for the gentlemen to who it is addressed, was
                        received in Richmond a few days ago from Mr. Sibert, the discoverer and
                        patentee of the process of making steel directly from iron ore.--The
                        secondary process of reducing the cast steel to malleable steel has not been
                        hitherto tried on any large scale than in a blacksmith's shop. It will be
                        seen that it has now passed the ordeal of the "Forge," and we understand it
                        will this week be put through the Tredegar Rolling Mills in this city, in
                        the manufacture of several tons of rails:</p>
                    <p> Mt. Solon, July 2, 1868, <br> Gen. John D. Imboden, Richmond, Va. </p>
                    <p>My Dear Sir:--I write this morning to inform you that yesterday I went to
                        Mossy Creek Forge and had my ingots wrought into steel bars without any
                        trouble at all. The quality of the steel is good, and what I call a No. 1
                        article. It works well, takes a fine temper, and its complexion is rich and
                        silver-like. The crystallization or molecular cohesion is perfect and
                        tenacious. In the fewest words, it cannot in anywise be surpassed anywhere.</p>
                    <p>I am proud of my success, and hope to be an advantage to my fellow men, poor
                        and rich. What I most desire is to see the sons of Virginia become possessed
                        of the rich bounties of a most beneficial God that have been locked up in
                        the rocky vaults of our mountain chains for ages past.</p>
                    <p>Without any apprehension of contradiction, I can now say to you that we have
                        fought the good fight and won the victory.--The cloud of doubt that hung
                        over our enterprise (that was full of merit) has passed away, and the
                        sunshine of our future prospects is not obscured by a single speck in the
                        horizon, but invites us on and on in the progress of civilization.</p>
                    <p>When I come down I will bring with me some bars of steel that will astonish
                        you. You may now go as far as you think proper in giving publicity to this
                        subject. You can not go too far to be sustained by the facts.</p>
                    <p>I am certain that you know that the sun sets in the West. Just that sure am I
                        that I will make at the Tredegar Works as fine steel rails, at the first
                        trial, as were ever made in Europe or America, and cheaper, too, than
                        General Anderson can make wrought iron rails.</p>
                    <p>My compliments to Messrs. Talcott and friend Whitcomb, and say to them that I
                        have some steel that will astonish the natives.</p>
                    <p> I remain, yours, truly, <br>Lorenzo Sibert. </p>
