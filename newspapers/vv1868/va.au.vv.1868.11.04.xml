                    <p>By Wm. Archer Cooke</p>
                    <p> Our exchanges inform us of a movement <del/> extensive with the area of the
                        late Confederate States, to provide Cemeteries suitable to the Confederate
                        Dead.</p>
                    <p>The very term Confederate dead, has an eloquence which reaches the heart. It
                        does not embrace those who lived, while they lived, on pelf, and died of
                        rottenness in comfortable chambers far away from the roar of artillery and
                        the rattle of musketry, where men laid down and died with the life blood
                        flowing from them. No, the <emph rend="italic">Confederate dead,</emph>
                        means those brave, honest patriots who for country bared their breast to the
                        storms of war; for liberty died under the flag of their native land; or with
                        sickened body and mutilated limb perished in the hospital. These are our
                        Confederate dead, who sealed their love of principle with a death-bed scene
                        that will forever stamp their names on the roll of honor.</p>
                    <p> They are in character<lb/> "Majestic men, whose deeds have dazzled faith."</p>
                    <p> Of each may it be said<lb/> "With his back to the field, and his feet to the
                        foe. And leaving in battle no blood on his name; Look proudly to heaven from
                        the death bed of fame.</p>
                    <p>Bury our Confederate dead in beautiful cemeteries. Let the chisel of the
                        artist, the cunning of the artisan decorate their graves, let the innocent
                        warble of the forest songster be heard in the willow that weeps above the
                        monumental stone. Let woman come with her plastic hand, and pure Christian
                        heart and plant fresh flowers around the last resting place of Liberty's
                        martyrs. Here the sweet young wife may gather at early morn and dewy eve,
                        and, as she mingles her tears of devotion with the dripping of the flower,
                        she can tell her orphan child how a noble father fell. Here the aged matron
                        and feeble sire may totter around the heaving earth that holds the remains
                        of the only stay and prop of their declining years.</p>
                    <p> Does any one ask?<lb/> "Can storied urn or animated bust<lb/> Back to its
                        mansion call the fleeting breath? <lb/> Can honor's voice provoke the silent
                        dust, <lb/> Or flattery soothe the dull, cold ear of death? </p>
                    <p>Alas! no; but the gratitude of a people for a soldier band of such worth and
                        character and honor as "our Confederate dead," should be perpetuated in
                        history, on the canvass, upon the breathing marble. The "cities of the dead"
                        should receive the embellishment of art and cultivation of taste, and, above
                        all, let the rising generation see and feel that though unsuccessful against
                        mighty armies, yet their names are to memory ever dear, and those who are
                        now younger brothers, or little orphan boys may see that brothers and
                        fathers, though sleeping beneath the sod, are still remembered by a grateful
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Nor is it an empty honor, we do justice to our own appreciation of all that
                        is excellent; we erect a shrine where genius and worth may offer their
                        devotion, we open a school where the ardent young mind may cultivate an
                        undying admiration not for the glare of military tinsel, but for high-toned
                        chivalric honor--for unshrinking valor.</p>
                    <p>Embellish these hallowed spots; engrave upon marble and upon granite your
                        gratitude and your appreciation for moral worth; you are reenacting the
                        history of classic Greece and Rome; you are adding another tune to the
                        melody of song--additional fire to the blaze of eloquence, a fresh stream of
                        devotion to the stream of Liberty.</p>

                <summary>This article eulogizes the Confederate dead in typical fashion. The author
                    tries his hand at lyrical language to illustrate the character of the glorious
                    Confederate soldier. Although their efforts ultimately failed, this is no
                    reflection on the soldiers themselves. Cemeteries should be monuments designed
                    to instill in the hearts of future generations the sacrifice these men made for
                    "Liberty."</summary>

                        votes for Grant. We do not like this, neither did we like the surrender of
                        Lee's army and the upturning of the Confederacy, but survived the one and
                        hope we shall the other. We can best make the best of things as they are,

                    <p> In Savannah, Ga. Negroes took possession of the polls this morning and a

                    <p> The following well written article is from the Danville Times: "A great many
                        of our people have not yet realized the fact that they are poor. They live
                        as they used to live, in the days of their prosperity, when they had land
                        and negroes. To save their lives, they can't come down to their
                        circumstances. They spend more than they make. They won't work--there's the
                        rub. They will not work--a great many of them. They are still trying to live
                        upon the sweat of the <sic>negroe's</sic> brow. No matter how a man or a
                        woman were raised, no matter how luxuriously they were brought up, when they
                        have lost their means, it becomes them to come right square down to their
                        circumstances; the husband should quit his cigars and fine wines, and the
                        wife should take off her silks. The habits of the whole household should be
                        changed. It is very <emph rend="italic">hard,</emph> but ought to be done,
                            <emph rend="italic">at once.</emph> It is the greatest folly to be
                        spending what little is left in trying to keep up appearances. To our view,
                        it does not <emph rend="italic">look</emph> well to see a woman or man <emph
                            rend="italic">swelling,</emph> whose debts are unpaid. He appears so
                        much better, living economically and striving, by honest work, to pay his
                        debts and lay up something for his family.</p>
                    <p> Economy and plain living ought to be encouraged, and extravagances
                        discouraged, in the South. It is very hard for individuals to go differently
                        from all their associates, and there is not one in a hundred, who has the
                        moral courage to do it. Therefore, we say, plain living and hard work,
                        should be encouraged, so that the whole community may untie in the same
                        habits. Strange to say, the example frequently has to be set by the <emph
                            rend="italic">rich</emph>--so prone are a great many poor persons to run
                        after and imitate the manner of living of their more wealthy neighbors.</p>
                    <p>The Southern people are the poorest people on the earth, let them realize the
                        fact. Let them take pride in living plainly, and in working to build up
                        again. If they will do this, their children may be of more account than they
                        ever would have been, brought up under the old regime.</p>
                    <p>A white boy now ought not to know what a little negro was made for. He ought
                        to wait on himself of course--bring his own water, clean his own shoes, and
                        wait on his parents, when not at school. The females of the households in
                        this country now, ought to clean up their own rooms, make their own dresses,
                        and study the art of cooking, notwithstanding they have been raised as
                        tenderly as a hot house plant. We know that these are unpalatable truths,
                        and some will object to being told what they ought to do, or to being
                        reminded how poor they are, but nevertheless it ought to be done.</p>
                    <p>Our people must live plainer and work harder, or else the whole country will
                        never prosper.</p>

                <summary>In this article that first appeared in the Danville Times, the author
                    chastises white people who live beyond their means. He argues that it is
                    impossible to live the lifestyles that existed while slavery functioned as the
                    primary source of hard work. Now that slavery no longer exists, and whites who
                    were formerly wealthy now live in poverty, they need to give up extravagant
                    pleasure such as cigars, wines, and silks, and begin to work for themselves at
                    honest labor. This is of utmost importance for it will set an example for future
                    generations as well as benefit the whole country.</summary>

                <summary>The Executive Committee of the Augusta County Fair congratulate the county
                    on the "great success" of its first fair. They state the intention of raising
                    more money to improve the fair grounds, and urge subscribers to find new members
                    and advance payment of their bonds. The corporation intends to borrow more money
                    in anticipation of collections, but state interest payments will be made
                    promptly. They also thank William A. Pratt for his services and hard work.</summary>
