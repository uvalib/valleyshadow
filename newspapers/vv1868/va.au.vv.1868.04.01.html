<b>Our Position Then and Now</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article seeks to dismiss the arguments made between whites of the
                    South regarding "consistency." This argument, suggests the author, is
                    counterproductive. The important issue is to rid Richmond of "negro rule," and
                    defeat the Radical constitution.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A valued friend and subscriber, who agreed with  opposition to the
                        Constitution to be submitted with our advocacy of the call for a Convention
                        which framed it."</p>
                    <p> The answer is simple. We advocated the acceptance of the Convention as a
                            terrible fact, as we did submission to Andy
                        Johnson's plans, considering and knowing both to be unconstitutional and
                        unjust but feeling it was the best we could do, powerless as we were to
                        accept the first radical plan as a finality as we
                        did Johnson's. We were for fighting the devil with his own firewood, i.e.,
                        taking hold of the Reconstruction measures, and using them against the
                        Radicals. We were for electing a Conservative Convention to meet in
                        Richmond, which we would have acted in concert with the Conservatives North,
                            not the hybred [sic] concern, which acts in
                        concert with our enemies there; and we believe it could have been done, if
                        the people had thrown off their indifference and worked. To admit any other proposition is an insult to the
                        intelligence of the white people of Virginia. Just before the election, we
                        saw there was no hope for such action, as the Radicals were fighting our
                        straggling bands with disciplined forces, and we did all we could to defeat
                        the Convention and elect Conservative candidates. We know that there was no
                        premise of the Radicals to be relied upon; that it was a hellish scheme to
                        negroize the South, and we have always opposed the whole work of the mean
                        whites and deluded blacks, at Richmond, because
                        it is infamous; a violation of every pledge made by the North during and
                        since the war, and because we are white. This, we think, is the position of
                        every paper and of every gentleman in the State, who went for accepting the
                        Radical plan, as a finality, until they saw there
                        was nothing final in it, but our absolute
                        subjugation to negro and radical rule. Some imbecile, may whine, "I told you
                        so," about his "coassistency," and say we are changeable, but we are not,
                        for we had rather be "right" than  "consistent," and 
                        "right" we honestly believe we were and are.</p>
                    <p>We hope the explanation is satisfactory, and that our friends will join with
                        us, heart and hand, in defeating the Radical Constitution. It is no time for
                            white men to wrangle over "consistency," or
                        who was right and who was wrong. Old John Randolph once said that the men
                        who bellowed most about "consistency" were either knaves or fools or a
                        combination of both, and we agree with him. Therefore, waste no time on
                        them, but go to work and vote down the Radical Convention; for to discern
                        between the evils that energy can remove and the evils that patience must
                        bear, makes the difference between manliness and childishness - between good
                        sense and folly.</p>

<b>How to Turn the Tables</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article suggests that southerners "quit the political field and employ
                    energies elsewhere." The problem, says the author, is that while southerners
                    dominated the government for years, northerners focused on industry. From this
                    they gained wealth and power and came to dominate the country. The great
                    political duty for southerners now is to focus on material interests.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For sixty years, says the Whig, Southern influence dominated the government.
                        We worked in the field of politics while the Northern people devoted
                        themselves to their industries. They grew rich and strong; and so the power
                        passed from our hands; the scepter departed from Judah, and the law giver
                        from beneath his feet.</p>
                    <p>We want to see the tables turned. The Northern people seem now to be demented
                        on the subject of politics. They have tasted power, and are intoxicated by
                        the draught. Not only the men, but the women and children are politicians.
                        It is time for us to quit the political field and employ our energies
                        elsewhere. We are outnumbered and overmastered, and our only hope of
                        acquiring wealth, influence and power, and measuring strength with them
                        again, is in devoting ourselves to our material industries. This was the
                        source of Northern wealth and power. We died by politics, while they
                        flourished by industry. Let us be warned by our fate and encouraged by their
                        success.</p>
                    <p>We have at present but one great political duty to perform, and that is to do
                        all that we can to rescue ourselves and our posterity from negro rule. Doing
                        that, we should give our time and attention to our material interests, and
                        after a while we shall reassert our sway and hold it by force of numbers as
                        well as of intellect. The secret of empire in these days is force, not moral
                        power or mind. Let us while holding on to those endeavors to accrue
                    that.</p>
