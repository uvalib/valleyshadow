<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This is a call to the (white) men of Virginia to reclaim their prominence
                    in the Union. It seems that all is on the verge of decay. Prosperity, public
                    welfare, honor, etc are all at stake and the only way to prevent an irrevocable
                    loss of these things is to forcibly protect them, even if this requires a call
                    to arms.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We fully agree with the Richmond Dispatch, "that
                        the exigency and peril of Virginia demands that her sons shall come to her
                        defense with all their might and with all their spirit. All that we hold
                        dear--the honor and glory of the State--the peace, order, and dignity of
                        society--the public welfare and general prosperity of the community--are at
                        stake. If for their preservation we cannot give our labor and our means,
                        then are we unworthy of the blessings of freedom and good government. Men of
                        Virginia, to arms! To the rescue of your honored mother, whose renown is
                        unequaled on this continent! Vindicate your rights and your title to
                        predominance in public affairs. To these objects, worthy of the noblest
                        exertions, give your hearts and hands with a devotion equal to the exigency,
                        and you will triumph. You will secure peace and prosperity to yourselves,
                        order and dignity to the State, and restore Virginia to her proud eminence
                        among the States of the Union! Fall in this, and public dishonor, private
                        misfortune, State decay, social humiliation and disgrace, must ensue--and
                        the proud Commonwealth of the Ancient Dominion will decline into
                        insignificance, leaving no trace of her former glory! </p>
