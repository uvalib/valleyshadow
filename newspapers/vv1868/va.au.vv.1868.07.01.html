<b>A Striking View of Reconstruction in Virginia</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>J. Randolph Tucker writes to argue that while he believes all the
                    reconstruction acts are unconstitutional, Congress's actions toward Virginia are
                    especially unlawful. Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court had all
                    recognized the legitimate state government of Virginia at the end of the war,
                    and by including that state in the reconstruction acts, Congress in effect
                    overthrew a sitting state government.<br>

<b>The Situation--Politically and Otherwise</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The "situation" in this article is one of hope. Although radicals have
                    caused numerous problems, hard work and organization on the part of the
                    conservative element--from all sections--is proving effective. Soon,
                    particularly after the upcoming Democratic Convention, conservatives will once
                    again be in power in Virginia, and any "scalawags" will have to make haste away
                    from the South.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The busy hum of the "Reapers," the glad shouts of the harvest bands, as they
                        reap the rewards of labor well performed--the hard earned wages that come
                        only "by the sweat of the brow"--precludes the necessity of long editorials.
                        "The laborer is worthy of his hire," and all classes, South and North are
                        now being paid off by a merciful Providence. Things look brighter than at
                        any time since the war, politically as well as pecuniarily--and the poor,
                        oppressed South begins to see the "silver lining" to the "cloud" of her
                        troubles.</p>
                    <p> There is every indication that no election will be held in Virginia, but we
                        must keep up the good work of Conservative organization. The "scallawags"
                        know they will be defeated at a fair election, as they were in glorious old
                        Mississippi--they know that any Legislature elected would continue the "stay
                        law," which expires in January, 1868, and they want cheap lands in Virginia. Therefore, there will be no election,
                        and the "scallawags" might as well clear out. We will soon be "out of the
                        woods!" restored to the Union, with all our rights as white men, Virginians and freemen!</p>
                    <p>The voice of an outraged and indignant people will be expressed next
                        Saturday, July 4th, by the National Democratic Convention. The old
                        Democratic party, united and all-powerful, aided by all the Conservative
                        elements of the country, can but nominate a candidate representing the great
                        re-action against tyranny and wrong inflicted on the country by the Radical
                        Revolutionists.--Who he may be the Omnipotent alone can know; but we may
                        have faith in the party and the people! Be of good cheer and work, for a
                        better day is coming, ye Southern people! There are voices in the air; there
                        are undefined feelings in our heart; there is a "heart-boat" in every
                        pulsation, which speaks to us sand says--"Victory is ours! the right must conquer!"</p>
