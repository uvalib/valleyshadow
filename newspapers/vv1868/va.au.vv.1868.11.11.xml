                <head>Northern Men in Virginia</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>A correspondent of the Baltimore Statesman writing from the Halifax C.H.
                        says:</p>
                    <p>I am grieved at the misrepresentation of the people of Virginia, in which the
                        Northern press persists. Their repeated charges that Northern men are
                        denounced, indiscriminately, as "carpetbaggers," and treated with insult and
                        indignity, are cruelly false. I have lived for seventy years in this county,
                        which probably was most affected by the events of the war, because of the
                        large slave population; I am familiar with the sentiments and feeling of its
                        population, and I know, form observation and correspondence, that they
                        fairly represent the sentiments and feelings of the whole State.</p>
                    <p>It may be of doubtful utility to repeat what has already been so often
                        stated, but it may be of possible benefit to explain the precise attitude in
                        which Northern men stand with reference to our citizens. The honest
                        immigrant--the real settler, the tradesman, or mechanic--who comes from the
                        North and seeks to establish a permanent home in Virginia, not only has
                        nothing to apprehend in the way of personal annoyance or injury, but is
                        sincerely welcomed as a desirable addition to our population. His political
                        opinions do not affect the estimate which his new neighbors form of him;
                        that depends entirely upon his personal character and conduct, and the
                        testimony, on this point, of men from every part of the North, is abundant
                        and conclusive. I might mention two well-known names to which I am willing
                        to refer, and by whose evidence I am ready to abide. I mean the Rev. Dr.
                        Sears, at Staunton, and General Mulford, at Richmond. But that class who are
                        designated as carpetbaggers stand in a very different relation to us. they
                        come among our people to obtain office, and to profit by our disorganized
                        society. They bring no character with them, and have left no good reputation
                        behind. They are mere adventurers, impecunious, irresponsible and grasping;
                        they stir up sedition and strife, and they debauch the minds of the ignorant
                        negroes, deluding, deceiving and plundering them. In many instances,
                        outcasts from Northern society; in others, escaped or pardoned felons, they
                        form a ready alliance with all that is bad in our midst; they are without
                        sympathy with black or white, without stake in the community, without
                        interest in property, and yet they aim, and too often succeed, in filling
                        official positions and exercising a relentless and irresponsible authority
                        over us. It would be strange indeed if every emotion of our natures did not
                        revolt at the presence of such men. No Northern society would endure them,
                        and yet when we revolt against these calumniators of our oldest and best
                        citizens; these slanderers of our purest womanhood; these perverters of the
                        real feelings and purposes of our people, we are blamed by the very class at
                        the North who would deem themselves contaminated by their touch. It is
                        strange that we complain of the recognition which some men obtain from
                        authority, and the readiness with which their falsehoods are received with
                        pretended belief, and made the pretext for new oppressions? We are willing
                        to accept the consequences of the war in every true and honest sense; but
                        the presence and the power of this class of men present the most depressing
                        illustration of our humiliation; the most hateful reminder of our
                        helplessness and degradation. I trust that the North will take the trouble
                        to understand our real feelings and notions. Let them believe Mr. Adams, Dr.
                        Sears and others, who bear true testimony to both. Let them not do the
                        grievous injustice to themselves, to their own motives, to their own
                        civilization, which will be involved in the demand that we shall include
                        among the inevitable results of conquest, willing acceptance--as part of our
                        social and political system--of an element which no organized society would
                        endure for a day.</p>
                    <p>I may be uselessly consuming the space this hurried communication will take
                        in your columns, but I feel impressed with the duty of declaring how
                        willingly our people will welcome honest and true settlers from the North;
                        how cheerfully we will labor with them in working out whatever prosperity
                        the future may have in store for our poor old State.</p>

                <summary>In opposition to widespread accusations leveled by the northern press,
                    suggesting that a bitter South treats all northern men as carpetbaggers, this
                    anonymous author suggests exactly the opposite. Rather, the southern citizenry
                    shuns only unscrupulous "grasping" men, and welcomes honest, hard working
                    settlers from the North. These men should not fear harsh treatment, but expect
                    to share in the future prosperity of Virginia that immigration will help to
                    foster.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p> "G," the correspondent of the Richmond <emph rend="italic">Whig,</emph> has
                        been at his old tricks, making personal sketches of the leading members of
                        the Norfolk Convention, a few of which we give. He says: "To the left of me,
                        and about midway the dress circle, sits, with the air of one who was born to
                        be seen and heard, Alexander H.H. Stuart of Augusta. I do not know how it is
                        with others, but for myself, I have never been able to conceive of his
                        presence in a deliberative body so august that his individuality could be
                        entirely lost or his <emph rend="italic">personnel</emph> fail to excite
                        favorable comment. But who is the goodlooking man near him who deports
                        himself to his seat as if he were accustomed to go to church, and had
                        acquired the habit of listening. My neighbor reporters do not know, never
                        having seen him before in a convention. To the left of Mr. Stuart is seated
                        his fellow-townsman, William H. Tams, cashier of the Virginia Insurance
                        Company at Staunton. His bearing is thoughtful, and at a glance you see that
                        the commercial column is the first portion of a newspaper he reads, and that
                        upon the subject of direct trade and finance he has clear and well defined
                        ideas, and yet he will never appear in the daily convention reports, I
                        venture to predict, because he will remain silent and listen, in many
                        instances, to talking men with not a tithe of his, information in regard to
                        the great and all-important questions before the Convention. I turn my head
                        and there in the parquette, in front, but some distance from the chair, is
                        John B. Baldwin, whose face and head show that he is massive in intellect,
                        but hardly indicate, as in the case of Mr. Stuart, the full measure of his
                        great ability.</p>
                    <p> Major J.C. Covell, Superintendent of the State Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb and
                        Blind, attracts me, and I skip a half dozen politicians or more to sketch
                        him. He does not seem to be thinking of direct trade, as I commence, but,
                        like your correspondent, is examining only more critically the <emph
                            rend="italic">personnel</emph> of members. He would, it seems to me,
                        make a great detective, and will, if he lives long enough, connect his name
                        with some highly important invention.</p>
                    <p> What a familiar group, and one composed of Virginians who have figured
                        conspicuously and influentially in the Legislature and in public assemblies
                        of the State, have we in Bolivar Christian and J.H. Skinner, of Augusta;
                        William E. Ward, of Botetourt; N.K. Trout, of Staunton; R.W. Hughes, of
                        Abingdon; Colonel Edmund Fontaine, of Hanover, and others like him, who are,
                        heart and soul, devoted to the advancement and development of the great
                        commercial, manufacturing, agricultural and mechanical interests of
                        Virginia. For a military picture, my canvass is too contracted to allow me
                        even in miniature to sketch any below the rank of brigadier, and I therefore
                        confine myself to Generals Ruggles, Echols, James Walker, Robert Preston,
                        Imboden, Terry and Maney, (of Tennessee), neither of whom looks warlike, and
                        all of whom seem eager to enlist, without bounty or choice of the branches
                        of service, in the ranks of the cohorts now being marshaled to battle for
                        the commercial independence of the States. May the same gallantry and
                        indomitable perseverance, but far better success, attend them than their
                        efforts for the political <sic>disenthralment</sic> of the South.</p>
                    <p>Samuel McDowell Moore occupies a retired seat in the parquette, and is the
                        sole representative from Rockbridge. He was in the great Convention of 1829,
                        but has still fire in his eye, and Virginia fire in his heart, too. No
                        member is more cordially welcomed to the body. The question, Where is
                        Flournoy?--is he coming?--was answered by the arrival awhile ago of the
                        eloquent gentleman himself. He looks as hale in person as he is vigorous in
                        intellect and indomitable in will.</p>

                        subsidence of interests in the Presidential contest will come to us in
                        Virginia a struggle far more momentous than that in which the party leaders
                        of this State elected to take no part. The constitution recently adopted at
                        Richmond will doubtless shortly be passed to a vote. Had the conservatives
                        of Virginia organized for the Presidential campaign, even though their votes
                        were not counted, yet they would now have had a compact and disciplined
                        political organization with which to meet the well organized "Loyal Leagues"
                        whose strength is about to be put forth in support of the proposed
                        constitution. It is, however, not yet too late to organize. Better late than

                <summary>The author informs his readers that the lack of interest in the
                    presidential election resulted in serious consequences for the conservatives of
                    the state. This was also due, in his estimation, to the lack of political
                    organization. The upcoming vote on the recently adopted state constitution will
                    require both greater interest and organization.</summary>

                    <p>On last Wednesday night a large and enthusiastic meeting of our citizens took
                        place at the Court House. The question of subscribing $100,000 to the stock
                        of the Valley Railroad was ably discussed. His Honor, Mayor Trout presided
                        and J.B. Evans was Secretary. Addresses were delivered by Judge Sheffey,
                        Col. M.G. Harman, Dr. C.R. Harris, and Majors J.B. Watts and Jed Hotchkiss.
                        A committee of influential citizens was appointed to canvas Staunton in
                        favor of the 100,000 subscription.</p>
