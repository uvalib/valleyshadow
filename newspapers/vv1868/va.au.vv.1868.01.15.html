<b>A few Reasons</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article, directed at the poor white citizens of Virginia, warns of the
                    dangers of the new "Mongrel Constitution." Specifically, the author argues that
                    universal manhood suffrage, an important component of the new constitution,
                    would transcend any equalization of the races based on voting rights alone.
                    Rather, suffrage would pave the way for race leveling in other areas, such as
                    legislative and judicial. There would be further consequences when free schools
                    opened their doors to both black and white. The best way for poor whites to
                    maintain the distinction between races is to not support the new constitution.
                    The Radical party, the article maintains, is creating a constitution that will
                    inevitably lead to race mixing.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A few reasons why the poor, laboring,whitemen of
                        the South should vote against the Mongrel Constitution now being framed by
                        the mixed Convention in session in Richmond</p>
                    <p>In the first place, it will contain manhood suffrage. That is, universal
                        white and black suffrage. It is true, suffrage of itself does not equalize
                        mankind, but it lends to other and more equalizing associations. For
                        instance, the holding of office and the association upon juries, and the
                        adjudication of cause upon the bench. When all the avenues to position are
                        open to the negro, do you not see that inevitably many of them will become
                        Judges, Legislators, Governors [sic],&amp;c. Will this not lead to
                        equality between the races? And why? because the close relationship of
                        representative and constituent, will soon destroy the distinction that now
                        separate the two races, and a mingling of their blood, and the production of
                        a mongrel race will be the inevitable consequence. Who does not look with
                        horror upon this even remote result of manhood suffrage. This would not be
                        the result were either race in sufficient preponderance to despise the other
                        politically. But here, in the South, they are so evenly balanced that the
                        negroes hold the balance of power. This, then, will always make them an
                        object to be quoted by demagogues.</p>
                    <p>In the next place it will undoubtedly provide for free schools. These schools
                        will be sustained by tax upon property. And who owns the property? The white
                        race. And who will be the principle recipients of this bounty? The negroes
                        of course. The whites will not send to free schools, especially as those
                        schools will be composed of both white and black--for we have no idea that
                        provision will be made for a division of the school fund, so that the
                        classes can be separate. Then, as there will be no division of this fund,
                        where is the white man, rich or poor, conservative or radical, who desires
                        his child to be educated in constant association with negro children. -
                        Constant association begets familiarity, familiarity begets confidence, and
                        confidence love, and love marriage, and marriage a blending of the blood of
                        the two races. This free school systemis the most
                        insidious scheme that can be devised for breaking down the barriers that now
                        separate the two races in the South. Whoever desires that the immediate
                        future of this State shall produce such a mixed population as curses the
                        fair land of Mexico, had better vote for the Constitution soon to be
                        submitted to the people for ratification or rejection. But he who desires to
                        keep the blood of the Caucasian race free from degrading mixtures should
                        leave no stone unturned to defeat said Constitution. And the poor man, who
                        had as much to be proud of in his origins, as dukes and princes - because
                        the noblest blood of earth courses in his veins - is as much interested in
                        preventing this contamination as the rich and lordly landowners of the
                        South.</p>
                    <p>In the third place the aforesaid Constitution will provide a permanent
                        disfranchisement of many of our best citizens. Not best because they happen
                        to be wealthy and to have occupied high civil and military positions. But
                        best, because they have shown that they were worthy representatives of free
                        and independent constituents. We fought withthem
                        and under them, and it will be base ingratitude now to consent that they shall be denied the
                        privilege we accept for ourselves. "Ingratitude is treason to mankind," and
                        cannot be covered by "any size words!" We, feel therefore that we do not
                        appeal in vain to confederate soldiers to stand by their comrades and
                        leaders in this combat.</p>
                    <p>many other reasons might be addressed, why the white men of the State should
                        not join the ranks of the radicals, but we think these sufficient for the
                        present.</p>
                    <p>We appeal to them not for the purpose of creating a war of races, or for
                        getting power into our hands, but because the success of the radical party
                        opens the floodgates of political corruption and leads inevitably to a
                        mixture of the blood of the two races. Upon this high ground we take our
                        stand, and to this resolve we call our fellow citizens.</p>

                        Washington on the 8th day of January, courteously declined the invitation
                        for very proper reasons. We give his letter below, and commend it most
                        heartily. - "Words fitly spoken are like apples of gold in pictures of
                        silver."<br>Staunton, Va, January 2, 1868.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen - I pray you accept my thanks for your kind invitation to attend a
                        banquet to be given at the Metropolitan Hotel in the city of Washington, on
                        the 8th instant, under the auspices of leading members of the Conservative
                        Democratic party.</p>
                    <p>Under ordinary circumstances it would be particularly gratifying to me to
                        participate in the festivities of that occasion and to enjoy "the feast of
                        reason and slow of soul" which, I doubt not, will give zest to your
                        entertainment. But situated as I am - disfranchised as a citizen, denied the
                        political privileges which are accorded to negro servant, repelled from the
                        hall of the House of Representatives, to which I was selected almost by
                        acclamation; my native state, the proud old mother of Washington, and Henry,
                        and Jefferson, unrecognized save as Military District No 1 - I must confess
                        I would feel somewhat out of place at your board.</p>
                    <p>In former days, when I visited Washington as a representative of the people,
                        or as the associate of Webster, Crittenden, and Corwin, in the executive
                        councils of the nation, I felt that, in the eye of the law at least, I was
                        the peer of the loftiest in the land. I was privileged to think freely and
                        to speak freely on all matters of public concern. Were I to join your circle
                        now, I should feel painfully conscious of the difference between your
                        position and mine. No military order can consign you to a dungeon beyond the
                        reach of habeas corpus, and no persuasive bayonets admonish you to speak
                        with "bated breath." With me the case might be different. But be that as it
                        may, while Virginia mourns I cannot rejoice. While the cypress encircles her
                        brow I cannot twine the myrtle around my own.</p>
                    <p>But may I not hope that the present condition of things is temporary? If I do
                        not misinterpret the sign of the times, the day is near at hand when, by the
                        mandate of a magnanimous people; the shackles will be stricken from the
                        limbs of Virginia and her southern sisters, and there shall be given unto
                        them "beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of
                        praise for the spirit of heaviness." When that glorious day shall have
                        arrived I shall be happy to meet you and your fellow patriots around the
                        festive board, and on behalf of Virginia to offer a willing and hearty
                        tribute of gratitude to the noble Conservative Democrats who set her free.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully, your obedient servant,<br> Alexander H.H. Stuart</p>

                    <p>Parnassus, Va.,<br> Dec. 23. 1867.</p>
                    <p>Messers Editors:</p>
                    <p>We see in your last issue a request for an "agent and correspondent" at every
                        Post office; and not knowing how many applications may be made from this
                        place, we are somewhat reluctant to make the requisitions. But, feeling that
                        we do no wrong in offering our services, we have concluded to become a rival
                        of any who may aspire to the honor: however you would lose nothing by having
                        several from this point, since, it is so nearly the Eden of Augusta. If
                        other places correspond more nearly to the ancient Garden; then, Augusta is
                        all Eden. Others may boast of a more level country, larger streams, larger
                        meadows; but, can they say they have better people? If so, theirs indeed is
                        a Paradise.</p>
                    <p>Our little town and its vicinity are fast looking up and preparing to send
                        forth men and women, who shall work for the good of our common country.
                        Political meetings and debating clubs are the themes of the week, and Church
                        going on the Sabbath.</p>
                    <p>We have four schools, two debating societies, and one or two singing schools
                        taught by the first music professors of the day. The school teachers are
                        well informed and do themselves, as well as their profession, credit.</p>
                    <p>This is a fat country, and the people live off the best. If any of your town
                        boys get hungry, and want plenty of good things to eat, nice young men for
                        associates, and the lovliest of the fair sex to smile upon them,
                        just send them out here; we doubt not before they are here one week, they
                        will have fully fallen desperately in love, have fully made up their minds
                        to spend their days with us, and "be a farmer's boy."</p>
                    <p>Though ours is a town, we are, with but few exceptions, all farmers; we have
                        one merchant and five mechanics. The name of street or streets, is unknown
                        to us, for one good big road answers the purpose of both. Here we have a
                        church, and not one blest Sabbath passes that our sexton does not open wide
                        the doors for good people to enter and worship the God who has so freely
                        blessed them.</p>
                    <p>The prophecy "know ye the Lord" is nearly fulfilled, for scarcely every
                        member of all the families is a professor of religion, and they do not
                        forget to acknowledge the blessings with which they have been favored; for
                        each morning they bow, and the grey headed father breathes a prayer, simple,
                        eloquent and sublime. An instance of remarkable favor with heaven is
                        frequently remarked, his (the Pastors) five neighbors who join farms, each
                        raised twelve children, making sixty children at five houses along our
                        little creek within the space of a mile.</p>
                    <p>We feel our heart leap with gladness, when we share the hospitalities of
                        these good Christians, no one can leave their houses without bestowing a
                        secret blessing; the parents meet you with that friendly warm shake of the
                        hand which says, you are welcome: a style that is particular to the old
                        folks of Virginia. The young men, though plain and unassuming, are
                        intelligent and refined, and they have that agreeableness about them taught
                        by their parents. In all, they are "fine fellows" and have that firm good
                        sense which makes this country what it is.</p>
                    <p>But the most charming of all are Augusta's daughters. The man is a knave who
                        can't feel the happy leaping of his heart, after talking one or two hours
                        with their shining eyes and faces. They are what we call elegant women; they
                        talk with fluency and are certainly ornaments to their pa's parlor; but the
                        most blessed of all is they are at home every where; the tables show that
                        their fair hands have directed and assisted, in fact, every business about
                        their homes, show them to be stylish. Well do we remember their unmatched
                        kindness and patriotism during the rebellion when we were a "saged reb." And
                        now they talk to us so kindly of those old hard times, till, to change the
                        sadness, their voices strike the melodious strain, and sweet music fills the
                        air and we seem to be enchanted. No later than last night we were charmed by
                        the angelic choristers.</p>
                    <p>So abundant have been the crops of corn, that yet the grain shocks stand in
                        many fields. From the quality of sausage's we see we reckon the number of
                        hogs killed was unusually large. Generally, the R.R. subscription is
                        opposed, and won't get many votes. You shall hear from this section
                        frequently, if you think us worthy your favor.</p>
                    <p>Very Respectfully,<br>"OMI."</p>
