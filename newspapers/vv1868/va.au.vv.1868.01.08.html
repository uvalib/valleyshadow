                    <p>Council met January 4th, 1868. N. K. Trout, Mayor, presided. All present
                        except Crawford, Hope, Points, and Bickle, (sick.) The Mayor presented the
                        bond of Dr. A. M. Atkinson for payment on Market House and lot, which was
                        approved. The interest on the public debt of the city, amounting to $29,860
                        was allowed and the Treasurer ordered to pay same. The usual accounts for
                        preceding month were allowed. The account of Major Jed Hotchkiss, for
                        services as city Engineer, was not allowed, because it was not certified to
                        by Commissioners of Streets. A proposition to open a subscription of $50,000
                        by the city of Staunton to the stock of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad
                        Company was laid over for consideration at next meeting. It was ordered that
                        all accounts allowed by the Council, for sums under five dollars, shall be
                        paid hereafter by the Chief of Police, on the certificate of the clerk of
                        Council. Mr. Evans submitted an ordinance requiring owners of property,

                        city Physician for the poor, at a compensation of $30 per annum. (As the
                        competition for this office and salary will be very great, we advise

<b>Report of a Meeting at Hall's School-house, the 28th of December, 1867.</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>At a schoolhouse meeting, the speaker warns of the dangers inherent in a
                    new Constitution. The principle fear is that Radicals will shift power into the
                    hands of the black citizens of Virginia, thereby creating an unfair
                    representation by those with the least property. This will in turn create
                    problems regarding race relations between property holders and their former
                    bondsmen. Overall, this speech warns that Conservative white citizens will go to
                    any measure to avoid the "disgrace" of "Negro rule."<br>(Names in announcement:  J. S. Ellis, Capt. C. Hall,  W. L. Hunter,  J. A. Fitch,  B. F. Cochran,  Alex Coiner,  G. Herman, Capt. C. G. Miller,  George Nihergall,  David RankinJr.,  M. B. Coalter)</blockquote>

                    <p>Whereas, the Congress of the United States have required a Convention to be
                        called in the State of Virginia for the purpose of creating a Constitution
                        of the State,</p>
                    <p>And whereas, from the action which has been taken by similar Conventions
                        which have been held in other Southern States, there are good grounds to
                        apprehend that the Virginia Convention now in session, may recommend to the
                        people a Constitution which will bring the State under control of the negro
                        race;</p>
                    <p>And whereas, in the opinion of this association, such a result would be most
                        disastrous to the best interest of the State, by transferring the political
                        power of the State to the most portion of its population, and ultimately
                        burthening the land and property of the people with enormous taxation,
                        imposed by those who would own but a small portion of the property of the
                        State, therefore</p>

                        by the Convention, we pledge ourselves to each other, and to our fellow
                        citizens generally, to make every fair and honorable effort to defeat the
                        ratification of such constitution by the people; and to that end we will not
                        only vote against its ratification ourselves, but we will diligently exert
                        ourselves to induce every voter in our respective neighborhoods to attend
                        the polls and record their votes against it.</p>

                        and influence to save ourselves and our race from this calamity and
