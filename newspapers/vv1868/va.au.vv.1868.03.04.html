<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Focusing on the possibility of the impeachment of President Johnson, the
                    author suggests that it is now unlikely. The Radical wing of the party has
                    squared off against its more moderate members insisting that the "tenure of
                    office" bill restricts Johnson's actions. The author predicts that cooler heads
                    in the North will realize the loss of liberties that this battle between
                    Republican factions implies. If Radical rule prevails, it could mean the
                    downfall of a white man's government. Since the South is powerless, southerners
                    should concentrate on developing resources while northerners decide this
                    pressing question.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The excitement at Washington seems to be subsiding. Matters relative to
                        impeachment, stand pretty much in statuquo.</p>
                    <p>Some of the leading Radicals declare that in less than two months the
                        President will be impeached and removed; when Ben Wade of Ohio will be
                        President; a man whom the Conservatives of Ohio have consigned to oblivion,
                        in the late election, and whose place is to be filled in the U.S. Senate by
                        that sterling Democrat Judge Thurman.</p>
                    <p>The "office tenure bill," which has passed for the purpose of tying the hands
                        of President Johnson, and giving the Senate the control of all his
                        appointments fails to teach Stanton. The bill was intended to disarm the
                        President, but as applies only to appointments made by the President and as
                        such coming under the purview of the Senate and Stanton not being an
                        appointment of President Johnson, but of Lincoln, the office tenure bill
                        does not save Stanton and completely giving Mr. Johnson the under
                            tract. It is now doubtful whether the President will be
                        impeached at all. Stanton it is thought will resign by June and thus avoid
                        as he does his trial, involving a quo warrento. It is thought the President
                        will stand firm. He is managing his card so as to
                        set his policy by the Supreme Court, and thus arm him for the great issue by
                        the people at the Ballot Box.</p>
                    <p>There is no prospect for a fight. Yankees fighting Yankees is one thing, and
                        their fighting poor Rebs is another. They will bluster a little, but there
                        will be no fight. Our duty is plain. It is an affair of their own, a fight
                        amongst the Republicans. Radicals on the one hand and Conservatives on the
                        other. The "Rule or ruin" policy of the Radicals we trust will "not
                        prevail." Our sympathies are with the President so far as he  preserve
                        the Constitution, and thus save what is left of Constitutional Liberty.</p>
                    <p>We hope for the best and belong to the class of the hopeful - we don't
                        despair. The people of the North have too much at stake. It will cost them
                        millions and billions to maintain Radical ascendancy and Radical rule; and
                        also the loss of their Liberties and the downfall of a white man's
                        government. Every negro vote in the ten former Slave States of the South,
                        will be equal to the same number of white votes in the North. It is a
                        question for the North to decide - not for us - we are powerless now, and
                        will remain so until the Conservatives of the North shall break the shackles
                        which negroocracy has placed upon our limbs. We must in the meantime develop
                        our resources, and take care of out State and municipal governments as best
                        we can. Continue to labor - "we will hope for the best."</p>
