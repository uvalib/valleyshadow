                <summary>The paper argues that the only sure means toward Virginia's regeneration is
                    the construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad line. The paper urges the
                    people of Augusta to approve a county subscription to the road of between
                    $250,000 and $350,000. That amount would secure the road. Stuart and Baldwin
                    will address the county on the matter.</summary>

                    <p>James Gordon Bennett is right--the issue, the living, practical issue in the
                        pending campaign, is Negro Suffrage. Shall the negroes rule the Southern
                        States, and, through the electoral votes of those States, rule the Northern
                        States as well, is the one simple, single issue to be decided in the
                        election next fall. Grant and Colfax have decided for negro rule. Their
                        election is but a declaration that the negro is the equal of the white men
                        of the land. Their defeat is the verdict of the people that this is a white
                        man's country and government. That this verdict will be promptly rendered,
                        who can doubt? The white men of the North cannot do otherwise.</p>

                <summary>This article expresses anxiety over the possible election of Grant and
                    Colfax. If this were to take place, the author suggests, they will install negro
                    rule throughout the South, and through electoral votes, the North as well. The
                    defeat of the Republicans would show without question that the United States was
                    a white man's country throughout.</summary>
