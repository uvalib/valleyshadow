                    <p>"I am Jehovah; I change not." Thus God speaks, but mortals cannot give such
                        utterance; change is written on every leaf of their record. The policy of
                        yesterday will not suit the necessity of to-day. All experience demonstrates
                        that we must mould our political action to suit uncontrollable events as
                        they occur. In December 1867, from the then conservative standpoint, it was
                        statesmanship earnestly to protest against negro equality and
                        dispassionately to defy in emphatic reasoning the powers that be. Twelve
                        months have produced new living facts for us to meet, which is part of
                        wisdom--like old fogies or infatuated "Bourbons," to be voluntarily broken
                        on the wheel, or to die in the last ditch of obsolete ideas, or like men
                        equal to the emergency, and true to their country, to undertake to pilot the
                        ship of state now wildly driven towards the rapids of adverse winds. Who can
                        hesitate as to the right answer? We say, then, away with the futile effort
                        of the opposition who arraign the leaders of the new movement on the charge
                        of inconsistency and change of political chart. Come up and show that the
                        last step is not demanded by every appeal of patriotism, show that your plan
                        of masterly inactivity and submission to the Radical prescription will lead
                        us to peace, harmony and prosperity; stand to the fore like men and accept
                        the irreversible decision and make the best of it.</p>

                <summary>The author submits an argument to the "fogies" holding on to their old
                    ways. Peace and prosperity depend on being able to make the best of a bad
                    situation. Thus, the author suggests moving beyond attacks on the "powers that
                    be," and instead recommends that those "voluntarily broken on the wheel" join
                    the new movement.</summary>

                    <p>The Washington Express has an editorial which is certainly in the right
                        spirit and worthy of the notice of the fire-eating men of the North. It
                        says: "Confidence is said to be a plant of slow growth, but grow it must and
                        will. Human hearts are not made for estrangements. All national difficulties
                        between equals are, sooner or later, capable of adjustment. Monarchists and
                        Democrats cannot mingle any more than can oil and water; but fellow citizens
                        of the same republic, of kindred intelligence, cannot long essentially
                        differ. They must unite.</p>
                    <p>For years before the war of 1861 the South and the North were more or less
                        accustomed to speak of each other as "Southern brethren" and "Northern
                        brethren." A sad alienation has since occurred; but, and as it is, it cannot
                        last forever. Already the signs of mutual reconciliation are beginning to
                        multiply and increase. It is just here and now that one of the high missions
                        of the Democratic element of our country begins.--This element has always
                        had a greater control over the South than any other of a political
                        character. It was in the South, among the hills of Monticello that the
                        purest Democracy of America had its birth. Its infancy was rocked in the
                        hickory Hermitage of Tennessee. Is it any wonder that the chivalrous people
                        of the sunny land should love their own offspring?</p>
                    <p>If the rulers of this nation expect to conduct its affairs successfully they
                        must not ignore the South. As far as she has been alienated they must
                        conciliate her. She must be restored to her place in the sisterhood of
                        States, fully, freely, cordially, and on terms of perfect equality.
                        Reconstruction is not the word. The South is already constructed, and has
                        been since the days of Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry, and from the
                        foundation of the Government. This country owes more of her best territory
                        to the South than to any other portion of the Republic. The Jeffersonian
                        ordinance of Congress, which opened up the area from the Alleghenies to the
                        Rocky Mountains, was the free gift of the South.--The great giant of the
                        Northwest was born of Virginia. All the tier of States and Territories, from
                        the Ohio to the Pacific, lying on the gift of the old mother of Presidents,
                        are her children's children.</p>
                    <p>Is it not graceful and becoming, therefore, that Virginia should be treated
                        with all due deference? All such tributes of respect are peculiarly valuable
                        at such a time as this.--They will carry us back as a people, to the
                        chivalrous spirit of other times. We are much inclined, at this day to view
                        all our national affairs through political, party, and commercial mediums.
                        There is such a thing a genuine patriotism; there is a confraternity of
                        State; there is a National Union; and they are based on kindred principles,
                        on social exchanges, on general hospitalities. O, for the good old days of
                        heartfelt sympathies, through every part of the Republic! Why may they not
                        dawn upon us again? Is there any reason why we should continue to speak of
                        any part of the country as distinct from the rest? Where all are peers, may
                        not the ruling power be equal among all?</p>
                    <p>What is needed more to our nation than anything else is restored confidence.
                        We have had enough of estrangements. It is time they should cease at once
                        and forever. There is no interest of the South but is equally dear to the
                        North. There is no interest of the North but as equally dear to the South.
                        Perish the thought that we should ever be again estranged!</p>

                <summary>This article calls for sectional reconciliation on terms of "pure
                    equality." The author suggests that before the war, the sections were on
                    friendly, mutually beneficial terms, and he longs for that to again be the case.
                    Significantly, he implies the North is responsible for any ill feelings.
                    Northerners who hold onto sectional bitterness are reminded that Virginia was
                    the birthplace of the democratic republic, and that the great Northwest expanse
                    originated in Virginia. Thus, Virginia is a fundamental component of the
                    republic, and should be treated accordingly.</summary>

                    <p> The National Intelligencer says:--"We published the other day resolutions
                        unanimously adopted by the people of Washington county, on the motion of
                        that learned and pure jurist Hon. S.S. Baxter, appreciating the "purity of
                        patriotism of the gentlemen who recently visited Washington to avert the
                        evils which threaten the present and future political right of the people of
                        Virginia," and tendering their <emph rend="italic"> "their sincere thanks
                            for their course."</emph> This ought to be sufficiently distinct, and
                        yet this county has been claimed as hostile to the "new movement." Smythe
                        and Bland counties, in Southwest Virginia, have each held meetings, and
                        indorsed the "new movement." Nelson county, in East Virginia, almost
                        unanimously sustains the movement; and Halifax county, containing more
                        blacks, we believe, than any other county in the State, has put at the head
                        of its delegation Hon. Thomas S. Flournoy, one of the original friends of
                        the proposition. In Essex county the speaking was all in favor of the
                        movement and ex-Senator Hunter, we are glad to see, heads the delegation to
                        the convention of the 17th of March. Rockbridge and King George counties
                        have gone adversely, but the impressions so far entirely refute the point so
                        conspicuously made and relied on by Governor Wells, viz: that the people of
                        Virginia do not favor the new movement. Those who did not understand it at
                        first are now fast coming to its support. Sensible men are able to see that
                        a movement and platform so earnestly opposed by Governor Wells and his
                        carpetbagger must have good in it for the State.</p>
                    <p>Virginia, by her large preponderance of whites and their energetic character,
                        is much better to face negro suffrage than South Carolina, Louisiana,
                        Mississippi, or even Georgia. But this is not the only question. The reason
                        why these shrewd party leaders in Tennessee and the cotton States have
                        yielded this point is that they see negro suffrage is a fixed fact, and that
                        the only way to secure a large portion of the negro vote for respectable men
                        is to abandon opposition to their voting. Like sensible people, they make
                        the best of the situation as they find it, and they prefer themselves to
                        vote the negro instead of forcing him into the arms of the carpetbaggers.
                        For a while the latter voted the entire class of blacks, but he lost his
                        empire the day the whites stopped their war on negro suffrage. This lesson
                        is very suggestive.</p>

                    is a fact. Instead of allowing blacks to fall under the spell of radicals, the

                    <p>Washington, Jan. 27--The attendance in the room of the Congressional
                        Reconstruction Committee this morning was large. Among those present were
                        noticed Judge Sheffey, of Staunton; ex-Gov. Fayette McMullen; Judge
                        Sinclair, of Prince William; W. H. Gray and Senator Mercier, of Loudon; Mr.
                        Cowardin, of the Richmond Dispatch; Douglas Wallack and others. But three
                        members of the committee, Messrs. Boutwell, Payne, and Norris, were in the
                        room during the first half hour of the session, but Mr. Bingham and two
                        others dropped in before its close. It is the subject of remark that a full
                        committee is never present, and that those most frequently absent are those
                        supposed to be disposed to act with leniency towards the unfortunate people
                        whose fate is in their hands.</p>
                    <p>Two hours--from ten to twelve--devoted to committee business, was consumed in
                        an examination, by Mr. Norris, of Col. John B. Baldwin, and in listening to
                        the statements of Charles Whittlesey. [Mr. E. E. White says Mr. Whittlesey
                        resides in Alexandria, and not in Richmond, as the correspondent supposed.]</p>
                    <p>The basis of Col. Baldwin's examination was a written statement by him of the
                        public sentiment in Virginia which had previously been laid before the
                        committee, and which was intended to show that the people of the State as a
                        whole were actuated by conscientious motives, would abide by the laws, in
                        their relations with immigrants would be governed by the same rules that
                        obtained in other States, and, with reference to their former slaves, though
                        not regarding them as proper recipients of the privilege of suffrage, would
                        allow them all the rights to which they might be entitled. During his
                        examination he was asked whether a Democratic and Radical carpet-bagger
                        would receive similar treatment in Virginia. He answered that he did not
                        suppose in the whole range of natural history such an anomaly as a
                        democratic carpet-bagger could be found, for it required either national or
                        State executive appoint, or the military power, or the influence of the
                        Freedmen's Bureau to constitute such an animal.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin, after his examination, made a statement concerning the reported
                        ejectment of the colored members of a Methodist Church in Staunton, which
                        was substantiated by sworn evidence now in the office of Gen. Stoneman, in
                        Richmond, and which differed very considerably from the account of the same
                        affair as given to the committee a few days since by Rev. Mr. Phelps, of the
                        Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
                    <p>Charles Whittlesey then detained the committee over an hour in a futile
                        attempt to invalidate the assertions made to the committee last week by Col.
                        Baldwin. He had taken notes of what Col. Baldwin had said at that time, and
                        had prepared for the occasion a lengthy narration, the bearing of most of
                        which, however, upon the subject at issue--the plan of the committee of
                        nine, and the removal of political disabilities--could not be perceived by
                        the committee, and of which fact Mr. Boutwell informed him. He laid great
                        stress upon the fact that the people of Virginia were in favor of a white
                        man's government, and was amusingly non-plussed when Mr. Beck naively asked
                        him whether the laws of his State--remarking that he understood he came from
                        Connecticut--were not as rigorous in the exclusion of negroes from office as
                        any laws in existence in Virginia.</p>
                    <p>During the session it was announced that the applications of those desiring
                        the removal of their disabilities, with the reasons therefore, must,
                        hereafter, be made in writing.</p>

                        credit system, and more especially is it felt in times like these in which

                        go."--Debt undermines the principles of individuals and nations. Any man, or
                        any community that recklessly makes use of the credit he or it may possess,
                        gives evidence of a moral intemperance which, in nine cases out of ten, is
                        little else than moral turpitude. We hold that a disposition to rush into
                        debt, because one has the ability so to do, is an evidence of a lack of
                        moral principle. No man has a right to incur an obligation, unless he can
                        see, or thinks he sees, the certainty of possessing the means of discharging
                        it.--The fact that he is able to give security for the performance of the
                        promise to pay, does not detract from the serious responsibility he assumes.
                        It is too well known that a very large percentage of the mortgage given
                        results in the final loss of the mortgage of his entire security pledged;
                        and it follows that he and his are reduced to penury and want, and this
                        change is not at all calculated to improve the moral tone or elevate the
                        moral sentiments of the suffering we behold through the county now.</p>

                <summary>This article serves as a warning to those seeking to go into debt. Debt,
                    says the author, is the root of moral turpitude, even if one has the proper
                    backing to secure the money borrowed. Rather, the author suggests that all "pay
                    as they go." This will help put an end to "suffering through the country."</summary>
