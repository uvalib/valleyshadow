<b>Strong-minded Women</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This particularly scornful look at strong-minded women condemns all "female
                    monsters" and "disappointed spinsters" who advocate women's rights. Included in
                    this attack are suggestions that women's rights activists necessarily advocate
                    miscegenation, as well as an accusation that these women will drag their
                    husbands down. The author is careful to point out the variety of opinions
                    advanced at the recent Women's Convention in New York, particularly those who
                    reject universal suffrage.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> It is humiliating and even painful to a person of refined sensibility to
                        read the details of "Womens' Rights," "Peace" and "Universal
                        Suffrage" meetings held at the North. The former, particularly, is
                        characterized by all the vile slang and balderdash that prevail in the
                        lowest kind of Ward gatherings or at prominent caucuses. The ruling spirits
                        of those meetings are women--or rather female monsters who disgrace their
                        sex by assuming all the baser passions of the sterner sex. These Gorgons are
                        led on by Susan Anthony, Mrs. Stanton and a parcel of male tags, who are
                        hangers on and do the dirty work, if there is any left for them to do. The
                        poor, deluded sisters who are led to attach themselves to these leaders,
                        through a mistaken belief in a successful adjustment of the question of
                        women's rights, are drawn from their true sphere of usefulness--the home
                        circle, and made to jostle to crowds at Mass meetings, Free love gatherings,
                        and the like, to the neglect of their families and the consequent ruin of
                        their husbands. They look in vain for better homes and better pay; the
                        little they earn is drawn from them to aid in defraying the expenses
                        necessary to carry out the great reformation. Do they find the relief for
                        their physical and social woes? Do they elevate themselves in the scale of
                        respectability? No, the physicians they have employed cannot
                        effect a cure, all the female gatherings and penny-trumpet
                        harangues will not give them the position they demand. Their sufferings are
                        great and their wrongs many, it is true, and may be remedied in the course
                        of time, but not by their assuming the prerogatives of man--not by claiming
                        the right to vote, to sit as jurors or to hold office. The brazen faced,
                        shrieking sisterhood who cry aloud for a share of the "loaves and fishes,"
                        and make a strong point of abusing the opposite sex, are mostly a band of
                        parched up, sharp-featured, stale and disappointed spinsters--who long for
                        notoriety and care but little how it is obtained. The very fact of their
                        advocating miscegenation proves that, having found all the white bachelors
                        hard-hearted, they are willing to try their luck with gentlemen of African
                        'scent. Make Sambo a voter, they say, and then we will acknowledge the
                        "tender impeachment."</p>
                    <p> On the first day of the Womens' Convention in New York, the lie
                        passed between Miss Anthony and Mr. Foster. On the second day hisses,
                        cat-calls and yells greeted the speakers. The Tribune says that the women, by their rowdy proceedings, fully
                        established their claims on all rights--they were no better than men. One of
                        the sisterhood who had been on a visit to the South, strongly protested
                        against black suffrage. She said that black men whip their wives, adding
                        that "One of her sisters servants whipped his wife every Sunday regularly.
                        She thought that sort of man should not have the making of the laws for the
                        governance of women throughout the land." Mrs. Stanton also took the same
                        ground and loudly protested "that she did not believe in allowing ignorant
                        negroes and ignorant Chinamen to make laws for her to obey." The debate was
                        boisterous and many a hard blow given and received.</p>
                    <p> At a meeting of the Universal Peace Society held in New York, the women also
                        took an active part in the debate. The object of the philanthropic society
                        is to give the world at large a great quantity of wholesome advice, which
                        said world can follow or let it alone. One of the theories advocated by the
                        Peace Society is the assertion that "the exemption of the Indian from
                        taxation is a wrong to him." There is a strong likelihood that the Red man
                        don't think so. A very odd resolution was offered by Minnie Merton. She
                        submitted "that women have a right to life--that women represent the life of
                        the nation; that women cannot attain that life unless men give them material
                        aid." All this men of gallantry will agree to, that is, if we understand
                        Miss Minnie aright; the men are to support the women--just what all good
                        husbands are now doing. After Miss Minnie had submitted her views Miss
                        Crouch, the Secretary, it is said, arose and defined her position in "a
                        clear, sharp, metallic voice." For a Peace
                        gathering it seems odd that women with shrill voices should be allowed to
                        assault the ears of the audience. Mrs. Sommerville advocated "ultra peace
                        doctrines," and, in order to make her ideas of peace clearly understood, she
                        violently attacked all Christians who did not side with her! We have not yet
                        learned whether the Society has established peace throughout the world--it
                        may succeed some of these days.</p>

<b>Election Order</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article briefly outlines a few procedural changes ordered by General
                    Canby for an upcoming election. Included is the race, political affiliation, and
                    number of challengers at each polling place, the organization of voting
                    precincts, and the use of the ballot box.<br>

                    <p>Gen. Canby has issued an order concerning Registrations and Elections. It
                        occupies more than six closely printed columns, and we would cheerfully
                        publish it, if it were ordered as an advertisement--but we can only give the
                        pith of it, as our room is precious.</p>
                    <p>The revision of the registration lists is to commence on the 11th of June and
                        continue ten days.</p>
                    <p>Two white and two colored persons on each district are to be selected by the
                        Board as challengers.</p>

                    <p>Two persons from each political party may be selected as challengers at the
                        polls.</p>
                    <p>The number of election precincts in the towns is increased, there is to be
                        one for every four hundred voters.</p>
                    <p> Registration is necessary to voting. These are the siftings of the document.
                        When registrars cannot be obtained on account of not being able to qualify,
                        army officers "waiting orders" are to be employed. The 
                            viva voce, or honest and open system of olden times, is not to be
                        used--but the abominable ballot box, so often corrupted and stuffed to the
                        injury of the pubic liberties.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our town presented quite a sense of animation on Monday last; an unusual
                        number of strangers being called hither either on business or a love of
                        observation. The day was mild and balmy, and the farmers looked cheerful
                        with the prospect of fine crops of grain before them, and, consequently,
                        plenty of money when the result of their labor was brought to a ready
                        market. In and around the Court House, the bustle was particularly
                        refreshing. Within the walls of the seat of justice, Colonel Baldwin held
                        forth on the position of the day to a dense crowd of listeners composed of
                        all hues from the pure Caucasian to the blackest Ethiopian.--Around the
                        square were gathered a mixed assortment of bipeds examining the various
                        farming machines on exhibition, some selling and some buying. Knots of negro
                        politicians were here and there discussing the issues of the day and the
                        best mode of maintaining their rights. Three auctioneer's stands were within
                        range of vision, and the criers lustily exercised their lungs while setting
                        up and knocking down. The braying of jacks and neighing of horses added to
                        the striking power of the chorus. We will endeavor to give the reader an
                        inkling of the effect of this heterogeneous chorus.</p>
                    <p>Orator. My colored hearers, ponder the question
