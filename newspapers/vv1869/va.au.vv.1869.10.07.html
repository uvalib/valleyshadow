<b>Our Legislature--The Senatorial Question</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article illustrates the complications involved with the Senatorial
                    question recently discussed at a meeting of the Legislature. "Restless friends"
                    have put forward a name with the hopes of pleasing General (President) Grant.
                    The author suggests that these "friends" have acted in haste and run the risk of
                    offending Congress. The author suggests that all action regarding the Senatorial
                    question be postponed until Congress has expressed its wishes in regard to the
                    various powers of the General Assembly.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This body assembled on Tuesday. Until the recent supplementary opinion on
                        Attorney-General Hoar was promulgated, the universal impression seemed to be
                        that the General Assembly would meet, organize, pass the 15th amendment and
                        adjourn.</p>
                    <p>This programme, however, did not suit some of our restless spirits, and by
                        constant agitation, they have managed to draw a second opinion from
                        Attorney-General Whore--we beg your pardon--Hoar! and now the matter seems
                        to be somewhat complicated.</p>
                    <p>The first idea of some of our politicians was, that we must elect a certain
                        General Williams to the Senate of the U.S. to show our gratitude to Gen
                        Grant! Presently it turned out that Gen Grant did not want General Williams
                        elected, but did want his brother-in-law Dr. Sharp chosen! This somewhat
                        disconcerted the advocates of "gratitude to Gen. Grant." They found that
                        Gen. Grant's wishes and their's ran in different channels. Their's led to
                        the election of Mrs. Douglas' husband--while Gen Grant's gravitated towards
                        a member of his own family. This put the "grateful" men in a quandary, and
                        how it will come out, we can't say.</p>
                    <p>We fear our restless friends have got us into a difficulty from which we will
                        not find it easy to free ourselves.</p>
                    <p> Our true policy is, to offend nobody--but, as far as we can see, to
                        conciliate all. By pleasing the President we may displease Congress, and Congress
                        is the body to which we must look for relief. We should recollect how
                        jealous Congress showed itself of Executive interference, in Mr. Johnson's
                        time, and we should profit by that lesson. </p>
                    <p>We think our Legislature should proceed cautiously, and be sure it is
                        treading on solid ground. If it acts hastily, it may find itself in quick
                        sand.</p>
                    <p>It seems to us, the wisest course would be for the Legislature to adopt a
                        resolution reciting that whereas there are so many doubts and difficulties
                        surrounding the Senatorial question, and whereas they earnestly desire to
                        make their action conform to the wishes of Congress, therefore be it
                        resolved that all action on that subject be postponed, until Congress shall
                        have the opportunity of expressing its views and wishes in regard to the
                        powers and duties of the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>In this way we will give no offence to any body. We will exhibit every
                        disposition to satisfy Congress and the Executive. And if, at a future day,
                        Congress shall indicate its wish for an election of Senators, the
                        Legislature can make it. It would be as easy to elect Gen. Williams, or Mr.
                        Sharp, or Mr. any body else, then, as now.</p>
                    <p>By adopting this policy, we would know what we were about. We would not be
                        acting in the dark, and butting our heads against either a Congressional or
                        Executive post.--Better see the whole field in the clear light of day, than
                        go thundering along in the thick fog that now envelopes us.</p>

                        experience and able services in the Cabinet and legislation, both federal

                        Fourteenth Amendment, admit him to his seat, and thus secure honorable and
