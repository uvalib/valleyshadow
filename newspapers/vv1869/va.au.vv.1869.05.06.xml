                    <p> From every quarter we have indications of the increasing unpopularity of the
                        present administration. The great bell which is to toll the knell of Radical
                        supremacy is hung, and its tones will soon be heard reverberating from one
                        end of the land to the other. The party tool, who "did not seek" the high
                        office conferred on him, has shown his weakness, and has proven himself so
                        willing a cat's-paw, that even those of his original friends who shouted for
                        him,, are becoming disgusted with the calf they held up for the people to do
                        reverence to. The constitution has become a mere myth--the Supreme Court,
                        whose sage judges were in times past looked upon with awe and reverence,
                        has, as is proved by its dismissing the appeal in the McAardle case, been
                        awed into submission to party power. The veto power of the President is held
                        as naught--and even if the present Executive considered it his duty to
                        withhold his approval of a bill, he has not the moral courage to do it;
                        Grant <emph rend="italic">dared</emph> not veto the tenure of office bill
                        though it tied his hands, through fear of vengeance of the party that lifted
                        him into power. Power! where is his power? Congress is the Government <emph
                            rend="italic">de facto;</emph> the President is a mere tool, the Supreme
                        Court is a puppet, and the people good easy fools who can be taught to
                        swallow buncombe speeches about the stars and stripes--patriotism--rebel
                        atrocities--Cuban independence--equal rights--free love and spiritualism.</p>
                    <p>The verdict of the people will be given through the ballot box at the next
                        general election; such a state of affairs cannot exist long; the blind shall
                        be made to see; for what government can exist which is based exclusively on
                        party measures--created by party power, and sustained by closed caucus of
                        leaders? An oligarchy will not be sustained by the People. Congress has
                        issued its edict, asserting a despotic rule over Presidents, Courts, States,
                        and the people, making the ideas of an Union and a Constitution a farce, and
                        coercing whole communities beneath their heel. This decree affects not only
                        the Southern but the Northern States. The "Rebels" are not the only ones to
                        be ruled--the people of the "loyal States" are to be enslaved. If the voters
                        of the Northern and Western States are not blind beyond cure, they will be
                        made to see by some political optimist. Senator Sprague is doing much
                        towards opening their eyes--other leading Radicals are openly denouncing the
                        corruption and rascality that now exist in high places, and before long
                        Grant will scarcely have a backer.</p>

                <summary>This article warns the people of the corruption of the present
                    administration. President Grant is merely a tool of the Radicals and the Supreme
                    Court is its puppet. The author indicates that the Radicals make a farce of the
                    Constitution, which in turn has consequences not only for the Southern states,
                    but the Northern ones as well. Despite the oppressive circumstances at the
                    present, the author is confident that the next general election will yield
                    positive results against the radicals. He assures his readers that Grant will
                    soon have no backers.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>We have received (franked by Geo. W. Anderson, M.C.) the address of Mr.
                        Segar, the republican candidate for Congress for the State at large. He says
                        he never admired the caucus system in any of its forms, and thinks that
                        popular sentiment will be far more likely to be advanced by the voluntary
                        suffrage of the people, who are sure to bring the test to personal
                        qualification. He defies caucuses and cliques; he wants the people (the dear
                        gullible people) to judge the innovation and the innovator. He thinks the
                        work of reconstruction has been accomplished, and congratulates us all,
                        "that the magnanimity and statesmanship of President Grant have removed the
                        obstacles that lay in our path, by providing for the submission of the
                        Constitution to the people, either stripped of its offensive features, or to
                        be voted on its separate sections." The smallest favors thankfully received!
                        He says he is determined to vote against the test oath--So are we. He lays
                        particular stress on the fact that ninety-nine out of a hundred voters will
                        be deprived of the right of franchise on account of their having in some way
                        aided the rebellion. Mr. Segar can safely vote--he was far from being an
                        aider and abetter of the rebellion; but he knows something about the
                        pointing of the guns of Fortress Monroe upon the town of Hampton at the
                        opening of said rebellion. He is also opposed to disfranchisement, and says
                        that the county organization provision will entail upon the people a
                        taxation that will eat out their substance. To clinch the matter he says, "I
                        scarcely need add that if the present Constitution were presented to me as a
                        whole, as it now stands, I should be constrained to reject it."</p>
                    <p>Of the Fifteenth Amendment, which makes suffrage universal throughout the
                        Union, he is rather shy. "Negro suffrage" he says "is a fixed fact. We can
                        no more avert it than we can stop the sun's course, and it is, our policy to
                        settle this negro question at once and forever." What, settle a fixed fact?
                        He promises if we the people will make him our representative to the Forty
                        first Congress, to develop the resources of Virginia--to see that her
                        railroads are completed; in fact he is an advocate for internal improvement;
                        and will put on the brow of Virginia "the wreath of both commercial and
                        manufacturing renown, and place her, ere many lustrums, along side the
                        Empire State." According to his ideas, railroads can be built without
                        money--all we have to do is select a smart man to Congress, and we will get
                        an appropriation of public lands, or a loan of the national credit. He winds
                        up with stating that--</p>
                    <p>"We have in General Grant a statesman magnanimous, wise and firm, who
                        comprehends our difficulties, and understands our needs, and who will smooth
                        our way to reconstruction without oppressive or dishonorable
                    conditions."</p>

                <summary>The author of this article is skeptical of the promises made by
                    Congressional candidate Joseph Segar. Segar, a Republican, claims to be opposed
                    to many of the radical propositions for the Constitution. Most importantly, he
                    supports universal suffrage. While "shy" regarding Negro suffrage, he agrees
                    with the current sentiment acknowledging the matter as "fixed." The author
                    thinks this politician is making promises too difficult to keep, particularly
                    those concerning the development of Virginia's industries.</summary>

                    <p> The Democratic organs of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas, says the
                        Louisville <emph rend="italic">Courier Journal,</emph> are greatly exultant
                        because President Grant is authorized by Congress to select according to his
                        own discretion such provisions of those States as he pleases and submit them
                        separately to the people for acceptance or rejection. The Radicals on the
                        contrary are said to be greatly mortified and disappointed, their universal
                        desire having been that each constitution should be submitted as a whole to
                        the people of the State voting upon it. The Southern Democrats take it for
                        granted that the President will submit separately all the most odious and
                        obnoxious provisions of the proposed constitution, and that those provisions
                        will be rejected, whilst the Radicals are said to be painfully apprehensive
                        of such a result. Our own decided conviction, however, is that the Democrats
                        have very little cause to feel elated in regard to the matter or the
                        Radicals to feel depressed. Grant, we hardly need to say, is undeniably in
                        the hands of the Radical leaders, and if there are, in the constitutions of
                        the three States spoken of any provisions, no matter how offensive and
                        revolting, which are deemed necessary to the full consummation of the
                        Congressional plan of reconstruction in all its enormity, none of <emph
                            rend="italic">those</emph> provisions will be submitted separately as
                        the Radical leaders may think can be dispensed with without detriment to the
                        success of their despotic designs. We should have hoped better things from
                        Grant a few weeks ago, but Grant has murdered hope.</p>

                <summary>Although Grant has been authorized by Congress to submit provisions of
                    constitutions to each separately to be accepted or rejected by the people, the
                    author does not have high hopes. Some Democrats assume that Grant will submit
                    the worst provisions first and that they will be immediately rejected. While
                    this is good news for the Democrats, it has the Radicals worried. However, since
                    Grant is "undeniably in the hands of the Radical party," he will not act on this
                    authority. Thus, the Democrats have no reason to be elated and the radicals have
                    no reason to be worried.</summary>
