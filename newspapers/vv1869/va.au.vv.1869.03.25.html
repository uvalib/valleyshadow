<b>The Evils of Intemperance</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article supports the efforts of the Friends of Temperance. Whiskey,
                    the author states, is at the heart of a number of social, intellectual, and
                    financial shortcomings. It causes people's businesses to fail, it effects
                    reason, and "bribes the tongue" to speak falsehoods. The time to do away with
                    the evil of drink has arrived, particularly since death can come at any time.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are every day occurrences that call to our minds the evil and
                        depressing effects of drink. It is Whiskey that has taken the glow of health
                        from the cheek, the lustre from the eye, strength from the limbs and
                        vitality from the blood. It is Whiskey that has entered the temple of
                        thought and dethroned reason--that has taken the beam of intelligence from
                        the eye--has bribed the tongue to utter falsehoods--broken the ties of
                        friendship, has made the indulgent father a brute and the affectionate
                        mother a fiend that has filled our prison houses with men whose business has
                        been crushed and broken up by the too free use of ardent spirits.</p>
                    <p>What a fearful record indeed, and what a wide field for the display of
                        christian virtues. Let us unite the many examples that come up before us and
                        take warning in time, for fear of death and destruction may come upon us
                        when we least expect. One thing is certain, no man can prosper and become a
                        good member of society who continues a course of dissipation. It gives us
                        great pleasure to notice the efforts made by the old and new associations of
                        Friends of Temperance of our town. May they continue to flourish, and may
                        the good effects of their teachings be visible in our community a thousand
                        fold.</p>

<b>Lorenzo S. Sibert</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Lauding the virtues of inventor Lorenzo Sibert, the author points out one
                    important invention that could have helped the Confederate cause, and another
                    invention that will certainly benefit post-war Virginia.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>This gentleman viewed as an inventive genius is one of the most remarkable
                        men in the Old Dominion. Let us glance at a few chapters in his history for
                        the past eight years. In 60 or 61 he invented a gun, which far surpassed any
                        previous invention; and it would have been of incalculable service to the
                        greatest of Generals, Lee, during the late unpleasantness, but for some
                        light fingered gentlemen, belonging to that superior race of men, known by
                        the euphonious appellation of Yankee, who purloined the model from the
                        patent office at Washington. Within the past few months he has also invented
                        innumerable useful articles, the most prominent of which being manganese
                        steel; and for the manufacture of which he has formed a co-partnership with
                        some large capitalists, and is making extensive preparations. It is the
                        design of the company to erect about fifty dwellings for the accommodation
                        of laborers who are daily making application to them for employment.</p>
                    <p>They propose erecting four or five large furnaces in the near future, which
                        will render necessary the employment of hundreds of artisans, and, of
                        course, a portion of the application which they are now receiving, meet with
                        favor.</p>
                    <p>In selecting managers for the company Mr. Sibert has displayed judgment which
                        would be flattering to a man of the most exalted ability and
                    penetration.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article, reproduced from the Richmond Whig, looks to the future with
                    optimism. The author suggests that time has come for reconciliatory efforts. All
                    those who in the past have had differences should come together to work against
                    oppressive people who desire to control Virginia. Only then, can Virginians once
                    again enjoy peace and prosperity.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The Richmond Whig says: "There are many cheering
                        indications of the approach of better times in Virginia. The lines drawn by
                        the war are beginning to grow faint, and passions that raged with violence
                        are fast cooling down. Party ties are rapidly loosening, while personal
                        bitterness is every hour diminishing. Men who have been divided by a gulf
                        that seemed impassable have come together in familiar converse, and are
                        beginning to learn that they have more in common than they believed
                        possible. All good men, all reflecting men, all who have a stake in the
                        community, and who desire to re-establish order, tranquility and prosperity
                        in the State, begin to realize that past troubles and differences should no
                        longer divide them, since such divisions will be the means of handing over
                        to corrupt and incompetent men the control of our affairs. There is, indeed,
                        no reason who men of integrity, character and intelligence, whatever may
                        have been their past difference, should longer stand in opposition to each
                        other. Virginia needs the help of all her sons, native and adopted. They
                        must lock shields, and, with faces to the front, stand shoulder to shoulder
                        in the good cause.</p>
