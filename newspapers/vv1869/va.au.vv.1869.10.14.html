<b>Co-operation</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author looks to the theory and practice of "Co-operation" to solve the
                    various problems that exist between Capital and underpaid, disinterested Labor.
                    His suggestion, borrowed from the example of a previously failing British Coal
                    Mining operation, is to spread the wealth among the workmen. Logic would dictate
                    that a worker with more to gain would naturally work harder and more
                    efficiently. According to the author, this increase in output would be
                    beneficial to both Labor and Capital and for the prosperity of Virginia overall.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> Does it pay the manufacturer best to pursue the usual old mode of hiring his
                        workmen for the least money, or to interest them by co-operation? The manufacturing interest of Staunton is rapidly
                        increasing, and it is well for us to study this question. Facts, as well as
                        theory, answer Co-operation. </p>
                    <p> Under the old system the selfish rule of conduct is for Capital to give
                        Labor as little as possible, and as a natural result Labor gives Capital as
                        little return as it dare, with a very indifferent interest in the quality of
                        the article made or the success of the business. They both quickly take
                        advantage of the necessities of the other to rise or fall. They stand all
                        through their connection in direct antagonism towards each other, which not
                            unfrequently results in strikes, lock out, riots, loss and
                        suffering. A practical example of the complete reverse of this system is
                        furnished us in an English Coal Mine. A large Company from the above cause
                        had advertised to sell out, having lost continuously for years, and not
                        expecting to realize one half of their investment, from the sales.</p>
                    <p>A proposal was made from their miners. The company to receive a certain rate
                        of interest on their money, the hands to be entitled to draw their wages
                        weekly. The scale to be regulated by a Board of Miners and the Directors.
                        Then all profit above the interest, cost of labor, &amp;c, was to be
                        divided equally between Capital and Labor. The miners who let their money
                        lay were allowed the same rate of interest as other stock owners. The result
                        was constant work, better coal, no waste, the miners watched each other, and
                        at the end of the second year they had over five per cent extra to divide
                        between the heretofore bankrupt Company and idle miners.</p>
                    <p>Each of our manufacturers and farmers can easily arrange with their workmen
                        some simple plan of co-operation which will render their interests identical
                        and add to our general prosperity.</p>
