<b>Negro Labor in the South</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article refutes a number of claims recently made by Harriet Beecher
                    Stowe. She suggests, after living in a ramshackle dwelling in Florida,
                    surrounded by black people, that while in extreme poverty, they are all
                    industrious and honest. As evidence, she illustrates how doors were left open,
                    and keys were left lying about without a single incident of thievery. The author
                    argues the very opposite. Black people, he claims, both before and since the
                    war, have displayed their inherent nature to steal whenever given the chance.
                    Further, they do not, or rather cannot understand freedom as it pertains to
                    honoring labor contracts. In short, blacks are not to be trusted. They have
                    managed to secure a number of offices under the auspices of the radical party,
                    but their schemes to rule over the white race will soon be thwarted.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> Harriet Beecher Stowe has an editorial in the Hearth and
                            Home of this week on the subject of negro labor, honesty
                        &amp;c. In the offset she denies the report which appeared in this
                        journal, as well as many others, that her residence in Florida had led her
                        to entirely alter her opinion of the negro race, and, that she has since
                        been heard to express a desire to write a book to expose these follies and
                        vices--a book that would take an opposite view to that of "Uncle Tom's
                        Cabin." She gives strong testimony in favor of the honesty of the negro, (and she had them around her from
                        Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana). She
                        "lived in a dilapidated house, where doors were off the hinges and would not
                        be made to keep shut; where the windows were broken out, and in some cases
                        wholly gone." This was a strange abode for one so fastidious as Mrs. Stowe
                        to select. "During the four weeks that we were there," she says, "it was the
                        custom of the family to go to bed, leaving the outside doors wide open,
                        except in the case of stormy weather. Our table used to stand set for
                        breakfast, with our silver upon it; the key which locked the pantry and the
                        provision closet hung up in the open hall; and yet, no robbery was ever
                        committed. These people were poorer than any conception of poverty which we
                        generally form. They had literally nothing but their hands and the clothes
                        on their backs. The furniture and trinkets, and articles of dress and of
                        ordinary home comfort, which were brought down by the ladies, evidently
                        excited the most longing desire; for they would sometimes beg for them with
                        the simplicity of children; but never, that we know of, was there an article
                        taken."</p>
                    <p>We have our doubts, notwithstanding the evidence of Mrs. Stowe, whether with
                        the freedom of the African race came honor and honesty. We have studied them
                        as a distinct people, before the war, during the war, and after the war.
                        There were honest men and women among them, it is true, but generally
                        speaking, they did not consider theft a crime. There was more innate
                        principle of rectitude among the ignorant and semi-civilized field hands
                        than among the more refined negroes--those who dwelt in cities and hold
                        humble, yet responsible positions. In their state of slavery they would
                        steal when they could; during the war they were cowed by the bayonets that
                        glittered among them, yet they were always foremost when a free plunder took
                        place. Since the war the records of crime will establish their status:--All
                        over the South out of the culprits brought to justice, nine in ten are
                        negroes. Their idea of liberty is disregard for laws made for the protection
                        of honest men--they couple freedom with licentiousness; witness the recent
                        municipal election in Washington, where they not only assailed the police of
                        their own stripe, but attempted to kill some of their own race. Mrs. Stowe's
                        love for the negro still clings to her, and she is now endeavoring to
                        varnish over the imperfections in order that he may maintain his exalted
                        stand above a white Southerner.</p>
                    <p>In regard to industry, faithfulness, and fairness in fulfilling working
                        contracts, she says that "the freed people on a par with the average hands
                        to be hired in the free North--no better and no worse." Shortly after the
                        war there was such difficulty experienced in holding farm hands to their
                        contracts, and, it is generally known that in some cases, the military had
                        to be ordered out to compel the negroes to be faithful to his contract. It
                        is better now--the farmer and laborer seem to understand each other; so many
                        of the latter find that the vision of a farm and a mule, created by the
                        shrewd carpet baggers, was a useless fabric, and they could only live
                        through the aid of muscle.</p>
                    <p>"It is difficult under freedom to govern a plantation of negroes," continues
                        she, "those who have tried it with the most benevolent intentions often find
                        themselves greatly disappointed. The results of generations of barbarism
                        cannot be done away with by a few months of even the most enthusiastic and
                        devoted labor. And in our view, the Southern farmer does a permanent good
                        for himself when he enables some steady, honest, respectable negro to buy
                        land and settle down near him, and become a respectable and self-respecting
                        farmer.</p>
                    <p>This has been tried over and over again; the "honest and respectable" of the
                        race have been invited to purchase small tracts of land and pay for them by
                        semi-yearly or yearly instalments. Some few have had the good reason to
                        accept this offer and put in labor for , but a great majority of the
                        freedmen have preferred to hang about cities and towns and  a
                        precarious livelihood through other means than agriculture. Politics is now
                        their hobby, politically they are arrayed against their best friends--the
                        Southern whites. The success of a few negroes in obtaining office under the
                        Government, has inspired a belief that they all have a claim upon the
                        dominant party, no matter what their merits or capability my amount to. In
                        the State of Virginia, for instance, they cannot be made to believe that the
                        power they now wield through the ballot box is not perpetual. Our most
                        eminent and far seeing orators have endeavored on vein to open their eyes to
                        the fallacy of their dream of everlasting sway over the Caucasian race. They
                        are in full belief that the day is at hand when they, the chosen of God,
                        shall triumph over all other people, and rule their former masters.</p>

<b>"The New Movement"--Col. Baldwin Speaks</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>John T. Harris, a candidate for Congress, writes this article in objection
                    to the recent canvass of Colonel Baldwin of the "New Movement." Baldwin's
                    campaigning for his brother-in-law's election to Congress has led Harris to
                    believe that Baldwin presumes too much about Virginia's voters. Harris calls for
                    the voters to think for themselves and act on their own sentiments, not those of
                    one person. Further, Harris points out many factual errors in Baldwin's
                    argument, most notably, the Colonel's suggestion that Congress would never allow
                    a southerner, much less a former Confederate, to take his seat when duly elected
                    by the people. Harris, who seems to support the Movement's "committee of nine,"
                    withdraws his support when the movement appears to be distilled to the voice of
                    one. This he claims is the work of Kings who force leadership rather than derive
                    their power from the consent of the people.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>
                        Fellow citizens
                    </p>
                    <p> If any thing could be regarded as singular and unheard of these days, it
                        would be the letter of Col. Baldwin to the people of this District, advising
                        them to vote for his brother-in-law Gray, for Congress. First, strange that
                        any man should presume to direct all the voters of the District; second,
                        stranger still that he should overleap the bounds of delicacy and direct
                        them to vote for his brother-in-law. Moreover it is singular the letter is
                        published just in time for the last issue of each paper in the District,
                        thus giving no time for reply before the election. This letter is not less
                        remarkable in its statement of facts. For instance, in the first sentence it
                        says, "I fear they (the Walker party) are about to let the Radicals take
                        control of the District without a struggle." From this, the reader would
                        infer there were Republicans in the field, when the fact is, that on last
                        Friday, they were to have had a Convention at this place to nominate a
                        candidate and not a single delegate from any other county attended and
                        nothing was done. Consequently they have no candidate, and Col. Baldwin
                        knows that, for he says further on, a Wells Radical "may at the last moment
                        be sprung upon us." Again he assumes Mr. Conrad is a candidate in the face of the fact that he is not regularly
                        announced in any paper in the District, and that in answer to a letter
                        requesting him to run and make an active canvass,
                        he answered, saying he would not canvass, but placing his name in the hands
                        of the gentlemen written to, the latter published the correspondence without
                        announcing him, and there the matter ends, except two Winchester papers have
                        his name at their head. I refer to the papers of the District for the truth
                        of this. So Col. Baldwin creates the necessity by
                            making two candidates in order to call upon
                        the people to avoid the dilemma by voting for his "near connection." Again
                        Col. Baldwin announces this to be law. "To elect a man to Congress who by
                        the Constitution and laws of the United States, is prohibited to hold
                        office, State or Federal, would seem to be flying in the face of the
                        national authority. (how deferential all at once
                        to the national authority!) and would give Congress a substantial reason not only to reject our representative but
                        disregard all votes cast for him, and to give place to his Radical
                        opponent." This Col. Baldwin announces to be constitutional law, that if an
                        eligible man receives one hundred votes and his
                        ineligible opponent receives 25,000, the former would be entitled to the seat. For mark--he says it would afford Congress
                            a "substantial reason."  In the discussion of
                        constitutional questions how can a reason be substantial not founded in law? This doctrine is in the face of
                        every decision on the subject. He makes this assertion too, in the face of
                        the fact that a number of Southern men have been elected to Congress since
                        the war with disabilities and admitted to their seats. For instance, P.M.
                        Young, a Confederate General and a Conservative from Georgia was admitted to
                        his seat--and further in the face of this fact, during the last winter Mr.
                        Payne of Wisconsin offered a resolution covering precisely Col. Baldwin's
                        views of the law. To wit: that the eligible candidates should be declared
                        elected and disregarding the votes cast for the candidate under
                        disabilities.--This resolution was referred and never heard of again. No
                        Congress refused to do exactly what Col. Baldwin
                        says they will do. The Col. ought to look at the
                        proceedings of Congress a little before he makes such sweeping assertions.
                        As to his "near connection," and his "capacity to make a good
                        representative," I have nothing to say. I have ceased to notice him.</p>
                    <p> In conclusion, I appeal to the people of the District to vote their
                        sentiments without regard to Col. Baldwin or any body else.--Let him vote
                            his own sentiments, but not undertake to vote
                            yours. Washington issued the first address of warning to the people--Col.
                        Baldwin the second. I will be pardoned for
                        stating that it is the first time of this District that any one man has
                        voluntarily undertaken to influence in behalf of another, a whole district
                        of freemen--all his peers in political rights and privileges. The time was,
                        and is yet, in some countries, when Kings ordered their "near connections"
                        to high places and ordered their subjects at will, but that time thank God
                        has not come to us yet. The fewest number of men ever known to take the old
                        Dominion on their shoulders was "NINE" but it seems now the honors are
                        divided out and ONE is to say who is to go to Congress. If the Colonel had a
                        "committee of nine" on me, the thing would be
                        serious, but when it comes down to a committee of one,  I beg to be excused from regarding it. Col. Baldwin having
                        said, if I were eligible there would be no objection to me, I hope after
                        reading my cards on the subject, the people will concur with him and give me
                        their united support.</p>

                    <p>I am a candidate for Congress and I regret I have not been able to address
                        you in person. I am compelled, therefore, to speak to you through the medium
                        of the press.</p>
                    <p>Some fears have been expressed that I would not be able to take my seat, if
                        elected. In regard to which I beg to say, that there is not a shadow of a
                        doubt on that point. See the copy of the letter just received from the Hon.
                        J.F. Farnsworth, who, in the last Congress, was chair of the Sub-Committee
                        on Reconstruction, and whose duty it was to take applications for the
                        removal of disabilities.</p>
                    <p> "In reply I can state that your name is in the bill which passed the House
                        at the March session and is now pending in the Senate. That your name was in
                        the bill which passed both Houses at the Winter
                        session at the last Congress and only failed to become a law because the
                        Senate amended by adding other names, some of which were objectionable. I
                        have never heard any objection to your relief and have no doubt you will be
                        admitted to a seat in the House, if elected." </p>
                    <p>The bill is now before the Senate and as that body passes all such
                        unanimously, I hope this question is at rest.</p>
                    <p>Questions have been asked if improper conditions are not imposed on persons
                        asking the removal of disabilities. I answer no! and refer to my statement
                        taken down before the Reconstruction Committee and to Judge Sheffey who was
                        present.</p>
                    <p>When I announced myself at the May Court, I said I would vote for the
                        expurgated Constitution--vote against the objectionable clauses and for the
                        Walker ticket. I have not changed my purposes.</p>
                    <p>Silly and false statements have been made about me which my self-respect and
                        my regard for the public taste forbid that I should notice.</p>
                    <p>If elected, fellow citizens, you will find me in the future, as I tried to be
                        in the past, a faithful and industrious representative.</p>
                    <p> Respectfully, <br> John T. Harris </p>

<b>Last Word to the People</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Robert A. Gray, a candidate for Congress representing Augusta County, makes
                    this appeal to the voters of the district: Harris is the wrong man for the job.
                    Not only are his claims of eligibility subject to skepticism, but Gray claims
                    his dealings with the Radical party serve his self interest at the expense of
                    the white Virginians. Clearly Harris is a liar who has virtually admitted
                    pandering to black voters and Radicals. Further, he fails to answer pressing
                    questions leading Gray to conclude that he should not represent the district.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> White men of the District, which is to represent your interests, Gray or
                        Harris? Gray is fighting all along the line as the Conservative Walker
                        ticket white man's candidate. Harris is fighting for you by private
                        interviews with Wells and secret interviews after
                        night with the leaders of the radical leagues, which he will not deny.--Gray
                        is without disabilities and can get into Congress as your representative if
                        elected. Harris says he can get in. If he can, it is because he is under
                        pledge to the radical members, and that fact can be proven. On an important
                        question between the Radicals and Conservatives, Gray would incline to the
                        Conservatives; Harris with the Radicals if they let him in. Harris charged
                        the Southern man in his troubles and financial embarrassment five hundred
                        dollars to assist him in his pardon. Gray did the same work for the Southern
                        man and charged him nothing, not even his
                        personal expenses. Harris electioneers privately with the negro for his
                        vote; he won't deny it; Gray declines the vote of the Wells negro. Harris
                        reads publicly a communication, saying it is from General Jubal A. Early,
                        --numbers have heard it,--insulting to the Walker ticket generally, and to
                        John F. Lewis and R.A. Gray in particular; and afterwards, when the letter
                        is demanded, he admits that the name of Early was added by himself, and a
                        mere surmise. Was not this undoubtedly a lie to
                        the people, willful, deliberate and malicious, only used for selfish ends?
                        Is not the truth knowingly suppressed a lie? Is not Harris in the interest
                        of the Radicals? Do the gallant white men of the district want such a man
                        for their representative?--Which, gentlemen,--honor bright,--which for you?
                        Gray who answers everything right up to the mark, or Harris who answers
                        nothing; who prefers leaving you in the darkness and a fog, in stirring,
                        troublesome times as these? Consult you best judgment, and let that direct
                        your suffrage.</p>
                    <p> Respectfully, <br> Robert A. Gray. <br> Harrisonburg, Va. June 15, 1869.
