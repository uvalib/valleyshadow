<b>Carpet-baggers</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Since the recent election, the carpetbagger, the notorious seeker of money
                    and office, has all but disappeared. The author rejoices in the carpetbaggers
                    demise and writes this article for the sake of the education of future
                    generations. The author traces the carpetbagger to his Puritan ancestors
                    suggesting that they had been taught from an early age to pursue self-interest,
                    no matter the cost. Further, he illustrates how carpetbaggers had duped black
                    Virginians into believing that their former masters were now the enemy.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The genus carpet-bagger is becoming rare in this section of the South since
                        the election, and lest the characteristics of the tribe should be lost to
                        history, we will essay to delineate them for the instruction, if not the
                        benefit of the future. The genuine carpet-bagger is a descendant in a direct
                        line from the Pilgrim Fathers, who were the original progenitors of the
                        migratory tribe. The wandering gypsies who have infested Europe since the
                        days of the Gauls, differ in many respects from the Yankee carpet-bagger.
                        The former claim no house and may be said to be cosmopolites, free to go
                        where and do as they please. The Yankee is an adventurer, avoiding the wild
                        forests and lonely places to  settle, for the
                        time being, among the masses, make money and instill into the minds of the
                        unenlightened the particular notions of his people. The almighty dollar is
                        always before him, and his motto is "make money, honestly if you can, but
                        make it at all events." Speculation is his great object--his home and home
                        associations are nothing to him, for in youth he had been taught that to
                        become great was to become rich; meanness and deceit were imbibed from the
                        maternal breast, and what the liberal world considers unprincipled he was
                        taught by his Puritan father to consider honorable. The termination of the
                        war, so humiliating to the chivalric Southerner, opened a wide field to the
                        speculative mind of the restless carpet-bagger. He thought he could make
                        capital out of her misery--he saw a willing tool in the untutored negro
                        placed suddenly upon a footing with his late master. With the little of
                        worldly goods his niggardly father had granted him packed in a small bag, he
                        goes into the land of promise, for he cares but little for the place of his
                        birth, and, with a silvery tongue and "nary red" in his pocket, he harangues
                        the gaping and thick-lipped crowd, tells them of their newly-acquired
                        rights, their power at the polls, their claims to offices of emolument, the
                        wrongs inflicted upon them by the disfranchised white rebels, and the duty
                        they owe themselves and children to cut the throats of all their former
                        persecutors and burn their houses to the ground. He stands firmly upon the
                        platform that advises eternal hatred to the white "rebel," and elevation of
                        the African race. The nasal twang of his ancestors may be heard in his
                        speeches at Loyal Leagues flattering and cajoling his colored brethren and
                        making them believe that he is an angel sent from Heaven announcing the
                        millennium! Alas, alas--that his glorious aspirations should be so
                        short-lived,--that all his visions of fat offices and money in both pockets
                        should so soon pass away. The carpet-bagger, in Virginia, is no more.
                        "Othello's occupation's gone." </p>
