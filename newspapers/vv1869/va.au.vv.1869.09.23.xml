                <transcript>
                    <p> We perceive that some of our contemporaries, and especially the Richmond
                            <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph> are earnestly pressing the election
                        of U.S. Senators, by the Legislature of Virginia, at the session which will
                        commence on the 5th of October. </p>
                    <p> We must confess that we were surprised when we found these intelligent
                        journals taking this position, because, according to our reading and
                        recollection of the opinion of Attorney General Hoar, the Legislature
                        cannot, under the reconstruction laws, do any act which is not expressly
                        authorized by those laws. The only thing which, by those laws, they are
                        authorized to do, is to organize, and vote on the fifteenth amendment.--When
                        they have done this, they are <emph rend="italic">functus officio,</emph>
                        until after Congress shall have approved the Constitution. This was our
                        impression, but in deference to the views of our contemporaries, we have
                        taken the pains to refer again to the opinion of Attorney General Hoar.
                        After disposing of the test-oath, he proceeds as follows: </p>
                    <p>"But, on the other hand, I fully concur with the view of the General
                        commanding in Virginia, that under the reconstruction acts of Congress no
                        officer or legislator is competent or should be permitted to exercise any of
                        the functions or powers of his office within that State, except so far as
                        those acts themselves provide, without taking the oath which is referred to
                        in the statute of 1867, above quoted. The act of April 10, 1869, requires
                        the Legislature to meet at a time which it designates. That it is to meet
                        implies that it is to come together for some purpose. It is required under
                        the previous law to act upon the question of adopting the fourteenth
                        amendment to the Constitution of the United States before the admission of
                        the State to representation in Congress. I am of opinion, therefore, that it
                        may come together, organize, and act upon the amendment, but that until
                        Congress shall have approved the Constitution and the action under it, and
                        shall have restored the State to its proper place in the Union by
                        recognizing its form of government as republican, and admitting it to
                        representation, the Legislature is not entitled, and could not without
                        violation of law, be allowed to transact any business, pass any act or
                        resolve, or undertake to assume any other function of a Legislature, if the
                        test oath has not been required of its members; and that no officer ejected
                        under the new Constitution can enter upon the duties of his office, without
                        taking the oath, while military government continues.</p>
                    <p> Very respectfully, <lb/> E.R. Hoar, <lb/> Attorney General. </p>
                    <p> How our friends can get around the language of this opinion, we do not
                        understand. It seems to us as plain as day, that under that opinion, any
                        attempt to do any thing else than to vote on the 15th amendment (which the
                        Legislature is expressly authorized to do), would be sheer usurpation. "The
                        Legislature is not entitled, and could not, without violation of law, be
                        allowed to <emph rend="italic"> transact any business, pass any act or
                            resolve, or undertake to assume any other function of a
                        Legislature,</emph> if the test oath has not been required of its members."
                        Can words be plainer? Is not the election of senators one of the highest
                        Legislative duties? Can it be supposed that Congress intended to allow the
                        Legislature to perform an act of this character when it was not competent to
                        do any other Legislative act, even of a local character? The election of
                        Senators affects <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the States, local
                        Legislation affects only <emph rend="italic">Virginia.</emph> Is it
                        reasonable to suppose, that Congress would authorize a <emph rend="italic"
                            >distrusted,</emph> quasi rebel legislature to perform such an important
                        national function as the election of Senators, when it would not trust them
                        to pass a road law or a tax bill? We think not. We are, therefore, clearly
                        and decidedly of opinion that the Legislature has no authority whatever, to
                        elect Senators, or perform any other legislative act until after Congress
                        shall have approved the constitution, and restored Virginia to her rights in
                        the Union. We trust, then, that our Legislature will not consent to engage
                        in any hazardous experiments. Let's "stick" to the line of duty marked out
                        for us by Hoar's opinion, instead of embarking on a wide and stormy sea of
                        political and party excitement. By adhering to the course indicated by the
                        Attorney General we will give offense to nobody. By an opposite course we
                        may encounter perils and difficulties, the nature of which no one can
                        foresee. </p>

                <summary>This article questions the logic of anyone who supports the election of
                    Senators by the State Legislature. Reconstruction laws heavily restrain the
                    Legislature, forbidding it to act as a legislative body. Thus, the paper
                    suggests that since the Legislature cannot act locally, it should not elect
                    senators. The Legislature should not act at all, until of course, Virginia is
                    restored to its rightful place in the Union.</summary>

                <head>The Farmer vs. Fair</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>It will not be deemed misappropriate at this particular juncture, when the
                        public mind is so much directed to Agriculture and its products, to offer
                        some reflections in regard to the approaching Fair and the advantages the
                        Farmer enjoys in comparison with other pursuits. After the contentions and
                        turmoils of political life, and the exhausting labors of Legislative halls,
                        we find the Statesman and the politician seeking repose and retirement on
                        the farm. The advantages, the beauties and the pleasures of this glorious
                        life have been poetized time and again by our sweetest bards. After the
                        uncertainties and toils of a Merchant's life have worn down his energy and
                        health, he desires with a longing hope to spend the remnant of his days in
                        the peaceful pursuits of agriculture. Professional men, too, fondly indulge
                        in the same expectation, after the flower of their youth and the mature
                        energies of their manhood have been consumed by the harassing cares and
                        grave responsibilities of their calling. The Editor, also, ardently
                        cherishes the hope of seeking repose and contentment in the quite pursuits
                        of agriculture after the rough contests he has had with his fellow man, the
                        rivalries and the jealousies peculiar to his occupation.</p>
                    <p>Are we hazarding too much when we say that all, or nearly all, who have tried
                        the experiment, have fully realized the full fruition of their hopes?</p>
                    <p>Every profession and pursuit has its cares and annoyances, for we are told
                        that man must live by the sweat of his face, and agriculture is not free
                        from them; but we speak by comparison when we say that agriculture combines
                        more positive pleasures with fewer annoyances, than any other pursuit or
                        calling we are acquainted with.</p>
                    <p>The reasons why this is so are plain, and may briefly be stated thus: In the
                        first place it is the most independent of all other pursuits; and in the
                        next place it is the most healthful. And thirdly, it is the most
                        remunerative of any other employment.</p>
                    <p>It is the most independent because the farmer, unlike the politician and
                        merchant and professional man, is not compelled to have daily intercourse
                        with men, and to exercise all prudence and forbearance, to pander to the
                        prejudices of this one and the conceits of that one, and to bear with all
                        the ill-temper and presumptions of those with whom they have to deal. It is
                        the most healthful, because the farmer has only physical labor to perform,
                        while other professions have mental labor, which is exhausting and
                        harassing.</p>
                    <p>Having said this much in regard to the Farmer and his pursuits, we will close
                        by briefly alluding to the Fair, which has been instituted for his benefit
                        more than any other. All persons are more or less interested in its success,
                        but the farmer is peculiarly so, and it is incumbent on him to contribute
                        everything in his power to make it a success. No little amount of money has
                        been expended and much taste displayed in beautifying and ornamenting the
                        Fair grounds, and he above all others should exert all his energies to
                        render the Fair an honor to old Augusta.</p>

                <summary>The author of this article considers the work of the farmer to be far more
                    virtuous, healthful, mind easing, and beneficial than any other occupation.
                    Comparing the work of the farmer to that of the politician, merchant, editor and
                    professional, this piece points out that many of the problems suffered by those
                    in the latter occupations are not applicable to farm life. With agriculture so
                    important to economic prosperity, it is a wonder that more people do not enter
                    into the farming vocation. Finally, the author points out that the oncoming fair
                    will be successful through the help of all the energies the local farmers have
                    to offer.</summary>
