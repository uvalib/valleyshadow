<b>The Conservative Convention</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper announces plans to endorse any candidates nominated at the
                    Conservative Convention meeting in Richmond. "We cannot have it all our own way,
                    but we can defeat the ebony and chocolate candidates, and shout over the triumph
                    of a white man's ticket."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>To Writers</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors of the Valley Virginian announce a desire to include more local
                    and domestic news in an attempt to separate it from its competitors. "There are
                    three journals published in Staunton, all of them aiming at the same object.
                    Politically, their features are the same."<br>

<b>White Majority in the State</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article explains that the white majority of Virginia voters can
                    prevent negro rule by simply acting. The author suggests that all those who do
                    nothing are a disgrace and will have to face the consequences of the Underwood
                    Constitution, should it pass because of lack of action.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The Norfolk Journal puts down the white majority
                        of Virginia at 53,000, that is, if all will enroll themselves that can
                        register, and, if after doing so, push to the polls. It says: "Our fossil
                        friends can't deny that they are to be justly charged with preventing
                        thousands of people from enrolling themselves, on account of their lack of
                        action and lukewarmness." </p>
                    <p>If every white man who is entitled to a vote would think of the shame and
                        disgrace he will entail upon his children by neglecting to bestir himself
                        and bring up new recruits to prevent the adoption of the Underwood
                        Constitution, we would be able, at least, to so modify that black scroll as
                        to make it bearable.</p>
                    <p> If the whites, with a majority of 53,000 will allow the negroes to tide over
                        them, we exclaim with the Journal, they deserve
                        their fate.</p>

<b>Immorality in High Places</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper declares that widespread immorality pervades the Federal
                    Government. The women employed in the Treasury Department and other branches of
                    government in particular are, in the opinion of the paper, "loose characters"
                    many of whom are "paramours and mistresses of members of Congress."<br>

<b>A Nuisance</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper complains that Staunton is "full of vagrant negroes; they hang
                    around the corners of streets and blockade the pavement much to the annoyance of
                    the passengers--ladies particularly. Can not some of our police throw a

                    Hall instead. "We make no comment--but we cannot help thinking that we have been

                    feet."<br>(Names in announcement: Rev.  Kramer)</blockquote>
