<b>The Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Account of the reception in Baltimore of the delegation lobbying for a
                    $1,000,000 subscription to the Valley Railroad. The article includes addresses
                    of Col. Bolivar Christian and Col. M. G. Harman extolling the benefits that the
                    road would bring to Baltimore and the Valley.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Alexander Cochran, announcing his candidacy for a seat in the Virginia
                    House of Delegates, promises, if elected, to rid Virginia of the vile
                    carpetbaggers and once again place Virginia under the control of Virginians. He
                    insists that carpetbaggers come from the North simply to plunder and divide
                    black and white Virginians. Yet, in order for Cochran's plan to work, all
                    Virginians must put aside past differences and unite for the sake of the state.
                    If all eligible voters register and vote for Cochran, peace and prosperity will
                    be restored.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>
                        Fellow citizens of the County of Augusta,
                    </p>
                    <p>In obedience to the wishes of many friends residing in the various portions
                        of the County, expressed both publicly and privately, I announce myself a
                        candidate for a seat in the next House of Delegates of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>If it should be the pleasure of the people to elect me to the position, I
                        shall, irrespective of party considerations, work and vote to obtain the
                        passage of such laws as will, in my judgment, secure the greatest amount of
                        peace, prosperity and happiness to the people at large.</p>
                    <p>In the approaching election, soon to be held, I shall most unhesitatingly
                        vote for the expurgated constitution and for what is known as the Walker
                        ticket; believing the adoption of this course by the people is the only door
                        of escape from the ultimate imposition upon them of an odious, tyrannical
                        and unbearable government: And although the result of this line of conduct,
                        in any event, is not as we would like to have it, yet I am firmly persuaded
                        that in our subjugated, hopeless condition, the exigency of the hour, makes
                        it a high and patriotic duty to yield to the demands of inexorable
                        necessity, accept the situation, and reconstruct the State upon the basis of
                        the expurgated Constitution and the election of such men as are opposed to
                        disfranchisement and test oaths, and who are identified with us in interest
                        and sympathy.</p>
                    <p>The result, which is the best we can hope for, can certainly be achieved if
                        all will register and vote--Virginia, if her sons are true to her, can be
                        placed under the control of Virginians, and the miserable carpet-bag scum
                        and vultures of the north, who have come down among us to array one race
                        against the other, in order that they may more easily prey upon the
                        substance and vitals of our helpless and prostrate people, can be sent back,
                        howling, to their old haunts of vice and depravity.</p>
                    <p>These salutary results will only be attained, however, as a distinguished
                        countryman said, in the late Conservative Convention, by united effort,
                        induced by mutual conciliation and forbearance one towards another.</p>
                    <p>Let us then obliterate from our minds all past political differences, leaving
                        the dead past to bury its dead, and unite in one great band of friends and
                        brothers, "among whom no contention shall exist, but that noble contention,
                        or rather emulation of who can best work and best agree" in saving Virginia
                        from degradation and ruin.</p>
                    <p>My devotion to Virginia has always been great, but since dark, heavy clouds
                        have lowered over her and broken with remorseless fury upon her devoted
                        head, I have drawn her closer and closer to my heart, until her destiny and
                        mine have become inseparably locked up together, and should it be the will
                        of the people to make me an humble instrument to aid in restoring her to
                        peace and prosperity, I shall ever be grateful for the confidence reposed.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully, <br> Alexander B. Cochran. </p>
                <br>
