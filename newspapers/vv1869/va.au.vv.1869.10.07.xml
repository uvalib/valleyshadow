                    <p>This body assembled on Tuesday. Until the recent supplementary opinion on
                        Attorney-General Hoar was promulgated, the universal impression seemed to be
                        that the General Assembly would meet, organize, pass the 15th amendment and
                        adjourn.</p>
                    <p>This programme, however, did not suit some of our restless spirits, and by
                        constant agitation, they have managed to draw a second opinion from
                        Attorney-General Whore--we beg your pardon--Hoar! and now the matter seems
                        to be somewhat complicated.</p>
                    <p>The first idea of some of our politicians was, that we must elect a certain
                        General Williams to the Senate of the U.S. to show our gratitude to Gen
                        Grant! Presently it turned out that Gen Grant did not want General Williams
                        elected, but did want his brother-in-law Dr. Sharp chosen! This somewhat
                        disconcerted the advocates of "gratitude to Gen. Grant." They found that
                        Gen. Grant's wishes and their's ran in different channels. Their's led to
                        the election of Mrs. Douglas' husband--while Gen Grant's gravitated towards
                        a member of his own family. This put the "grateful" men in a quandary, and
                        how it will come out, we can't say.</p>
                    <p>We fear our restless friends have got us into a difficulty from which we will
                        not find it easy to free ourselves.</p>
                    <p> Our true policy is, to offend nobody--but, as far as we can see, to
                        conciliate all. By pleasing the President we may displease <emph
                            rend="italic">Congress,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Congress</emph>
                        is the body to which we must look for relief. We should recollect how
                        jealous Congress showed itself of Executive interference, in Mr. Johnson's
                        time, and we should profit by that lesson. </p>
                    <p>We think our Legislature should proceed cautiously, and be sure it is
                        treading on solid ground. If it acts hastily, it may find itself in quick
                        sand.</p>
                    <p>It seems to us, the wisest course would be for the Legislature to adopt a
                        resolution reciting that whereas there are so many doubts and difficulties
                        surrounding the Senatorial question, and whereas they earnestly desire to
                        make their action conform to the wishes of Congress, therefore be it
                        resolved that all action on that subject be postponed, until Congress shall
                        have the opportunity of expressing its views and wishes in regard to the
                        powers and duties of the General Assembly.</p>
                    <p>In this way we will give no offence to any body. We will exhibit every
                        disposition to satisfy Congress and the Executive. And if, at a future day,
                        Congress shall indicate its wish for an election of Senators, the
                        Legislature can make it. It would be as easy to elect Gen. Williams, or Mr.
                        Sharp, or Mr. any body else, then, as now.</p>
                    <p>By adopting this policy, we would know what we were about. We would not be
                        acting in the dark, and butting our heads against either a Congressional or
                        Executive post.--Better see the whole field in the clear light of day, than
                        go thundering along in the thick fog that now envelopes us.</p>

                <summary>This article illustrates the complications involved with the Senatorial
                    question recently discussed at a meeting of the Legislature. "Restless friends"
                    have put forward a name with the hopes of pleasing General (President) Grant.
                    The author suggests that these "friends" have acted in haste and run the risk of
                    offending Congress. The author suggests that all action regarding the Senatorial
                    question be postponed until Congress has expressed its wishes in regard to the
                    various powers of the General Assembly.</summary>

                    <p>We fully concur with the correspondent of the Bay Shore in the following:</p>
                    <p>We have men among us to the manor born, reared upon the soil of Virginia,
                        involved in and devoted to her every interest, both State and National, and
                        have not their equal for learning, for purity and honesty of purpose and
                        every acquirement which should adorn a Virginia Senator, and first in the
                        long line of greatness stands the name of A.H.H. Stuart, of Augusta, whose
                        experience and able services in the Cabinet and legislation, both federal
                        and State, whose intellectual acquirements, refined and accomplished
                        bearing, his enlarged statesmanship and his whole political national record
                        stamp him as the should be first Senator from reconstructed Virginia.
                        President Grant and Congress will be well pleased with him, and remove any
                        and all his disabilities under which he may labor by virtue of the
                        Fourteenth Amendment, admit him to his seat, and thus secure honorable and
                        distinguished representation to Virginia in the person of her most "gifted
                        statesman."</p>

                <summary>The editors of the Virginian concur with their colleague who lauds the
                    character of A.H.H. Stuart, and recommends him for Senator. Similar to other
                    articles, Stuart is praised for his experience and dedication to the State, both
                    in local and national interests. Further, the author suggests that Grant and
                    Congress will approve of his election to the Senate.</summary>
