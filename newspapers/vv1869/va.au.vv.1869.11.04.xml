                <transcript>
                    <p>In our issue of last week, we expressed our pleasure at the proposition to
                        make a new, short, and well-graded road from Staunton to Barterbrook. We
                        regard this as one of many valuable improvements that ought to be made by
                        our county. Nothing tends more to stimulate production, to promote trade, to
                        advance general prosperity than good roads. We have no special interests in
                        the Barterbrook road, nor indeed in any particular road. Our motive is, to
                        promote the general welfare. We look on the Barterbrook road, as a sort of
                        pioneer enterprise, and we hope to see many, of a similar character,
                        undertaken, at an early day.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the wisest thing our people could do, would be, to enter on a
                        general revision of our whole system of roads. Very few of them are properly
                        located, and most of them are impassable during the winter and spring. The
                        location of a road is properly the work of a scientific engineer, and yet it
                        is generally entrusted to men of limited scientific attainments. Hence the
                        insurmountable blunders that have been committed. A county like Augusta,
                        ought to have a competent engineer to examine and report on all the leading
                        roads of the county, suggesting the alterations in location, which the
                        public interests require, and the best means of making them. The first step
                        in the process is, to ascertain what location is the best for the public
                        convenience, and then, from time to time, to put the roads on such
                        locations.--Then the people would know what to depend on, and all the work
                        done, and money expended in making the roads, would be for a permanent
                        benefit.</p>
                    <p>After it shall have been ascertained, by a comprehensive survey and report,
                        what roads are necessary, and what locations are best to accommodate all
                        sections, a legislative effort should be made to construct them--of course
                        every thing could not be done at once, but all that is done, should be done,
                        with reference to, and in part execution of the general plan. Let a system
                        be agreed on, which will give a convenient outlet to all the important
                        points in the country, (with internal roads leading into them), and then let
                        a persistent effort be made to do something every year, on each one of them.
                        When such a system is once commenced, and people begin to understand that
                        they are not frittering away their means on roads which are liable to be
                        changed at any term of the Court, they will work with a will. Farmers will
                        understand that these roads are for their benefit, and a spirit of emulation
                        will spring up among them.--After the locations are definitely settled, what
                        would contribute more to the public convenience than to McAdamise these
                        roads, commencing at Staunton, and making, say two or three miles each year,
                        on each road? By this process, in seven years, good solid roads could be
                        extended to every important point in the county. The local roads would
                        connect, at suitable points, with these main routes, and thus a convenient
                        system of inter-communication, would be established, throughout the county.
                        Every man, by traveling a few miles, on one of these common roads, would be
                        able to reach one of these great thoroughfares. The nearer the town, the
                        better the roads should be, because more people would travel over them. The
                        advantages of such a system of roads, in an agricultural, commercial, and
                        social point of view, can hardly be over-estimated. Every farmer could haul
                        a much larger quantity of produce over a good road than over a bad one, and
                        he could haul at seasons when his teams would otherwise be idle. The
                        merchants would profit by the increased volume of trade into the town. And
                        neighbour could visit neighbour, or come to town, and bring his wife and
                        daughters, when the roads would otherwise be impassable. On Sundays too, our
                        pious citizens could go, with their families, to church, instead of being
                        confined to their homesteads. All these advantages can be secured by a
                        comparatively small outlay. The main thing is, to operate with proper
                        system, and to do thoroughly what we undertake. There is no necessity for
                        burthensome taxation. Ten thousand dollars a year, would amount to only
                        about 30 cents per head for the entire population of the county. In our
                        opinion the county could expend double this amount annually for ten years,
                        without feeling it. At the end of seven or ten years, we would have an
                        admirable system of roads, which would be kept in order for a trifle, and
                        thereafter, through all time, the people would be, in a great measure,
                        relieved from taxation on this account. Can any man doubt that if such a
                        system of roads were finished, the enhanced value of lands in the county
                        would pay the cost tenfold?</p>
                    <p>In this connection, we would call the attention of the county authorities, to
                        a stone-breaking machine which has been invented and which we learn, is now
                        being successfully used. We do not feel competent to express an opinion on
                        the merits of this machine. But a committee of the Court could soon, by
                        actual experiment, test its capacities. If it fulfills half that its
                        inventors and manufacturers promise, it would be of great value to the
                        county, and materially expedite and cheapen the construction of the roads.</p>
                    <p>These considerations address themselves to the people of every portion of the
                        county.--But we think the citizens of Staunton especially, ought to bestir
                        themselves to have the plan carried into effect. It would unquestionably
                        give a new and vigorous impulse to the trade and business of the town, and
                        thereby augment its population and prosperity.</p>
                    <p> We hear a great deal about the construction of a new Railroad line with a
                        view to give more convenient access to the market. This is all very well in
                        its place. But we believe the system of good county roads extending to all
                        the important points of the county, would do more to promote the general
                        prosperity than any single railroad. We now have a railroad which gives us
                        an outlet at all seasons. The difficulty under which a large portion of our
                        people labor is, their inability, during the Winter and Spring, <emph
                            rend="italic">to get to the railroad.</emph></p>
                    <p>We earnestly beg the citizens of Augusta to give these suggestions careful
                        consideration. Every dollar spent on our roads will be seed sown in good
                        ground.</p>

                <summary>This article focuses on the benefits of new roads to the citizens of
                    Augusta county. First, the author enumerated the many different ways in which
                    these roads could be useful to the population, including bringing produce to
                    market and getting to church on Sunday. Second, he illustrates that there will
                    be no significant tax increase to pay for the road's construction. There are
                    several new inventions that could be put to use building the roads, such as a
                    stone-breaking machine. Finally, while the author underscores the importance of
                    rail lines, he suggests that roads are even more important, especially in
                    everyday usage.</summary>
