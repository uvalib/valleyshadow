<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Rockingham Register says that we did injustice
                        to the Provost Guard of Harrisonburg in stating several weeks since, that
                        "some persons mistaking the Harrisonburg Provost Guard for the Augusta Home
                        Guard erroneously stated that a portion of the Home Guard ingloriously fled
                        on the near approach of the enemy." We are pleased to hear that the
                        Harrisonburg provost Guard did not run, for then we are satisfied that no
                        running was done except by the Yankees. Our statement was made under the
                        following circumstances: Whilst in Rockingham we heard some of the citizens
                        of that county charging that some of the Home Guard ingloriously fled on the
                        near approach of the enemy. A portion of the Home guard and the Provost
                        Guard of Harisonburg [sic] were the only parties present on the occasion
                        spoken of by those citizens. </p>
                    <p>Upon inquiry, we learned, that the Home Guard did not run as reported, and as the Provost Guard of Harrisonburg was
                        the only other body of troops present, we supposed that those persons
                        claiming to be eye-witnesses of the scene who made the charge mistook the
                        Home Guard for the Provost Guard. This is the "head and front of our
                        offending." It would now seem that these persons were altogether mistaken,
                        and that in fact there was no running done save by the Yankees. May this
                        always be the case, and may the citizens of Rockingham always be willing to
                        stand by the noble sons of "Old Augusta." </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Marietta (Geo.) Rebel says that from the tenor
                        of our articles heretofore, our readers will understand that we are
                        necessarily opposed to the enactment of the law reported by the military
                        committee of the Senate, providing for the levy en masse of our male
                        population. The law provides than [sic] every able-bodied man shall be put
                        in the army, and that there shall be no exemptions, except such as the
                        Secretary of War and the President see proper to make. The passage of this
                        law would constitute the most extraordinary transfer of power, from the
                        legislature to the Executive, ever known under a Republican system of
                        government. It would create a condition of things without a parallel in any
                        species of government, except that of an unmixed despotism. It will place
                        every man in the Confederacy under absolute military authority, and
                        substitute military rule for civil law at once. </p>
                    <p>We cannot for a single moment tolerate the idea of the necessity for any such
                        law. Its effect will certainly be pernicious at home, and unwholesome
                        abroad. It will produce great dissatisfaction among our own people, and fix
                        upon outside nations the conclusion that we are reduced to desperate
                        extremities. Confidence in our ability to work out our independence, will be
                        seriously impaired, if not totally destroyed, when it is seen that we are
                        driven to the adoption of such an unprecedented measure as the absorption of
                        the entire male population into the army. The world will ask, as our own
                        people will also ask, how is the army and the nation to be sustained, how
                        fed and clothed, if the men are all to be withdrawn from the pursuits of
                        agriculture, and the mechanic arts?</p>
                    <p>If we were reduced to such a strait that it was absolutely necessary to make
                        one last desperate stand against the foe, to inflict all the damage we could
                        upon him, and then fall and leave the nation to expire, there would be
                        philosophy and heroism in the resolution, for it is better to "die all
                        freemen, than to live all slaves," but we are not yet driven to any such
                        desperate resort. Our armies still face the foe, and hold him in check. Our
                        gallant boys are full of spirit, and if properly cared for, well fed and
                        clothed, are able to hold the portals of the Republic against all comers.
                        Our present troubles have grown out of bad management with the men in the
                        field, and not for any want of men. Our soldiers have been badly fed, and
                        worse clothed. There has been too much straggling of both officers and men
                        permitted. There are too many soldiers scattered through the country
                        guarding the doors of Provost Marshals' offices, and too much incompetency
                        in the commanders. Make our present army efficient, and there will be
                        nothing to fear.</p>
                    <p>But, if the whole population is dragged into the army, where are the supplies
                        for the army, and bread and meat for women and children to come from? We
                        have found it difficult to provision and clothe the army and the people
                        heretofore, and how much more difficult, indeed, how impossible will it be,
                        when the laborers are all withdrawn from their avocations--when the
                        producers are all turned into consumers?</p>
                    <p>We have endeavored to consider the proposed law, without prejudice or
                        excitement, but have failed to find in it one redeeming feature. It is
                        either the profoundest folly or a most dangerous and wanton assault upon the
                        public liberty, and we cannot believe, that after due deliberation, the
                        Congress will be found so wanting in statesmanship, and so false to the
                        public interests, as to enact it into a law.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have seldom seen, says the Richmond Dispatch,
                        more universal concurrence in the press of the country upon any subject than
                        there is in its opposition to the desperate expedient of a levy en masse of the population of the Confederacy. It
                        is a confession of weakness not warranted by the circumstances of the case,
                        calculated to create distrust in the minds of our own people of the extent
                        of our resources, and has already given new encouragement to the hopes of
                        our enemies. To put boys of sixteen to eighteen in the army is to destroy
                        the "seed corn" of the population, as President Davis aptly characterized
                        it; and to force men over the age of forty-five into the ranks is to furnish
                        food for disease and death, and to crowd the hospitals and graveyards
                        without adding appreciably to the strength of the army. Prussia, when
                        beleaguered by the most colossal military power on the earth, never called
                        men of that age from their homes. At their homes they are good for
                        something. There, they, and the unmature striplings whom a cruel radicalism
                        would devote to the perils of battle, may provide food for an army which is
                        already pressing strongly on the means of subsistence, and under State
                        organization render the only military service of which they are capable, the
                        defence of the soil against raids of the enemy. Bring back the stragglers
                        and the absentees, place negroes in the place of white teamsters, nurses,
                        &amp;c., and we shall have as large an army as the people can feed. What
                        we need is skill and produce in the development and husbanding of our
                        resources, rather than an increase of numbers. Look at the shameful manner
                        in which Confederate property has been squandered and the negligence and
                        blunders by which so many of our men have fallen into the hands of the
                        enemy. These are the evils which must be remedied, and, as long as they
                        continue, no increase of our strength will be of any permanent value. It
                        will be like a new inheritance to a spendthrift, who will run through it
                        just as rapidly as his former possessions. What we want to see in Congress
                        is coolness, combined with energy, and in the army, vigilance and
                        discipline, united with courage. </p>

                    <p>Mr. Editor: As gigantic efforts will be made next spring by the enemy to
                        subjugate us, I ask the attention of the proper authorities, if their
                        attention should not be turned [to] deserters, who are skulking about their
                        homes since last summer; and harbored by their friends.</p>
                    <p>A CITIZEN.</p>
