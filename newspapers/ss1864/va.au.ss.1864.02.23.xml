                    country. Your representatives have responded. You have been eager; they have
                    been deliberate--more so than you thought proper. But they have done their best
                    to meet your wishes. You have demanded to be taxed and taxed heavily. . . . Will
                    you obey the laws made at your request and obey them cheerfully, or will you
                    begin to find fault and evade them?"</excerpt>
