<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"In these times we hear some strange sentiments uttered. Some seem
                    disposed to dispense with the chart furnished by our wise fathers, and to
                    entrust, in the storm of revolution, the ark of our liberty to the waves without
                    any thing to enable them to direct its course to prevent it from being engulphed
                    in the Charybdis of despotism. "The price of liberty is eternal vigilance." and,
                    in times of revolution and trial, the friends of liberty are called upon to
                    exercise increased vigilance. We were surprised to find the following sentence

                    <p></p>
                    <p>"Habeas corpus is the criminal's writ; good men have very little use for it,
                        and can dispense with it altogether by obeying the laws, and devoting their
                        whole time and energy to the defence of their country."</p>
                    <p>Was the Constitution of Virginia adopted for the special
                            protection of criminals?" Did the framers of that instrument
                        consider "Habeas Corpus as the criminal's writ?
                        The first sentence of the fifteenth section of the 50th article of the
                        Constitution of Virginia reads as follows: </p>
                    <p>"The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus hall not, in
                            any case, be suspended." v</p>
                    <p>Is the constitution of Virginia to be trampled in the dust? Shall the
                        Juggernaut of military power crush beneath its ponderous wheels all
                        individual and personal rights?</p>
                    <p>The 13th section of the "Virginia Bill of rights" says, "that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to
                            and governed by the civil power."</p>
                    <p>We have been under the impresion [sic] that we have been expending our
                        treasure and spilling the life's blood of thousands of our best citizens to
                        preserve the inestimable boon of liberty, and have been so unsophisticated
                        as to believe that the way to preserve the liberties of all is to preserve
                        intact the right of each individual. There can be no liberty for the country
                        when individual personal rights are disregarded and trampled in the dust.
                        Our motto is "Liberty and Independence," and not simply independence; for
                        independence without liberty is not worth the price we are paying.</p>

<b>An Important Question</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>States that the recent ban on distilling whiskey in Virginia has raised
                    questions about the relationship of state and national authority in the
                    Confederacy.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>By the recent legislation of Virginia all distillation of Whiskey, upon any
                        pretext whatever, is forbidden in the Commonwealth. The law expressly
                        provides that no whiskey shall be distilled, in fulfilment [sic] of any
                        contract with the Confederate States.</p>
                    <p>It furthermore makes it the duty of the Judge of the circuit, when he shall
                        be informed of any violation of the law, to call a special term of his court
                        and to empannel [sic] a special grand jury to investigate the matter.</p>
                    <p>At the last form of the county court, measures were taken to inform the Judge
                        of this circuit of a violation of the law in this county, and we learn he
                        has called a special term of his court for the 2nd of Feb. to investigate
                        the case.</p>
                    <p>If this be the case, it will present a very important question in regard to
                        the relative powers of the State and Confederate authorities. It will bring
                        up the question of State sovereignty. We will then learn whether the
                        Commonwealth of Virginia has a right to regulate her own domestic police, or
                        whether she is, according to Mr. Seward's notion, a mere municipal
                        corporation subject to the paramount authority of the Confederate
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The theory of our system is, that the States are the principals and the
                        Confederate Government their agency. Is the agent subordinate to, or does it
                        over-ride, the principals?</p>

                        the Commonwealth, to be laid up among her treasures, the tattered remnant of
                        a flag, which was during last year, presented to the 52d Virginia Infantry,
                        by his Excellency, the Governor. It has floated over the Regiment on the
                        fields of Cedar Run, 2d Manassas, Sharpsburg, 1st Fredericksburg, 2nd
                        Fredericksburg, and Gettysburg. Under its folds many a brave son of Virginia
                        has fallen in maintenance of the Confederate cause, and, on the bloody field
                        of Sharpsburg "the last enemy, Death," arrested it from the hands of a
                        gallant bearer, * who, while living, was ever prompt to carry it defiantly
                        in the face of his country's foes.</p>
                    <p>Let it then be cherished as a memorial of the honorable services of the men,
                        who, amid fiery trials, have never faltered beneath it; and be pleased, sir,
                        to send in its stead, as you have kindly promised to do, another, upon whose
                        folds, yet unbaptised in blood, and untarnished by the smoke of battle, may
                        be read, with fresh inspiration, the just doom of tyrants, and Virginia's
                        everlasting resolve of resistance to oppression.</p>
                    <p>I am sure I but utter the heartfelt wishes of my countrymen, when I pray
                        that, in the coming year, and ere the new flag can have lost its freshness,
                        it may please God to vouchsafe to our bleeding country the balm of peace,
                        and the blessings of Independence.</p>
