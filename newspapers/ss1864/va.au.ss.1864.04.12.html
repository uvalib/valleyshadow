<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"The Yankees, says the Richmond Examiner are
                    running mad in their love for the negro. Not content with sacrificing one
                    million of lives of their own men in this war for the negro, (as confessed by a
                    New York paper)--not content in receiving them "with marked favour" at the
                    President's receptions--not content with riding in the same car with them--not
                    content in having them as pall-bearers at the funeral of their great public men,
                    (one of the pall-bearers at Owen Lovejoy's funeral was, according to their own
                    accounts, a negro, formerly a slave)--not content with making soldiers of them,
                    and placing them on a political equality--not content with all this, the
                    Republican party, in their wild love for the negro, has inaugurated a new
                    chapter in their creed: "Miscegenation"--a wholesale
                        intermarriage of blacks and whites. This is the last and new phase of
                    abolitionism in the North. It is openly and unblus[h]ingly avowed--preached even
                    from the pulpit! It is the new test of Republican faith. To show how rapidly and
                    alarmingly the infamous and disgusting practice is spreading in the North, we
                    copy a portion of an editorial on the subject from the New York Times. The reader must bear in mind, when reading the
                    article below, that it is the language, not of a "Copperhead" journal, but of a
                    thorough, out and out Republican journal--an open, voluntary confession of a
                    paper that has never faltered in its support and devotion to the principles of
                    that party, and that has done as much in advocacy of the Lincoln administration
                    and the encouragement of this war as any other paper in the whole North. Now
                    that it sees ruin and degradation and a level with the negro staring it in its
                    face, it is forced to confess (and a very humiliating confession it is for a
                    Republican paper) that the only quarter to which the country can now look to be
                    saved is the Democratic party. But let no one fail to read this article--let it
                    be circulated in every Southern paper far and wide--let it be read, if
                    necessary, to our army. If there is a man in the whole South that can read this
                    confession below without firing his heart and causing a feeling of shame that we
                    should ever have lived with such a people, then he must be dead indeed to every
                    sense of honor, pride and virtue."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>[From the New York Times.] <br>What Are We Coming To? </p>
                    <p>A rage for marrying black people has lately taken possession of the
                        Republican party. Radicals have carried everything before them, if things go
                        on at their present rate it is feared that, in three months, every white man
                        who is not connected by marriage with a coloured family will be "read out"
                        of the party. The gusto with which the abolitionists go into the insane
                        movement is something at once distinguished and alarming. We shrink from
                        putting on paper the stories which reach us as to the prevalence of this
                        evil. We will only say that there will very soon be hardly a family in the
                        city belonging to the Republican persuasion which will not be glorying in
                        the possession of a negro son-in-law. It is said, we know not with what
                        truth, that the Union Legaue [sic] Club has fitted up a night bell at its
                        door, and keeps a black minister on the premises who marries all couples of
                        different colours at any hour of the day or night. Soon we may expect to
                        hear of duels being fought about some black washer-woman, and crowds of
                        white men thronging the basements of those families who have coloured
                        servants in their houses for the purpose of soliciting the honor (?) of
                        their hands.</p>
                    <p>It is with great reluctance that we speak out our minds in this matter. But
                        we have no hesitation in saying that if we had at the outset conceived it
                        possible that hostility to slavery would ever have led to wholesale
                        intermarriage with negroes, the Republican party should never have received
                        any countenance or support from this journal. We owe it to ourselves and to
                        posterity to say that the thing has taken us by surprisee [sic]. It never
                        entered our head. We now see and confess our errour [sic] and deplore it.</p>
                    <p>The question which now naturally suggests itself to every right-minded white
                        man and woman is, where is this thing to end?
                        Whither are we tending? What is to be done to stop this unnatural and
                        detestable movement. For it is as plain as a pikestaff that if it continues
                        there will be soon no whites left in this once great and prosperous country.
                        We shall all be mulattoes, and be afflicted with all the peculiarities, both
                        mental and physical, of that unhappy race. The signs of this great and
                        terrible change already begin to make themselves manifest in our streets;
                        for the most careless observer who walks down Broadway can hardly fail to
                        observe the appearance on a vast number of faces of the well-known brownish
                        tinge. Let that tinge once become general, and then fare-well, a long
                        farewell, to all our whiteness. </p>
                    <p>There is but one quarter--and we are not ashamed to own it--in which, in our
                        opinion, we can look for either help or comfort at this crisis, and that is
                        to the great, old, truly national Democratic party. It has its faults;
                        nobody has been forced to call attention to them oftener than we; but it has
                        never yet proved false to its race, and we are satisfied that whatever can
                        be done now will be done by it to preserve the purity of our blood.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In a short time the earth will be made to tremble beneath the shock of armed
                        hosts in hostile and deadly conflict. The armies of the South and North are
                        now girding up their loins for a most terrible encounter. The most crimson
                        page in the book of Time will be written in blood the ensuing Summer. The
                        enemy feel that, if they fail to conquer us in this campaign, the task is
                        hopeless, and that anarchy and irretrievable ruin will be their lot.
                        Therefore it is that they are using every possible exertion to overcome us
                        in this campaign. We should prepare with industry, and resolve to meet their
                        assaults with firmness and determined bravery. We have confidence in the
                        justness of our cause, the exalted bravery of our soldiers, and the
                        fortitude and patriotism of our citizens. It will not be long before these
                        virtues will be subjected to another test of their strength. In the language
                        of the Richmond Examiner, "the sun and winds of April will soon leave the
                        roads dry and hard, inviting the roll of artillery wagon-wheels; the fresh
                        green sward will be firm under the feet of marching brigades; the song of
                        birds upon every spray will upbraid the silence of the charging bugle, and
                        the Favonian zephyrs of spring will softly lift and flutter the folds of the
                        regimental flags. All nature pleads with man to come and do his part, and,
                        seeing battle is the business in hand, cries aloud that now is the day and
                        the hour to put it through. Our long endearing and devoted soldiers would
                        surely move to the fray with even a more fiery and invincible alacrity, if
                        they had good reason to hope that one or two stalwart blows, struck this
                        summer, would close the bitter struggle, and enable the most of them to
                        march to their far off homes through a country wild with joy; through towns
                        and villages illuminated with triumph; welcomed and hailed with patriotic
                        music and "orators of the day"; in a rain of roses flung by whitest hands.
                        Surely a reasonable anticipation of so glorious an autumn would nerve our
                        troops to pass more lightly and gaily through a bloody spring and
                    summer."</p>
