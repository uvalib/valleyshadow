                    <p>Suffolk, says the Petersburg <emph rend="italic">Express</emph>, has been
                        again occupied by the Yankees. On Tuesday, the brutal and notorious Col.
                        Spear, at the head of three regiments of infantry and five companies of
                        cavalry, arrived and established quarters. One of the infantry regiments is
                        composed entirely of negroes, black as ebony, and as saucy and vulgar a set
                        of devils as were ever pressed into the Yankee service. It is not positively
                        known what Spear's intentions are, but the general impression seems to be,
                        that Butler has sent him to Suffolk for the purpose of watching the
                        movements of the Confederates from a nearer stand point than that he has
                        been enable to do hitherto. His plans, whatever they may be, will probably
                        develop themselves at an early day. </p>

                    hardships and privations of another Summer's campaign."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR: As any news from the army is read with interest, by those at
                        home, I will endeavor to note down some things that have come immediately
                        under my notice.</p>
                    <p>I am now writing almost in full view of the Yankee camp--our brigade being on
                        picket at this time. This is not the most pleasant part of a soldier's duty,
                        yet it serves to break the monotony of camp life. Our regiment is very
                        comfortably quartered, enjoying the luxuries to which many of our friends at
                        home are strangers, such as sugar, coffee, molasses, &amp;c., of which
                        we are drawing pretty abundantly.</p>
                    <p>We have preaching almost every night when the weather will permit, by our
                        chaplain, the Rev. Mr. See. There does not appear to be that interest
                        manifested on the subject of religion as was last winter, but, on the whole,
                        there is a pretty good attendance at divine service.</p>
                    <p>War is very disastrous in its effects; it corrupts the morals, blunts the
                        sensibilities, and destroys the finer feelings of man, not only of the
                        soldier, but of the civilian. It has surprised me very much to see the
                        change that has taken place in the minds of many persons at home. Some of
                        them pledged their last dollar for the support of the soldiers' families,
                        who have since been the leaders in extortion and speculation. Others who
                        appeared equally as zealous have refused to sell their productions to
                        soldiers for Confederate money; and when induced to sell, actually charged a
                        half month's wages for a single pair of half soles for his shoes.</p>
                    <p>If this does not constitute disloyalty I am at a loss to know what does. The
                        change has been so gradual it would scarcely be noticed by those who
                        witnessed it every day, but I must confess it struck me forcibly. There is
                        another class of persons who have surprised me even more, viz: Those persons
                        who seemed to be so impatient to get Virginia out of the Union, could not
                        wait until there could be a Convention called for the purpose, wanted to be
                        pitching into the Yankees, felt themselves able to whip almost an unlimited
                        number. But since the war has been inaugurated have become exceedingly
                        patient, willing to let it move quietly and steadily along unwilling to
                        assist in any capacity, except as quartermaster, wagonmaster or in some
                        other bullet-proof position, and then take care to avail themselves of the
                        first exemption bill, or employ a substitute, and now when there is no other
                        alternative, have the audacity to ask for a detail.</p>
                    <p>I think it is the duty of every able-bodied man, especially those who are in
                        possession of property, to participate in our struggle for Liberty and
                        Independence. We who have been standing [a wall as it were] between the
                        enemy and their property, think it very unjust that they should remain at
                        home enjoying their ease, while we are compelled to remain in service and
                        endure the hardships and privations of another Summer's campaign. That we
                        are tired of the service no one will deny, but we are not so tired that we
                        would be willing to give up the conflict, provided every man comes up and
                        does his duty.</p>
                    <p>But there is another class I would notice before closing, with whom there
                        appear to have no changes taken place. I mean the Ladies, noble-hearted
                        creatures, who seem to have no other end in view than the achievement of our
                        Independence. May their expectations be realized, and through their efforts
                        may many be brought into the service who have been shirking duty, is the
                        desire of your humble servant.</p>
