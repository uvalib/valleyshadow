<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We noticed last week that a meeting would be held in the Court House tonight
                        for the purpose of organizing an Association in aid of the one established
                        in Richmond for the benefit of maimed soldiers. It is hoped that the meeting
                        will be well attended, and that many ladies will grace the occasion with
                        their presence. It is hoped that Associations for the same purpose will be
                        established in every neighborhood in the county. We believe that Augusta
                        county will do as much as any county in the State to furnish artificial arms
                        and legs to the brave soldiers who have been maimed in the military service
                        of the country. We understand that Rev. J. L. STIREWALT has collected as
                        much as $16,000 in the counties of Rockingham, Shenandoah and Page. These
                        counties have done well, but we cherish the belief that, if Associations be
                        formed in every neighborhood as we think should be done, this county will
                        contribute more than all three of these counties. We hope that the proper
                        kind of an Association will be organized in Staunton that it may be a model
                        for those in the different villages and neighborhoods of the county. Form
                        the Associations without delay, and appoint good committees to wait upon the
                        people. The most efficient committees for such purposes are those composed
                        of ladies. There are now in the Confederacy 10,000 maimed soldiers, and may
                        be nearly as many more before this "cruel war" will be over. What a sublime
                        spectacle it would present to see all these maimed soldiers supplied with
                        limbs by generous, voluntary contributions. The page of our history which
                        would contain the record of this fact would be among the brightest in the
                        whole volume--it would be one which even angels could read with pleasure.
                        This page will be written, and the name of this noble county will be found
                        upon it. Augusta will not be excelled by other counties in deeds of
                        generosity, liberality and humanity to the noble soldiers who have
                        sacrificed their limbs in the service of their country.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The correspondent of the Petersburg Express on the
                        Blackwater, gives a detailed account of the infamous conduct of the Yankees
                        and negroes during the late raid into the counties of Isle of Wight and
                        Nansemond. The negroes were turned loose on the women and children in
                        Suffolk, and robbed every house in the town. Watches, jewelry, &amp;c.,
                        were stolen from the persons of ladies, and every indignity and insult
                        offered them. Two of the most respectable ladies in the town, ladies of high
                        school position and refined feelings, being found with no male defenders
                        near, were grossly insulted with propositions and attempted violence too
                        indelicate to appear in print. These ladies were forced to defend themselves
                        with knives against great, black, greasy, buck negroes, whilst their friends
                        were away in the army. This fiendish proceeding has produced a sensation in
                        Suffolk which has been equalled by nothing that has transpired since the war
                        commenced. </p>

                    <p>The South is really menaced by one serious danger only; and that is the
                        failure of adequate subsistence. While superfluous abundance exists in many
                        considerable districts of the Confederacy, it cannot be denied that in those
                        in which there is much the heaviest consumption of food, including Virginia,
                        a most serious scarcity prevails. This scarcity is not only felt in the
                        cities, towns and villages, but throughout the interiour [sic] country.
                        There are many farmers in Western Virginia who could spare largely from
                        their hoarded stores for the general want; but it is a fact notorious, which
                        it were idle to deny, that a considerable proportion of the producing
                        population of Virginia are stinted for the necessaries of life.</p>

                    <p>As long as two months ago the county of Charlotte, in a region unoccupied by
                        any army, took measures to obtain a supply of grain for the consumption of
                        its inhabitants from the far South; and if this be the case on the South
                        side, imagine what it must be in regions suffering from the presence of
                        armies; where, first, producers voluntarily sold to Government what they
                        could spare; where, second, a molety [sic] of what was left has been
                        impressed by foraging parties sent out from the armies; and where, third,
                        much of the residue has disappeared under the pilfering and robberies of
                        straggling soldiers, over whom no discipline seems to be exerted.</p>
