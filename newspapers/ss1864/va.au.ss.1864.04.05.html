<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have recen[t]ly learned some interesting and gratifying facts in
                        connection with the state of religious feeling in Gen. Imboden's command.
                        The Brigade Chaplain, Rev. Geo. G. Brooke, of the Baltimore Conference of
                        the M. E. Church, is an earnest, zealous, pious, and most industrious
                        laborer in that department of God's moral vineyard. Since the Brigade has
                        been encamped where it now is, about 50 of the soldiers have professed
                        religion and joined one or the other branches of the christian church. "A
                        camp church" has been established, into which have been gathered all the
                        members of the different churches. Preaching and other religious services
                        and a good many tracts and other religious books have been circulated and
                        read in the command. The soldiers, a very large proportion of whom are
                        intelligent gentlemen, are beginning to take a deep interest in spiritual
                        matters, so that there is reason to hope for a still better condition of
                        things in this department of our army. Rev. Mr. Brooke is assisted in his
                        labors of love by Rev. Jno. Lafferty, chaplain to the 18th Reg't., a
                        talented, zealous, and highly intelligent member of the Va. Annual
                        conference.--Rock. Register.</p>

                    <p>Mr. EDITOR:</p>
                    <p>I wish to call the attention of the proper authorities to the subject of
                        desertion, as some who have left their posts, since last summer, are now
                        skulking about home and friends, and are engaged in pilfering through the
                        neighborhood. As the campaign will open in a few weeks, I think it is the
                        duty of all officers and men to be at their posts without any further delay,
                        and it is the duty of those, who have it in charge, to arrest every
                        deserter, and mete out to him such punishment as the military code provides.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Compares women to china and fabric in explaining to young men how they

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Choosing a wife is a perilous piece of business. Do you suppose there is
                        nothing of it but evening visits, bouquets, and popping the question? My
                        dear simple young man, you ought not to be trusted out by yourself alone!
                        Take care that you don't get the China article, that looks exceedingly
                        pretty on the mantlepiece, until the gilt and ornament are all rubbed off,
                        and then is fit only for the dust-pile! A wife should be selected on the
                        same principle as a calico gown. Bright colors and gay patterns are not
                        always the best economy. Get something that will wash and wear. Nothing like
                        the suns and showers of matrimony to bleach out these deceptive externals.</p>
                    <p>Dont' [sic] choose the treasure by gas light, or in a parlor sitting. Broad
                        daylight is the best time--a kitchen the most sensible place. Bear in mind,
                        sir, that the article once bargained for, you can't exchange it if it don't
                        suit. If you buy a watch and it don't run as you expected, you can send it
                        to a jeweler, to be repaired; in the case of a wife, once paired, you can't
                        repair. She may run in the wrong direction--very well, sir, all that is left
                        for you is to run after her, and an interesting chase you will probably find
                        it! If you get a good wife, you will be the happiest fellow alive! If you
                        get a bad one, you may, as well sell yourself for two and sixpence, at once!
                        Just as well consider all these things beforehand, young man!</p>
