<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are credibly informed that within the past three months not less than
                        thirty boys, between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, have come out from
                        Winchester, and are now not boys, but fighting men in the ranks of our army.
                        The impulse to this movement received additional strength from the
                        appearance of a negro regiment which occupied the town some weeks ago, the
                        greater portion having joined the army since that time. Such indignation and
                        disgust seized the community, that, not only the boys, but the children,
                        were roused and only wanted years and strength to have placed themselves by
                        the side of their brothers only a few days older. These boys are now
                        fighting as willing and ardent soldiers to reclaim their homes and
                        firesides, outraged and desecrated by the presence of such a foe. May they
                        reap such success as their courage and manliness deserve. This, no doubt, is
                        more or less the case throughout the border wherever these black regiments
                        have made their appearance. Verily, our enemies have served us many a good
                        turn since the commencement of this war. From the generous acts of Mr.
                        Banks, our Commissary General, who has strewn his favors with a lavish hand
                        all over Virginia and Louisiana, to the negro proclamations of Mr. Lincoln,
                        we derive no other feelings than those of the most unalloyed satisfaction.
                        In this connection, an incident worthy of record may be mentioned. Towards
                        the latter part of April, a young man, about seventeen years of age, by the
                        name of Jones, son of Edward Jones, of Winchester, came out and enrolled
                        himself in the cavalry company of Capt. Adams, then stationed in the
                        vicinity of Woodstock. He told his Captain that he had no horse, but thought
                        he would be able to obtain one in a few days, and returning to Winchester,
                        awaited his opportunity. On the Thursday, April 28th, after the rout of the
                        enemy's cavalry from Cedar Creek to Winchester by Capt. Davis, a force of
                        300 Yankee cavalry passed thro' Winchester up the Valley Turnpike for the
                        avowed purpose, smarting as they were under the rout of the previous Sunday,
                        of wiping out the rebels in that section of country. Some time after their
                        departure from the town, one of them returned and halted his horse on Main
                        Street, nearly opposite the house occupied by the father of young Jones.
                        Presently Jones emerged in Confederate uniform and walking across the street
                        directly towards the Yankee, when at a proper distance, accosted him, and
                        demanded his surrender. The Yankee made no reply but moved his hand towards
                        his pistol, which motion Jones perceiving, instantly fired, the ball passing
                        through the left breast of his antagonist. The Yankee fell gently from his
                        horse, and in falling, begged his assailant not to fire again, that he
                        surrendered; whereupon Jones, mounting the horse, ordered him to hand him
                        his sabre and pistols, which he did. Jones then, in double-quick, left town
                        by a by-road, and when our informant passed through Woodstock on the
                        following day, he was safe, fully armed and equipped, and handsomely mounted
                        a fighting private in the company of Capt. Adams. We have no doubt he will
                        do the Confederate States good service until our rights are secured, and his
                        own home rescued from the Lands of these vandal invaders. Many similar
                        instances might be mentioned to show the spirit and daring with which the
                        mere boys of the country have espoused her just and righteous cause. The
                        behavior of the Corps of Cadets, in the late fight near New Market, under
                        Gen. Breckinridge, which, according to his statement, was beyond all praise,
                        is an instance in point. All honor to the youth of our country who
                        everywhere have shown themselves worthy of revolutionary sires.</p>
