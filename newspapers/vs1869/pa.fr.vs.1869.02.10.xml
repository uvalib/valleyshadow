                    <p>A general desire having been expressed, by friends of Temperance, for a State
                        Temperance Convention, for consultation and harmony of action in the effort
                        to lessen the evils resulting from the use of, and traffic in, intoxicating
                        liquors in Pennsylvania, the undersigned earnestly and cordially invite all
                        interested in the cause of Temperance to meet in State Convention, in the
                        Court House in Harrisburg, on Tuesday, the twenty-third day of February,
                        1869, at ten o'clock, A.M.</p>
                    <p>The past year has witnessed greater and made successful efforts in public
                        instruction, by the Church and Temperance Societies, in the religious,
                        social, moral, political and economic relations of the Temperance Question,
                        than during many years past,--but, alas! the heavy and unjust taxes imposed
                        by our drinking customs and the insatiable liquor trade--<sic>he</sic> sad
                        wail of anguish from hopeless hearts--the violent and premature deaths--the
                        broken fortunes and reputations--our crowded prisons, alms-houses and
                        benevolent institutions--the open, persistent violation of the laws of the
                        Commonwealth, and setting at naught of the American Sabbath of our fathers,
                        by those engaged in liquor selling and liquor drinking, admonish as how much
                        remains to be done, and the need of counsel and concerted effort for the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The Liquor dealers have organized for the purpose of controlling political
                        action in the future as in the past, and to make "party" the shield and
                        defender of their trade--boldly declaring they will make the continuance of
                        the liquor license system a political issue; and that they "<emph
                            rend="italic">will sustain no candidate of whatever party, in any
                            election, who is in any way disposed toward the total abstinence
                        cause</emph>." The Sixth National Temperance Convention, which met at
                        Cleveland, Ohio, July 29th and 30th, 1868, carefully considering the duty of
                        Temperance Voters to the question thus raised, unanimously.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved:</emph> That Temperance, having its political as
                        well as moral aspects and duties demands the persistent use of the ballot
                        for its promotion; and the Convention urge the friends of the cause to
                        refuse to vote for any candidate who denies the application of the just
                        powers of civil government to the suppression of the liquor traffic, and
                        exhort the friends of Temperance, by every practical method, in their
                        several localities, to secure righteous political action for the advancement
                        of the cause."</p>
                    <p>It therefore has become the duty of Pennsylvania's Temperance Voters to
                        determine the position they will take in this advanced step in the progress
                        of the Temperance reform.</p>
                    <p>We do earnestly call upon all Churches, Sunday Schools, Colleges, Divisions
                        of Sons of Temperance, Lodges of Good Templars, Temples of Honor and
                        Temperance, and all Temperance Societies of whatever name, to send their
                        ablest and best men and wise men as delegates to this Convention. We also
                        ask that public and private prayer be constantly offered to Almighty God
                        that His presence and blessing may be with the Convention, and for the
                        success of the cause it meets to promote.</p>
                    <p>A Public Prayer Meeting will be held in the Court House from 10 to 11
                        o'clock, A.M., preceding the Convention.</p>

                    <p>The foregoing call for a State Temperance Convention has been sent all over
                        the State, in the form of a circular letter, with a note requesting editors
                        to publish it in full or give the substance of it. We have concluded to give
                        it in full for the information of the public, and for the special benefit of
                        the distillers, liquor dealers and hotel and restaurant keepers who voted
                        for John Cessna. Of course it will not escape their observation that the
                        name of the Honorable John is signed to the call. We told them during the
                        late campaign that Cessna was the "Temperance candidate," but we must admit
                        that we did not expect he would take such an early occasion after the
                        election to enter upon a temperance crusade. His success has made him
                        unusually bold.</p>
                    <p>This call, it will be observed, quotes a resolution adopted by the National
                        Temperance Convention which met in Cleveland on the 29th and 30th of July
                        last, and of which John Cessna was Temporary President. That resolution
                        declares that Temperance "has its <emph rend="italic">political</emph> as
                        well as moral aspects and duties," and that it "demands the persistent use
                        of the ballot for its promotion," and "the Convention urge the friends of
                        the cause to <emph rend="italic">refuse to vote for any candidate</emph> who
                        denies the application of the just powers of civil government to the
                        suppression of the liquor traffic."</p>
                    <p>This was the platform laid down by the Temperance Convention over which
                        Cessna temporarily presided at Cleveland, but that foxy politician kept it
                        out of sight during his candidacy for Congress. He did not tell Dan.
                        Trostle, John Fisher, John Adams, Francis Bowden, Charles Ridgely, John
                        Hassler, E. S. Shank, John T. Stull, Thomas McAfee, Charles G. Lowe, and
                        others of his Republican friends in this district who are engaged in the
                        liquor traffic, that he had <emph rend="italic">pledged himself not to vote
                            for them</emph> if they should become candidates. But the election being
                        over, he does not hesitate to sign his name to a paper which declares that
                        it "has become the duty of Pennsylvania's Temperance voters" to make an
                        assault on the liquor dealers and if possible ruin their business and
                        destroy the value of their property.</p>
                    <p>John Cessna does not care a pinch of snuff for the Republican party. He will
                        desert it, as he did the Democratic party, if he finds it his interest to do
                        so. If he can climb higher by organizing and leading a Temperance party, he
                        will do it. His future political connections will depend upon the success of
                        the movement to establish a Temperance party. If a Temperance party strong
                        enough to exercise a controlling influence in the politics of Pennsylvania
                        can be built up, he will desert his present political associates and
                        denounce them as foully as he now denounces his former political friends in
                        the Democratic party.</p>
