<b>Our County Ticket</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gives short biographies of every Democratic nominee for Franklin county
                    offices. Especially likes to point out military service whenever possible and

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Democratic County Convention, last week, performed its labors with the
                        utmost harmony. There was no discord among its members. The rival candidates
                        had their warm personal friends who pressed their respective claims with
                        earnestness and energy, but there was none of that bitterness which is so
                        frequently an unpleasant feature of Conventions. The ticket formed is one
                        that we present with pride and pleasure to the people of the County. The
                        candidates are men well worthy of the hearty support of the Democracy and we
                        doubt not that they will be acceptable to those Conservative Republicans who
                        have resolved to repudiate the ticket nominated by the Radical Convention.</p>
                    <p>CAPTAIN GEORGE W SKINNER, of Chambersburg, is the nominee of the Convention
                        for Assembly. Although a young man, he is so well known to our people that
                        it is scarcely necessary to say a single word in his favor. When but
                        eighteen years of age, he enlisted as a Private in Company A, 77th Regiment
                        of Volunteers. This was in 1862. Step by step he fought his way upwards
                        until he was commissioned Captain of this Company. He remained in the
                        service until the command was mustered out in January, 1866. During all this
                        time, this regiment performed military duty in the South-West, participating
                        in many bloody engagements and maintaining a splendid reputation for
                        gallantry and thorough discipline. Capt. Skinner was one of the best
                        officers in the Regiment. For dauntless courage and power of endurance, he
                        had no superior in it. And through the whole war, he remained true to
                        Democratic principles. In 1867, he was selected by the Convention as the
                        candidate of the Democratic party for County Treasurer, and was elected by
                        the handsome majority of 251 over one of the most active and energetic men
                        in the County. There was but one candidate on the Democratic ticket who
                        received a larger majority. He has discharged the duties of this responsible
                        office in an unexceptionable manner. His political opponents will bear
                        testimony to his uniform courtesy and remarkable efficiency.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Skinner will make an able representative in the Legislature. He has
                        received a good classical education, is a clear thinker, a ready writer and
                        a pleasant and forcible speaker. Add to all these qualifications an energy
                        that never tires and a character for honesty that has never been assailed,
                        and we have in him a candidate who, when elected, will be able to take a
                        high position in the House of Representatives.</p>
                    <p>GEORGE W. WELSH, who was nominated for Prothonotary, is also well known to
                        the people of Franklin county. He was admitted to the Chambersburg Bar in
                        1856. In 1859, he was the candidate of the Democratic party for the office
                        of District Attorney. That was in the days when Republicanism had such a
                        fast hold upon the "old Green Spot" that it was impossible for a Democrat to
                        be elected. Mr Welsh, however, made an excellent canvass and led his party
                        vote to an extent that was quite flattering. He became the law-partner of
                        William Reilly, and for several years, practiced with him under the firm
                        name of Reilly &amp; Welsh.</p>
                    <p>When the war began, Mr. Welsh enlisted with the three months troops, and
                        served through the campaign with them. In August, 1864, he assisted in
                        organizing Company A, of the 126th Regiment, and was made 2nd Lieutenant. On
                        the promotion of Lieut. John Stewart to the position of Adjutant, he took
                        Mr. Stewart's place as 1st Lieutenant. After the battle of Fredericksburg,
                        where Captain John Doebler was wounded, Lieut. Welsh commanded the Company
                        until the time when it was mustered out of service. Since that time he has
                        been practicing law at the Chambersburg Bar, having his office in
                        Waynesboro', except one year when he was engaged in the office of the Age, in Philadelphia.</p>
                    <p>There can be no doubt as to Mr. Welsh's ability to discharge the duties of
                        the office of Prothonotary. In addition to his other qualifications, he is
                        an excellent penman and will keep a neat and beautiful record.</p>
                    <p>HIRAM T. SNYDER, of Fayetteville, who was nominated for Register and
                        Recorder, is a prominent citizen in that locality. He is one of the most
                        honest and sagacious business men in the County. He is exceedingly
                        industrious and scrupulously careful in all his business transactions. Of
                        late years, he has been in delicate health, which has incapacitated him to
                        some extent for out-door labor. There is no man more popular than he in his
                        neighborhood and we look for a strong vote in his favor. When elected, he
                        will give his personal attention to the duties of the office and the public
                        can rest assured that their interests will not suffer in his hands.</p>
                    <p>B. A. CORMANY, the nominee for Clerk of the Courts, is now living in this
                        Borough, having moved here about two years ago from St. Thomas township. In
                        the latter township he filled the position of Justice of the Peace with such
                        ability and impartiality as to receive the approbation of the men of all
                        parties. Since his coming among us, he has borne himself in such a manner as
                        to win the respect and esteem of all our citizens with whom he has become
                        acquainted. He is universally popular because of his gentlemanly deportment
                        and clever and obliging disposition. There is no County officer with whom
                        the people come more in contact than the Clerk of the Courts, and we can
                        assure them that they will always find Mr. Cormany ready to accommodate them
                        as far as lies in his power.</p>
                    <p>WILLIAM REBER, who was nominated for Treasurer, comes of good old Democratic
                        stock. He came to this County from Adams county, when a young man and
                        resided on his farm in Southampton township. A few years ago, he
                        relinquished farming and moved to Orrstown where he now lives. He has been
                        dealing largely in stock of late years, and bears a reputation for honesty
                        and integrity in all his dealings. He has an extensive acquaintance in the
                        County and wherever he is known he is liked. The management of the County
                        finances will be entrusted to him for the next two years.</p>
                    <p>JACOB BRUMBAUGH, who was nominated for Commissioner, is from the Middleburg
                        district, in Antrim township, where all the people are born Democrats and
                        kept in the faith from their youth up. He is a man of sound judgment, good
                        business capacity and strict integrity. He will make a faithful and
                        efficient Commissioner.</p>
                    <p>FREDERICK LONG, the nominee for Director of the Poor, is one of the most
                        intelligent farmers in Fannett township and a Christian gentleman, being one
                        of the leading members of the Methodist Church in that section.</p>
                    <p>JOHN C. TRITLE, who was nominated for Auditor, is one of the most substantial
                        citizens of Hamilton township. He is an excellent accountant and is, in
                        every way, qualified for a much higher place on the ticket. We hope to have
                        the pleasure of supporting him for a better position at some future time.</p>
                    <p>Such, Democrats, is your ticket. From top to bottom, it is eminently worthy
                        of your most earnest efforts. It is made up of men of ability and integrity.
                        The question, "Is he honest, is he capable?" may be applied to every
                        candidate and you can ring back the answer yes.
                        Go to work and elect them all and let us have a grand old Democratic
                        rejoicing.</p>

                        of the last legislature, together with their chief manager, Gov. Geary. Yes,
                        go to work, ye toiling slaves, work early and work late, work by night and
                        work by day, to keep in their fat offices the profligate horde who have
                        proven themselves such perfect adepts in squandering your money.</p>
                    <p>But the toiling masses of this once proud and prosperous old Commonwealth
                        need no such admonition from their masters. They are at work, they have been

                        To the Democratic Voters of Western Pennsylvania:
                    </p>
                    <p>Your attention is directed to the following explanation of the Registry Law.
                        Read it carefully, in order to ascertain what is your duty in the premises,
                        and then see that your names are placed upon the Assessor's list.</p>
                    <p>Naturalized Citizens</p>
                    <p>Will see that the Republican Legislature has imposed additional duties upon them. Let them comply fully with the
                        requirements of the Law, in order that they may vote for the party which has
                        always stood by them.</p>
                    <p>Examine the Assessor's List,</p>
                    <p>One of which is posted on the house where the election is to be held, and the
                        other is in the assessor's hands. You have a right to examine them, free of
                        charge.</p>
                    <p>These lists should contain your name, and the names of all other qualified
                        voters in the district; they should state, if you are a house-keeper, the
                        number of your house, the street it fronts on; your occupation; if you
                        board, where and with whom you board; if you work for another, your
                        employers name; and opposite your name should be written the word "voter."</p>
                    <p>If you have been naturalized, there will also appear the letter "N." If you
                        have merely declared your intention to become a citizen, the letters "D. I."</p>
                    <p>If you are between 21 and 22 years old, the word "age." If you have removed
                        into the district since the last election, the letter "R." will appear
                        opposite your name.</p>
                    <p>
                        Make it your personal duty to see that your name is upon
                            the list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do not trust this matter to any one else.
                    </p>
                    <p>How to Get Registered.</p>
                    <p>If you find your names is not on the list, go
                        yourself to the assessor, and make your claim to be put on. He is
                        bound to add your name. He cannot question your right. You need not discuss

                        residence, occupation, &amp;c. He will mark "C.V." opposite your name.</p>
                    <p>Attend to this at Once.</p>

                    <p>If you intend to take out your "last papers" before the election, you must
                        show your "first papers" to the assessor.</p>
                    <p>See that your names are on the list.</p>

                        naturalized before the election, should get naturalized first, immediately, and go to the assessor with your
                        "papers."</p>
                    <p>All naturalized citizens must take their "papers" with
                            them to the polls, unless they have been voting for ten years in
                        the same district.</p>
                    <p>You must take your "papers" with you when you go to vote,
                            even if your name is on the list.</p>
                    <p>Do not forget this or your enemies will deprive you of your vote.</p>
                    <p>Taxes.</p>
                    <p>The law in relation to the payment of taxes is unchanged. If you have paid
                        neither a State nor county tax, assessed within two
                            years, do it without delay.</p>
                    <p>Take your last tax receipt with you to the polls.</p>
                    <p>Do not delay registering or paying your taxes; attend to the matter now, for fear something may prevent hereafter.<br>
