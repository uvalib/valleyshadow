                    <p>Let Radicals read and ponder. Let them see who are willing and who are not
                        willing to do justice to the plundered citizens of the border counties of
                        this Commonwealth. We call their attention to the action of the State
                            <sic>Senateas</sic> shown in the following brief report of its
                        proceedings:</p>
                    <p>Mr Duncan offered the following, which was twice read:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, by the Senate (the House of
                        Representatives concurring), That the Auditor General be requested and
                        instructed to have printed for the use of members ten thousand copies of the
                        report of the board of commissioners appointed by the Governor, under the
                        act approved the 9th day of April, A. D., 1868, entitled an act for the
                        relief of the citizens of the counties of Adams, Franklin, Fulton, Bedford,
                        York, Perry and Cumberland, whose property was destroyed, damaged or
                        appropriated for the public services and in the common defense in the war to
                        suppress the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>The resolution was subsequently amended by providing that two thousand copies
                        only be printed, and excluding from the work the testimony taken and other
                        voluminous matter.</p>
                    <p>On the resolution as amended, the yeas and nays were required by Mr. Duncan
                        and Mr. Fisher, and were as follows, viz:</p>
                    <p>Yeas--Messrs. Beck, Hurnett, Davis, Duncan, Jackson, Linderman, M'Candless,
                        M'Intire, Miller, Nagle, Randall, Turner and Wallace--13.</p>
                    <p>Nays--Messrs. Billingfelt, Brown (Mercer), Coleman, Connell, Errett, Fisher,
                        Graham, Henesey, Kerr, Lowry, Olmsted, Osterhout, Worthington, <emph
                            rend="italic">Speaker</emph>--17.</p>
                    <p>So the resolution was rejected.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">The thirteen Senators voting yea are all Democrats. The
                            seventeen Senators voting nay are all Radicals</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The Radicals of the Senate have thus refused to allow themselves to be
                        informed as to the extent of our losses and the names of the sufferers. They
                        do not want any light. Why is it that they seem to have made it a party
                        issue? Why is it that they are always found in opposition to any plan which
                        looks towards a reimbursement of our citizens? It is a notorious fact that
                        every measure introduced into the Legislature of Pennsylvania for the
                        adjudication and payment of our claims, has received the almost unanimous
                        support of the Democrats, whilst the Radicals have generally been found
                        arrayed in opposition to such propositions. The people are asking the reason
                        for this.</p>
                    <p>And what hope can we have of <emph rend="italic">payment</emph> from Radical
                        Senators and members, if they record themselves against this initiatory
                        step?</p>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> has lately been writing heavy
                        leaders on the subject of these border damages. Let it now read its party
                        friends in the Senate a good lecture. Let it demand to know the reason why
                        "the friends of freedom and progress" are willing to spend hundred of
                        thousands of dollars on lazy negroes, but will not consent to do anything
                        which squints at the ultimate payment of the white plundered citizens of the
                        border counties? Open your eyes, ye Radical braggarts, and see where the
                        fault lies. It is at your own door.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, it affords us pleasure to lay before our readers the
                        account which the Harrisburg <emph rend="italic">Patriot</emph> gives of the
                        manner in which Hon. C. M. Duncan bore himself in the discussion that took
                        place on the above resolution. The popular Senator from Franklin seems to
                        have made a decided accusation. Read the following extract:</p>
                    <p>The usual quiet of the Senate chamber was somewhat disturbed by the
                        introduction of a resolution by Mr. Duncan, the Senator from Adams and
                        Franklin, requesting the publication, by the Auditor General, of the report
                        of the Border Damage Commissioners. The resolution asked for the publication
                        of 10,000 copies of the said report. Immediately after some of the ultra men
                        on the opposite side of the chamber arose and opposed the passage of this
                        resolution. The Senators from Potter, Erie, Lebanon and others, fiercely
                        assaulted the resolution. But Mr. Duncan parried their blows, answered their
                        objections and made a strong appeal to the Senators in favor of its passage.</p>
                    <p>After an animated discussion, in which the Senator from Franklin stood firmly
                        in favor of the resolution, and <del/> its passage in earnest appeals, the
                        resolution was lost, and on a call of the ayes and nays it appears that the
                        republicans to a man voted against it, while the democrats all voted for it.</p>
                    <p>In the debate Senators from the other side of the chamber argued that this
                        was only an entering wedge, and moving to the ultimate payment of the border
                        claims.--The Senator from Franklin did not deny the assertion, but remarked
                        that he thought, trusted and hoped that the time was not far distant when
                        this Commonwealth, rich in everything, would say that she will indemnify the
                        losses--will pay the damages as in justice and equity she ought to do in all
                        these cases. Mr. Duncan brought the republicans to their trumps, and the
                        able manner in which he defended his resolution excited general admiration.</p>
                    <p>Will the <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph> shake off the trammels of
                        party for once, and exercise sufficient independence to do Mr. Duncan
                        justice and to roast its party friends on hot coals?</p>

                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The motion of Senator Duncan to print the report of the Border Damage
                        Commissioners was opposed by some superlatively honest members of the Senate
                        on the ground that it was "an entering wedge" which would open the Treasury
                        to a large number of claims. Men are always to be found in our deliberative
                        bodies who keep a sharp look out for entering wedges. If these men were at
                        all times vigilant and conscientious guardians of the public treasury, we
                        might respect them even if we thought wrong in the particular instance under
                        consideration. But the very men who are most apt to oppose such meritorious
                        claims as those presented by the Border Counties, and, for want of better
                        arguments, object to them as entering wedges, <emph rend="italic">are
                            themselves the most dangerous entering wedges that the Treasury has to
                            contend with</emph>. A just and honest claim that puts nothing into
                            <emph rend="italic">their</emph> pockets is sure to encounter their
                        violent opposition, whilst they are willing to make entering wedges of
                        themselves and split open the vaults of the Treasury whenever a sufficient
                        pecuniary inducement is held out to them. These scoundrels live by robbing
                        the people. That is their trade--the business of their lives. And the reason
                        why they object to the payment of honest claims is, that the more money
                        taken out of the Treasury honestly, the less will there be to steal. It
                        makes a great difference to them whether a million dollars go into the
                        pockets of the plundered people of six or eight Border Counties, or whether
                        that amount is divided among the scoundrels who make up the Legislative
                        "ring" at Harrisburg.</p>
                    <p>We wish the eyes of the people of this whole commonwealth could be opened, so
                        that they would see this matter in its true light. Many of them will no
                        doubt be so far imposed upon as to believe that the entering wedge objectors
                        are really guarding their interests. If their eyes could be opened to the
                        truth, they would see that such is not the fact. A certain amount of money
                        goes into the State Treasury every year, and just so much of it as is not
                        absolutely required for the use of the State is stolen for the benefit of
                        the corrupt "ring" in and around the Legislature. What harm was done to the
                        people of the State at large by the appropriation of half a million for the
                        relief of the burnt out citizens of Chambersburg? None at all. If that half
                        million had not been given to Chambersburg, it would have found its way out
                        of the Treasury at any rate. If it had not gone into the pockets of honest
                        men, it would have been gobbled up by thieves. The people of the State at
                        large lost nothing, therefore, by the appropriation to Chambersburg, whilst
                        a large number of meritorious citizens were benefited. Nor would the people
                        of the State at large lose anything by an appropriation for the payment of
                        the Border Damages, whilst such appropriation would really have a purifying
                        tendency. There would be just so much less to steal.</p>

                <summary>Rev. Dr. Schwartz delivered a lecture entitled "No man owns deeper than he
                    plows," at the Court House. The paper gave it good reviews, although declared it
                    may have been too intellectual for a mixed audience. The argument was that no
                    man owns that which he does not "turn to practical account." The editors
                    chastise the public for low turnout to the free event.</summary>
