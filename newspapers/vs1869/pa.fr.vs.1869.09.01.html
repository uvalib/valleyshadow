<b>The Negro in the Schools</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on the mayor of Washington's visit to Pennsylvania to promote
                    education for blacks and breaking down racial barriers. Urges all men who agree

                    <p>Mayor Bowen, of Washington, distinguished himself at Gettysburg, by his
                        intimate association with a negro Alderman.--He had brought the darkey with
                        him for the purpose of showing the magnates there assembled that he was in
                        favor of wiping out all distinctions on account of color. It caused
                        considerable trouble and the Mayor was obliged to get his companion back to
                        the National Capitol as quietly as possible. But the Mayor still clings to
                        his Radical notions. In a message to his negro Councils, he used the
                        following language:</p>
                    <p>The breaking down of all caste distinctions is one
                        of the great missions of the American people, and the sooner all classes
                        "conquer their prejudices" and accept the situation, the better for all
                        concerned. All children should be educated as the children of American
                        citizens, the future sovereigns of the Republic, and should be taught to ignore all class distinctions.</p>
                    <p>One of the leading Radical newspapers in Washington City sustains this
                        position by this comment:</p>
                    <p>As to the suggestion in regard to the mingling of the two races together in
                        the same schools, it has the merit of practicability, and, at the same time,
                        of opening the door for the gradual exit of existing prejudices.</p>
                    <p>What say you, men of Franklin county, do you desire to have all social
                        distinctions wiped out between your children and the blacks? Do you want
                            the door opened so that preparations may be
                        made in the village schools for social commingling in after life? If so,
                        vote the Radical ticket with the jig-dancer Geary at its head. If not, vote
                        for the white men's candidate and thorough gentleman, Asa Packer.</p>

<b>77th Reg't Penn's Vols</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Announces a reunion of the 77th Penn. Volunteer Regiment to be held in
                    Pittsburgh in a week. Invites the regiment to hold its subsequent meetings in

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The first reunion of the 77th Regiment Penn's Vols. will be held at La
                        Fayette Hall, in Pittsburg, on Thursday, the 9th inst. There will be a
                        business meeting at 10:30 A. M. The Reunion will be at 2 P. M. when an
                        oration will be delivered by Col. Fred. S. Pyfer, of Lancaster, Pa. The
                        Festivities take place in the evening, the Hop beginning at eight o'clock
                        and the Banquet at ten o'clock.</p>
                    <p>This Regiment contemplates holding an annual reunion hereafter. We would
                        suggest to its members, that no more suitable place could be selected for
                        its next meeting than Chambersburg. This Regiment was organized here. One of
                        its most gallant officers sleeps in the Cemetery in this Borough. Colonel
                        Stumbaugh and Captain Skinner were identified with it during their terms of
                        military service, and there is a considerable number of private soldiers in
                        our County who fought bravely in its ranks.</p>
                    <p>On behalf of the people of Chambersburg, we extend an invitation to the
                        Regiment to make Chambersburg their next place of reunion, with the
                        assurance that every effort will be made to render their visit pleasant.</p>

<b>Gettysburg</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Prints an article from a New York newspaper about Union veterans putting up
                    monuments at Gettysburg. Believes this is a bad idea because it will only
                    encourage sectional strife instead of uniting the country. Especially upset that
                    the Union veterans asked Confederate veterans to assist them, and asks how Union
                    veterans would feel if the situation were reversed.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The leading ex-rebel generals have been invited to be present at Gettysburg
                        and assist in marking out and building monuments upon the principal lines of
                        the battle-field. This request they decline in courteous terms, alleging, as
                        a reason, in the language of General Lee (who fairly represents the
                        sentiments of all the southern officers), that it is wiser "not to keep open
                        the sores of war, but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavor
                        to obliterate the marks of civil strife; to commit to oblivion the feelings
                        it engendered." If Lee and his brother generals had attempted to perpetuate
                        the memory of southern victories by surveys and monumental stones, their
                        objections to the Gettysburg affair might be justly liable to criticisms on
                        the score of personal and sectional feeling. But they have refrained from
                        offending the patriotic sensibilities of the North by such a course. They
                        have not held meetings and set up granite pillars at Fredericksburg,
                        Chancellorsville, Cold Harbor, the Seven Pines, Red River Landing, Olustee,
                        and the other spots were their arms triumphed over ours. Had they done so,
                        would they not have been accused throughout the North of "disloyalty,"
                        "inciting a new rebellion," &amp;c.? Undoubtedly they would; and in
                        revenge for their conduct new military screws would have been put upon the
                        South, and the tardy process of reconstruction still further delayed.
                        Suppose, for illustration, that the Confederates had won the battle of
                        Gettysburg, but that their supposed victory had not changed the final issue
                        of the war. How would the North like to have Lee and his lieutenants come
                        trooping into that old Pennsylvania town this pleasant summer weather to
                        perform the same ceremony for which the Federal officers are now assembled?
                        We fancy that a howl of indignation would go up all over the North, and they
                        would be lucky if they escaped the delicate attentions of a loyal mob. Yet
                        we do not see why, if the victories of civil war are to be commemorated at
                        all by such enduring mementoes, the ex-rebels are not entitled to erect
                        signal posts on the fields of their supremacy, wherever they can find them,
                        even if one of them were Gettysburg. They, like northerners, are Americans.
                        They, like northerners, are now peaceful and devoted to the Union, and are
                        or are soon to be, every one of them, restored to full citizenship, just as
                        if there never had been a war. Having the same ownership and interest in the
                        country that we have, they might fairly lay claim to the right of glorifying
                        their feats of arms, in the Gettysburg fashion--on this pretext, if no
                        other, that future generations ought to know how gallantly the armies fought
                        on both sides in the great rebellion, and what a tough and wiry foe the
                        North had to grapple with and overthrow, thus teaching the coming American
                        to be proud of an ancestral race which produced such heroic fruits wherever
                        the stock was planted, South as well as North. But no! We should decidedly
                        oppose the erection of monuments on battle-fields by the South, for the same
                        reason that we object to the present exercise at Gettysburg--on the ground
                        of the wisest expediency. It can only tend to keep alive the feelings of
                        mutual hate that ought to be buried.</p>
                    <p>----"deeper than did ever plummet sound."</p>
                    <p>It can only contribute to neutralize the exertions that good men are making
                        in all parts of the country to restore a fuller measure of fraternal
                        attachment than ever existed before the war. What is the use of striving to
                        bring about this national and political millennium that all lovers of the
                        republic are yearning for, if we are to put up imperishable tablets on every
                        battlefield where the Unionists were victorious, so that the South may never
                        be allowed to forget how she was conquered and punished?</p>
                    <p>There is no danger that Gettysburg or any other great national battle ground
                        will be forgotten. It lives in history and poetry and legend, and in the
                        long rows of tombstones that rise above the graves of the honored dead. As
                        long as this country is filled with an intelligent race of beings, it will
                        be a recorded fact, bearing its instructive moral to each generation as it
                        comes upon the stage. This is inevitable and proper. We would not have
                        history repressed or mutilated. It should stand as it is, for a lesson and a
                        warning. But here is no lesson and no warning inculcated by the Gettysburg
                        survey now going on; and in the manner in which it is conducted it causes,
                        and can cause, none but unfraternal emotions throughout the South, now and
                        for a long time to come.--N. Y. Journal of

                        then reported the following resolutions which were unanimously adopted:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we heartily endorse the platform
                        made by the Democratic convention at Harrisburg, and that we rejoice in the
                        selection of Asa Packer, the clear headed Statesman and the sound-hearted
                        patriot, to be the next Governor of Pennsylvania: and Cyrus L. Pershing, the
                        noble standard bearer of Democracy, the able jurist and Christian gentleman
                        for Supreme Judge.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That in these improvident times we are
                        the uncompromising advocates of retrenchment and reform, in all the
                        departments of the Government, National, State and County; and we deem it
                        the sacred duty of every lover of his country to economise the peoples'
                        money, and bring the administration of public affairs back to old fashioned
                        simplicity and integrity.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the efforts of our opponents to
                        give the ignorant negro the ballot, is subversive of the best interests of
                        the white man; that the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment by the Radical
                        majority of the Pennsylvania Legislature, was a fraud on the people and in
                        direct opposition to their wishes and it should be repealed forthwith.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we are in favor of paying all loss
                        sustained by citizens of the border counties, during the war of the
                        rebellion, believing that their claim upon the State is just and well
                        founded, and we hereby require our Senator and representatives, and urge the
                        Democratic party of the commonwealth to aid us in securing the passage of an
                        act providing compensation.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That as heretofore the Democratic party
                        is the true friend of the laboring man, and that it will continue its
                        efforts to advance his best interests, by giving him a better
                        currency--insuring to him the just reward of his labor, and protecting him
                        from unjust taxation.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That we commend to the Democracy of
                        Franklin county the hearty and united support of the ticket this day placed
                        in nomination.</p>

                    and charging higher prices in some areas than others.<br>
