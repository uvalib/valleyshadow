<b>Border County Damages</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Makes another complaint about the refusal of the State and National
                    governments to compensate border counties for losses incurred during the war.

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The people of York, Adams, Franklin, Cumberland, Fulton and Bedford counties
                        suffered greatly from the depredations of the enemy during the late
                        rebellion. They have always entertained a hope that the losses they
                        sustained would some day be made good by the National or the State
                        government. The application made in their behalf to Congress received no
                        consideration from that body, but this did not lead them to abandon all hope
                        that their just claim to indemnification would finally be allowed.--As the
                        inaction of Congress weakened the hope they had entertained that the
                        National government would come to their relief, their faith grew stronger
                        that the State would do something for them. The
                        Border Counties were the break-water against which the waves of the
                        rebellion had expended their fury. Behind them the balance of the State had
                        reposed in safety. Every consideration of justice and of gratitude seemed to
                        furnish a guarantee that the three millions of people who had escaped the
                        ravages of the invading foe, would offer to make good the losses of the few
                        thousands upon whom that foe had expended his fury. But though more than
                            seven years have elapsed since the first
                        depredations were committed and it will soon be five years since the war was
                        brought to a close, no relief has been given to these plundered people,
                        except the half million dollars appropriated to the Chambersburg sufferers.</p>
                    <p>If our National and State governments had been pinched for funds, and if
                        those who administer them had been making a struggle to relieve the people
                        from taxation, there might be some excuse for the failure to do justice to
                        the Border Counties. But it is well known that Congress appropriated from
                        ten to fifteen million dollars a year, for several years in succession, to
                        feed and clothe Southern negroes who were abundantly able to work and
                        maintain themselves, and it is equally well known that the State Treasurer
                        of Pennsylvania has kept from one to two millions on hand all the time, for
                        the exclusive benefit of the "treasury ring" of which he is the central
                        figure.</p>
                    <p>If this "treasury ring" had not been in existence, the appropriation to
                        Chambersburg would have been a million instead of only half that amount.</p>
                    <p>Now, who are responsible for the denial of justice to the Border Counties?
                        The answer is plain. The Republicans have been in power in every branch of
                        the State and National governments. They could at any time have given us
                        compensation for these losses. They had full and complete command of the
                        means, and all they lacked was the disposition. Generally speaking, "where
                        there is a will there is a way." In this case the
                        way was clear enough, but the will did not
                        exist.</p>
                    <p>We presume the claims of the Border Counties will again be presented to the
                        State Legislature at its next session. What probability is there that the
                        Republican majority in that body will take them into favorable
                        consideration? Suppose a few prominent Republicans go from this section to
                        Harrisburg, to importune their political friends in the Legislature to make
                        an appropriation for the benefit of the border sufferers--what answer will
                        they be likely to get? Will not Senators and Representatives from the
                        Northern, Eastern and Western parts of the State say to them: "Gentlemen, we
                        suppose you are not in earnest about this matter. We take it for granted you
                        are only playing off on the people of your section.--John W. Geary has been
                        Governor of this Commonwealth for the last three years.--During all this
                        period he has never said one word in favor of compensating the border
                        sufferers, either in his official communications to the Legislature or in
                        private conversation with any of its members. He was a candidate for
                        re-election last October. You and the Republicans of the Border Counties,
                        whose interests you pretend to represent here, voted for him. Actions speak
                        louder than words. Your votes weigh heavier than anything you can say to us.
                        For three years Gov. Geary has persistently refused to endorse these border
                        claims, and yet the Republicans of the Border Counties have voted for him.
                        We interpret your real desires from your votes, and we will stand by Gov.
                        Geary in opposition to your claims. We are thankful for the support you have
                        given us. Without the twenty thousand Republican voters of the Border
                        Counties we should have been badly beaten. Go home and continue to humbug
                        them. You will have another chance next fall. Like Governor Geary,
                        Congressman Cessna has not crooked a finger in favor of your border claims.
                        He will be a candidate for re-election. A few of our friends may be disposed
                        to inquire why he has not brought your claims before Congress. Your
                        ingenuity in glazing over the matter in Governor Geary's case gives us great
                        confidence that you will succeed in covering Cessna's tracks. Go home,
                        gentlemen, and take with you the blessings of the treasury ring."</p>
                    <p>What reply could a Border County Republican make to a speech like this? There
                        stands the fact that Geary has never opened his mouth in favor of the
                        suffering people of the Border Counties, and there also stands the facts
                        that the Republicans of those counties voted for him only two weeks ago.
                        Have not the people of other parts of the State a right to infer that those
                        who have so voted do not desire compensation for their losses? We must admit
                        that the inference would be a fair one, and we have serious apprehensions
                        that it will be drawn.</p>
                    <p>We allude to this matter after the election, in a time of perfect freedom
                        from political excitement in the hope that the Republicans of the Border
                        Counties will look at it in its true light. With scarcely an exception, the
                        Democrats in the Legislature have been favorable to the payment of these
                        claims. With few exceptions, the Republicans in that body have been against
                        their payment. At the last session, there was a solid Democratic vote in the
                        Senate in favor of Duncan's motion to print the report of the Damage
                        Commissioners, and a solid Republican vote against it. We are thoroughly
                        convinced that unless the Republicans of the Border Counties lay aside their
                        political prejudices for a season and vote as their interests demand,
                        payment of the Border Damages never will be obtained. They must make their
                        political friends in other parts of the State feel&gt; the danger they incur by denying the just demands
                        of the plundered people of the Border Counties. Unfortunately the favorable
                        opportunity presented by the late election was not improved as it should
                        have been, and this important matter is enveloped in the thick fog of the
                        future. With Asa Packer in the Governor's chair and a Democratic majority in
                        the Legislature, relief would speedily have come to our long-suffering
                        people. With Geary and a Republican majority, what promise does the future
                        hold out when viewed in the light of the past?</p>
                    <p>It is time for the Republicans of this section to take a decided stand in
                        this matter? What will they do? Can any of their organs inform us?</p>
