<b>Our Noble Dead</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Pays homage to local veterans who recently passed away, saddened by the
                    fact that so many have died in such a short period of time.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Death has been busy lately amid the ranks of our illustrious men. In rapid
                        succession, some of those who have shed imperishable lustre upon the
                        American name, have gone down to their graves. Almost before the funeral
                        dirge was chanted for one, we have been called to mourn the loss of another.
                        Pierce, Bell, Stewart, Wool, Pratt, Wickliffe, Peabody, Walker and Kendall,
                        all old in years and crowned with honor, have passed that "undiscovered
                        bourne from whence no traveller returns." Their names are associated with
                        deeds worthy of high renown, on the field of battle, on the stormy ocean, or
                        in the council chamber. True Americans were they all, wedded to the
                        interests of the nation and glorying in her great name and fame. May they
                        sleep in peace. And may we who are left behind, imitate their bright
                        examples and follow in their footsteps, so that when the hour of our
                        departure is at hand and our spirits are about to wander out into the death
                        river, we, too, may approach our graves "like one who wraps the drapery of
                        his couch about him and lies down to pleasant dreams."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Hon. Charles Sumner, United States Senator from Massachusetts, will deliver a
                        lecture in Repository Hall on the evening of Thursday, the 25th inst. His
                        subject will be, "The Question of Caste." There will, of course, be a great
                        desire on the part of our people, to see and hear the distinguished Senator.
                        He has, for a long time, been a prominent actor on the stage of National
                        politics. And although we cannot commend his political doctrines, or admire
                        his political career, yet we must acknowledge his ability, and confess to an
                        anxiety on our own part, to bear him for ourselves. The subject announced
                        will afford him ample scope for the presentation of his ideas of the proper
                        theory of government, as well as exultation at the success of those who have
                        adopted his own political notions. The lecture will, doubtless, be replete
                        with the political experience of the lecturer at the National Capitol.</p>
                    <p>This lecture is in conjunction with the famous Star Course of Philadelphia, a
                        series of discourses which has been the source of great attraction in that
                        City as far as it has gone. We do not doubt that a large audience will
                        assemble in the Hall to hear Mr. Sumner. Tickets, 50 cents. Reserved seats,
                        75 cents.</p>
