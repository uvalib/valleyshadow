<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The municipal authorities in Washington City are still wild on the negro
                        question. They now refuse to issue licenses to hotelkeepers and restauranteurs who object to allowing black men the
                        same privileges in their establishments as whites. What an exhibition of
                        tyranny this is in a Republic! The payment of a license for keeping a hotel
                        or a restaurant was intended as a source of revenue to the government. Can
                        it be possible that this will be pressed as a valid reason for refusing the
                        granting of a license, that the applicant refuses to acknowledge the
                        equality of he races? The merchant may sell, or refuse to sell
                        goods, to whomsoever he pleases. Why should the keepers of hotels and
                        restaurants, and the managers of places of public resort, be obliged to
                        admit persons who are not only objectionable to them, but to the large
                        majority of their guests and visitors also? This attempt to legislate the
                        negro into social as well as political equality with the whites must fail.
                        Strange indeed it is, that intelligent men should support such an obnoxious
                        movement as this, and give encouragement to the political fanatics who enact
                        the infamous legislation that makes such conduct possible. Out of
                        self-respect, let us preserve the dignity of the white race, to the extent
                        at least of enjoying the privilege of sleeping without the forced
                        companionship of the odorous African.</p>

<b>Thanksgiving Day</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Thanksgiving Day passed quietly. Shops were closed, most people took a

                    exhibition of the Magic Lantern was held at the Court House for the enjoyment of
                    Chambersburg's children. "The day was marred by very little rowdyism or disorder
                    of any kind. One fight between two negroes occurred on the Court House pavement,
                    which gave rise to considerable excitement, and caused two bruised faces." The
                    Mechanicsburg Band and the Silver Cornet Band held concerts. The people enjoyed
                    traditional meals of chicken and turkey.<br>
