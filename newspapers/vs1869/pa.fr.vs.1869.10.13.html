<b>Conservative Citizens of Franklin County!</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on the early returns, which appear to indicate a large majority for
                    Democrats in Franklin county. Congratulates all Democrats for their victory
                    against great odds.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>You have fought a good fight and won a grand victory. From the returns sent
                        in, up to the time that we go to press, the Democracy have swept the County
                        by three hundred majority. Your whole County ticket is elected by handsome
                        majorities. Your candidates for the Assembly have both been triumphantly
                        elected, and you have thus given an emphatic expression of your opinions on
                        the question of negro suffrage and negro equality. You have declared in
                        favor of the repeal of the resolution ratifying the infamous fifteenth
                        amendment. In spite of treachery in a certain quarter, from which it should
                        have been least expected, the Democratic candidate for Assembly from this
                        County most likely leads the whole ticket.</p>
                    <p>You have filled the Court House with Democratic officials.</p>
                    <p>You have made a complete Board of Democratic Directors of the Poor, thus
                        rebuking the terrible extravagance which has characterized Radical control
                        of the Poor House.</p>
                    <p>In this result, all conservative men will rejoice. For many years, the
                        Democracy have been fighting valiantly against odds, pursued by malignant
                        enemies who coined and circulated the basest falsehoods in relation to their
                        candidates, and who, in addition, poured out money like water to accomplish
                        their ends.</p>
                    <p>The people have spoken now with emphasis, and have given a larger Democratic
                        majority for the Democratic State ticket in the County than has been given
                        for thirty years.</p>
                    <p>A party that has thus struggled against obstacles like those with which you
                        have contended may well feel proud of the victory which you have so
                        gloriously achieved. The tide so long against you, has at last turned in
                        your favor, and you may now safely expect to reap the fruits of faithful
                        service to the Democratic cause, and earnest devotion to the time-honored
                        principles of the Democratic organization.</p>
                    <p>We congratulate you on your triumph and share with you in your joy.</p>

                    <p>The returns as far as received we give below. The election of the whole

                        likely reach three hundred, and may perhaps exceed it.</p>
