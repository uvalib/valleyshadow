<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The trumpets have ceased to blow. We mean the Radical trumpets. They do not
                        give forth any sound of praise. They are apparently determined on leaving
                        the President to "blow his own horn." The diligent observer of events will
                        recollect the sickening flattery which was heaped upon him three months ago.
                        Radical journals vied with one another in the attempt to exalt him in
                        closest proximity to the skies. He was not only Moses but equal to Moses and
                        Joshua combined. He had spoken nothing, but his silence was construed to
                        mean profundity of thought.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the fact that he had rolled in the gutters and begged
                        "quarters" in the streets of Galena, his sobriety was contrasted with the
                        intemperate habits of his predecessor. He was held up to public admiration
                        as the purest of the pure. We were triumphantly told that at last we had
                        obtained a President who combined the best capacity, the most perfect
                        integrity and a will of iron. Throughout the Union, rang the joyous news
                        that the days of corruption were ended. "Rings" were to be broken up. The
                        shameful extravagance which had marked the administration of the government
                        during the war was to be stopped at once. The thieves who were plundering
                        the public Treasury were to be driven out and punished. Wickedness was no
                        longer to be allowed to rule in high places. Strict integrity was to be
                        required in every official position as the badge of merit.</p>
                    <p>But times have changed since then. Radical journalists seem to have awakened
                        from this pleasant dream in which they had been indulging. "The promised
                        land" seems to be yet afar off. Grant turns out to be more of a man than a
                        God after all. He seems to have the weakness of frail human nature about
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Vague hints are being thrown out that he, too, loves his "toddy." The nation
                        is aware by this time that he is fond of presents and that the larger the
                        gift the more he loves the giver. The men who received the applause of the
                        people, soon after the close of the war, for their unselfish generosity in
                        rewarding the conquering General with munificent presents, it now turns out,
                        had the sagacity to see that this same General would ride into power on this
                        tide of military glory, and, when possessed of power would return their
                        gifts to them, "some thirty, some sixty and some an hundred fold." In this
                        they have not been disappointed. Everybody who gave Grant anything has
                        received an office. The way to reach him is through his pocket. The people,
                        plain, simple, old-fashioned people as they are, are beginning to ask, in
                        what do these presents differ from bribes? And no satisfactory answer has yet been given.--Hence Grant's honesty
                        is at a discount.</p>
                    <p>Again, this mysterious man who shut himself up in utter secrecy is not
                        credited with as much ability as he was a short time ago. He is supposed to
                        be quiet now, not because of depth of thought, but because he really has
                        nothing to say. In what he has said and done, he has betrayed such
                            woful ignorance of law and common sense as to convince
                        everybody that he is not "the right man in the
                        right place."</p>
                    <p>His will, too, does not seem to be made of iron. Like clay in the hands of
                        the potter, he seems to be in the hands of a few personal friends. They have
                        moulded him to suit their own purposes. He is undecided as to what plan he
                        should adopt and, when adopted, he hesitates and doubts as to the propriety
                        of carrying out his plan.</p>
                    <p>The same frightful extravagance exists in every department of the
                        Government.--Whisky rings and other rings are just as formidable as in the
                        days of Johnson's administration. Thieves are still putting their hands into
                        the public crib. Government officials are growing rich upon the perquisites
                        and "pickings" of their offices. The purity which was to mark the
                        administration of Grant has not yet been seen.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the President has surrounded himself with a set of fossils as his
                        constitutional advisers. The Cabinet, strange mixture as it is, is composed
                        in the main of very respectable gentlemen, but they seem to know very little
                        about running the Governmental machine and have utterly failed to command
                        the confidence of the people. Hence there has been thunder all around the
                        sky. The political papers in sympathy with the President have denounced the
                        Cabinet in unmeasured terms. Both in the West and in the East, the cry has
                        gone up for a change.</p>
                    <p>And to make his administration more unpopular, Grant keeps himself shut up as
                        if he were in camp. His sentinels keep guard. All the military regulations
                        are observed. Instead of the observance of the simple manners of the
                        President of a republic, the White House exhibits the show and glitter which
                        remind one of "the pomp and pageantry of war." The attendants are arrogant
                        and supercilious, evidently regarding everybody in the walks of civil life
                        as an inferior.</p>
                    <p>The New York Herald which has been a steady
                        supporter of Grant ever since his nomination, takes occasion to denounce in
                        scathing language this feature of Grant's administration. The people are
                        evidently disappointed with Grant. By the time his term of office expires,
                        they will come to the conclusion that it would have been far better for them
                        and for him to have allowed him to remain in the position of General of the
                        Armies of the United States.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We desire to call the attention of our readers again to the propriety of a
                        general observance of the day set apart for honoring the memories of our
                        dead soldiers. Let every resident of the borough and friend of the soldiers
                        be present. Every consideration which can be of weight with generous minds
                        prompts to it. Respect, gratitude, love, impel to a universal
                        showing of our appreciation of their services and regard for their fame.
                        Who, of our community, has better earned the poor tribute of an annual visit
                        and the offering of a few flowers, than the dead soldier, whose life
                        contributed to the preservation of the land? It is but little we can do, but
                        let us not suffer that little to be undone, much less to be performed
                        sparingly or grudgingly. As John Adams foresaw that Independence Day would
                        become a day of rejoicing, a time for bonfires and illuminations, it is safe
                        to predict that the American people, out of the fulness of their
                        hearts, will enroll in the list of their festal days this newly consecrated
                        Day of Decoration. Year by year its observance will grow more binding, and
                        gathering the citizens of the Republic as it annually recurs, will draw them
                        away from the selfish occupations of their daily lives to the pure and
                        ennobling duty of rendering honor to the preservers of all they have and all
                        they are. We give below the programme of the exercises for the day as
                        furnished us by the marshal:</p>
                    <p>Order of Exercises.--The different Societies will
                        assemble at the Court House, on Saturday afternoon, May 29th, at 3 1/2

                    weeks. He was 73 years old. "Some six months ago, the deceased in old age
                    embraced, as a matter of most happy personal experience, the religion of Jesus.
                    From that glad hour to the moment of his death, his soul reposed so serenely,
                    triumphantly and constantly in Christ, that 'twould almost seem that he was
                    scarcely so much as even tempted either to practical evil doing or spiritual
                    doubt."<br>(Names in announcement:  William Shillito)</blockquote>
