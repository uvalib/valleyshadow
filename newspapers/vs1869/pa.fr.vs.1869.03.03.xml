                    <p>When the Republicans first forced the slave issue upon the country and
                        appealed to the people for support, they declared it to be their object
                        simply to prevent the further extension of slavery. They avowed that they
                        had no desire, as they admitted that they had no right, to interfere with it
                        in the States in which it existed. They pretended to care nothing for the
                        negro himself, their only concern being to prevent the "curse of slavery"
                        from extending itself to regions in which it did not then exist, and they
                        indignantly repelled all suggestions of an ultimate intention on their part
                        to put the black race on the same political or social level with the white.
                        These avowals, admissions and assurances must be well remembered by all who
                        have paid any attention to political affairs during the last twelve years.</p>
                    <p>How have the actions of the Republicans corresponded with their words? They
                        have belied every assurance they gave to the people. At each step they have
                        taken in advance they have pledged themselves to go no farther, but the
                        pledge has been given only to be broken. Starting out as a State Rights
                        party, they have trampled the conceded rights of the States under their
                        cloven feet at every step in their progress. Their latest achievement is a
                        deadly blow at the dearest right possessed by the States, that of regulating
                        the suffrage. Both Houses of Congress have finally passed the following
                        amendment to the Constitution of the United States:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Be it enacted &amp;c.; two-thirds of both Houses
                            concurring</emph>, That the following amendment to the Constitution of
                        the United States be submitted to the Legislatures of the several States,
                        and when ratified by three-fourths thereof, it shall be a part of said
                        Constitution.</p>
                    <p>Article 15. The right of any citizen of the United States to vote shall not
                        be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of
                        race, color, or previous condition of servitude.</p>
                    <p>It is true that this amendment will have to be submitted to the Legislatures
                        of the several States, but three-fourths of them will have the power to
                        force negro suffrage upon the balance against their will. Pennsylvania may
                        refuse to ratify it, because she claims and is unwilling to give up the
                        right to define the qualifications of her own electors; but it may be forced
                        on her, great commonwealth as she is, by the action of such little States as
                        Rhode Island and Vermont, aided by South Carolina with her Negro
                        Legislature.</p>
                    <p>If the people of Pennsylvania permit negro suffrage to be set up in this
                        State, we may well inquire where the Radicals will stop. If our domestic
                        concerns are to be regulated by Congress and by three-fourths of the States,
                        we shall be at the mercy of powers foreign to our soil. No matter what our
                        own opinions and desires may be, we shall have to yield to the opinions and
                        desires of people who live thousands of miles from us. To-day those people
                        may content themselves with requiring us to allow negroes to vote. Next year
                        they may require us to allow negroes to hold office. The third year they may
                        require us to admit negroes into the same schools with white children; and
                        the fourth they may prohibit a white man from marrying a white woman so long
                        as there shall be an unmarried negro wench between the ages of seventeen and
                        seventy-five. Does this seem improbable? Ten years ago it seemed equally
                        improbable that a proposition to establish negro suffrage in all the States
                        could receive a dozen votes in Congress. The rate at which the Radicals have
                        been going since they got into power raises the very serious question, <emph

                <summary>The paper is horrified by the changes in Republican racial policy since the
                    1850's. Again condemns Radicals for trying to force black voting on unwilling
                    states by passing the 15th amendment through the legislatures. Speculates that

                    <p>Under the call issued by Hon. John Cessna and others, a State Temperance
                        Convention was held at Harrisburg on Tuesday and Wednesday of last week. The
                        Convention passed a string of resolutions as long as the last will and
                        testament of Billy Bowlegs, which was written on fifteen feet of bark. They
                        resolved, among a multitude of other things, that Temperance is "a political
                        question of paramount importance to all citizens of the commonwealth," that
                        as existing political parties fail to make it a part of their political
                        faith, a new political organization must be effected; that a prohibitory
                        league must be formed, whose members shall vote against all candidates "in
                        every county, senatorial or representative district, for local or
                        legislative offices," who are not the declared friends of prohibition. It
                        was also resolved to appoint County Committees and a State Central Committee
                        in order to carry forward the work of organizing the new party. And to cap
                        the climax, it was</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved:</emph> That a committee of five be appointed by
                        the chair to prepare a memorial or petition to Congress, either to pass an
                        act or an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting and restraining the
                        manufacture and sale of all alcoholic liquors, except for medicinal and
                        mechanical purposes.</p>
                    <p>This resolution ought to draw over to the new party nearly all the members of
                        the present Radical party, and perhaps it may have been adopted with that
                        view at Mr. Cessna's suggestion. As will be observed, it recognizes the
                        power of Congress to prescribe by a mere act, as well as by an amendment to
                        the Constitution, what the good people of this commonwealth shall drink.
                        That done, and the power of Congress in the premises fully recognized, New
                        England and her Negro allies at the South may prescribe what the good people
                        of this commonwealth shall eat. Is Mr. Cessna aiming to bring us down to
                        bran bread and sawdust pudding?</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Whenever the opponents of the Democratic party have succeeded in electing a
                        President of the United States, they have done it by abandoning their
                        representative men and taking up candidates about whose opinions on
                        important questions there was room for doubt. This was so in 1840, when all
                        the great Whig leaders of that day were thrown overboard and Gen. Harrison
                        nominated. It was so again in 1848, when all the distinguished statesmen of
                        the Whig party were given up for Gen. Taylor. It was so again in 1860, when
                        Seward, the father of the Republican party, and other men of high
                        distinction, were sacrificed for Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>In all these cases, the party thus stooping to conquer was punished for its
                        abandonment of principle. Harrison died, and Tyler administered the
                        government upon Democratic principles, to the unutterable disgust of a large
                        majority of those who had voted for him. Taylor died too, and Fillmore
                        enraged a large number of the very men who had elected him by approving
                        certain important bills which were supported by the Democracy and opposed by
                        the great body of the Whig party. Lincoln died likewise, and Johnson
                        maddened the Radical party by administering the government on conservative
                        principles.</p>
                    <p>In nominating Gen. Grant, the opponents of the Democracy played the old game
                        that had proved successful in the instances we have cited. Will they reap
                        the same reward? Are we destined again to see them rage and hear them howl?</p>
                    <p>For some time past there have been mutterings that betokened a coming
                        storm.--Every word said in Congress against the repeal of the
                        tenure-of-office act has been prompted by distrust of Grant. The disgraceful
                        rumpus in joint convention, when the electoral votes were counted, had its
                        origin in jealousies and distrusts connected with the same distinguished
                        personage.--There really appears to be more cause than we had suspected the
                        existence of for Radical anxiety about the President elect. Grant has thus
                        far foiled the persistent efforts of the most active of them to discover who
                        will be in his Cabinet, and this they look upon as an evil omen. He has done
                        more. He has actually declared himself independent of them. Imagine Col.
                        McClure's disgust at being talked to in the following style:</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.--Among the numerous callers at Grant's headquarters
                        to-day was A.K. McClure of Pennsylvania. McClure asked Grant directly if he
                        would not appoint Gov. Curtin to a place in his cabinet. The General replied
                        that it would be impossible to do so. McClure then said, in that case he
                        felt compelled to say that to give satisfaction in Pennsylvania, the
                        appointment must be given to some man who has been prominently identified
                        with the republican party and is an active politician. To illustrate what he
                        meant, he said: It must be no such man as George H. Stuart, A.E. Borie or
                        John Welsh. Grant instantly replied that he could not see what objection any
                        loyal man could have to such a man as George H. Stuart, who had done so much
                        for the country and was so widely known. Mr. McClure then made some remarks
                        about the prospect--that if such appointments were to be made the republican
                        party would be defeated in Pennsylvania in the election for Governor next
                        fall. Gen. Grant replied: "I am not, myself, a representative of any
                        political party, although a political party elected me." Gen. Grant
                        concluded: "I would not have you to understand that Mr. Stuart is the man
                        selected." The interview has been much talked about at the capital to-day.
                        Mr. McClure says he has no doubt from what was said that Mr. Stuart is the
                        Pennsylvanian to be selected for the cabinet.</p>
                    <p>The Washington correspondent of the New York <emph rend="italic">Times</emph>
                        of Feb. 26th, writing about Col. McClure's raid on Gen. Grant, said:</p>
                    <p>It is best that he should be made solely responsible for it in his own words,
                        which were taken down verbatim from his own lips this afternoon. This is his
                        version:</p>
                    <p>"I went up with a letter from Judge Read, concurred in by Judges William and
                        Agnew. It was put upon the ground that Williams was to be the candidate of
                        the Republican party for Supreme Court Judge. I had also a dispatch to the
                        effect that Governor Geary, who is to be the candidate for Governor, had
                        also written a letter which is now in the mails. Both letters appeal to
                        General Grant to appoint Governor Curtin on a seat in the Cabinet, as a man
                        having the confidence of the Republican party of the State, and as the only
                        man who, in their judgment, could save the State next fall."</p>
                    <p>When this came out, Gov. Geary immediately telegraphed to Gen. Grant that he
                        had not written in favor of anybody. Judges Agnew and Williams have
                        authorized it to be stated that they neither wrote nor promised to write for
                        Curtin. And Col. McClure publishes a card in which he says, in effect, that
                        Geary is such a liar that it is never safe to take his word for
                        anything.--Gen. Grant has a happy family on his hands just now.</p>
