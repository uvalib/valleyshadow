<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor condemns the United Brethren for the "animus which governs them
                    as a religious body." Among the resolutions of the United Brethren Conference
                    are condemnations of slavery and an expression of their commitment to "secure
                    the complete enfranchisement of the negro with all the rights of an American
                    citizen," an amendment apparently proposed by a resident of Augusta county.<br>(Names in announcement:   Glossbrenner,   Markwood,   Shuey,   Bachtel,   Rimel)</blockquote>

<b>Don't Leave Virginia</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors discourage emigration to Brazil. It is understandable, they
                    argue, that people should want to leave because "the rights properly due them as
                    citizens of the United States are at present denied them." Nevertheless, they
                    warn, the promise of a better future in Brazil is only a "mirage." Emigrants
                    would in fact be met with "frowns of prejudice and ignorance" in their new home.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are sorry to see that some of the citizens of this State seem to be
                        contemplating expatriation and to be making preparations to emigrate to
                        Brazil. As the rights properly due to them as citizens of the United States
                        are at present denied to them, it is natural that they should feel
                        dissatisfied and desire to emigrate to a country where they believe a
                        greater degree of liberty can be enjoyed. We fully appreciate the feelings
                        of restiveness experienced by a proud and liberty loving people who are
                        debarred the enjoyment of their constitutional rights. But whilst this is
                        the case, we would desire them to remain at home in the good old State of
                        Virginia, believing that it will not be a great while before they will be
                        allowed to enjoy the rights to which, as citizens of the United States, they
                        justly entitled. If ever, this is not the time to "leave our own to stand
                        upon foreign soil." At this time, our dear old mother, Virginia, desires the
                        presence, counsel and aid of all her children. She would be pained to see
                        them leaving her altars and firesides to seek homes in a foreign land. She
                        appeals to them with a mother's love to remain with her and share her
                        fortunes for weal and woe. We believe that there are but few Virginians who
                        will fail to hearken to her affectionate appeal. The sons of Virginia should
                        be more devoted to her than ever before. Such was the patriotic conduct of
                        Virginia immediately before the war, so earnestly did she strive to preserve
                        the peace, and so noble and heroic was her conduct during the four years of
                        bloody strife, that we are prouder than ever before of having been born upon
                        Virginia soil.</p>
                    <p>We would caution the young, ardent and imaginative against the flattering
                        tale which the siren, Hope, pours into their willing ears, like a "leprous
                        distilment," wooing them but to betray. To them, Brazil has become, in the
                        language of the Richmond Commercial Bulletin,
                        "what that vast mysterious inland region of Florida was to the adventurous
                        and gold seeking Spaniard -- the El Dorado of hope and promise. Upon that
                        land of great rivers and great mountains -- of golden-tinted fruits and
                        dark-eyed maidens -- of waving pampas and roving steeds, the eye and the
                        heart of thousands of our new Jasons are fixed. Here, they argue, will they
                        find the Golden Fleece of Fortune -- here the quiet and peace of
                        untrammelled life. But do they take into consideration the relentless
                        chances that environ their pilgrimage with failure. Do they reflect upon the
                        mental and social short-comings of those whose society they propose to seek
                        -- of the mirage that lure them on, and of the frowns of prejudice and
                        ignorance that may meet them at the threshold of their new homes? We do not
                        think that these possibilities have entered into the hopeful visions of
                        those of our people whose hearts are fixed upon expatriation, and we would
                        urge those Virginians who contemplate a severance of the ties that bind them
                        to the soil that holds their ancestors to think calmly whether, after all,
                        with all the woes and desolation that hang about her -- with all her present
                        plentiful lack of work for man's hands and her plentiful abundance of
                        woman's tears -- with all her great history and honorable record -- with all
                        the many voices with which she calls upon her sons to abide with her --
                        whether Virginia, proud and loyal and true, is not better far than other
                        lands to live and labor in; and, when the turmoil of life is over and the
                        recompenses of the fortune have no further power to harm or change, whether
                        it be not better that her children should repose in her protecting bosom
                        awaiting the last summons, than to lie in state even in the religious light
                        of Santa Croce or surrounded by the marble splendors of the Chamber of the
                        Dead in Westminster Abbey."</p>

<b>Encouraging Sign</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

                    Southerners "an early restoration of all their constitutional rights, except

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article argues that if, "as President Johnson very properly maintains,"

                    qualifications for office beyond those specified in the Constitution. Attempts
