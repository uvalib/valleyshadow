                    <p>Staunton, Sept. 14th, 1865</p>
                    <p>A. W. Campbell, Editor Intelligencer, Wheeling, W. Va.:</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir -- I have received your letter asking "information as to the real
                        state of things in the Valley and on from there to Richmond, and as to the
                        real feelings of the people, and how they are affected toward the
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>You express a desire and purpose to use your "pen and press in the best
                        interests of a right restoration," and you invite me to write you and "a
                        full, free and frank letter, to be used in promoting the cause of Union
                        which you trust we both have at heart.</p>
                    <p>I accept your invitation in the spirit in which it is given, and I will write
                        you truly the results of my personal observation, and of an expensive
                        intercourse with persons of intelligence from many parts of the State.</p>
                    <p>1. As To Secession.</p>
                    <p>Opposition to the authority of the United States is completely at an end in
                        Virginia; and I doubt if theer can be found in the State a man, woman or
                        child who thinks it either practicable or desirable to renew it in any form.</p>
                    <p>The supremacy of the National Constitution and law is as thoroughly felt and
                        acknowledged in Virginia as in any part of the Union, and there is no more
                        necessity for an armed force to maintain th authority of the Government here
                        than there is in any Northern or Western State.</p>
                    <p>The central idea which now controls i the public opinion of Virginia is, that
                        the Union must be regarded as a fixed and enduring fact, and that everything
                        of value in our future that depends upon Government or Nationality is
                        inseparably connected with the peace, prosperity and success of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>This belief is universal, earnest and practical. So much so that, if we could
                        now have a free election without restriction as to the right to vote or to
                        be voted for, no man who does not entertain it, and intend in good faith to
                        act upon it, could ejected to office of any kind in any part of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>The pretense that elections thus far held in Virginia have turned upon
                        "Unionism" or "secessionism," or that those now pending are likely to be so
                        influenced, is a mere device of office-seekers to appropriate to themselves
                        all the merit of the one and to throw upon their competitors all the odium
                        of the other. Among the most active in the resort to this expedient are well
                        known secessionists who, under the "Confederacy," used it with the ends
                        reversed.</p>
                    <p>We have, as yet, no party divisions in Virginia, and our elections
                        necessarily turn upon the personal popularity of Candidates, all of whom
                        profess substantially the same opinions and purposes in regard to public
                        affairs.--Under such circumstances, it will not, I think, be deemed
                        unnatural or improper that our people should be influenced by sympathies and
                        preferences which have grown up in the progress of the trials and sufferings
                        through which they have so recently passed.</p>
                    <p>2. As to Slavery.</p>
                    <p>The people of Virginia do not believe that the dealings of the government
                        with slavery have been either just or expedient, or that the interests of
                        either master or slaver will be promoted thereby. They look forward with
                        painful apprehensions to the future of a community whose industrial system
                        has been so recklessly overthrown, and of a helpless race who have had
                        freedom thrust upon them without preparation for its duties or
                        responsibilities, and are thus, without fault of their own, handed over to
                        want, suffering and probable extinction.</p>
                    <p>They are satisfied, however, that the mischief is already practically done,
                        and that any attempt to retrace the steps which have been taken would be
                        wholly impracticable, and could only serve to increase the trouble and
                        confusion which are now impending. You may, therefore, expect, with
                        confidence, that, so far from seeking to obstruct measures deemed proper to
                        complete the work of freeing the slaves, the people of Virginia will
                        promptly do all that may be necessary on their part to carry it into full
                        effect, and to make it, as far as practicable, beneficial to all concerned.</p>
                    <p>To establish a system of free labor by which these "Freedmen" may be saved
                        from the poverty and misery which will naturally attend upon their want of
                        industry and thrift, will require great good sense and much kindness and
                        forbearance. Fortunately for them and for the cause of humanity, it is not
                        true as has been charged, that the white people of Virginia have any feeling
                        of hatred or ill-will toward them -- or any disposition to deprive them, by
                        legislation or otherwise, of substantial benefits of freedom. Indeed the
                        relations between the two races are still marked by the mutual kindness
                        which has always attended their intercourse, and which, in view of all the
                        disturbing influence which have been brought to bear, may be regarded as
                        truly wonderful.</p>
                    <p>The effect of freedom upon the character and conduct of the negro is yet to
                        be see, and will require time and experience to determine who far it will be
                        either wise or safe to confer upon him additional rights or privileges,
                        civil, social or political.</p>
                    <p>3. "A Right Restoration"</p>
                    <p>If I am right in what I have said, it would seem to follow that the
                        difficulties in the war of restoring Virginia at once to all her relations
                        with the Federal Government are, so far as her people are concerned, purely
                        imaginary.</p>
                    <p>On this subject you may rely with entire confidence upon the truth of the
                        following proposition:</p>
                    <p>1. That the people of Virginia are now fully prepared in good faith and upon
                        earnest convictions of duty and interest, to take upon themselves all the
                        obligations, and to perform all the duties which justly belong to them as
                        citizens of the United States.</p>
                    <p>2. That our Courts of Justice and Police now organized according to the
                        Constitution and laws of Virginia, are as fully competent to administer
                        justice and to maintain order, and may be as confidently relied upon for
                        that purpose by all classes and conditions of our people, as at any time in
                        our past history.</p>
                    <p>3. That it wold be not only perfectly [unclear], but eminently wise to
                        withdraw from Virginia all commandants of posts with them armed guards, all
                        Provost Marshals with their military officials, and all lecturers and other
                        agents of the Freedmen's Bureau. These instruments of martial law have
                        become wholly unnecessary since the organization of our civil tribunals, and
                        their continuance among our people tends to alienation and unkindness rather
                        than conciliation and good will.</p>
                    <p>4. That if our people could be assured of their entire freedom to act, and
                        that constitutional actions on their part would be sustained they would go
                        on with cheerful alacrity, and in a spirit of national conservatism, to
                        conform their State Government to the new circumstances in which they find
                        themselves, and to restore the constitutional harmony between the State and
                        Federal Governments.</p>
                    <p>5. That those who count as political capital any supposed preference on the
                        part of our people among obsolete party organizations, and those who
                        apprehend that resentments, growing out of past collisions will control our
                        future political relations, alike fail to appreciate "the situation." They
                        will all find that freeing the slaves has set the masters free from the
                        necessities which once controlled their political action, and that our
                        people are far more accessible to influence suggested by the future than by
                        the past.</p>
                    <p>I have thus stated truly and fairly the opinions and purposes of the people
                        of Virginia, founded upon pure convictions of duty and interest, but I take
                        it for granted that you look for something higher and better than this, and
                        that you include in your idea of a right restoration, a revival of those
                        feelings of kindness and good will which once existed between the people of
                        several States and of that affectionate loyalty to the common government
                        which in the earlier days of the Republic, so greatly distinguished our
                        whole people.</p>
                    <p>It is due to candor to say that no such revival has yet taken place in
                        Virginia, though I do not at all despair of seeing it brought about. Time,
                        of itself, will do much toward relieving the bitterness of recent strife.
                        The renewal of commercial intercourse must be followed by the
                        re-establishment of social relations between the people of the different
                        States, and if we can have constitutional equality fully recognized and
                        practically enforced by laws which shall protect alike the people of all
                        parts of our country, the people of Virginia will not be slow to give their
                        affections to a government thus commending itself to the approval of their
                        judgement.</p>
                    <p>Martial law, confiscation libels, and State trials will undoubtedly postpone
                        such a result, but I hope they will all soon give way under the influence of
                        reviving confidence and good will.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully,</p>
                    <p>Your obedient servant,</p>
                    <p>John B. Baldwin.</p>

<b>In Or Out Of The Union</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial argues that if the Southern states are in the Union then
                    "the only restrictions which can be rightfully imposed upon the liberties of the
                    people are those embraced in the Constitution." But the editor also suggests
                    that these rights will "never be accorded to us if we do not claim them."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The State of Virginia is either in or out of the Union. If Virginia is in the
                        Union, she is entitled to all the rights which the Constitution of the
                        United States guarantees to the several States comprising the Union. If she
                        is out of the Union, she is entitled to perfect freedom and independence,
                        and has the right to adopt such rules of Government as may suit herself. If
                        she is not a member of the Union , she is not entitled to elect any one to
                        represent her in the Congress of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The administration of Mr. Lincoln made war upon the people of the States
                        which passed ordinances of secession, because it denied the right of
                        secession, and considered all ordinances of secession as mere nullities --
                        that, in spite of such ordinances, the States claiming to secede were still
                        in the Union, and under obligations to obey the laws of the United States.
                        If the administration had recognized the seceding States as being out of the
                        Union, it would have acknowledged, by such recognition, that it had no right
                        to make war upon the citizens of those States. The war upon the South has no
                        justification save upon the theory that the States claiming to secede were,
                            all the time, States in the Union.</p>
                    <p>If this theory be correct, (and it has been so decided by the stern
                        arbitrament to which the question was submitted) then the Southern States
                        were, during the war, and still are, in the Union, and, consequently,
                        entitled to all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution to the several
                        States of the Union.</p>
                    <p>This being so, it becomes the duty of every citizen to claim the right
                        guaranteed to them by the Constitution. The only restrictions which can be
                        rightfully imposed upon the liberties of the people are those embraced in
                        the Constitution of the U. S., and the laws passed in pursuance thereof, not in violation
                        thereof. But some say, we are a conquered people, we are governed by might,
                        we are helpless, we are in the power of those who have no regard for the
                        Constitution, that it is folly to talk about our Constitutional rights, that
                        we should meekly acquiesce in whatever the dominant party should do,
                        however, violative of our Constitution rights. We do not concur with those
                        entertaining such sentiments. We believe that we should contend in a proper
                        spirit -- the spirit of people "who know their rights, and knowing dare
                        maintain" -- for all the rights guaranteed to us by the Constitution, and we
                        have faith that they will be obtained, if the proper course be pursued. They
                        never will be accorded to us, if we do not claim them. A people willing to
                        surrender their birthright do not deserve to enjoy it.</p>
