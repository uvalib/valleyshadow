<b>A Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Addresses the proposition of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to build a
                    line from Staunton to Baltimore, decried by Richmond merchants as a measure that
                    would sap their commerce. The author claims that the Legislature should abandon
                    the "suicidal policy" of forcing producers to trade in Richmond.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Richmond Dispatch illustrating the short sighted policy of the "Richmond
                        Merchants" is virtuously indignant at the "startling propositions" of the
                        Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to build a branch from Winchester, along the
                        Valley, to Salem. The Dispatch says 'its effect would be divert from
                        Richmond much of the trade and traffic which our people have for years been
                        led to expect from Southwest Va., and the Valley. This simply means that
                        Baltimore would thus afford a market so much better than Richmond, that the
                        people of Southwest Va., and the Valley would trade with Baltimore because
                        it would be their private interest and resist this opportunity for the
                        Valley producers to seek better prices than Richmond merchants will give.</p>
                    <p>The Legislature is invoked to "consider" the matter. We trust it will do so
                        for the sake of the interest of the great producing portion of the people
                        which it equally represents with that of the "Commission Merchants" -- a
                        class useful enough, perhaps, but still which lives upon the profits arising
                        from this very want of facilities which requires a "middle-man" between
                        producer and consumer.</p>
                    <p>We admit the propriety of giving the preferences to our own State business
                        men, but calm that the "reciprocity" should not require our State producers
                        to make a sacrifice for the sake of increasing profits at the expense of
                        these very producers -- equally our own State citizens.--Just thirty years
                        ago, Baltimore proposed to build a railroad throughout the Valley, from
                        Harper's Ferry to the Tennessee line, and with a branch from Staunton to the
                        Ohio River, and not only not tax the people to build it, but actually
                        offered to pay a bonus forever into the State Treasury for the privilege.
                        But the Richmond merchants, naturally enough, defeated it by appeals to
                        "build up your own cities" -- and by promises that the Valley should have a
                        better market is not yet offered to counteract the greater expense of
                        getting to Baltimore. Meantime our producing community has been heavily
                        taxed to build roads, and all the while borne the tax upon their produce
                        consisting in the different of cost and time required to reach the beset
                        market amounting in thirty years to millions of dollars. This fact, alone
                        has discouraged thousands of our people, and sent them off to seek in mere
                        favored lands the just reward labor.</p>
                    <p>If our country had reached its maximum of production there night be some
                        excuse for controlling the disposition of its products to build up
                        particular cities. But when the capacity of production has been scarcely
                        tested, sound policy would seek to encourage the producer to his utmost, and
                        expect thus eventually, and more surely, to build up cities in which the
                        surplus production seeks its market.</p>
                    <p>In that very western country to which many of our farmers have in this last
                        thirty years been driven, the freest competition in choice of markets has
                        been granted, and, in consequence, all along these competing railroads the
                        "villages" of this thus developed region now exceed Richmond in wealth and
                        population.</p>
                    <p>The cost, and thus tax, upon the producer of getting his produce to market by
                        a railroad is increased by each additional mile of railroad -- the charge
                        being by the mile. Now a railroad from Staunton, for instance, to Baltimore,
                        would be something over 200 miles long, while to Richmond, by a short track
                        direct from Charlottesville, would be little over 100 miles, a difference of
                        100 per cent. If Richmond fears competition with
                        Baltimore under the great difference, for the Augusta trade, it indicates
                        heavy charge upon this trade to force it to go
                        to Richmond, notwithstanding. And to carry out the policy of requiring
                        Virginia to trade with Richmond, merely because it is in Virginia,
                        regardless of cost to the producer, would be to compel the citizens all over the State, no matter how near to
                        Baltimore, and better prices for their products, to bring them to Richmond
                        that her merchants should make fortunes.</p>
                    <p>It is time such suicidal policy were abandoned. Let the Legislature now
                        "consider" how it can best develop the unlimited resources of the State's
                            producing wealth, on which all other wealth
                        at last depends, and then it will follow, as the night does the day, that
                        "our own cities" will find their true prosperity, and be "built up"
                        permanently. Let her commission merchants and her local papers go to work,
                        like Baltimore, and build avenues that will induce trade there; let them
                        make, for instance, the "short track," so long talked of, from the Valley to Richmond, thus bringing almost the
                        whole Valley nearer to Richmond than to Baltimore, and let them cease
                        whining because, without these facilities, people are left simply to sell
                        where they can sell highest and buy where they can buy cheapest. Hercules
                        helps those who put their own shoulders in the wheel.</p>
