<b>Duty of Voters</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial castigates "the Press of the State" for urging voters to
                    only elect men who will be able to take the test oath. The editor contends that
                    voters should elect whoever they think can best represent them because the test
                    oath itself is unconstitutional, and, he concludes, if the "radicals in
                    Congress" deny those men their seats it will destroy the radicals and
                    "strengthen the conservative party of the North."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In our issue of September the 5th, we showed that the Constitution imposed no
                        other restrictions upon eligibility to the House of Representatives in
                        Congress than that the Representative should be 25 years of age, seven years
                        at citizen of the United States, and, when elected, an inhabitant of the
                        State in which he shall be chosen. These are the only Constitutional restrictions, and any others which have been
                        imposed by Congress are palpably unconstitutional. The only oath which the Constitution requires
                        members of Congress to take is, that they shall support
                            the Constitution of the United States, and the imposition of any
                        other is without Constitutional authority. There is no Constitutional
                        authority for requiring persons elected to Congress to take the test oath
                        imposed by Congress in July 1862.</p>
                    <p>No one can vote now who has not taken a solemn oath to "faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United
                            States," and, consequently, it is the sworn duty of every voter
                            to the Government to vote for those only who
                        will "support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States,"
                        and it is their duty to themselves to support
                        those only who will defend all rights guaranteed to them by the
                        Constitution.</p>
                    <p>The course of the Press of this State in urging the withdrawal of all
                        candidates for Congress, who cannot take the unconstitutional Congressional
                        test oath, is wrong both in its principle and policy. It is wrong in
                        principle, because it acknowledges the right of Congress to impose
                        restrictions upon eligibility which are without Constitutional authority;
                        and wrong in policy, because if we do not assert and claim our rights they
                        will never be granted to us.</p>
                    <p>We maintain that, under the obligations of the solemn oaths which all voters
                        have taken to "faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of
                        the United States," it is their duty to support those only who will not
                        submit to unconstitutional requirements. The people can effectually
                        "support, protect, and defend the Constitution" only by electing
                        Representatives who will oppose all unconstitutional legislation.</p>
                    <p>If we acknowledge the right of Congress to prescribe qualifications of
                        eligibility, Congress can prescribe any it may choose. It may prescribe any
                        it may choose. It may prescribe that the Representatives shall be made a man
                        of color, that he shall be six fee high, that he
                        shall weigh 200 lbs., that he shall have red hair, or any other
                        qualification equally absurd. It is a monstrous proposition, and "tis
                        strange, passing strange" that any sensible man should believe that it was
                        designed by the wise authors of the Constitution to invest Congress with
                        such a right.</p>
                    <p>We should elect men who deny this right, and who would refuse to take an
                        unconstitutional requirement. Those, even, who could take the Congressional
                        test oath without any violations of conscience, should refuse to do so, upon the ground that it is an unauthorized and
                        unconstitutional requirement, and that it is their duty, under their sworn
                        obligations to "faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of
                        the United States," to refuse to do any act which would recognize, in the
                        slightest degree, the right of Congress to impose such a test. Every friend
                        of the Constitution who may be elected a Representative, whether from the
                        North or South, should peremptorily and persistently refuse to submit to
                        such a requirement. They should take their stands boldly upon the firm and
                        solid basis of the Constitution, and each be willing, like Fitz James, to
                        exclaim:</p>
                    <p>"Come one, come all! this r[unclear] shall fly</p>
                    <p>From its firm base as soon as I."</p>
                    <p>Suppose the citizens of this State should elect only such men as would take
                        the oath, and that they should move in Congress the appeal of the
                        Congressional test oath, would not the members from the North say that the
                        people of this State showed their approval of the test oath by electing only
                        such as would agree to take it? They would say that such was the sentiment
                        of Virginia, that all candidates who could not take the oath were either
                        compelled to withdraw from the canvass before the election, or were defeated
                        at the polls. Should Virginia elect such only as could take the oath, and
                        they would agree to do so, she would be playing the very game which would
                        suit those who wish to keep Representative men
                        out of Congress.</p>
                    <p>If we elect men who were opposed to secession, who merely acted with their
                        States and who cannot take the oath because of their sympathy with their own
                        people whilst engaged in a mighty death struggle, and they should be denied
                        admittance, it would do more than anything else that could happen to
                        strengthen the conservative party of the North.</p>
                    <p>It should be borne in mind that loyal men are entitled to be represented by
                        men of their choice, and that no man can vote who is not recognized as a
                        loyal man -- whence it follows that those who are entitled to vote have the
                        right to be represented by those they may elect. Would Congress dare to
                        reject the Representatives of loyal citizens who possess the Constitutional
                        qualifications, and who are in wise responsible for the inauguration of the
                        rebellion? If the radicals in Congress should deny admittance to such
                        Representatives, of loyal citizens, it would break down their party, build
                        up a controlling conservative party, and finally result in the restoration
                        to us of all our Constitutional rights. It is our duty to maintain our
                        rights firmly. If our Constitutional rights are to be denied to us, let it
                        be against our earnest protest, and not with our consent. We may be
                        overpowered, but we cannot be debased and degraded except by our own
                        conduct. We should so comport ourselves as to maintain our own self respect,
                        and to deserve the respect of others. As we said on a former occasion, "The
                        people of the South have lost nearly all save honor. Their honor and
                        manhood, they should, by all means, preserve."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Friday evening last, two colored persons, a man and woman, got out of the
                        stage at the American Hotel, and, presuming upon social equality, went into
                        the sitting room of the Hotel and seated themselves upon one of the sofas,
                        whilst another was occupied by white ladies who had just arrived. As soon as
                        the Proprietor discovered the unwarrantable liberty taken by this "gemmen ob
                        color," he showed him in a striking and forcible manner that he had wholly
                        mistaken his social status. The negro sought redress by reporting the case
                        to the Provost Marshal, who, after hearing the facts, told the negro that he
                        had received the kind of treatment he deserved, but not to the degree to
                        which his improper conduct justly entitled him. We suppose that negro doubts
                        whether "de bottom rail be on de top now."</p>

                    <p>Mr. Editor</p>
                    <p>Please publish the following paragraphs, written in reply to one or two
                        points, made in the Hon. A. H. H. Stuart's last card to the voters of the
                        District.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart accuses me of quoting from private letter of his to prove that he
                        was opposed to reconstruction as late as February last. This I did not do. i
                        never saw the letters; but Dr. Woods, at the Albemarle Court, upon the hustings, charged Mr. Stuart with having
                        written -- letters in which he said, "we could never live with the Northern
                        vandals again; that the Southern members would have to legislate with bowie
                        knives and pistols." Mr. Stuart being present, did not
                            deny it.</p>
                    <p>I have heard that some of Mr. Stuart's friends are circulating a report that
                        my loyalty was questioned by the Confederate Government; that my contract
                        was about to be annulled, and that I went to Richmond to prove my loyalty. I
                        am certain that Mr. Stuart can have given this report no countenance, as it
                        is entirely false.</p>
                    <p>The firm of Lewis, Crawford, &amp; Co., had contract with Jos. R.
                        Anderson &amp; Co., that paid handsomely. The Government forced us to relinquish this, and make one with
                        them that did not pay.</p>
                    <p>I here repeat, with emphasis, that, if elected to the U. S. Congress, I can, conscientiously, and will take the oath.
                        Mr. Stuart says he cannot take it, and that he
                        would despise himself if he did.</p>
