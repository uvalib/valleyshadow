                    <p>10. Three quarters of an hour will be allowed during the winter months for

                        for the first offence, and if repeated, will be followed by dismissal and
                        loss of such pay as shall be adjudged against him by the proper authority.</p>
                    <p>12. All difficulties that my arise between the employees shall be adjusted by
                        the employer, and, if not satisfactory, an appeal may be taken to an agent

                    <p>17. A cheerful and willing performance of duty will be required of the

                        employer; to inform him of anything that is going amiss; to be peaceable,
                        orderly and pleasant; to discourage theft, and endeavor by his conduct to
                        establish a character for honesty, industry and thrift.</p>
                    <p>21. In case of any controversy in regard to the contract or its regulations,
                        between the employer and the employee, the agent of the Bureau for the
                        county shall be the common arbiter to whom the difficulty shall be
                    referred.</p>

<b>To the Voters in the 6th Congressional District</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This letter from John Lewis responds to a similar one from Alexander
                    Stuart, his competitor for a seat in Congress. Lewis defends his "Union"
                    credentials, distances himself from secessionists, attacks Stuart's actions
                    during the war and questions his ability to take the test-oath.<br>(Names in announcement:  John F. Lewis)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Like my competitor, Mr. Stuart, I was an original Union man. I was taught
                        from my childhood to regard the Union as the palladium of our liberties, and that any attempt to destroy it,
                        would result in war, desolation and ruin. I believed that secession would
                        prove "a shirt of Nessus" to the South.</p>
                    <p>I did not believe in the right, justice or practicability of secession, but
                        believed it to be conceived in sin, brought forth in iniquity, and hat it
                        would be baptized in the best blood of the country. How, then, could I be
                        expected to vote for, or sign an ordinance claiming to exercise such a
                        right?</p>
                    <p>I would not have done it for all the honors within the gift of the people.</p>
                    <p>I could not desert my principles "and go with the multitude to do evil.</p>
                    <p>My competitor was a very good "Union man," until the Union needed his
                        support. He was a very good friend of "Billy Patterson," until Billy was
                        struck; then he deserted him, but as soon as Billy triumphs over his foes,
                        he (Mr. Stuart) returns to his first love, and reminds Billy how devotedly,
                        how ardently, how sincerely he had loved him, and how delighted he would be
                        serve him in the next Congress. But "Billy" will be very apt to say to him:
                        "You deserted me in the very hour of my trials, I will not trust you, I want
                        none of your counsels."</p>
                    <p>No longer ago than last February or march when it was evident that further
                        resistance would only result in the sacrifice of human life, and end in
                        subjugation and ruin, some of the most prominent gentlemen in the State
                        desired Mr. Stuart to join them in an effort to stop further effusion of
                        blood. But Mr. Stuart declined, saying, "nothing could done that we could
                        not live with the Northern Vandals again, the breach was too wide, and too
                        bloody, that the Southern members would have to legislate in Congress with
                        bowie knives and pistols."</p>
                    <p>If this is to be the style of legislation, whilst I yield to Mr. Stuart in
                        diplomacy, in oratory and statesmanship, i must be allowed to say that I
                        think I would make as good, if not a better "Congressman" than Mr. Stuart.
                        But If I believed that this was to be the style of legislation, I would not
                        consent to represent you -- I would prefer that you should send Mr. Stuart.
                        But to be serious: -- Whilst I sympathized deeply with our people at home,
                        and with our brave and gallant soldiers in the field, who were, in many
                        instances, the victims of an odious, tyrannical and unconstitutional
                        conscription, and had neither negroes nor lands to fight for, I never for
                        one moment sympathized with, or desired the success of secession. If I had
                        believed it a struggle for liberty, I would have been ashamed to have held
                        up my head anywhere else than in the army. I never could have been found
                        enjoying the ease and comforts of home, when others, who had nothing to
                        fight for, were enduring all the hardships of camp-life, and risking their
                        lives upon the battle-field for me and mine. The army would have been the
                        place to have shown sympathy for the cause, but like the war horse mentioned
                        in the book of Job, Mr. Stuart smelled the battle afar off.</p>
                    <p>But Mr. Stuart says he hated secession as much as any one, and prophesied
                        that it would result in ruin to the South, and that he did not sign the
                        ordinance until he was instructed by the people at the polls. Now let us
                        examine this matter. The ordinance of secession was passed by the Convention
                        on the 17th day of April, 1861, 88 voting for, and 55 voting against it. On
                        Monday, the 23rd of April, just five days after the passage of the
                        ordinance, Mr. Stuart, in a speech delivered at the Court house of his
                        county, advised his constituents to vote for the ratification of the
                        ordinance of secession, and subsequently canvassed his county, urging his
                        constituents to vote for the ordinance. So you will perceive, that Mr.
                        Stuart first instructed his constituents to vote for the ordinance, and then
                            voted for the ratification himself, urged
                        men to volunteer in the Southern army, but now claims that he signed the
                        ordinance under instructions. I did not sign the ordinance; I did not advise
                        persons to volunteer, or vote for the ratification of the ordinance of
                        secession. How, then, can Mr. Stuart say that I would be as objectionable to
                        the Northern people as himself?</p>
                    <p>But Mr. Stuart says I had a Government contract. I admit I was one of a
                        company who owned and carried on Iron Works.--But I deny that I voluntarily
                        made a contract with the Government, or ever made a pound of iron for the
                        purpose of aiding the Confederate cause. When to shield me from the
                        threatened violence of the secessionists, it was urged by some of my
                        friends, that I was making iron for the Government, I invariably denied that
                        I was making iron from any desire to aid that I was making iron from any
                        desire to aid the Confederate cause. I can, and
                        will, take an oath, that I never, voluntarily, gave aid or
                        encouragement to the Confederate Government.</p>
                    <p>I was the only member of the Convention East of Alleghany Mountains, who did
                        not sign the Ordinance of Secession, which has proven to the South, (as I
                        predicted it would,) "the direful spring of woes unnumbered." I am proud of
                        my course in the Convention -- whether it is popular or unpopular, I would
                        not exchange records with Mr. Stuart to secure a seat in Congress.</p>
                    <p>But the question in which we are most interested now, is not the past, but
                        the present and the future. If I am elected to Congress, I will give to the
                        Administration of President Johnson, a cordial and hearty support in every
                        thing designed, or calculated to restore the country to peace, prosperity
                        and happiness. I will use every means within my power, to have all the
                        restrictions removed, and a general amnesty declared.</p>
                    <p>I will oppose the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine by the Government of the
                        United States -- I am emphatically for peace. My platform is opposition to
                        the next war.</p>
                    <p>But the great question with us now is, not who could do most in Congress, but
                        who, it elected, will be allowed to take his seat. Mr. Stuart has repeatedly
                        declared his inability to take the oath, and has said he would despise himself if he did take it. I am sure I
                        have as much regard for the obligations of chance to occupy a seat in
                        Congress who like Mr. Stuart, declares that he cannot
                            and will not take the oath. Mr. Seward said, a few days ago, to a
                        prominent gentlemen of Albemarle County, "you had better send a child or a
                        fool to the next Congress, rather than one who cannot take the oath," and
                        this is the general impression of the best informed, and unprejudiced and
                        disinterested men.</p>
                    <p>The law of Congress requiring all members to take
                        an oath, that they have not given aid, or counsel in any way, to the
                        Confederate Government is still in force, and will continue to exclude
                        person who cannot conscientiously comply with it, until it is repealed, or
                        is declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.
                        Then, it behooves you to send persons to Congress who can take their seats,
                        and vote with the conservative members for the repeal of these restrictions.
                        There is a powerful party at the North, aided by some fanatical person at
                        the South, who are anxious to keep the Southern States in the condition of
                        conquered Provinces until they consent to negro suffrage, and we, by
                        electing men to Congress who can not take their seats, are aiding and
                        abetting these Fanatics. That the law of
                        Congress will be changed, or altered to allow any Southern man to occupy a
                        seat, is absurd; much more absurd to suppose that it will be altered to
                        benefit one who advised the Southern people to vote for the ratification of
                        the ordinance of Secession, voted for it himself, and signed the Ordinance
                        in the Convention. I call your attention to the case of Mr. Bayard, of
                        Delaware, who was elected to the United States Senate, but was elected to
                        the United States Senate, but was not allowed to take his seat until he
                        subscribed to the oath. He complied with the law, made an elaborate argument
                        against the expediency and constitutionality of it, and failing to have the
                        law repealed, resigned his seat.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Bright, a member of the lower House, was expelled from Congress because
                        it was proven that he had given counsel to the South. With these facts
                        before you, are you willing to vote for one who tells you he cannot comply
                        with the law, and that he would despise himself if he could? This will be
                        the most important Congress that has ever assembled for good, or for evil,
                        and the vote of every conservative member, will be of inestimable value to
                        the South. We cannot afford, at this critical juncture of our affairs, to be
                        trifling -- it is representation on the one hand, and no representation on
                        the other. But if you prefer military rule to having civil law established
                        in the South, vote for a man who tells you he cannot and will not take the
                        oath, and that he would despise himself if he did. But I am determined that
                        the voters in this District shall have the choice between one who can and will, and one declares he cannot and will not take the oath.</p>
                    <p>But Mr. Stuart say, "better be unrepresented than misrepresented." Now this
                        implies one of two things. Mr. Stuart means to say that I have not the
                        capacity to represent you, or that he and myself differ in our political opinions. We have always agreed perfectly in our private conversations. If there is any difference, it must be that
                        Mr. Stuart claims to be more inclined to the doctrine of secession than I
                        do. He is welcome to all the capital he can make out of this position.</p>
                    <p>I am not of those who despair of the Republic, but, in the language of one of
                        Virginia's most gifted sons, "I am full of exultant hope for my country." I
                        am looking forward with confidence to a bright, prosperous, and happy
                        future, and believe that "Union and liberty are one and inseparable, now and
                        forever." If we are but true to ourselves, and act with prudence, discretion
                        and wisdom, "the Morning will come, that bright morning, when the dew-drops,
                        collected during the night of our troubles, will sparkle in its beams, when,
                        in one glorious reunion, a long oppression will have been forgotten, or only
                        remembered by contrast to enhance, or only remembered by contrast to enhance
                        the fullness of the joys of freedom."</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Spectator:</p>
                    <p>Sir:--A friend has called my attention to the recent Card of Mr. Lewis, and I
                        beg leave through your paper to correct several errors into which Mr. Lewis
                        has, (no doubt inadvertently) fallen.</p>
                    <p>1st. Mr. Lewis says, that "five days after the passage of the Ordinance. Mr.
                        Stuart, in a speech delivered a the C. H. or his county, advised his
                        constituents to vote for the ratification of the Ordinance of secession, and
                        subsequently canvassed his county urging his constituents to vote for the
                        ordinance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lewis is mistaken in regard to both of these important propositions. I
                        made a speech of the occasion referred to, but it was not on an entirely
                        different subjects. A proposition was pending before the County Court, to
                        appropriate a sum of money for the benefit of the wives and children of
                        soldiers then in, or soon to be in, the field. I was called on to express my
                        opinion on that subject, and did so, by earnestly advocating it. I made no
                        speech in favor of the ordinance, and so little was known to my opinions
                        [the seal of secrecy not having been removed from the proceedings of the
                        Convention] that a note signed by a number of our best citizens was
                        addressed to me, probably a month afterwards, and few days before the vote
                        was to be taken on ratification or rejection, asking my views on the
                        subjects.</p>
                    <p>So far from canvassing my county in favor of the ordinance. I returned to my
                        seat in the Convention, the day after making the speech above referred to,
                        and remained in Richmond until short time before the vote was taken.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lewis professes to quote from some private letter addressed by me to some
                        person whose name is not given. I shall make no point in regard to the
                        propriety of quoting from a private letter without my permission, but I
                        would have preferred that if any part of the letter was published, the whole
                        should have been given. I think the context was material to the true
                        understanding of the letter. If Mr. Lewis will examine the whole letter, he
                        will probably find that his report of it is not accurate.</p>
                    <p>I remember that, in February last, a gentlemen wrote to me, urging immediate
                        re-construction.--I replied, stating in substance, that I feared his hopes
                        misled his better judgement; that public sentiment was not ripe for it, and
                        that any arrangement which might be patched up, in the then condition of
                        public affairs, would be but a hollow truce, and that, ere long, hostilities
                        would again break out, probably commencing in the halls of Congress.</p>
                    <p>I am still of the same opinion. I believe that if anything like a treaty of
                        peace had been made before the defeat of our great armies, they would have
                        been a large party in the country who never could have been persuaded
                        otherwise than that if we had continued the contest, we would have been
                        powerful, defiant and ready, at any moment, to renew the struggle. Nothing
                        but such disasters as did befall our arms, would have produced the
                        convictions that the contest was hopeless, and made that party willing to
                        accept the result as a final settlement of the matters in issue.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lewis insists that he did not voluntarily
                        enter into any contract with the Confederate States Government to furnish
                        iron for military purposes. I certainly did not intend to do Mr. Lewis any
                        injustice. He does not deny that entered into such contract. That is an
                        indisputable fact. I have no disposition to discuss refined distinctions
                        with Mr. Lewis. I have been taught to believe that every contract implied
                            willingness on the part of those who entered
                        into it, and I apprehend that Mr. Lewis will find that Congress will not
                        stop to have privy examination of contractors to
                        see how far they assented to contracts. The fact that they signed, sealed
                        and expected them, will be taken as conclusive on that point.</p>
