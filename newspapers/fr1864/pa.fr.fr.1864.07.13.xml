                <summary>Details the rebel invasion of Maryland. The rebel forces advanced no
                    further than Boonsboro. The rebel cavalry raided Maryland clear to the
                    Pennsylvania line. Rebel infantry and cavalry crossed the mountains toward
                    Frederick. General Wallace met the rebels at Monocacy, but retreated in the face
                    of superior numbers.</summary>

                    <p>"July 3d, Sunday, 3 P.M.--Man stopped at the hotel door, saying that the
                        Rebels had defeated and captured Sigel, had captured all of his supply
                        trains, including forty lager bier wagons, and were marching upon
                        Williamsport. Put on our boots, and hastened to the public square, where we
                        found an anxious crowd discussing the propriety of leaving town, so that the
                        rebels could take no prisoners. Some one suggested that none but <emph
                            rend="italic">prominent</emph> citizens would be in danger of capture.
                        Each one conscious of his prominence, quaked in his boots, and hurryied
                        [sic] home to 'put his house in order.' 'The busy bee' might have taken a
                        lesson from Chambersburg that night. From 6 P.M. till long after midnight
                        they labored and sweated. It was Sunday, but 'the ox was in the pit.' The
                        town seemed one immense cooper shop, as the rub-a-dub of nailing down boxes
                        broke the Sabbath stillness. In the meantime the farmers began to flock in
                        with their horses, cattle and vehicles of every description; contrabands
                        lined the roads; government stocks were up--<emph rend="italic">from
                            Virginia,</emph> evinced by the long lines of wagons, horses and mules.
                        Every girl and woman that was not bedridden was out, and--to their credit be
                        it said--schemed remarkably cheerful, indeed appeared to enjoy the
                        excitement, and to look upon it as a good joke. The citizens were informed
                        that they might go to bed, and that in case of imminent danger the bells
                        would be rung. At 1 1/2 A. M. retired to a sleepless couch, (we do not refer
                        to the General, though the adjective applies full well) and 2 1/2 o'clock
                        were aroused by the <emph rend="italic">bang</emph>, BANG, BANG of the bell.
                        We arose in extreme haste, very nearly reversing the 'nature's first law' of
                        our pantaloons, and hurried down stairs to find that a patriot had
                        undertaken to ring the bell in spite of orders to the contrary, because of
                        the gul-orious [sic] fourth. Our self-respect was sustained by finding other
                        persons beside ourself in perturbation; so we presented a bold exterior,
                        acted as though we were up for all day, possibly as if we had not retired at
                        all, and were just then out on public business (taking the first quiet
                        opportunity to leave). The fourth passed off with a few Chinese crackers and
                        fire-works, spiced with just enough anxiety to awaken appreciation of 'peace
                        and safety you shall find.' 5th. A day of alarms and arrivals of troops
                        consisting of horse, foot and artillery, (number not specified). The sun of
                        the 6th rose cloudless and serene, <emph rend="italic">notwithstanding
                        which</emph> the bells were rung in the evening. From the arms of Venus to
                        those of Mars ran the citizens, all but those who <emph rend="italic">were
                            not well;</emph> muskets, and ammunition, and blouses were handed forth,
                        cannon were planted in the streets, intrenchments thrown up under the emetic
                        influence of picks and spades, the women superintending the whole, and an
                        orderly bustle pervaded the headquarters of the Department of the
                        Susquehanna. There were full as many troops as the Spartans had at
                        Thermopylae, and equally full of fight. The enemy heard of the preparations
                        and blanched. Hagerstown fell but Chambersburg stood. Was it because H. was
                        twenty miles nearer the Potomac? <emph rend="italic">Perhaps</emph>. July
                        7th. A good many sleepy looking young men in the streets. Contradictory news
                        every hour. July 8th. Went to Harrisburg to see the Governor. It would not
                        be proper to make public the conversation, as it was of a confidential
                        nature; but can assure our friends that if it is Lee's army that has come
                        North of the Potomac, that not a soul will ever return--<emph rend="italic"
                            >if we can prevent it</emph>. July 9th. The citizens have recommenced to
                        argue politics, from which we infer that the danger is in a great measure
                        past. July 10th. A Sunday of fearful reports from Frederick--Baltimore
                        threatened--Governor calls for 12,000 militia--young man aroused--Patriotism
                        not yet extinct. July 11th. Reports from Sigel that the enemy has re-crossed
                        with all his plunder. How long, etc.? Wisdom has yet some votaries.
                        Later--enemy <emph rend="italic">not</emph> re-crossed.</p>
                    <p>"The country has not forgotten the excessive alarm which last year pervaded
                        the Pennsylvania border, nor the haste with which the inhabitants fled
                        before the distant approach of the enemy. The startling reports then
                        telegraphed are remembered. The want of courage, the want of patriotism, the
                        want of all local effort to defend an overrun district are remembered."</p>
                    <p>The above is an extract from an editorial in the New York <emph rend="italic"
                            >Tribune</emph> of the 7th, headed "Invasion." This, if written on the
                        night of the 6th, was penned when our town was placed by the wish and hearty
                        concurrence of the citizens under martial law by Gen. Couch; when the bells
                        were rung to notify the people that the enemy were within a few hours march
                        of Chambersburg; when we had packed and sent off a small portion of our
                        goods, concealing some, and grimly risking the balance; when our women had
                        calmly made up their minds to the worst and had gotten out their linen
                        handkerchiefs for bandages; when our able bodied men had donned the blouse,
                        shouldered the musket and had been furnished with twenty rounds of
                        ammunition each; when some of our best men with pick and spade aided in
                        throwing up intrenchments; when cannon were planted in our streets; when
                        loyal Democrats and Republicans expected a battle with the enemies of our
                        government. At such a time, we say, the New York <emph rend="italic"
                        >Tribune</emph> wrote the above, in reference to citizens of a sister State,
                        who have been twice overrun and robbed, and almost ruined by the common
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>The editor of the <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph> has told us what <emph
                            rend="italic">he</emph> remembers. Let us use <emph rend="italic"
                        >our</emph> memory. Last year, Gen. Milroy with 10,000 <emph rend="italic"
                            >soldiers</emph> was defeated and routed and driven through our valley
                        far beyond us, and our peaceful agricultural population, was left between
                        him and Lee's army of 90,000 men. Col. (then Captain) Boyd, assisted by
                        Lieut. Palmer, with about eighty men fought unaided for about two weeks,
                            <emph rend="italic">delaying the advance for some days</emph>. We sent
                        off our horses under most stringent, military orders, to prevent them
                        falling into the hands of the enemy, leaving our over-ripe grain standing
                        uncut. We freely assisted every colored man, woman and child to escape, and
                        nearly every citizen with his family remained, though expecting rapine and
                        violence. Two regiments of New York troops arrived at C----g on a memorable
                        Sunday, were welcomed by us all with open hands and hearts. The 8th N.Y. (we
                        think it was) was drawn up on the Court House pavement, under the shade of
                        the trees, were fed by our ladies young and old with the best we had, and
                        were hailed socially as brave defenders. They were marched about a
                        mile-and-a-half south of the town, and upon the approach of the enemy, were
                        marched back again to our depot where they took the cars for Harrisburg,
                        leaving their baggage, tents, etc., which our citizens the next day
                        (copperheads and all) handed in and saved. We will not venture on details of
                        their conduct while in our valley; but our daily prayer ever since has been;
                        "give us defeat, grant us death, bestow upon us ignominy, but save us, good
                        Lord, from the New York Militia!" The foe came; we could not resist, for all
                        our fighting men were in the army, our quota being more than full; we did
                        not submit, we were treated as enemies; with our lives in our hands, we
                        furnished almost hourly valuable information to the government; we suffered,
                        did not complain, but remained <emph rend="italic">then</emph> and remain
                            <emph rend="italic">now</emph> loyal to our country. This is all true,
                        and comes within our personal knowledge.</p>

                <summary>The Repository reports a drastic contrast between the numbers of rebels
                    reported as seen in various areas of Maryland and the factual numbers. For the
                    period between July 2 and July 6, the rumored total ranges from 54,000 to
                    185,000 troops while the factual total ranges from 22 to 20,000. The article
                    also mentions the defense of Chambersburg, the skedaddling of officers, the
                    rebel occupation of Hagerstown, the ransoming of the town, and the disgust of
                    the Southern secessionist toward the Northern secessionist.</summary>
