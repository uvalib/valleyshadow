                    hopelessly dead." The state's paltry resources were drained by "the
                    revolutionary action of the Democratic Senators," who depleted the State
                    Treasury "to the verge of bankruptcy to pay the February interest--over $500,000
                    having been paid without equity or reason, and mainly to foreign and unfriendly

<b>Rebel Atrocities</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Grisly descriptions of the "fiendish atrocity of the rebel victors" at Fort
                    Pillow, after they had captured the fort on April 12, 1864. The narrative is
                    taken from a larger report compiled as a result of the official investigation of
                    The Committee on the Conduct of the War, and is based on eye-witness accounts of
                    the cruel murders of hundreds of white and black soldiers.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>An official investigation of the rebel butcheries at Fort Pillow has been
                        made by a committee of Congress, and they more than confirm the first
                        reports of the fiendish atrocity of the rebel victors. After referring to
                        their shameless violation of a flag-of-truce and the capture of the Fort,
                        the report says:</p>
                    <p>Then followed a scene of cruelty and murder without a parallel in civilized
                        war, which needed but the tomahawk and scalping-knife to exceed the worst
                        atrocities ever committed by savages. The Rebels commenced an indiscriminate
                        slaughter, sparing neither age nor sex, white or black, soldier or civilian.
                        The officers and men seemed to vie with each other in the dev[i]lish work.
                        Men, women and children, wherever found, were indiscriminately shot down,
                        beaten and hacked with sabres. Some of the children, not more than ten years
                        old, were forced to stand up and face their mothers while being shot. The
                        sick and wounded were butche[re]d without mercy, the Rebels even entering
                        the hospital buildings and dragging them out to be shot, or killing them as
                        they lay there unable to offer the least resistance. All over the hillside
                        the work of murder was going on.</p>
                    <p>Numbers of our men were gathered together in lines or groups, and
                        deliberately shot. Some were shot while in the riber, while others on the
                        bank were shot and their bodies kicked into the water, many of them still
                        living, but unable to make any exertion to save themselves from drowning.
                        Some of the Rebels stood upon the top of the hill, or a short distance down
                        its side, and called to our soldiers to come up to them, and as they
                        approached shot them down in cold blood, if their guns or pistolds [sic]
                        missed fire forcing them to stand there until they were again prepared to
                        fire. All around were cries of "No quarter, no quarter!" "kill the
                        --negroes!" "shoot them down!" All who asked for mercy were answered by the
                        most cruel taunts and sneers.</p>
                    <p>Some were spared for a time only to be murdered under circumstances of
                        greater cruelty. No cruelty which the most fiendish maligmity [sic] could
                        devise was omitted by their murderers. One white soldier, who was wounded in
                        the leg so as to be unable to walk, was made to stand up while his
                        tormentors shot him. Others who were wounded and unable to stand up, were
                        held up and again shot. one negro who had been ordered by a Rebel officer to
                        hold his horse, was killed by him when he remonstrated. Another, a mere
                        child, whom an officer had taken up behind him on his horse, was seen by
                        Chalmers who at once ordered the officer to put him down and shoot him,
                        which was done. The huts and tents in which many of the wounded had sought
                        shelter were set on fire both that night and the next morning, while the
                        wounded were still in them, those only escaping who were able to get
                        themselves out, or who could prevail on others less injured than themselves
                        to help them out, and even some of them thus seeking to escape the flames
                        were met by these ruffians and brutally shot down, or had their brains
                        beaten out. One man was deliberately fastened down to the floor of a tent,
                        face upwards, by means of nails driven through his clothing and into the
                        boards under him so that he could not possibly escape, and then the tent set
                        on fire. Another was nailed to the side of a building, outside of the fort,
                        and then the building set on fire and burned. The charred remains of five or
                        six bodies were afterwards found, all but one so much disfigured and
                        consumed by the flames that they could not be identified, and the
                        identification of that one is not absolutely certain, although there can
                        hardly be a doubt that it was the body of Lieut. Akerstrom, Quartermaster of
                        the Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry, and a native Tennesseean. Several witnesses
                        who saw the remains, and who were personally acquainted with him while
                        living here, testified that it is their firm belief that it was his body
                        that was thus treated. These deeds of murder and cruelty closed when night
                        came on, only to be renewed the next morning, when the demons carefully
                        sought among the dead lying about in all directions for any other wounded
                        yet alive and those they killed.</p>
                    <p>Scores of the dead and wounded were found there the day of the massacre by
                        the men from some of our gun-boats, who were permitted to go on shore and
                        collect the wounded and bury the dead. The Rebels themselves had made a
                        pretense of burying a great many of their victims, but they had merely
                        thrown them, without the least regard for care or decency, into trenches and
                        ditches about the fort, or the little hollows and ravines on the hillside,
                        covering them but partially with earth. Portions of heads and faces, hands
                        and feet, were found pro-truding through the earth in every direction even
                        when your committee visited the spot two weeks afterwards, although parties
                        of men had been sent on shore from time to time to bury the bodies unburied,
                        and rebury the others and were even then engaged in the same work. We found
                        the evidences of this murder and cruelty still most painfully. We saw bodies
                        still unburied, at some distance from the fort, of some sick men, who had
                        been fleeing from the hospital, and beaten down and brutally murdered, and
                        their bodies left where they had fallen. We could still see the faces, and
                        hands and feet of men, white and black, protruding out of the ground whose
                        graves had not been reached by those engaged in reinterring the victims of
                        the massacre, and although a great deal of rain had fallen within the
                        preceding two weeks the ground, more especially on the side at the foot of
                        the bluff where the most of the murders had been committed, was still
                        discolored by the blood of our brave but unfortunate men, and the logs and
                        trees showed but too plainly the evidences of the atrocities perpetrated
                        there. Many other instances of equally atrocious cruelty might be
                        enumerated, but your committee feel compelled to refrain from giving here
                        more of the heart-sickening details, and refer to the statements contained
                        in the voluminous testimony herewith submitted. Those statements were
                        obtained by them from eyewitnesses and sufferers. Many of them, as they were
                        examined by your Committee, were lying upon beds of pain and suffering; some
                        so feeble that their lips could with difficulty frame the words by which
                        they endeavored to convey some idea of the cruelty which had been inflicted
                        on them, and which they had seen inflicted on others. In reference to the
                        fate of Maj. Bradford, who was in command of the fort when it was captured,
                        and who had, up to that time, received no injury, there seems to be no
                        doubt. The general understanding ever[y]where seemed to be that he had been
                        brutally murdered the day after he was taken prisoner.</p>
                    <p>How many of our troops thus fell victims to the malignity and barbarity of
                        Forrest and his followers cannot yet be definitely ascertained. Two officers
                        belonging to the garrison were absent at the time of the capture and
                        massacre. Of the remaining officers but two are known to be living, and they
                        are wounded, and now in the Hospital at Mound City. One of them (Capt.
                        Porter) may even now be dead, as the Surgeons, when your Committee were
                        there, expressed no hope of his recovery. Of the men, from three hundred to
                        four hundred are known to have been killed at Fort Pillow, of whom at least
                        three hundred were murdered in cold blood, after the fort was in possession
                        of the Rebels, and our men had thrown down their arms and ceased to offer
                        resistance. Of the survivors, except the sounded in the hospital, at Mound
                        City, and the few who succeeded in making their escape unhurt, nothing
                        definite is known, and is to be feared that many have been murdered after
                        being taken away from the fort. When your committee arrived at Memphis,
                        Tenn., they found and examined a man, (Mr. McLogan,) who had been
                        conscripted by some of Forrest's force, but who, with other conscripts, had
                        succeeded in making his escape.</p>
                    <p>He testifies that while two companies of Rebel troops, with Maj. Bradford and
                        many other prisoners, were on their march from Browsville and Jackson,
                        Tenn., Maj. Bradford was taken by five Rebels, one an officer, led about
                        fifty yards from the line of march, and deliberately murdered in view of all
                        those assembled. He fell, killed instantly by three musket balls, and while
                        asking that his life might be spared, as he had fought them manfully and was
                        deserving of a better fate. The motive for the murder of Maj. Bradford seems
                        to have been the simple fact that, although a native of the South he
                        remained loyal to his Government.</p>
