<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A Bedford county correspondent writes us that the copperheads in that section
                        are industriously circulating the report, that if the soldiers are allowed
                        to vote, negroes in the service will also be enabled to vote. By this sort
                        of misrepresentation they hope to induce men to vote against the amendment
                        conferring the right of suffrage on our brave soldiers. It is a palpable,
                        whole cloth falsehood. The proposed amendment simply confers the right to
                        vote upon "qualified electors of this
                        commonwealth" who shall be in the service; and the "qualified
                        electors" are, as every one knows, white men over twenty-one years of

                    Holcomb, and Sanders--sought a meeting via Horace Greeley of the New York

<b>Volunteers And Bounties</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports Franklin County's quota for the new call for 500,000 volunteers as
                    870. The editors express the need for a uniform bounty system to prevent the
                    wealthier cities from stealing away men from poorer regions. They propose that
                    the county should offer a $100 bounty and also a $100 payment to the families of
                    drafted men. The Repository urges enlistment, arguing that an additional 50,000
                    men in Grant's army would allow the defeat of Lee and the capture of Richmond.<br>
