<b>Our Finances--Value of Land</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author seeks to allay the fears of readers who think there will be
                    "financial contraction and revulsion immediately after the close of the war," by
                    assuring them that land values and government securities will remain stable.<br>

<b>How to Feed Cows</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Farmers are urged to sow 2 acres of corn for summer feed for their cows,
                    which will, "we trust, lead them to pasture less each year, until middle fences
                    and pasturing entirely disappear." The author also suggests that farmers plant a
                    couple acres of sugar beets for winter feed, which will "yield rich milk, and
                    plenty of it during the whole winter."<br>

<b>Rebel Literature</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Of the more than four score histories, biographies, narratives,
                    &amp;c., relating to the present war, which we have perused, we have read
                    none with more interest than the record of this bloody drama as made up by our
                    enemies, its treasonable authors," is how this review of Edward Pollard's First
                    Year of the War and Second Year of the War, the Confederate Reports of Battles,
                    and War Pictures from the South by G. B. Estvan begins. The reviewer commends
                    the "highest literary ability" displayed in these books, and observes that the
                    "task of the rebel historian is one of painful embarrassment." Most of the
                    review is devoted to Pollard, who is applauded for being "unsparing in his
                    condemnation of the tyranny he aided to establish" and in his "criticisms upon
                    the tyranny and inordinate ambition of Davis" and other leaders. The reviewer
                    questions Pollard's description of Stuart's raid to Chambersburg as a
                    "remarkable souvenir of Southern chivalry," in which the rebels respected
                    private property, humorously inquiring after the horses that disappeared with
                    Stuart. The overall sense, however, is that these books are fair accounts, and
                    "will be invaluable when the future historian comes to his mighty task of
                    recording how treason betrayed a government; startled the world with its bloody
                    work, and then faded out in desolation, dishonor and death."<br>

<b>Miles O'Riley on the "Naygurs"</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Miles O'Riley, a New York Irishman and Union soldier, "who is in the habit
                    of saying that he has seen such a plenty of white men killed in this war, that
                    he has no objection now to letting the 'Sambos' take their fair share of death
                    and wounds," composed lyrics expressing this sentiment, and the Franklin
                    Repository printed them.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the banquet to the Irish Brigade, in New York, on Saturday, Captain Daly,
                        of the 47th Regiment New York Volunteers, one of the guests, being called
                        upon for a song, said he would give them one which was very popular in the
                        department he came from, and which had done much to reconcile the soldiery
                        of the command to the institution it referred to. It was Private O'Riley, of
                        his regiment, who is in the habit of saying that he has seen such a plenty
                        of white men killed in this war, that he has no objection now to letting the
                        "Sambos" take their fair share of death and wounds. Against any white
                        monopoly in the trade of "being kilt," as he phrased it, Private Miles had
                        entered, to the tune of "The Low-Backed Car," the following lyrical protest:</p>
                    <p>Some tell us 'tis a burning shame <br>To make the naygurs fight; <br>An'
                        that the thrade of bein' kilt <br>Belongs but to the white; <br>But as for
                        me, upon my sowl! <br>So liberal are we here, <br>I'll let Sambo be
                        murdered in place of myself <br>On every day in the year! <br>On every day
                        in the year, boys, <br>And every hour in the day, <br>The right to be kilt
                        I'll divide wid him, <br>An' divil a word I'll say.</p>
                    <p>In battle's wild commotion. <br>I shouldn't at all object <br>If Sambo's
                        body should stop a ball <br>That was comin' for me direct, <br>And the

<b>Border Loyalty</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The debate about whether or not to insist on a statement of loyalty from
                    all Pennsylvania border residents before awarding them compensation for damages
                    sustained during the Confederate invasion sparks this expostulation on loyalty.
                    The author notes that there are "former citizens of this county who are in the
                    rebel army," including a man named Fitzhugh. Gen. Dunn, "once one of our
                    Associate Judges, and a standing Democratic candidate for Canal Commissioner, is
                    also in the rebel army although over seventy years of age." These men are
                    exceptions, however, and the border residents are, "as a class, as earnestly
                    loyal as the citizens of any other sections of Pennsylvania."<br>(Names in announcement: Gen.  Dunn,   Fitzhugh)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The House at Harrisburg got up an animated discussion last week, on the
                        question of the loyalty of the people of the border counties. Mr. Kelly, of
                        Washington, started the performance by a resolution requiring the special
                        committee, to which is referred the question of claims for military damages
                        on the border, to require claimants "to furnish positive proofs of their
                        loyalty." So indefinite a standard of loyalty as that proposed by Mr. Kelly
                        was open to just objections; but we think that Mr. Mr. [sic] Sharpe erred in
                        resenting the motion as an insult to his canstituents [sic], instead of
                        accepting a just test of fidelity for his people and thus silencing all
                        cavil on the subject. That he should vindicate the loyalty of the people of
                        Franklin county, as a class, with earnestness, was but natural; but the
                        conclusiveness of his argument would have been unquestioned, had he proposed
                        that each claimant for damages should be required to be sworn before the
                        board of appraisers, that they have "never, either directly or indirectly,
                        by word or deed, given any aid, comfort, encouragement or information to
                        those in rebellion against the government of the United States, and that
                        they are, and ever have been, faithful and loyal in their support of said
                        government." No loyal man would object to the application of such a test,
                        and any one who cannot accept it should not make claim against a loyal
                        government for compensation.</p>
                    <p>Franklin county borders on a Slave State, and the citizens of the border
                        southern States have mingled freely and often become citizens of our
                        section. Some such retained their southern views and heartily sympathized
                        with the rebels in their effort to overthrow the government; while a few of
                        our own people have gone south, and inflated by the possible possession of a
                        negro at some time of life, have generally made the meanest and most
                        groveling secessionists. But our people are not to be judged by these
                        exceptional cases. The two Logans were Marylanders when the war broke out,
                        and from kidnapping and voting the Democratic ticket when in our county,
                        they naturally went with the traitors; but they offered their lives in
                        vindication of their convictions, and are entitled to the same comities
                        conceded to the Trimble's, the Low's, the Johnson's and others of the same
                        State, who created the tide of treason that swept the lesser lights over.
                        Fitzhugh is a Marylander, and never had any other than a temporary residence
                        in this county. When Longstreet was in Hagerstown in September, 1862,
                        Fitzhugh ran off to join him; enlisted regularly in the rebel service on
                        Friday; was captured on Saturday; imprisoned in Chambersburg on Sunday, and
                        has ever since been an inmate of the Old Capitol Prison in Washington. There
                        are other former citizens of this county who are in the rebel army. One
                        ex-member of the legislature, (Col. McAllister) a native of Juniata, was a
                        Colonel in the rebel service, and was confronted by his brother, Col. Robert
                        McAllister, at the head of a Jersey regiment; and Gen. Dunn, once one of our
                        Associate Judges, and a standing Democratic candidate for Canal
                        Commissioner, is also in the rebel army although over seventy years of age.
                        For many years there has been a steady stream of emigration from southern
                        Pennsylvania to the worn-out lands of the slave-breeders in Virginia, and
                        many have inculcated the doctrine that desolated their fields as they were
                        making them bloom again under the inspiration of free labor. And it is
                        doubtless true here, as Mr. Kelly admits to be the truth in Washington--that
                        there are scores in our county still who would be rebels if they were not
                        greater cowards than traitors; but they are here, as, elsewhere exceptions
                        to the rule, for our people are, as a class as earnestly loyal as the
                        citizens of any other section of Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>The proposition of Mr. Sharpe, to compensate the sufferers of the border, is
                        in no sense a party question. It involves men of all political faith--for
                        the rebels, whatever may be their political partialities as between the
                        parties in the North, were no respecters of persons in plundering our
                        citizens. Their "constitutional friends"--a term they sometime saffixed
                        [sic] to the Democrats, rather in derision than from any
                        affection--doubtless had their sympathies in our political struggles, but
                        they considered Democratic horses, stock, forage, &amp;c. just as useful
                        for the rebel service as like articles owned by the blackest of Republicans;
                        and in the instances--very few to the credit of our people it can be
                        said--where a whining whelp plead his friendship for the South as a bar to
                        the larceny of his property, the rebels usually did extra thieving at his
                        expense if possible, by way of manifesting their scorn for a treacherous
                        coward. With very few exceptions the people of the border, of every
                        political faith, stood as one man during the invasion, and united their
                        energies to confound the common foe; and in no single instance has the
                        evidence been at all conclusive that any of our citizens gave them aid,
                        comfort or information, unless under duress or by accident. Every effort has
                        been made to fix just guilt upon all suspected parties and it has uniformly
                        failed. The charge therefore that our people in any way aided or guided the
                        enemy, is unfounded in fact, and the impression that seems to prevail with
                        some members of the legislature on this point is in no degree merited. The
                        case of the family of the chief Editor of the Repository, cited by Mr.
                        M'Murtrie, of Blair, is in the main true; but the information was doubtless
                        given innocently by boys on the street, as they were cognizant of almost
                        every thing that transpired, and were questioned most pertinaciously by the
                        rebels whenever they were met. So much did our people embarrass the rebels
                        by their answers to their interrogatories, that Gen. Lee finally issued an
                        order peremptorily forbidding his officers and men from conferring with the
                        citizens.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sharpe was therefore but just to himself and to his people in his earnest
                        and able vindication of their fidelity; but it is better that one thousand
                        faithful men should be severely tested in their loyalty than that one
                        traitor, who may have been aiding and encouraging the enemy, should be
                        compensated. On this point he met the assaults of the House with more zeal
                        than skill, for a fair test--one alike just to the citizen and to the
                        State--would have silenced the opposition, and avoided much angry debate. We
                        are well assured that Mr. Sharpe desires to screen no unfaithful man, and
                        the Union men of the House should deal with his measure as they would hope
                        to be dealt with had their lands been taken by friend and foe, instead of
                        ours. Let the State be fully and fairly protected; but we hope that no
                        political prejudices will enter into a question that involves at once the
                        interests of a despoiled people and the honor and faith of the
                    Commonwealth.</p>

                    <p>"The dark Sunday of my life was the 28th of June (fourth Sunday after
                        Trinity), A.D., 1863; and the appropriateness of the appointed psalms to the
                        feelings of them that were shut out of the house of God and in the power of
                        an enemy was fully realized. The evening Psalter of the fifth day was our
                        first public thanksgiving, when the immediate danger was past, and tidings
                        of a decided battle came rolling in upon us. We have been called to
                        celebrate our permanent deliverance on two thanksgiving occasions, and
                        offerings of gratitude have been poured into the treasury of hospitals and
                        soldiers' aid societies. The nation has consecrated a portion of the field
                        on which its heroes won its safety, as a monumental cemetery in memory of
                        their services. But the Church has reared no memorial of the deliverance
                        vouchsafed in answer to her prayers.</p>
                    <p>"War has ruined many sacred edifices and desolated many fields of ministerial
                        labor; but in this Diocese no permanent serious injury has been allowed to
                        fall on any one of our church edifices; while prayer, ascending from all,
                        has helped to gain our entire deliverance from the power of our enemy. Ought
                        we not to erect a memorial of the efficacy of prayer? Ought we not to build,
                        in some destitute portion of the Diocese, a church which shall perpetuate
                        the memory of God's gracious answer to our prayers for the preservation of
                        our beloved country? Should we not recompense those who have suffered
                        afflictions and loss, by subjugation, for a time, by placing among them the
                        memorial of our gratitude and the comfort of a blessing? Gettysburg is
                        famous, and we may not add to its lustre; but I would suggest a church for
                        Chambersburg, as a thank-offering to God for our safety after repeated
                        invasions and a protracted occupancy by armed enemies, and as a monumental
                        evidence of the efficacy of prayer. I am assured that the erection of a
                        church there would give immediate success to a missionary effort already
                        begun in that important town. And I am sure none would better grace the list
                        of memorial churches within the Diocese. Who will be the first to help to
                        consecrate a Memorial House of Prayer to God in one of the fairest valleys
                        of Pennsylvania?"</p>

                    support.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Volunteering has continued during the last week with scarcely perceptible
                        abatement, and nearly all the districts of this county have most of their
                        men mustered in the service. Fannett has not acted as yet, but it is about
                        the only exception. We presume that by the 10th of March there will be very
                        few if any men lacking in this county. In addition to filling our quota, we
                        have lost very largely by enlistments for other sections, where money was
                        more plenty than patriotism. Cumberland, York and Philadelphia, drew pretty
                        largely upon our people, and more still would have been taken but for the
                        determined opposition it finally aroused. Men were taken and credited to
                        distant counties because of a small increase of bounty, while their families
                        were left behind, in some instances to become a charge upon the generosity
                        of their neighbors. The volunteer fund, disbursed in the families of
                        soldiers, cannot be applied to families of men who who [sic] have enlisted
                        and been credited elsewhere, nor can their families get the benefit of the
                        volunteer fund where their husbands have enlisted, without their families
                        reside there. This way soldiers have for a few dollars additional in bounty,
                        deprived their families of vast advantages. Allegations were frequent on the
                        street that officers were engaged in transferring men to distant localities
                        for a consideration, but we have not had any reliable evidence on the
                        subject. The citizens should tear the straps off any officer who would thus
                        defraud the county and barter for his personal gain, in the credits of
                        volunteers.</p>
