                <transcript>
                    <p>Lieut. Gen. Grant has assumed the command of the armies of the United States,
                        and his orders are supreme in all the Military Departments. It is understood
                        that his forces are about to take the offensive at all important points, and
                        the plan of the campaign of course contemplates the occupation of various
                        portions of country not now, and never as yet, held by our forces. It is due
                        to the sacred Nationality for which we are struggling, that the wanton
                        destruction of the private property of the enemy be arrested; and it would
                        commend the new Chieftain and his holy cause were he to declare to the world
                        by an order, that this war is not urged against private citizens,
                        non-combatants or private property. We know that such is the theory on which
                        the war has thus far been conducted; but it has been shamefully violated in
                        various instances by subordinate commanders. The destruction of private
                        property may be necessary at times to coerce treacherous citizens into
                        decency, but the burning of houses, mills, and other property simply because
                        they belong to the enemy, is unwarranted by any rule of civilized warfare;
                        and we cannot afford to be responsible for it. True, the enemy may provoke
                        it by similar acts of barbarity, or by the brutal treatments of our living
                        prisoners and the more horrible atrocities committed upon our heroic dead;
                        but this will not justify the almost unbridled license given to our men in
                        several instances recently, to destroy private property.</p>

                    employed the common weapon of the most scienced corruptionists of the
                    legislature. It is the most effectual plan that could be devised, to keep every
                    honest man away from the legislature who desires fair enactments; and it is by
                    just such imputations habitually made--sometimes by honest men as in this case,
                    but usually by rogues--that thieving lobbyists have the whole ground to
                    themselves, and create an atmosphere of pollution oftentimes in the very temple
                    of power."</excerpt>

                    border military damages. The editors adroitly manage to communicate their

                    some doubts about his politicking and position on the issue.</summary>

                    <p>Various movements are now on foot to connect the Cumberland Valley with the
                        Connelsville Railroad and the Broad Top Coal region; but we fear that the
                        enterprise must fail unless there can be some concentration of our energies
                        and capital. The Southern Pennsylvania Railroad Company, formerly known as
                        the Sherman's Valley, is now making an effort to reach the East Broad Top
                        coal lands, and we learn that at a meeting of the Directors held on the 19th
                        ult., it was resolved to locate the road through Fulton county before the
                        first of May next. This road, as at present managed, cannot make its way to
                        the point proposed. If it is taken hold of by New York, as its present
                        owners contemplate, it may become a through route to the Ohio, and thus
                        reach the Broad Top; but as a local effort it cannot succeed. It has a
                        feasible route, and it may be disposed of as a speculation and be made by
                        New York.</p>
                    <p>The Pittsburgh people are moving to extend Con[illegible]sville through
                        Cowan's Gap and Greencastle to join the Western Maryland; and another
                        project proposes the extension of the Columbia Railroad through Gettysburg
                        and Chambersburg to Broad Top. This should be the acceptable measure of the
                        people of Southern Pennsylvania, it offers the very best connections, and at
                        once shortens the distance to Baltimore and puts us in direct communication
                        with the Broad Top Coal lands. The road from Reading to Columbia was
                        complete last week, and is now running trains regularly; and the new route
                        proposed would put this point in the very best possible position for
                        receiving and shipping [illegible].</p>
                    <p>The Cumberland Valley must get direct communication with Broad Top at an
                        early day. It has become a necessity; and the growing trade of the country
                        clearly points to another great Pathway to the West through this region. The
                        Southern counties should lose no time in making common cause in this
                        important movement, and secure the priceless advantages it offers us.</p>

                <summary>George W. Rase, presently in jail for burgling the Oaks &amp; Austin
                    warehouse in Greencastle, apparently sent a letter to Capt. George Eyster and
                    Judge Kimmell, purporting to be from an anonymous dying soldier in Washington,
                    claiming Rase's innocence in that burglary as well as the arson and burglary
                    cases at William B. Gabby's property, near Chambersburg, and Mr. Henderson's,
                    near Carlisle. Eyster and Kimmell had a number of letters from Rase, and by
                    comparing the handwriting, deduced that the letter from the dying man was
                    actually from Rase himself, who somehow managed to get it conveyed to Washington
                    and mailed from there.</summary>

                    Battalion of the 13th U. S. Infantry, was recognized for its conduct and loss at
                    Vicksburg, which the board recognized was "unequaled in the army." Sherman has
                    named the hill where Washington fell "Mount Washington," and the officers of the

                <excerpt>"Turn the horse's head toward a strong light, say after the middle of the
                    afternoon of a clear day;--raise his head so as to allow the light of the sun to
                    shine full in his nose,--stand beside him, have his head held steady, raise the
                    lap of the nostril and look up as far as you can. If you discover ulcers with a
                    dark rim or edge and white in the centre, the case is decided; the horse is
                    glandered, and should be immediately shot."</excerpt>

                <summary>The author seeks to educate the public about the glanders, which is much
                    like consumption. This dread disease is "insidious," "incurable," "contagious,"
                    and may be contracted by people. Many of the army horses have it, and the author
                    warns against purchasing government stock that may then infect existing stock.</summary>

                <summary>The author observes that "there is a class of farmers who seem to think
                    that they have already attained perfection in their way," and that they
                    generally are the ones "whose fields are least productive and most untidily
                    kept." He urges these men to improve their farms by improving themselves, and
                    exhorts them to "dig up those deep-rooted prejudices which fill your minds."</summary>
