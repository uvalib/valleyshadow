<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Again the National heart beats with tremulous anxiety because of the ray of
                        hope that breaks upon the dark horizon of bloody war. There is hope of
                        peace! It may be a delusion. It may have been but a snare on one side or the
                        other, and end in disappointment; but we believe that never before, since
                        the commencement of this fearful, desolating struggle, has the question of
                        peace been so favorably entertained by the insurgents as now. Their army of
                        the South-west is shattered, and confessedly unable for an offensive spring
                        campaign. Charleston is menaced the port of Wilmington is closed, by the
                        capture of Fort Fisher, thus cutting off the last avenue for foreign
                        supplies; Lee's army is wasting under the gloom with which multiplied
                        disasters have shadowed it; Richmond cannot long be held with the powerful
                        armies of Grant, Sherman and Sheridan gathering around it, and with it
                        surrendered, the leaders of the rebellion would be without a resting place.
                        It is most natural therefore that the question of peace should distract
                        their councils and array their victims against the colossal crime that has
                        wantonly deluged our land with fraternal blood.</p>
                    <p>Mr. F. P. Blair, Sr., went to Richmond a few weeks ago, ostensibly to recover
                        some valuable papers, said to have been stolen by the rebels when they
                        occupied his premises in July of last year; but it was clear to most persons
                        who knew the character of Mr. Blair that he did not go to Richmond solely
                        for the recovery of his private papers. If they were taken, and could be
                        procured again, a brief correspondence within the rules prescribed by the
                        government would have answered the purpose. Mr. Blair evidently had a higher
                        purpose for his mission. He went with the hope that he could bring about an
                        adjustment. What assurances he had we do not pretend to know. He may have
                        been invited there; he may have been sent there by Mr. Lincoln, or he may
                        have gone on his own conviction that the time has come for friendly
                        intervention. At all events he went to Richmond, and returned; and after a
                        protracted and strictly confidential interview with Mr. Lincoln he steps on
                        board of a steamer that had been kept in readiness for him, and he is now in
                        Richmond again. He is no fool, nor does he seek notoriety. He is past the
                        years when he would thrust himself into the rebel capital in order to find
                        his name in every newspaper. And he is as sagacious as he is earnest. He
                        well knows the rebel leaders. The time was when he was the great leader of
                        many of them. When he spoke they trembled; when he counseled they obeyed,
                        for Jackson was at his back and he well deserved the confidence the Old Hero
                        awarded him as the editor of his organ. He therefore knew when to go and
                        what to say; and he has gone and said it--then returned and reported to Mr.
                        Lincoln, and gone back to say more. All this may fail to close the war; but
                        we are greatly mistaken if there are not reasonably fair prospects that the
                        South will, in some way, propose to end the conflict before the spring
                        campaign opens.</p>
                    <p>The question of Slavery has ceased to be an issue North and South. By common
                        consent it must die. The North demands it; the world demands it; the
                        desolated South demands it; the graves of our hundreds of thousands of
                        martyred dead demand it, and it must bow to the retributive stroke it has so
                        wickedly, wantonly invited. It may die to-morrow, or it may linger for a
                        term of years; but the seal of death must be indelibly planted upon its
                        mutilated form. There is therefore little to impede adjustment. The rebel
                        currency and debt have long since been given over as worthless, and no
                        pretense of galvanizing it into value will be offered. Confiscation has been
                        a practical nullity, and the amnesty proclamations of the President quiet
                        all apprehensions of vindictiveness on the part of the government. There is
                        therefore nothing for the South to do but submit--to dethrone their leaders
                        who have given them war for peace; desolation for prosperity; bereavement
                        for happiness, and the work of reconstruction, as it is called, is effected.
                        The Davis's the Boombs; the Wigfalls; the Masons; the Slidells, &amp;c.,
                        will not trouble the government. They cannot live in any part of the Union
                        when it is again united. Every man's hand will be against them, and
                        especially will the victims of their intrigues and ambition in the South
                        demand their expulsion from the land they have shrouded in morning.</p>
                    <p>We have abiding faith that President Lincoln will assent to no negotiation or
                        adjustment that is not entirely consistent with the honor, the dignity and
                        the supremacy of the government; and we therefore welcome every ray of light
                        that dawns upon us, came whence it may, and hope soon to greet the noontide
                        of victory bearing with it a restored and regenerated Union and an honored
                        and ending Nationality.</p>

                    <p>Correspondence of the Franklin Repository.</p>
                    <p>Washington City, Jan. 20, 1865.</p>
                    <p>We have been blessed with a few days of pleasant, cool and dry winter
                        weather, just such as would make one feel contented, were it not for the
                        continual state of excitement to which we are daily subject.</p>
                    <p>Since Monday last a continual rejoicing over the fall of Fort Fisher, has
                        been kept up. Last night when the excitement had quieted down, rumors of
                        peace took its place, and to heighten the fever old Mr. Blair to-day took
                        his servant and again started for Richmond. The steamer Don, on which vessel
                        he made his last trip, has been lying at the Navy Yard ever since with steam
                        up, and to-day at 11:15 Mr. Blair got aboard and she steamed away for City
                        Point. This of course caused a tremendous hubbub, even among our bulls and
                        bears, for we have some here, and gold tumbled down to 201. If old Abe don't
                        soon tell some people what kind of business old Mr. Blair is traveling back
                        and forth to Richmond about, some people will die of wonder. But the return
                        of Mr. Blair to Richmond, does look as if something more than the recovery
                        of papers was in the wind. Let us have patience and Abraham will tell us all
                        about it, for he said so.</p>
                    <p>Since the commencement of the present session of Congress very little has
                        been done, save debating the questions of amendment to the constitution and
                        reconstruction. They bid fair to have a much longer run.</p>
                    <p>If the arrangements which are now making be carried out, the inauguration of
                        Abraham Lincoln next 4th of March, will surpass anything of the kind ever
                        held on this continent, both as to the number of people in attendance and
                        the imposing grandeur of the ceremony. The Union League, the Lincoln and
                        Johnson club, and the Loyal Association of Pennsylvania have made the
                        preliminary movement in the matter, and invited other State associations to
                        join them. The inaugural will take place on the steps of the main entrance
                        of the side of the capital, where the last took place. In the evening a
                        grand ball will be given in the North unfinished wing of the Patent Office,
                        where there is a hall some 300 feet long by 16 in breadth. Cards of
                        admission will be $10, and at that price, the demand will be greater than
                        the supply.</p>
                    <p>From all sections of Rebeldom where our armies are operating, every breath of
                        wind wafts to us news of success and victories beyond our most sanguine
                        expectations. The beginning of the end is fast approaching. This gigantic
                        rebel bubble must soon burst, and every individual in Rebeldom, from the
                        highest official to the beggar is aware of it. Every issue of their papers
                        show weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth. The rank and file of the people
                        of the Confederacy are heaping curses deep and loud upon their old
                        leaders--the betrayers that lead them on from happy homes to misery and
                        death. Even Jeff. Davis himself, so lately set up by them as an omnipotent
                        power, or rather God, is deemed by them an impracticable imbecile, who knows
                        neither how to act or plan, nor judgement [sic] to select an executive
                        officer who can. To show the wonderful change of opinion in comparing the
                        Administration of Jeff. Davis to that of Abraham Lincoln, we quote the
                        following from the Charleston Mercury of January
                        10th, 1865:</p>
                    <p>"When Abraham Lincoln took the chair of the Presidency of the United States,
                        he promised in his flat-boat lingo to 'run the machine as he found it.'
                        Whether he has strictly kept his promise, those may doubt who choose to
                        consider the subject. It is enough for us to know that, whether 'running his
                        machine' in the pathway of his predecessors or not, he has run it with a
                        stern, inflexible purpose, a bold, steady hand, a vigilant, active eye, a
                        sleepless energy, a frantic spirit, and an eye single to his
                        end--conquest--emancipation. He has called around him, in counsel, the
                        ablest and most earnest men of his country. Where he has lacked in
                        individual ability, learning, experience and statesmanship, he has sought
                        it, and found it in the able men about him, whose assistance he
                        unhesitatingly accepts, whose powers he applies to the advancement of the
                        cause he has undertaken. In the Cabinet and in the field he has consistently
                        and fearlessly pressed on the search for men who could advance his cause,
                        and has unhesitatingly cut off all those who clogged it with weakness,
                        timidity, imbecility or failure. Force, energy, brains, earnestness, he has
                        collected around him in every department. Blackguard and buffoon as he is,
                        he has pursued his end with an energy as untiring as it is Indian, and a
                        singleness of purpose that might almost be called patriotic. If he were not
                        an unscrupulous knave in his end, and a fanatic in his political views, he
                        would undoubtedly command our respect as a ruler, so far as we are
                        concerned. Abroad and at home, he has exercised alike the same ceaseless
                        energy and circumspection.</p>
                    <p>
                        "We turn our eyes to Richmond, and the contrast is
                            appalling, shocking to the heart."
                    </p>
                    <p>Yesterday was the first day, since early in 1861, that there was no death of
                        a soldier to report from the Hospitals of this District. Owing to the high
                        state of perfection to which our hospitals have arrived, very few deaths
                        occur.</p>
                    <p>Our Theatres and places of amusement are nightly crowded. Forrest is playing
                        [sic] at Ford and Miss Annie Jones at Grover's. Besides we have had three
                        nights of Italion [sic] Opera, at $2.50 per ticket, and at that price there
                        was scarcely room left to move your elbow.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday the subject of a new Rail Road between Washington and New York was
                        debated in the Senate, and quite a number of Railroad men are in the city.
                        The old Monopoly will as usual come off victorious and no new road will be
                        built, which is much to be regretted.</p>
                    <p>The name of John W. Forney is daily used and his chances every day growing
                        bright, for Secretary of the Interior in the re-construction of the cabinet.
                        Thaddeus Stevens declined, on account of ill health, the use of his name for
                        Secretary of the Treasury, for which position he was urged by every Union
                        member from Pennsylvania. His declination makes the chances of Mr. Forney
                        better.</p>
                    <p>S.C.</p>
