<b>Sanctity of the Laws</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If we would preserve our liberties we must maintain the sanctity and
                        supremacy of the laws. They must be supreme under all circumstances,
                        regardless of class or condition; calling or color; prejudice or persuasion;
                        and to this great and every citizen should direct his determined efforts.
                        Especially in troublous days like these, is the good citizen required at
                        times to set his face like flint against the lawlessness, of which civil
                        feud and revolution are ever the fruitful parent. If in preserving our
                        government by force of arms against treason, we should inaugurate disorder
                        and anarchy in the administration of the civil law, our rescued Nationality
                        would turn to an empty bauble in our hands. In short, a government without
                        law is a libel and a fraud, and is not worth preserving.</p>
                    <p>This journal has repeatedly spoken boldly in behalf of the sanctity of the
                        laws. It has condemned contempt for law whether open or covert; whether
                        displayed by the cowardly foes of the government, or by those who assume
                        summarily to vindicate real or imaginary wrongs against the Country's cause,
                        and plead their devotion to it in justification of lawlessness. Whether
                        soldier or civilian, political friend or foe, we hold that the same
                        obligations to society obtain; the same respect for person, property and
                        life must be practiced, and the same penalties inflicted for crime. To
                        assume that a newspaper is not loyal and therefore destroy it by violence,
                        is none the less lawless if the assumption be true; for the remedy is but an
                        aggravated form of the wrong sought to be redressed; and to justify violence
                        or crime, or even to extenuate the same in opinion or in the administration
                        of justice, because of political difference of opinion touching the support
                        of the government, is but to steal the name and livery of the law to fling
                        anarchy broadcast over the land.</p>
                    <p>Let us look at home. Three important criminal trials were disposed of in our
                        courts here last week. In one case a soldier had murdered a negro, and
                        lawyers of all shades of political belief were invoked to prosecute and
                        defend. Did it escape the observation of the dullest attendant upon the
                        trial, that men of the Democratic faith only were deemed by the defence
                        acceptable jurors? And why? Was it believed that Republicans would convict
                        the prisoner whether guilty or not, simply because the victim was a negro?
                        We think not; indeed none will assume that they would have done more than
                        hold the prisoner guilty or innocent, without regard to the color, or
                        character of his victim, as the testimony might demand. Why, then, were
                        jurors of a different political persuasion preferred? We concede that it was
                            not because they are wanting in integrity or
                        in a just appreciation of the solemnity of an oath; but they were manifestly
                        chosen because they were presumed to be schooled to hate the negro, and upon
                        their prejudices, operating insensibly upon their reason, did the defence
                        rely for safety. Two advocates, justly eminent for legal learning and for
                        eloquence and skill in appeals to juries, plead for the life of the
                        prisoner. Judge Kimmell lectured the jury on miscegenation, and a stranger
                        would have supposed that the Anglo-saxon race was trembling in the balance
                        for existence, rather than the life of a culprit; and Mr. Sharpe rehashed to
                        the jury the common spawn of petty treason, by his declaration that the war
                        had been prostituted from its original and holy purpose to a war for the
                        elevation of the negro. And why were these startling declarations interwoven
                        with appeals in behalf of a prisoner, in a case with which the purposes of
                        the war and the mingling of races had no more to do than they have with the
                        revolutions of the comets? Messrs. Sharpe and Kimmell do not thus strangely
                        talk from force of habit. Both have made political speeches but never so
                        madly wrong--nor could they to-day be induced to harangue [sic] a public
                        meeting as they did a jury in an issue of life and death. They spoke as
                        advocates, and we are not prepared to say that they spoke unwisely as such.
                        They had sought as jurors men whose hatred for the negro is part of their
                        political faith, and they aimed to brutalize the jury by appealing to their
                        prejudices, hoping to give them the mastery over reason and conscience in
                        the verdict to be made up. They did not say in so many words that the
                        killing of a negro was little or no crime; that he was becoming quite too
                        important in this country; that he would soon be upon equality with the
                        whites; and therefore it was time that the white man's hand should be
                        against him even unto death--for that would have made an honest jury revolt;
                        but they sought to carry the conviction imperceptibly to their minds through
                        their prejudices, trusting to inflamed prejudices to magnify doubts, and
                        magnified doubts to procure an acquittal.</p>
                    <p>Equally forcible was the illustration of the correctness of our premises in
                        two other cases. A soldier had killed a citizen--they were of different
                        political faith, and the deed had been committed on election evening and in
                        a political fracas. The same rule that dictated Democratic jurors in the
                        case before alluded to, demanded Republican jurors in this one, and
                        political feeling ran high throughout the trial, especially amongst those
                        who live in the locality where the alleged offence was committed. The case
                        was taken from the jury by the judge on the ground that the testimony of the
                        Commonwealth could not be complete, because of the failure to make a post
                        mortem examination of the body; but had it gone to the jury, we should have
                        had an assortment of stars and stripes and fourth of July orations in behalf
                        of the prisoner, in strange contrast with the political speeches of the
                        counsel. Were Republican jurors chosen in this case because they were
                        wanting in honesty or respect for the laws, or in their appreciation of the
                        solemnity of their oath? Not at all. They were chosen because their
                        prejudices might, it was hoped, be turned strongly in favor of one who was
                        enlisted in the defence of his country, and thus cloud the reason to magnify
                        or create doubts to justify an acquitted. In another case the Democratic
                        faith was in demand again. A charge of treason had provoked a blow that
                        maimed the prosecutor for life, and again was political prejudice invoked to
                        shield a wrong. Again did Sharpe forget that this is a government of law, in
                        his speech to the jury, hoping thereby to make prejudice do what unclouded
                        reason must forbid; but in all cases we believe, jurors shamed the novel
                        assumptions of counsel by doing their duty.</p>
                    <p>We have alluded to these facts not for the purpose of censuring counsel or
                        juries; but to point out clearly to all classes of citizens--to men of all
                        political faith--that there is danger of growing looseness in the
                        administration of our laws, and of necessity a corresponding warfare upon
                        the order and safety of society. Lawyers do not appeal to prejudice where
                        prejudice does not exist; they do not deliver political harangues to juries
                        unless they have good reason to believe that political prejudice may be made
                        stronger than their sense of justice; and until it is discarded by all good
                        citizens; the enforcement of the laws demanded inflexibly, and the
                        administration of justice regarded as too sacred for political or other
                        polluting partialities or hatreds to mingle with it, we shall find a growing
                        tendency to disorder and crime, and even the better class of men may be made
                        insensibly to strengthen the current of lawlessness. Three men died untimely
                        and by violence on last election night in this county; a shocking murder was
                        committed in our midst but a few weeks ago, and half a score of homicides
                        were prevented by accident in the various altercations which have fallen to
                        our lot during last year. For this there is but one remedy--that is
                        obedience to the laws, and the enforcement of their supremacy and the just
                        punishment of crime without regard to creed, color, condition or class.
                            For the sacred maintenance of order let every good
                            citizen make common cause; and let crime of every grade meet its just
                            condemnation and punishment at the hands of all!</p>
