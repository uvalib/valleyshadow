<b>Disgraceful Conduct</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports several "disgraceful disturbances" during campaigning by Stewart,

                    their carriages.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr.  Stewart, Mr.  Sharpe,  C. EysterEsq.,  W. S. EverettEsq.)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is always disgraceful to disturb or in any way interrupt a political
                        meeting. Speakers may be fools and utter disgraceful sentiments, but there
                        is no law that compels anybody to listen to them; and it is always best to
                        let them alone. There have been in several instances, disgraceful
                        disturbances at political meetings in this county. At the Union meeting at
                        Dry Run Mr. Stewart twice narrowly escaped being hit with stones while he
                        was speaking, and there were slight disturbances at the Democratic meetings
                        at Waynesboro and Greencastle. Mr. Sharpe's harness was cut while he was
                        speaking in the Red School House and stones were thrown at him when he was
                        returning home. Subsequently C. Eyster and W.S. Everett, Esqs., spoke at the
                        same place and their carriage was cut; their horse turned loose; a shawl and
                        the cushions stolen, and stones thrown into the window while they were
                        speaking. Such conduct is disgraceful in the extreme, and all good citizens
                        should resolve to have it arrested regardless of consequences. It is a
                        disgrace to any community to have a meeting interrupted, and all should aid
                        to expose and bring to punishment those who thus violate all decency. If
                        this disorder is not stopped, there is but one remedy for it, and that is to
                        arrest and punish the offenders, and we trust that no man, of any party,
                        will be found ready to excuse or shield the men or boys who are thus
                        disgracing themselves and their communities.</p>
