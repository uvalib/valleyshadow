<b>Gambling Operation Defeated</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A ring of stock gamblers, including a man who identified himself as Joseph
                    H. Miller, attempted to produce a panic and cause the price of Cumberland Coal
                    Company stock to plummet so they could buy it up. The scheme entailed convincing
                    the public, via the newspapers, that rebel forces had invaded Cumberland Valley,
                    but Mr. Gilmore, the telegraph operator in Chambersburg, was suspicious of the
                    dispatches he was supposed to be sending. Instead of sending them along to the
                    Associated Press in New York and the Philadelphia Inquirer, he passed them along
                    to Major General Couch, who confirmed that it was a hoax.<br>(Names in announcement:  Joseph H. Miller, Mr.  Gilmore, Major Gen.  Couch)</blockquote>
<b>From the 21st Cavalry</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>News from the front, where the 21st Cavalry had to fight as Infantry (a
                    "cruel test," for they had never been drilled even an hour in infantry
                    movements). There is also an account of the wounding of Col. Boyd, who was
                    "sitting down cheering his men and smoking his pipe" when a sharpshooter got
                    him. 2d Lieut. R. Water of Co. E was struck upon the side of the neck with a
                    shell and instantly killed, one of nine men to die. A total of forty-nine were

                    houses of New York, and twenty thousand of whom are known to the police."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Do not venture into a sick room if you are in a violent perspiration: for
                    the moment your body becomes cold it is in a state likely to absorb the
                    infection; nor visit a sick person (if the complaint be of a contagious nature)
                    with an empty stomach, nor swallow your saliva. In attending a sick person,
                    place yourself where the air passes from the door or window to the bed of the
                    invalid, not between the invalid and the fire, as the heat of the fire will draw
                    the infections vapor in that direction, and you would run much danger from

<b>Flirtation</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Flirtation, whether seriously or lightly considered, is injurious to a

                    the individual makes, of her desire to attract the notice of men. No girl ever
                    made a happy union by flirtation, because no man capable of making a woman
                    permanently happy was ever attracted by that which is disgusting to persons of

                        their husbands, who had left some months previous for the freer and purer
                        atmosphere of the loyal Stotes [sic].</p>
                    <p>The names of the party are as follows, viz: Mrs. Wesley Hensley, with seven
                        children; Mrs. Rob't Hensley, with five children; Mrs. Matthew Lamb, with
                        six children, and Mrs. Hiram Hensley, making twenty-two persons in all. They
                        had, when they started, two two-horse wagons and when three miles from
                        Edinsburg, a party of guerrillas came out from a dense wood on the road, and
                        took the best horse from them. They were then compelled to load up their
                        effects and the small children in one wagon and abandon the other. The women
                        and large children had to walk all the way from that place, and met with no
                        further interruption on the road. At Martinsburg they readily procured a
                        pass to cross the Potomac. On last Thursday the party, way-worn and
                        foot-sore, reached the vicinity of Greencastle, and were hospitably
                        entertained by Mr. Mickley.</p>
                    <p>Their destitute condition becoming known to our citizens, contributions were
                        at once made, and these women and children sent by railroad to Harrisburg.
                        Their horses and wagon were sent in charge of one of their friends in the
                        same direction.</p>
                    <p>Our readers will remember that some months ago we published a statement that
                        a band of twenty-four men, Union refugees from Rockingham co., Va., had
                        passed over the South Mountain into Adams county, where they were engaged in
                        cutting timber. Here the small pox broke out among the party, and some of
                        them died, and the rest scattered: among those who died was a son of the
                        elder Mrs. Hensly, the husband of the younger woman of that name. The first
                        intelligence they had of this fact they received here, and were distressed
                        very much in consequence.</p>

<b>Body Found</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The body of Charles Pencyl, whose disappearance was noticed in early April,
                    was found by George Waltman and his small son, in the woods near Charles
                    Harclerode's in Bedford County. Waltman was at the foot of Dunning's Mountain,
                    looking for his cows when his son spotted a soldier's hat, which led to the
                    discovery of the body, "torn asunder, and scattered" by beasts. Foul play has
                    been ruled out, and it is presumed that he "perished from exposure" on the night
                    of the 29th of March, "when he had lost his way in a heavy snow storm."<br>(Names in announcement:  Charles Pencyl,  George Waltman,  Charles Harclerode)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Gen. Sheridan in his official account of his battle with Lee's cavalry near
                        Gordonsville, on the 12th inst., reports among the rebel dead left on the
                        field, "Col McAllister, commanding a regiment, killed." This doubtless was
                        Thomas McAllister, formerly of St. Thomas, in this county. He was a native
                        of Juniata, and moved here some time about 1840; was chosen to the
                        legislature in 1846 with Maj. John M. Pomeroy, but was not returned. Soon
                        after he moved to Virginia, turned up as a rebel Colonel, and has at last
                        met the hard fate he invited by his treason. His brother, Col. Robert
                        McAllister, of Juniata, has commanded a New Jersey regiment for two years
                        past, and has twice been in battle when his rebel brother's command was
                        engaged against him.</p>
