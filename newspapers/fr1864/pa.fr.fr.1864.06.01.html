                    <p>Correspondence of the Franklin Repository</p>
                    <p>Camp Casey, Va., May 21, 1864.</p>
                    <p>After a tiresome march and some disappointments, we have at last encamped in
                        this place. It is situated at the Virginia end of Long Bridge. The day after
                        our arrival at Washington City we were ordered to Belle-Plain and marched to
                        the wharf, anticipating a speedy trip and a chance of displaying our bravery
                        in the conflict now going on between the Union and Rebel armies. But all our
                        hopes were dispelled by the order being countermanded, and very reluctantly
                        we went into camp again--the men showing their disapprobation by giving vent
                        to language more expressive than refined. But he unkindest cut of all had
                        not come yet, and well may we cry "A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a
                        horse!"--for we have been dismounted, and have to act temporarily as
                        infantry. It was very hard for us to part with our horses, and I noticed
                        many a watery eye as the men took a final look or gave a parting caress to
                        the noble animals which they have cared for ever since the re-organization
                        of the Regiment, and which they expected to ride to victory or a patriot's
                        grave. But we know the Cavalry in the Army of the Potomac stand greatly in
                        need of horses, and must have them, so the men bore it manfully, and like
                        good soldiers--which truly they are--all of them will stand by our Country,
                        right or wrong. The Lieutenant Colonel issued an order congratulating the
                        officers and men upon the calm, patriotic and soldierly manner in which they
                        received the order dismounting the Regiment; that he observed with pride and
                        satisfaction that devotion to our cause which prompts them to do their duty
                        to their Country in whatever capacity the interest of the service may
                        require, and that he felt assured by their past and present conduct, their
                        future course will be characterized by the same soldierly bearing. We hope
                        to be mounted again in about six weeks and them you will hear a good report
                        of the gallant twenty-first.</p>
                    <p>We have had an addition to our Regiment since leaving Chambersburg---being no
                        less than a very pretty and intelligent young lady, who having a bold
                        soldier boy for a lover, put on the blue uniform and came to this place,
                        where they were married and are now living happy together in a shelter tent.
                        She says she will fight by the side of her husband as long as possible.</p>
                    <p>In the next field to our camp there is a negro regiment in barracks. I was
                        surprised to see with what proficiency they drill, and how well disciplined
                        they are. They handle their arms and march with the precision of veterans,
                        and I am happy to see that they receive all respect due them as United
                        States soldiers from the officers and privates of all ranks and regiments.</p>
                    <p>Those who have never experienced it can scarcely form an idea of how much
                        good it does a soldier to receive a letter from home, and by prevailing upon
                        those who have brothers and sons in the army to write to them often. I will
                        have to stop until I can find something of interest to communicate to you.</p>
                    <p>R.H.W.</p>

                    the national convention: The Somerset paper complains that Adams and Franklin
                    counties unfairly elected a delegate, but the Repository editor asserts that
                    when citizens of Somerset and Fulton did not appear at the announced meeting, it
                    was assumed that they had decided to meet separately, as Bedford County did, and

                    still resides on the State; but by his will admitted to probate on Monday last,
                    he revokes the legacy expressly on the ground that the legatee sympathises with
                    the traitors in arms against the government. Judge Nill was a War Democrat, and
                    he was as consistent in death as he was earnest in life, in his abhorrence of

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author corrects the Harrisburg Telegraph, which identified Hon. Wilson
                    Reilly as the "Breckinridge candidate" in the 1861 race against Judge Nill, the
                    Union candidate and winner of the election. Apparently Reilly was an ardent
                    Douglas supporter in 1860, and "never sanctioned Breckinridge or treason." His
                    military career is summarized as further proof of his decency: he volunteered in
                    1861 and raised a company for the 6th Reserves. When he resigned due to his
                    health, his two sons stepped in and have served gallantly.<br>(Names in announcement: Hon. Wilson Reilly, Hon. James Nill)</blockquote>

<b>Another Supposed Spy Captured</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Jacob M. Funk, of Mercersburg, "who has been devoting his attention
                    recently to the arrest of deserters," accosted a suspicious-looking man on South
                    Mountain. Funk was convinced that the man, who identified himself as Mordaunt
                    Winchester of Frederick, Maryland, was a spy, and took him to Sheriff Eyster.
                    Winchester appears to have been on a "tour of observation" for some time, and
                    might have been trying to find his way back to Virginia when he was captured.<br>(Names in announcement:  Jacob M. Funk, Capt.  Eyster,  Mordaunt Winchester)</blockquote>
<b>Broke Jail</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mac Hamilton, a "colored" man awaiting trial for murder, and five men
                    arrested as deserters--John Helurg of Co. M, 22nd Pennsylvania Cavalry, William

                    Artillery, and William Sissom of Co. G, 120th New York Vols.--escaped from the
                    Chambersburg jail last Wednesday. They asked for a pail of water, and struck the
                    girl who delivered it when she opened the door, rushing past her and making
                    their escape. Hamilton returned to the jail voluntarily on Saturday (a move the
                    author of the article cannot fathom, because Hamilton will die if he is found
                    guilty as charged). Hamilton reported that he had left the deserters in
                    Amberson's Valley, and citizens are urged to capture them and claim the $30.00
                    reward offered for the arrest of any deserter.<br>(Names in announcement:  Mac Hamilton,  John Helurg,  William Van Dyke,  Jacob Van Dyke,  Jacob H. Coons,  William Sissom)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Wednesday night of last week, six prisoners effected their escape from the
                        Jail in this place. Their names are--Mac. Hamilton, (colored) awaiting trial
                        for murder, and John Helurg, Co. M, 22d Penna. Cavalry; Wm. Van Dyke, Jacob
                        Van Dyke, and Jacob H. Coons, of Co. B, 5th New York Artillery, and William
                        Sissom Co. G, 120th New York Vols.,--all arrested by the Provost Marshal as
                        deserters. They had been locked inside of the Jail building in the evening,
                        and when they supposed the Sheriff to be out, they asked for a bucket of
                        water. When the servant girl opened the door to hand in the water, they
                        struck the girl on the arm with a stick, and rushed out of the Jail and made
                        their escape. On Saturday morning last the negro returned to the Jail
                        voluntarily and gave himself up. What his motive was for doing so, can
                        scarcely be conjectured, as he is imprisoned on a charge that will demand
                        his life if he is found guilty. He reports that he left the deserters in
                        Amberson's Valley. Any citizen is entitled to a reward of $30 for the arrest
                        of a deserter, and we doubt not that the citizens of the Valley can, with a
                        little strategy, gather most of these deserters up. We learn that Capt.
                        Eyster has placed a special guard about the Jail to prevent the escape of
                        deserters and military prisoners hereafter.</p>
