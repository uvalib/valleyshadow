                    <p>Under this head, the Baltimore American thus sums
                        up a few of the terrible results of the great rebellion and its guilty
                        cause--Slavery. It is a sad but truthful picture of the fruits of this
                        gigantic wickedness, which has risen up upon the soil of the American
                        Republic, to blast its peace and destroy the hopes of mankind for ages yet
                        to come:</p>
                    <p>Because of Slavery everything is taxed. We arise
                        in the morning and enrobe ourselves in taxed cotton and woollen [sic]
                        garments at twice their usual prices. We shave with taxed soap and comb our
                        hair with a taxed comb dolefully gazing in a taxed mirror. We put on our
                        taxed boots, or horse hide, for, alas, the glories of patent leather are
                        among the memories of the past, and walk over a taxed stair carpet to the
                        region where, with a due regard for the economy of taxed fuel, our frugal
                        breakfast is spread. We drink our taxed coffee, a decoction of chickory,
                        French, Broadbent, and "old rye," in which is mixed out taxed sugar, with a
                        taxed spoon out of a taxed cup; and although inwardly cursing the bitter
                        fate which condemns us to such stuff, are gratified to know that Sir William
                        Hamilton's remark, "that a man's intellect depends on the amount of coffee
                        he drinks," is not altogether true. We sniff the aroma of forty-five cent
                        butter, and, thinking it strong enough to bear the tax, revenge ourselves
                        upon the gravy of taxed sausages, with the fear of a rise in price on the
                        passage of the dog law. We write on taxed paper with taxed ink, and print on
                        the flimsiest of trash which monopoly and excise will enable us to furnish
                        to the many-headed monster yeleped [sic] the public. We print taxed
                        advertisements and pay for taxed despatches; ride in taxed carriages, behind
                        taxed horses, hitched in with taxed harness. Our incomes are taxed and our
                        outgoes are taxed, and when 'life's fitful fever' is over, by the aid of
                        some kind physician's taxed medicine, we are boxed up in a taxed coffin, and
                        pay our heaviest tax of all to the inevitable exciseman--Death.</p>
                    <p>This is only a small part of the account debited against the cause of the
                        war--the root of the Rebellion--the corner-stone of the
                        Confederacy--Slavery.</p>
                    <p>We have to set down to the account millions of blighted hopes, and broken
                        hearts, and desolate homes, and happy lives, and honorable ambitions
                        thwarted, and noble careers ended, and brilliant intellects clouded, and
                        souls gone astray. There are widows' and orphan's tears enough to weigh down
                        all the gold the accursed institution ever was worth, by the estimates of
                        its own worshippers in the palmiest days of Yancey, Wise and Keitt.
                        Compensation? Slavery ask for compensation? It is we, the sufferers, that
                        have a right to demand compensation of Slavery. We, that pay the tax, have a
                        right to ask Slavery to unburthen us of the enormous debts it has saddled
                        upon us. We, whose dead children lie on the fields of Shiloh and Gettysburg,
                        may well say to Slavery--Give us back the lives of our loved ones. Who shall
                        pay the orphan for a father gone? Only the Great God that holds the even
                        scales of justice in his mighty hand can tell how enormous is the debt due
                        to the American people this day by Slavery!</p>
                    <p>Maryland has a claim of her own by which to offset all demands for
                        compensation, independent of her share in the great general account we have
                        just related. Maryland has double the agricultural area of Massachusetts,
                        more than double the shore line, a finer and healthier climate, more coal,
                        iron and other mineral resources, greater water power and equal commercial
                        facilities. Her early settlement entitled her to as speedy a proportionate
                        development as Massachusetts, with the same advantages; but as Maryland has
                        greater natural advantages, she ought to have developed more rapidly. There
                        is but one reason why she did not, and that reason is Slavery! It acted as
                        an embargo on immigration. It prevented the settlement of the people and the
                        investment of capital. As a consequence we find the value of the real and
                        personal estate in Massachusetts in 1860 was $815,237,433, and that of
                        Maryland only $376,919,944. Deduct the latter from the former and we have a
                        balance to charge against Slavery of $438,317,489.</p>

<b>Gov. Curtin on the Draft</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gov. Curtin raises issues about the benefits of postponing the draft until

                    many volunteers, and that townships that have provided many volunteers do not
