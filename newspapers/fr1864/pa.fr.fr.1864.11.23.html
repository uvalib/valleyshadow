                    <p>Editorial Correspondence of the Franklin Repository.</p>
                    <p>Washington, Nov. 18, 1864</p>
                    <p>Again we have whispers of Peace. How the National heart throbs at the
                        utterance of the word. Now that the country is assured by the solemn verdict
                        of the people that no peace involving dismemberment or dishonor can be
                        attained during the next four years, the faintest star of hope that glimmers
                        in the dark horizon of grim war's desolation, is greeted on every hand with
                        most fervent prayers that it may break upon us in the noon-tide of triumph.
                        The people want Peace; not the Peace of Chicago, that would shame the living
                        and blot the memory of the dead; that would exchange the sad exactions and
                        sacrifices of war for anarchy and the supremacy of treason; but the Peace
                        that will re-unite the States; make North and South again one people, with a
                        common Constitution, a common Freedom, and a common Glory.</p>
                    <p>This is the hunger-cry of the Nation. It comes not from the faithless, but
                        from the faithful who have stood resolutely against traitors in arms and
                        their subtle, treacherous allies in the North; and to its consummation their
                        best energies will be devoted. No mere abstractions; no pride of opinion; no
                        mean ambition; no sanctity for the records of statesmanship; no trembling
                        for the shifting sands of old duties as they are supplanted by those of
                        to-day can stand in the way of peace. But one issue can warrant protracted
                        war--the unity of the States. That once attained, the mission of the sword
                        is ended, and the peaceful channels ordained by government must give the
                        sequel of this bloody drama.</p>
                    <p>To this end--the preservation of our common Nationality--and to it alone, has
                        this war been prosecuted. Weak men have thought otherwise; bad men have
                        wished otherwise; bad men have wished otherwise, and so appealed to cupidity
                        and prejudice to give heart and hope to our relentless foes. That
                        emancipation has sprung from the chaos of civil war to strike treason in its
                        most vital element of power is not a perversion of the great object of the
                        conflict; but an auxiliary to its grand consum[m]ation, and was a necessity
                        as imperious as the laws of gravitation. It has no sanction in the civil
                        powers of the government; but from the war powers of the constitution it
                        comes clothed with all the ceremony of law, and while those powers are
                        called into exercise for the common safety, there is no appeal from the
                        inexorable decree of military necessity. But war must one day cease and when
                        its appalling shadows shall have passed away, then must the duties of
                        adjustment return to the people in their sovereign capacity, or to the
                        lawful channels known to peace.</p>
                    <p>I am glad to see the discussion of Peace North and South. It cannot but bring
                        golden fruits. It may disappoint the hopes of the sanguine by its tardiness
                        of fruition; but every newspaper article, every speech, every public
                        resolution coming from loyal hearts must fall upon some "good ground," and
                        hasten in a greater or less degree the termination of this wanton, cruel
                        struggle. I was glad to read the pointed remarks of Gen. Butler in New York
                        last week, and also the able and well matured articles of Col. Forney,
                        ("Occasional,") in the Philadelphia Press. They
                        fully appreciate the great issues with which we have to grapple. They have
                        the grasp of mind and moral courage to still the wild slants of partizan
                        triumph with the solemn duties victory has imposed, and declare to friend
                        and foe that the late National vindication of its own life shall be the
                        signal for magnanimity, not intolerance; for generously re-uniting, not
                        dividing, and that as the country has just declared for war until its
                        insulted laws shall be respected and supreme, the boon of promise, the
                        silver-lining of conciliation and hope shall go out with the verdict
                        demanding the preservation of the Republic.</p>
                    <p>I do not speak advisedly, but I shall be disappointed if President Lincoln
                        does not, in his forthcoming message, leave no channel closed to efforts for
                        Peace. Should he do so, he would fall short in the discharge of his highest
                        and holiest duty to the people. Just how he will present the issue to the
                        country, he must be the best judge; and knowing as I do that he is, of all
                        others, the most solicitous for an early and honorable close of this
                        exhausting war. I am prepared to yield much to his suggestions and councils
                        when he presents them to the world. He may not go so far as many would wish,
                        and may go beyond what others would advise; but I have abiding faith that he
                        will keep his heart steadily fixed upon the star of enduring Peace, and
                        exhaust his renewed powers to make rugged ways smooth and crooked paths
                        straight for the Nation to crown itself with perpetual Union.</p>
                    <p>It is worthy of note how a mere whisper of Peace vibrates upon the chords of
                        the National heart. A few days ago there were rumors of movements in the
                        insurgent States looking to reconstruction; and gold toppled forty per cent;
                        the whirl of speculation was arrested; bulls mourned in the marts of
                        commerce, and there was renewed activity in the legitimate channels of
                        business. I do not share the spasmodic joy that springs from some
                        ill-defined conviction of the immediate dawn of Peace. It is not visible to
                        the cool observer; it has no tangible form around which to gather hopes that
                        the conflict is about to close. No action has been taken in the rebel States
                        looking to an immediate breaking up of the power of treason; but the People
                        who have thus far bowed to the tyranny of crime are widening and deepening
                        the chasm between them and the remorseless despoilers who have given them
                        desolation and mourning for peace and plenty. To them the government should
                        appeal in most generous terms and thus place upon them the responsibility of
                        future war so clearly that the world cannot fail to recognize the necessity
                        for its continuance, if continue it must. With their leaders, there is no
                        hope. Jefferson Davis will not exchange his frail Empire, though thick with
                        wanton tombs and stricken with consuming sorrow, by his own mad perfidy.
                        Desolated, bereaved, and shrouded in woe by his own acts, still it is the
                        only spot of earth that owns him as potentate, and he can surrender it only
                        to meet the hissing scorn of the living or to die in infamy. To the long
                        suffering but now restive victims of his colossal crime must the government
                        appeal; and we await the issue with mingled hopes and fears. If the doors to
                        Peace are closed by their refusal to throw off the hated, deadly yoke of
                        treason, then must the sword fulfil[l] its crimsoned work, and subjugation
                        with its withering retribution, must close the war. With such an alternative
                        who would not err on the side of conciliation to spare his own fair land so
                        sad a destiny.</p>
                    <p>To strengthen the hope of Peace the government must be fully prepared for
                        war. It must be ready for every possible contingency. It must be more than
                        ready for renewed war, it must come; and in overwhelming armies is our
                        confidence to save life and treasure and hasten the termination of the
                        conflict. The last call for troops has but little more than supplied the
                        losses of the summer campaigns and the withdrawal of veterans by the
                        expiration of their term of service. Certainly not over 120,000 men have
                        been actively put into the service under it. Naval credits and credits on
                        previous calls exhausted two-fifths of the number, and the persistent,
                        systematic efforts of faithless men have measurably defeated the filling up
                        of our ranks by encouraging desertions. The previous call for 700,000 men
                        did not put 50,000 actually into the army, as the latitudinous exemptions
                        and the payment of commutation relieved almost every conscript, and when it
                        is considered that all the three years' men of 1861 were discharged during
                        this season, it will not be a matter of surprise that the army is not now
                        larger than when the campaign opened in May last, I doubt not therefore that
                        a call for additional troops will be made this winter, so that if the rebels
                        reject all efforts for Peace, their refusal will be met with vigor and
                        irresistible power on the part of the government.</p>
                    <p>Sherman is known to be on the war path, and if he shall achieve decisive
                        success, our present armies may be quite equal to the great work of closing
                        out the rebellion. With an army of not less than 50,000 men he has cut loose
                        from Atlanta and moved for the sea-coast, probably at Savannah or
                        Charleston. He will, I trust, liberate our suffering prisoners in Georgia,
                        and it is understood that he will arm all rescued prisoners and slaves who
                        may be found in his sweep. It is the boldest movement in the history of
                        warfare, and is attended with great perils; but the country has faith in
                        Sherman and will confidently hope for his success. Should he reach
                        Charleston or Savannah, I shall not be surprised if the major portion of his
                        army is thrown rapidly by transport to Grant, and Richmond captured before
                        the close of the year. With such a success which is more than possible, the
                        war would close before the 1st of April next.</p>
                    <p>There are few strangers now in the capital. The President looks quite well,
                        and is most hopeful of the overthrow of the rebellion. However gratified by
                        the flattering vote by which he has been reelected, no one appreciates
                        better than himself the solemn responsibilities imposed upon him. He is
                        charged with the safety of the great Free Government of the world against
                        the combined assault of treason and despotism, and to the discharge of his
                        sacred trust his whole energies will be devoted with unfaltering fidelity.
                        Secretary Stanton is ill, worn down with the exacting duties of his
                        Department. He will soon retire unless he improves. I see Gen. Banks on the
                        street looking as active and fresh as when he was Speaker of the House. His
                        head is a little more silvered, and his military moustache gives him a
                        different air, but his compactly knit frame, keen eye and finely chiseled
                        face are the same. I would indeed that his military success and been equal
                        to his civil renown. Gen. Gilmore is also here and his soft blue eye and
                        fair face and locks would mark him for some other trade than war. Tom Corwin
                        is one of the lions of the town. His step is measured and heavy, and the
                        rude ravages of remorseless Time have done their work with him; but his eye
                        still glistens with the fire and humor of his youth, and a happy, green old
                        age is fitly crowning one of the ablest and best of our living statesmen.
                        Thurlow Weed, the sagacious, reticent, imperturbable politician, may also be
                        seen to-day upon the Avenue. Although three score and ten, age has dealt
                        kindly with him, and his large, rugged frame seems to defy the waste of
                        years, while he is without his peer as a political leader. Col. Forney looks
                        none the worse of his active campaign for Lincoln's re-election. His step is
                        as elastic and his spirits as buoyant as twenty years ago when his keen pen
                        flashed in the columns of the Pennsylvanian, and
                        led the successful blasts against the gallant Harry of the West. Kind,
                        genial, generous to a fault, and as faithful in his friendship as he is
                        forgetful of his wrongs, three are few so much beloved as John W. Forney.
                        Like Greely [sic], his only peer as a great journalist, he is the architect
                        of his own just fame, and he wears no honors that he has not more than
                        earned.</p>
