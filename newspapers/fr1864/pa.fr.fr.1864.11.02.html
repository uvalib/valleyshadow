<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository reports election irregularities with the army vote. Some
                    Democratic judges invalidated a number of soldiers' votes because poll books
                    contained candidates from several counties, a violation of the act passed by the
                    legislature. The editors remind that the act also states that "no mere
                    informality in the manner of carrying on or executing any of the provisions of
                    this act, shall invalidate any election held under the same or authorize the

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Commissioners named in the ball incorporating the Connellsville and
                        Southern Pennsylvania Railroad Company, met at Bedford on the 14th ult., to
                        open conscription books and commence the work of organization. Hon. Samuel
                        L. Russell presided at the meeting, and five millions two hundred thousand
                        dollars were subscribed to the capital stock, and five dollars paid in on
                        every subscription. Such an immense subscription made bona fide, as it was, at once secures the early construction of
                        this most important artery of trade, and must add fabulous wealth to the
                        Southern tier of counties in this State.</p>
                    <p>The stockholders adjourned to meet in Philadelphia, on the 10th of November,
                        to effect a permanent organization of the company by the election of
                        President and Directors. Thus far we have heard only the name of Col. John
                        A. Wright suggested for the Presidency, and we shall be glad to learn that
                        he has been chosen and accepted the responsible trust. He is one of the most
                        thorough and experienced Railroad men of the country, and with the sternest
                        integrity combines the most comprehensive and practical business qualities.
                        We can think of no man who could give a brighter promise of early success to
                        this vital enterprise.</p>
                    <p>The delay in the approval of the bill by Gov. Curtin, arising from the grave
                        constitutional question earnestly urged by the Baltimore interests in
                        opposition to the resumption by the State of the franchises of the
                        Pittsburgh and Connellsville Company, necessarily postpones active
                        operations on the new road this season; but we are assured that the
                        promptest measures will be taken to put it in readiness for rapid progress
                        next season. We presume that the heavy subscriptions to the capital stock
                        made at Bedford came mainly from those interested in the great internal
                        thoroughfares of the country--the Pennsylvania Central and the Pittsburgh,
                        Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad, as the construction of the great Southern
                        line is of the utmost importance to them. The Pennsylvania Central is now
                        unequal to its immense and steadily growing trade, and by leading the
                        Southern Pennsylvania to the commercial city of our State by intersecting
                        the Cumberland Valley at or near Chambersburg, its through trade can be well
                        accommodated, and the local trade of the State immensely increased by
                        developing the exhaustless mines and forests of the counties between this
                        and Connellsville. The investment, on their part, is therefore most
                        judicious, and at once disenthrals the Southern counties, develops their
                        slumbering wealth, enhances the value of every acre of land on the border,
                        and must greatly cheapen coal, lumber, and every article wanted from the
                        West. In addition it will make Philadelphia the receptacle of all the wealth
                        of Southern Pennsylvania, and add greatly to the general prosperity of the
                        Commonwealth. This enterprise cannot be too earnestly commended to the
                        people of our county, and we hope to see them co-operate generously in
                        pushing it forward to early completion.</p>
