<b>Another Call for Troops!</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Announcement of Abraham Lincoln's order for a draft of 500,000 men on March

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The author scolds the Democratic Congressmen from Pennsylvania for having
                    "neither the pluck nor the patriotism to utter a word" in support of the bill to
                    reimburse the state for the damages caused by the Confederacy's invasion the
                    previous summer. The Republicans did speak up.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Not one of the Democratic members of Congress from this State had a word to
                        say when the bill came up to reimburse Pennsylvania for her expenses in
                        repelling the rebel invasion of last summer. Mr. Coffroth, who represents
                        the greater part of the invaded region, was mute. He, in whose district lies
                        the battle-field of Gettysburg, had not a word to say in behalf of
                        Pennsylvania. Mr. Bailey, who represents Cumberland, Perry and York, was
                        equally speechless. Mr. Dawson, another border representative, maintained an
                        equally expressive silence. Even Fernando Wood, of New York and Cox, of
                        Ohio, had something to say for the claims of their States; but nor
                        Pennsylvania Democrats had neither the pluck nor the patriotism to utter a
                        word. Fortunately Thayer, Stevens, Leonard Myers and Kelley were there to
                        represent the State and vindicate her claims. But it appears to be a
                        deliberately adopted policy, among our opposition members, to do nothing for
                        the dignity or the honor of Pennsylvania. The people must remember all these
                        things.</p>

<b>Burning of the Cathedral at Santiago Chili</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In this article, which is part of the "Washington" column, the anonymous
                    author recounts how his thoughts turned to a dreadful cathedral fire while he
                    was sitting in a crowded theatre in Washington. "There were not less than 1800
                    persons present, and I thought, should a fire break out, here too would be a
                    tragedy almost as great ... Time and again I have seen the President and his
                    family and the most prominent and useful men of the country occupying boxes
                    close by the stage, and I know that had a fire broke out their lives would
                    scarcely have been worth a penny." The author suggests a special committee be
                    formed to increase the number of doors in public buildings.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Spirit is appalled at the prospect of filling
                        up the armies. It complains of everything that promises to strengthen our
                        gallant soldiers in the field, and give success to the National cause. It is
                        indignant because the Repository wants a conscription act "sufficiently
                        stringent in its provisions to gobble up every poor man, as well as every
                        man of moderate means, and force him into the army before spring opens."
                        Just not so, as usual with the Spirit. We want a conscription bill that will
                        "gobble up" a due share of the whining, cowardly, copperheads, who pollute
                        the loyal atmosphere of the Free States with their denunciation of
                        everything designed to preserve the government that protects them in their
                        persons, their property and all their civil and religious rights. The loyal
                        hearts alone have volunteered and given success to the Union arms, driving
                        treason from more than half its territory, and leaving it to winter in want
                        and despair, while the quibbling, treacherous copperheads remain to defame
                        the cause to which our brave sons and brothers have consecrated their lives,
                        and to inspire confidence in the dominions of crime by declaring that "the
                        rebellion is revelling in the pride of its strength to-day." For such foes
                        of order and humanity, we bid the conscription speed its work!</p>
