                    <p>Camp Battery B, Independent Pa., <lb/>Six miles south of Kingston, Ga.,
                        <lb/>May 20th, 1864.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday, the 4th inst., we received orders to have our tents struck at
                        12 o'clock, M. [sic], and be ready to march, previously having had eight
                        days rations issued us, three days of which we were to carry in our
                        haversacks, and the rest in wagons. There was great cheering all over camp
                        as the order was read. A great many were wondering which road we would take,
                        but they were not long kept in suspense, as we took a pretty direct route
                        for Tunnel Hill, where it was believed we would have rather a sharp brush
                        with the enemy. This just suited the boys, for I never saw them in better
                        spirits or more eager for a fight. We marched along briskly on the afternoon
                        of the 4th, and until nearly night of the 5th, when we went into camp at
                        Catoosa Springs. Here was a delightful place for a weary soldier to take a
                        temporary rest. Out of the same hill, close together, flow beautiful streams
                        of different kinds of water. Here were the ruins of what must have been some
                        splendid residences, whilst some of the mansions still stand in all their
                        magnificence. Here, at these Springs, was no doubt a pleasant summer resort
                        for the chivalrous Southern aristocrats.</p>
                    <p>On the morning of the 7th (Saturday) the grand Army of the Cumberland was
                        again in motion. Every now and then we could hear heavy cannonading in our
                        front, plainly indicating that we were contending for every inch of ground
                        we gained. The enemy felled trees across the roads and obstructed them all
                        they could to impede our march, but half the Confederacy could not resist
                        the onward march of Sherman's massive columns.</p>
                    <p>At 4 o'clock, P.M., we were in possession of Tunnel Hill, and had a good view
                        of Joe Johnson's rebel hordes, who were posted on Rocky Face Ridge and
                        Buzzard Roost Gap. It is about 2 1/2 miles from the top of Tunnel Hill to
                        the top of Rocky Face Ridge, so we could not reach the enemy with our guns.
                        On Sunday morning, the 8th inst., we advanced upon the enemy in three
                        columns, and soon his skirmishers sought safer places than could be had at
                        the foot of the ridge, so they fell back towards the top. Before night we
                        held the foot of the ridge on the left of Buzzard Roost Gap. Our men made
                        some gallant charges. Here we first tried our new guns, and found them very
                        effective. During the night of the 8th we held a ridge about five hundred
                        yards from the gap, but there was some desperate fighting for it, and ere we
                        got full possession of it many a hero fell to bite the dust. On the 9th we
                        were ordered to the hill in front of the one we took the evening before. We
                        went there on double-quick, as the sharp-shooters from Rocky Face Ridge were
                        very troublesome. We had three of our horses shot in getting there. Works
                        had been erected there for only two pieces, so we could not get them all in
                        position. These two pieces shelled them all day. The enemy opened two or
                        three batteries on us, but did us no injury, as we were too well fortified.
                        About sundown we took the four pieces that we could not get into position to
                        the rear. On the 10th nothing occurred of much importance except that heavy
                        skirmishing was kept up all day. Our two gvns [sic] were still posted on the
                        hill in front of the gap, giving them an occasional shot. On the night of
                        the 10th the entire rebel army was in motion in the direction of our right.
                        We learned that a corresponding change was made of our troops. Under the
                        cover of darkness we pulled our battery by hand to the top of Signal
                        Heights, right in front of the gap. Every one was anxious to know what move
                        was on foot for the morrow. On the morning of the 11th we found all the
                        troops gone except once Corps, which was posted in front of the gap, which
                        it was ordered to hold. Generals Hooker, Palmer and Schofield, commanding
                        respectively the 20th, 14th and 23d Corps, were flanking the rebel position.
                        The following night (the 12th) the enemy thought it best to retire. On the
                        morning of the 13th the cry was was [sic] again "On to Atlanta!" and our
                        columns again advanced. Gen. Johnson exhibited a great want of generalship
                        by wasting so much time and labor in fortifying Rocky Face Ridge and then
                        allowing Gen. Sherman to outflank him. At 1 o'clock, P.M., we reached
                        Dalton, Col. Gross, commanding the brigade to which we were attached, was
                        the first to enter the town. Two of our pieces shelled the enemy all day, as
                        their rear guard appeared very stubborn.</p>
                    <p>Saturday the 14th, we had some very heavy fighting. Our division was on the
                        extreme left and just before night we were outflanked and greatly
                        outnumbered at this point. Consequently our left wing gradually fell back.
                        At this critical movement "fighting Joe" came up with his corps of veterans
                        just in time to save us from disaster. Here our loss was heavy but that of
                        the enemy much heavier. Capt. Simpson's Battery, 5th Indiana, was on the
                        extreme left and did wonderful execution. The enemy made three desperate
                        charges on it but were each time repulsed. Over two hundred and fifty dead
                        rebels lay in front of this Battery.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Davis, of the 77th Pa. Vols., Brigade Inspector was here, I fear;
                        mortally wounded. On the 15th we drove the enemy at every point. The 20th
                        Corps made some desperate charges, they made three successive charges on a
                        Fort before getting possession of it. Here we took six guns from the enemy.
                        Our loss was very severe in wounded but few were killed. Our Battery got a
                        splendid position here and did, I think, good execution. We were well
                        fortified so that they could do us little harm. Our casualties were few.
                        Lieut. John H. Hassinger, of Reading, Pa., was wounded in the side, but not
                        mortally. Private Daniel Gallanders, of Erie county, Pa., was shot in the
                        breast, wound not serious. Resaca, where this battle was fought, is a small
                        town situated on the North banks of Coosa river and 15 miles South of
                        Dalton. The 16th found us in full pursuit of the whipped and flying rebels.</p>
                    <p>We have been fighting and driving the enemy before us up to this day, which
                        is the 20th. Sometimes he would stand and fight us for several hours, but by
                        the time we got formed in line of battle he would make a hasty retreat. We
                        are now resting six miles south of Kingston. The Rome railroad intersects
                        the Atlanta at this place. Rome, too, is in our possession. The railroad
                        will be completed to this place in a few days. The only injury it sustained
                        was the destruction of the bridge over Coosa River. We are now fifty-six
                        miles from Atlanta. On our way here from Tennessee we passed through a
                        number of small and unimportant towns; but they were almost entirely
                        deserted by the white inhabitants, and very few colored persons remained.
                        The country through here is a very fine fertile district, abounding in fine
                        springs of fresh water and never before felt the blasting effects of this
                        war. The air is sweetly perfumed by shrubs, which grow wild in great
                        abundance. Here and there you come across some splendid mansions, but nearly
                        all are deserted. Few churches are met with, and these are constructed out
                        of the cheapest material, and present a very rough exterior--not even
                        painted.</p>
                    <p>During the last two week's fighting, Johnston's army was very badly whipped,
                        and greatly demoralized. Rebel prisoners say if their commander cannot fight
                        us behind such works as he had, he can't fight us at all, and that they had
                        better throw down their arms. I concur with them about throwing down their
                        arms.</p>
                    <p>Battery B played well its part in the last two weeks active campaign. We had
                        a good many raw recruits but they all fought like veterans. We have now only
                        two Lieutenants with us, two being absent wounded. Lieut. Luitze was wounded
                        at Chickamauga and has not been fit for duty since. We were very fortunate
                        in having good and able officers since we entered the service. You can
                        expect glorious news from Gen. Sherman before the close of this campaign.</p>
                    <p>Saturday, May 21st: we are still encamped six miles South of Kingston, but
                        the impression is that we will leave for Atlanta next Monday, the 23d inst.
                        I said that we were in the advance through Dalton. About a mile South of
                        that place the rebels drew up in line of battle, we did the same and were
                        just about making a charge, but a few shots from our 12 pound Napoleon guns
                        soon made them "skedaddle," although not until we killed a number of their
                        battery horses. During this advance upon the enemy we gave them very little
                        time to destroy railroads and bridges. The most damage they did was the
                        burning of the railroad bridge across the Coosa river at Resaca. Up to this
                        time the cars were sometimes almost in advance. We were not in Resaca half
                        an hour until two large trains came in, loaded with lumber to rebuild the
                        bridge across Coosa river. I never saw an army in better spirits than
                        Sherman's after this long march and all the privations and hardships it
                        endured. There was a continual cheering in camp. One of the most cheering
                        things was our Brass Band following us into the midst of battle and playing
                        "Rally Around the Flag," &amp;c., and the "Star Spangled Banner" and a
                        number of other national airs. Our Brigade Band would often play within four
                        or five hundred yards of the rebels. Our boys would give one cheer after
                        another, which commingled with the soul stirring strains of the Band would
                        have a very depressing effect on the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Col. Gross, commanding our brigade, is, I believe, as cool and able a
                        commander as we have in this Department, and justly deserves the star. He
                        formerly commanded the 36th Indiana.</p>
                    <p>Lieuts. Zeigler, Shatzer and Hassinger, as well as our Captain and the men in
                        the ranks, deserve great praise for their gallant conduct through the late
                        engagements, and I am sure our battery did some very good execution. We were
                        often within two or three hundred yards of the enemy and no line in our
                        front but skirmishers. We would have lost half our number had it not been
                        that we fought mostly behind fortifications, which saved us very much.</p>
                    <p>The 77th Penna. Vols., Col. Stumbaugh's old regiment, is in our brigade. This
                        is the first time we have been together for over two years. As usual it
                        fought splendidly, and deserves much praise. I do not know the casualties in
                        it yet, but they are few.</p>
                    <p>The health of our men is general good. They are all in fine spirits, and the
                        cry continues "On to Atlanta!" from which place I hope to write my next.</p>

                <summary>A brief history of the Pennsylvania Reserves, organized by Gov. Curtin in
                    May 1861, and recently discharged after three years of service, "in which they
                    have enriched the ground of every eastern battle-field with their blood." The
                    "shattered columns" of the Pennsylvania Reserves were welcomed back at
                    Harrisburg; scarcely 3,000 of the original 15,856 men bore arms the day they
                    were discharged.</summary>

                <summary>The author strongly advocates removing the Cabinet members "who have hung
                    like mill-stones about the progressive ideas of the age," namely Post Master
                    General Blair and his cronies. He argues that a "divided, discordant cabinet
                    neutralizes its own influence upon the policy of the country, and can be
                    peculiarly potent only for evil."</summary>

                <summary>This article confirms the death of "our" Jenkins--the Guerrilla Jenkins who
                    captured Chambersburg in June of 1863. The author provides some little known
                    facts and anecdotes about Jenkins and the occupation, including the "fact" that
                    Jenkins, who allegedly graduated in the same class at Cannonsburg College as J.
                    McDowell Sharpe, Esq., and had been a member of the same Congress as Hon. Wilson
                    Reilly, had made "very kind inquiries about these two gentlemen" while he was in
                    town. Most of the detail provides a less genteel portrait, and ultimately the
                    name of the guerrilla Jenkins, "in infamy, is added to the long black list of
                    Treason's minions."</summary>
