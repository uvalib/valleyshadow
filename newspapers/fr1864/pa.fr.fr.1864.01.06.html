<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>An eventful year has closed. Inexorable Time has consigned it, with its
                        crimsoned and thrilling history to the eternal past; and upon the chequered
                        canvas of man's imperfect record of himself, it must ever stand as the
                        mightiest of its century. It opened upon the Republic shrouded in gloom. The
                        National heart had sunk to the very verge of despair as it turned to the
                        long list of indecisive or positively disastrous battles, whereby Treason
                        had grown insolent, and appealed to the world for recognition in the name of
                        its triumphs. Save in the victories of the South west, the year of sixty-two
                        had shown no progress for the Republic, no hope for Freedom; and excepting
                        the few pages illuminated by Henry, Donelson, Nashville and Shiloh, there
                        was nothing in the year's record but humiliation and disasters to the
                        friends of our honored Nationality. The Peninsula was made historic ground
                        by the heroism of the Union troops who braved the foes of Freedom and the
                        more deadly miasmas of the Virginia swamps; but our Flag floated in sight of
                        the rebel capital only to be trailed back discomfited, and thousands of
                        nameless tombs tell how sad, how appalling were the blunders which wasted a
                        gallant army in ill-directed and fruitless conflict. Banks' retreat,
                        Cross-Keys, Cedar Mountain, the second Bull Run, and the final retreat of
                        the Army of the Potomac into the fortifications of Washington, with its
                        ranks thrice decimated, its spirit broken, its leaders paralyzed by perfidy,
                        and a victorious and defiant foe confronting our capital, were the
                        thickening shadows which enveloped the National cause in the summer of 1862.
                        Mad[d]ened by its triumnphs [sic], the arm of wasting Treason reached from
                        its own desolated land to the free North, and invited battle on our own
                        green fields and heartsome hills. Inspired as if new life had been given to
                        our defeated and despairing troops, they closed up their broken ranks, and
                        with weary step they marched to avenge the pollution of loyal soil. South
                        Mountain and Antietam more than vindicated their heroism, and if but bravely
                        led, would have made Richmond ours, and left the chief army of crime to
                        exist only in its own fearful history. The God of battles invited the
                        sluggard chief to decisive victory. The autumn smiled with bright days as
                        the defeated foe sought safety from conflict; but the impatient columns
                        moved not in pursuit, and the gory field of Fredericksburg fitly crowned the
                        folly and closed the year.</p>
                    <p>The New Year of sixty three dawned upon the Nation thus sorrowing and
                        humiliated. Mourning was in half our households for loved ones sacrificed in
                        what seemed hopeless war. In the hour of wide-spread gloom, perfidious men
                        had gained power; treason was boasting of its promised supremacy in the
                        popular branch of our National legislature, and two great States had
                        confided their Executive functions to men who condemned their own--not the traitor's government. But loyal men still
                        hoped, still trusted, still sacrificed; and with unfaltering faith stood
                        Abraham Lincoln, as the treacherous, the weak, and the selfish plead our
                        sorrows and discomfitures as a justification for National suicide. Instead
                        of bending beneath the weight of disaster and shrinking from the gloomy
                        future that seemed to confront him, he rose to the full measure of his great
                        duty, and resolved them in the darkest hour of our history, with the very
                        life of the Republic trembling in the scale, to disenthral[l] a continent.
                        Appealing to a just God, and to a loyal People, he smote the colossal crime
                        of Slavery--the fruitful parent of discord and of death--and bid the Nation
                        prove itself worthy of its own deliverance. Wise men had grave misgivings;
                        faithful men were racked with painful doubts; but the bold master-stroke was
                        in the cause of the Right; was true to the teachings and great charter of
                        the founders of the government, and with unshaken purpose and unfading
                        courage its honored author stood as disaster after disaster still came to
                        add to our humiliation and peril. The Iron-clads were repulsed at
                        Charleston; Hooker returned defeated at Chancellorsville; Grant and Banks in
                        vain assaulted the strong-holds of the Mississippi, and mid summer came ere
                        there was so much as a silver lining to the cloud that enveloped our
                        National life. Again the insolence of treason grew boundless, and as our
                        golden harvests were about to invite the reaper to gather in their
                        ful[l]ness, the hordes of Lee flaunted the traitor's flag defiantly in the
                        very heart of our State, living upon our abundance and demanding tribute as
                        the price of fidelity to the government. Again the heroic but ill-starred
                        Army of the Potomac took up its march to repel the invasion of their own
                        homes and avenge the insult to their own loved ones. By forced marches,
                        weary and foot-sore, they encountered the foe at Gettysburg, and after three
                        days of matchless bravery, the pride of Treason was humbled, and its broken,
                        dispirited columns reeled back upon the Potomac, leaving one-third their
                        number behind them. Their dead were left to find sepulchres in the land they
                        sought to desolate, and at the hands of those they had made enemies by
                        causeless war; their wounded were committed to our humanity, and thousands
                        found refuge from rebel desolation and tyranny by fleeing to our mountains
                        until they were compassed by our lines. On the same day--the natal day of
                        the Republic, when loyal hearts everywhere were uniting their prayers for
                        its long continuance as the returning anniversary of our National
                        existence--the stronghold of rebel power on the Mississippi was surrendered;
                        and the day that witnessed the birth of a great Republic eighty-seven years
                        before, witnessed its deliverance from the power of traitors. Soon the last
                        rebel fortification on the Mississippi was given up, and the great Father of
                        Waters severed the boundaries of crime, and coursed its way "unvexed to the
                        sea." Since then the doomed city of the coast has been encircled by loyal
                        troops, and to-day it is at the mercy of Gen. Gilmore's artillery. Gen.
                        Banks has recovered the Rio Grande, with its fortifications, and holds the
                        French under observation in Mexico and is penetrating the heart of Texas.
                        East Tennessee, with its thousands of loyal men, who have suffered untold
                        brutality under rebel tyranny, has been permanently restored to the Union,
                        and its brave sufferers are now swelling our ranks and bidding defiance to
                        their oppressors. Chickamauga was lost by rebel perfidy in swelling their
                        army with prisoners of war; but Gen. Grant has more than avenged it by the
                        utter route of Bragg and the possession of his strongholds, thus ensuring
                        safety to his command and lines until he is fully prepared for a final blow
                        in the Cotton States. Arkansas and Mississippi have surrendered their
                        capitals and with Louisiana, Tennessee, Texas, Florida, North Carolina and
                        East Virginia, will soon be within the folds of the Union again, with loyal
                        representatives responding to the noble sentiments of Maryland, Delaware,
                        the Virginias, Missouri and Kentucky, in behalf of Freedom.</p>
                    <p>Thus closed the eventful year of sixty-three. The Union armies have won
                        decisive fields in every section and redeemed States, unshaken credit, a
                        confident Army and Navy, a preserved Nationality, and an accepted policy of
                        Universal Freedom, are the rich fruits of the heroism of our troops and
                        loyal faith of the people. The once slave is now the enlisted soldier, and
                        has dissipated the fiercest prejudices as he won for his race imperishable
                        fame at Milliken's Bend, at Port Hudson and at Charleston; and the New Year
                        dawns upon us with the bright promise of vindicated Right; of a perpetuated
                        Republic; of a Nation rescued from the withering blight of slavery. Such are
                        the lessons of memorable sixty-three; such the noon-day of promise for
                        sixty-four! Who would erase from our triumphs, and their rich fruits in
                        National Freedom and Progress, one jot or tittle if he could?</p>
