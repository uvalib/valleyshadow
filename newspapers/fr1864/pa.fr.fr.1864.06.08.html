<b>The Union Party--Its Issues</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is interesting to observe how most of the leading politicians of our
                        country have failed in their prophecies relative to the position and
                        principles of the Union party during the terrible ordeal now pending. That
                        many prophesies should have been made is not at all singular. In the midst
                        of the life and death struggles, by which, during the last three years
                        densely populated States have confronted each other in bloody battle, and
                        the most peaceful of our citizens have been distracted, it would indeed have
                        been remarkable, if the spirit of prophecy had not become general, and if
                        the signs of the times had not prompted a general prediction of unexampled
                        confusion in our national politics.</p>
                    <p>The leading statesmen of the old Whig and Democratic parties despaired of the
                        perman[en]cy of the Union, and feared the collision of arms between the
                        North and South. In order to avert so sad a calamity, they were on several
                        occasions induced to yield to compromise when the measures then agitating
                        the public mind should have been fearlessly met and settled according to the
                        spirit, if not the letter of the constitution. These acts of timidity
                        instead of settling dangerous questions, produced political disorder in all
                        parties, from which we believe have grown up the different factions of
                        fanatics, whose extreme views have hurried on the fearful bloody conflict
                        that has deluged our land. When the gates of Janus were unlocked and thrown
                        open, and three years of fratricidal war like a besom of destruction, have
                        swept their way across the South, desolating the whole land, he was a bold
                        man who ventured to predict a harmonious order of things to be restored from
                        this tempestuous confusion.</p>
                    <p>How often have our ears been greeted with the intelligence that party lines
                        have been broken up, and that no party organizations were in existence, save
                        and alone for the purpose of vindicating the integrity of the Government and
                        restoring the Union. How often have we been told that the Democratic party
                        was national in its doctrines, conservative in its tendencies, and loyal in
                        its principles, and that whilst the dark cloud of war hung over our national
                        horizon, its power should be exercised for the preservation of National
                        life; and yet in the face of all this, influential journals, the oracles of
                        this party, have been found advocating a disruption of the Union, as the
                        only practicable method of extricating ourselves from the political
                        entanglements by which we have been overcome.</p>
                    <p>In the midst of our troubles the ultra organs of all parties have been busily
                        engaged in exerting their influences and disseminating their pernicious
                        doctrines. It was an easy matter for them to assert their claims to
                        attention and to wield an influence in public opinion for a time. this we
                        have all seen, and all are equally glad that their existence was brief, and
                        their death as sudden as their birth. The decay of factions is the greatest
                        proof of the stability of our government and its institutions. And now since
                        the rebellion has been stripped of its terrors, and the supremacy of the
                        government has been fully vindicated, the landmarks of duty and principle
                        have become more distinct to the minds of all, except those who are
                        constitutionally incapable of seeing.</p>
                    <p>Universal freedom, the light of the Constitution, that beacon of all true
                        American Statesmen, is now more than ever recognized as the guide through
                        our great national difficulties. The eye of the nation is directed to it,
                        and with one voice does the Union party, the party in power, proclaim its
                        advent. It should be a source of gratification to every Republican, every
                        well wisher of the nation, that the doctrines of our party have triumphed
                        through this terrible struggle; that factions have ceased their blatant
                        uproar, and that the Union party has again the opportunity, during the
                        approaching Presidential struggle, of confronting the disloyal elements of
                        the nation, upon the issues of social, political and national
                        aggrandizement. In the merits of our political creed we have full
                        confidence, relying as we do on the amount of truth we can bring to sustain
                        our cause.</p>
                    <p>Let no Union man be persuaded that the principles for which he has all along
                        contended are about to be abandoned by the party during the coming campaign.
                        The destiny of these principles has not yet been completed and to sacrifice
                        any of them at this time, would but be a step backwards and against the
                        interests of our country. The doctrines of the Union party are those of
                        equitable and peaceful progress. Neither by violence nor by stagnation will
                        they ever propose to succeed; but by a firm decided and steady course, amid
                        every variety of political and social circumstances. The institution of
                        slavery must be abolished, and the States in rebellion subdued and brought
                        back to their allegiance, upon the basis of the free States of the North. A
                        good and substantial circulating paper medium must be established. A tariff
                        sufficient to encourage and protect the free labor of the country must be
                        enacted. These are the doctrines of our party, and when we are found untrue
                        to these, untrue to American interests, we shall admit the claims of others
                        to the possession of a purer patriotism. Until then we shall not cease, with
                        all honesty of purpose, to propose for popular acceptance those great
                        measures in defense of which we are now arrayed, and with reference to which
                        we are not divided.</p>
