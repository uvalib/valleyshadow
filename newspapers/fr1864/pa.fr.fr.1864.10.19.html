<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The great States of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana have declared in thunder
                        tones against a humiliating peace with murderous traitors, and in favor of
                        the prosecution of the war, until its crowning victory is achieved by the
                        submission of rebels to the majesty of the laws. The verdict, so significant
                        on the threshold of a great National struggle, is in no respect indecisive.
                        Pennsylvania, with thirty thousand brave sons just sent to the field, held
                        the enemy at bay on the home vote, while her gallant soldiers have announced
                        in most emphatic language that the men who libel their heroism, hate them
                        for their victories, and rejoice at the misfortunes, shall not rule the fair
                        land they have sought to destroy. Sixteen loyal, faithful members are
                        returned to the next Congress, displacing four of the men who ever voted
                        alike to embarrass the government and its noble armies in its fearful
                        contest with traitors; and a Union legislature in both branches and a
                        decided Union majority on the popular vote, determine beyond all cavil that
                        the Keystone State cannot be seduced or intimidated into suicidal hostility
                        to her brave sons in the field and to the great Nationality of which she is
                        one of the brightest and proudest ornaments. Ohio has swept the
                        Vallandighams, the Pendletons, the Longs and their followers into dishonor
                        by an utterly overwhelming majority--one that consigns the sympathizers of
                        treason to open shame and the authors and followers of the Chicago platform
                        to perpetual obscurity. Scarcely a M'Clellan Congressman is left to tell
                        that his party has an existence in Ohio, where but five out of nineteen in
                        the present Congress fail to vote as Vallandigham and Jeff. Davis would
                        dictate. In Indiana, where Democracy had culminated in open, insolent
                        treachery--in positive and thorough and armed organization to plunge the
                        Nation in to anarchy, the loyal people of all parties have made common cause
                        to hurl the faithless into obscurity by a majority entirely unprecedented.
                        With their gallant soldiers deliberately disfranchised by a disloyal
                        legislature, they confidently hoped to save the State for M'Clellan and
                        Pendleton; but they are routed by a majority of 22,000 and but two of the
                        eleven Congressmen elected are of the M'Clellan school.</p>
                    <p>Such is the verdict of October! It points with unerring certainty to the
                        utter discomfiture of the Chicago tricksters in November, and declares that
                        neither by traitors in arms nor by their less manly aiders in the North
                        shall the great cause of an imperiled Nation be lost. It has determined the
                        November struggle! It has fixed the policy of the People, and while loyal
                        men and the friends of Freedom in every clime will rejoice that
                        self-government is vindicated, the last hope of traitors will fade out as
                        they reel in despair from the overwhelming verdict that treason must
                        die--the Republic must live!</p>
                    <p>Loyal Men!--rally once again for your own and your Country's cause, and let
                        your triumph already well assured, be so decisive that treachery of every
                        shade must cease to breed disorder, and strife and death in the most
                        beneficent government of the world. The battle is already won, but let it
                        leave no future for perfidy; no hope even for mean ambition, but in fideiity
                        [sic] to the Union, the Constitution and the majesty of the Laws!</p>

                        Chambersburg and the immediate districts will improve fully fifty, and noble

                        there be a general rally for the Union in every district, and Franklin will

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A jolly mingling of politicians of all grades was had on election night. When
                        the hour of seven, big with fate, was slowly and solemnly tolled by the old
                        town clock, the little partitioned shanty in front of the ruins of the Court
                        House closed upon the crowd, and the verdicts of Guilford and North Ward
                        were consigned to the officers for inspection. The South Ward voted in a
                        little brick smoke house in the rear of the late Indian Queen. The polls
                        once closed, and independent voters again upon equality with politicians
                        gathered in little knots and fought their battles over with self
                        satisfaction, and each claimed the victory. Faint buzzes could at times be
                        heard in connection with heavy, unsteady steps on the streets, but as a rule
                        the contending parties rested from their labors and awaited the decision of
                        the people.</p>
                    <p>The Repository and Spirit offices were the
                        head-quarters of their respective parties, and the overly anxious rotated
                        between the two as the news hung heavily on the wires. A few fragmentary
                        returns from the State indicated Democratic gains, and partial returns from
                        this county pointed to the defeat of the Union ticket on the home vote.
                        About eleven o'clock a dispatch was sent to both head-quarters stating that
                        the State had gone Democratic by from 20,000 to 30,000 on the home vote, and
                        that the Union men gave up the State as heavily against them. There were
                        dismal faces at the Repository office when the doleful news was read, and
                        boisterous cheers were heard across the way at the Spirit office, and a rush up street, for what purpose was not
                        known. The party made reconnoisances in force in different parts of the
                        town, bet their money freely, hurrahed for M'Clelland and tossed the
                        tumblers with a will, regardless of "Abe Lincoln's tax" on tanglefoot. They
                        retired in squads at various periods, and were encountered by our reporters
                        at different points of their routes. When we saw one of them attempt to
                        light his segar by holding it against the moon, it was supposed that oysters
                        had gone to his head, and when another hurrahed for Jeff Davis it was set
                        down that there are times when some men speak their minds. Another hurrahed
                        "for M'Clure and a rope to hang him," from which our reporter supposed that
                        he must have voted for "that other fellow." Satisfied with from 20,000 to
                        30,000 in the State, the Democracy dispersed and scattered like the
                        Dutchman's milk, "lying around loose," from that until morning. Various bets
                        were taken; but with morning came a different story, and the jubilant
                        Democracy found that they had lost their money and won a headache by the
                        night's performance.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic calculations put down a majority of from 300 to 500 in this
                        county--just the same they had fixed on last year. Like the Bourbons they
                        learn nothing and forget nothing. Having resolved that they would carry the
                        county last year by from 300 to 500, and missed it, they resolved to hit it
                        this year just where they had missed it last year, and it must not be denied
                        that they succeeded admirably. The majority of from 300 to 500 faded down to
                        fifty on the home vote, and before all the districts were in, returns were
                        had from two Franklin companies--one in Tennessee and one in
                        Pottsville--giving enough Union majority to elect the entire Union county
                        ticket. Might it not be well for the Democratic leaders to reverse their
                        state and schedule of majorities for the next campaign? Perhaps if they were
                        to adhere to them for forty years they might come out right once or so, but
                        while dealing with the present generation, they had better revise.</p>
                    <p>Upon the whole election night was orderly, and all seemed content to abide
                        the verdict of the ballot-box and laugh misfortune in the face.</p>
