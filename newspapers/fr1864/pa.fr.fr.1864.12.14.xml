                    thinks it is going to cure rheumatism, and most of the other ills that flesh is
                    heir to; another asserts that it is going to create a great revolution in
                    traveling--that travelers will soon oil the soles of their shoes, step on the
                    railroad bars and slide away with lightening speed to their destinations."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Just now the oil fever rages. It rages everywhere, infects all atmospheres,
                        and has drawn all classes into its dazzling whirl of speculation. Hitherto
                        it has been confined mainly to the great cities and other centres of trade;
                        but it has now ramified into every rural district in the State, and all want
                        to take a chance in the brilliant lottery of fickle Fortune. In view of the
                        fact that Franklin county is likely to invest half a million or more in
                        those stocks, we venture a few suggestions for the consideration of our
                        readers.</p>
                    <p>1. Never invest in non-producing oil lands more than you can afford to lose
                        entirely. We do not mean by this that such investments must always prove a
                        loss; but we do say that they will prove a total loss nine times out of ten,
                        and profit-less forty nine times out of fifty. Of two hundred and fifteen
                        Oil companies now organized in this State, not more than twenty of them are
                        paying bona fide dividends out of the revenues from their wells.
                        Three-fourt[h]s of the remainder will prove dividendless on a total loss to
                        the stockholders.</p>
                    <p>2. Never invest in any Oil stock, good, bad or indifferent, more money than
                        you can spare from your legitimate business without embarrassment. It is
                        never wise to do so, for evn with the best prospects loss is possible. Wells
                        may fail to produce, Oil may fall in price; titles may prove defective and
                        scoundrels may plunder in the management of these as well as other
                        corporations, and it is best to be safe against all such contingencies.</p>
                    <p>3. Make such investments entirely incidental to your regular business on
                        which you depend for a livelihood. It will prove a costly appreciation of
                        wealth if it diverts farmers, tradesmen and other businessmen from their
                        daily pursuits, while if they operate with their spare capital only, and
                        ever bear in mind that it is a tide of speculation only that must ebb and
                        flow with the inflations and depressions of trade, most judicious men may
                        profit by it as it passes, and it will leave them richer in purse and no
                        poorer in fitness for industry when it fades away. Be ever careful that the
                        substance is not abandoned for the shadow. The dog tried that when crossing
                        the stream with the meat in his mouth, and lost both. Many men will be no
                        wiser.</p>
                    <p>4. Invest to the extent of your surplus means in companies with <emph
                            rend="italic">certain</emph> revenues. There are such on the market, and
                        it wants but a little care and discrimination to distinguish them. If it is
                        an ascertained fact that a company has a positive yield of oil equal to ten
                        or twenty per cent, on the cash capital, with good lands and ample reserved
                        capital for development, it is fair to conclude that capital is not likely
                        to be lost in that company. It is reasonably certain to pay good interest,
                        and the stock will have a steady market value equal to its original cost,
                        while the efforts for development are all in favor of the holders. True,
                        even such companies may fail but the chances are largely in favor of
                        dividends.</p>
                    <p>5. It is not best to invest all in any one company. While it is the most
                        profitable of investments when profitable at all, it is at the same time the
                        most precarious, and it is but the part of discretion to try two or three
                        good companies instead of one. If either develops successfully, the others
                        may fail and the operation still prove profitable on the whole.</p>
                    <p>6. Make such investments through some reliable person at home. In the cities
                        the business of selling such stocks to rural friends is a profession, and
                        men are expected to take advice and at the same time be responsible fore
                        results. Most of our leading business men in the centres of trade throughout
                        the county either are operating in such stocks, or are well informed on the
                        subject, and as a rule, they cannot afford deliberately to mislead those who
                        counsel with them. They may err in judgment but generally they will add
                        vastly to the safety of such investments.</p>

                <summary>The editors argue that Congress should not try to regulate the price of
                    gold because regulation resulted in rapid inflation. Congress has made no
                    distinction between gold and currency because only gold can be used by merchants
                    to pay custom duties and by the government to pay the interest on the public
                    debt and the principal at maturity. The editors suggest that an increase in
                    taxes would save the credit of the country.</summary>

                    fire or other causes. The Repository replies the state should compensate
                    citizens for damages since it funds military companies to protect the state.</summary>

                <summary>Describes the organization of the Burning Spring and Ruble Farm Oil
                    Company. Eyster is one of its managers. Also notes that stock for the Imperial
                    Oil company can be bought from the remaining men listed above. Sterling Oil
                    closed its books, but the editors note that at least eighteen new oil companies
                    have been organized in Philadelphia in the last ten days though some are surely
                    "bogus." Only 41 of the 215 organized oil companies have provided dividends. The
                    article also mentions that the Bank of Chambersburg is now the National Bank of
                    Chambersburg and will soon have the national issues.</summary>
