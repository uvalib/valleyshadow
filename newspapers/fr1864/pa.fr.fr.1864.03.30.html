<b>History of the 2d Pa. Artillery</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>More than 300 men from Franklin County have served in the 2nd Artillery,

                    <p>Fort Bunker Hill, D.C., March 23.</p>
                    <p>As Franklin county has quite a number of her sons serving in the 2d Pa.
                        Artillery, a brief history of the Regiment may not be uninteresting to your
                        readers.</p>
                    <p>In October, 1861, Col. Charles Angeroth, a Prussian by birth and education,
                        was authorized by the Secretary of War to raise a Battalion of Heavy
                        Artillery in Pennsylvania for duty at Fortress Monroe, to be Officered in
                        accordance with the views and directions of the Governor.</p>
                    <p>On February 8th, 1862, the Regiment was organized with ten companies,
                        numbering in all about 800 men, made up from the different parts of the
                        State as follows: 4 companies from Philadelphia, 1 from Pittsburgh, 1 from
                        Fayette county, 1 from Luzerne county, 1 from Columbia and Monrour counties,
                        1 from Wayne county, and 1 from Northumberland county.</p>
                    <p>Three companies were immediately assigned to duty at Fort Delaware and the
                        others rendezvoused at Cottage Garden, Camden N.J. until April following
                        when the whole were ordered to the defences around Washington, where the
                        Regiment has been ever since and has done enough of digging in the meantime
                        to have undermined the rebel capitol.</p>
                    <p>In June, 1862, Col. Angeroth resigned, and in August following Capt. A. A.
                        Gibon, of the 2d Regular Artillery was appointed to the Colonelcy. The
                        Regiment then numbered about 600 men. A short time afterwards Capts. Jones'
                        and Schooley's independent Light Batteries were attached by order of the
                        Secretary of War which gave the requisite number of companies for an
                        Artillery Regiment.</p>
                    <p>On August 23, 1862, B.F. Winger was appointed 1st Lieut. in Co. D, vice
                        Lieut. Baggs promoted, and while arranging for the comfort of his family
                            "for three years or during the war" and
                        bidding adieu to his friends in "old Franklin," he enrolled thirty-five men
                        for the Regiment.</p>
                    <p>About October 5th, 1862, Lieut. Winger was ordered on recruiting service in
                        Pennsylvania, and was stationed at Chambersburg and Greencastle, and from
                        that time until April following he enlisted 157 men for the organization. A
                        fine class of men were enlisted, and through their influence at home and the
                        deserved popularity of the Regiment, over one hundred more men were induced
                        to enlist so that Franklin county has turned out for this Regiment at least
                        300 men.</p>
                    <p>The men from Franklin county are distributed among D,B,C,A,H and L, companies
                        and form the stamina of the three former. If the
                        War Department had allowed the men enlisted in the Fall of 1862 to have
                        re-enlisted as veterans, nearly every man would have adorned himself with
                        the honorable veteran badge, but as they had not served two years it could
                        not be done. There are now fourteen vacancies of line officers, and owing to
                        a dead-lock between the authorities at Harrisburg, and our Colonel no
                        commissions are issued to this Regiment. It is to be hoped, however, that
                        the barrier will soon be removed, so that able and deserving
                        non-commissioned officers, of which we have a number, may be promptly
                        promoted to fill the vacancies. It might be in order to remark here that
                        Franklin county has but one commissioned officer in the Regiment, out of all
                        the men she has furnished the organization.</p>
                    <p>The Regiment is now more than full, 1769 enlisted men being the maximum and
                        we have over 2000. There are but two heavy Artillery regiments from
                        Pennsylvania, this one and the 3d (Roberts,) now doing duty at Fortress
                        Monroe. New York State has sixteen, part of which are doing duty as
                        Infantry.</p>
                    <p>A word to the patriotic ladies of our county, and particularly to those
                        connected with "Soldiers' Aid Societies" for sick and wounded soldiers. We
                        have a number sick in our Regimental Hospital and, although abundantly
                        supplied with substantials, a box of delicacies sent by our fair friends
                        would be gratefully received, handsomely acknowledged and the effect upon
                        the cheerless and desponding sick soldier would be most happy. Send in care
                        of Rev. Thos. P. Hunt, Chapl[a]in 2d Pa. Artillery, Fort Saratoga,
                        Washington, D.C., and you can rest assured that the articles will be
                        properly applied. By the way, our Chapl[a]in is a splendid man; a sound
                        practical preacher (Presbyterian,) an able and indefatigable temperance
                        lecturer and a kind genial companion of the sick.</p>
                    <p>There is a rumor that we will leave here shortly; I think it may be so; the
                        desire to go into the field is general; we don't want to serve out our time
                        without trying our hand "in a fight for the Union."</p>

                    <p>The preservation of the Battle-fields of Gettysburg, with its natural and
                        artificial defences in the exact form and condition they presented, in the
                        battles of the 1st, 2d, and 3d days of July last, is the purpose of the
                        Gettysburg Battle-Field Memorial Association. The history of its inception
                        and plan is furnished in the accompanying correspondence and preliminary
                        organization. An incorporation similar to that of a Monument Association is
                        contemplated. To accomplish the design of its founders, a fund is to be
                        created by the voluntary subscription by citizens of sums of money, to be
                        divided into shares of $10, and for which suitable certificates will be
                        issued. The fund thus created will be faithfully devoted to the object,
                        under a management composed of gentlemen of well known business character
                        and of public and private worth. What monumental work of art, what column or

                        fame?</p>
                    <p>The Battle-grounds of Gettysburg--the Battle-field of Pennsylvania--the

                        field of this second war of Independence, because the turning battle of the
                        war, from which dates the downfall of the Rebellion--it appeals with more
                        eloquence to the great loyal heart of the people. To it all eyes turn as to
                        a sacred spot, which should be guarded with religious care, and zealously
                        preserved from disturbance, neglect, or decay, or the wasting of the
                        elements. Its every portion, its redoubts, its wondrously built stone
                        defences, its timber breast-works, its forest heights, with the trees torn
                        by shells and scarred by countless bullets its long lines of earthwork
                        defences--Cemetery Hill, McKnight's Hill, Culp's Hill, Granite Spur, Round
                        Top--these have become sacred to all who love the Republic and delight to
                        honor its brave defenders, whether among its living or its dead. Shall we
                        not pay a just and grateful tribute to the heroic valor and signal triumphs
                        of our army on this ever memorable battle-field? Shall we not contribute to
                        the preservation of these standing memorials of the terrible struggles of
                        the noble men who fought and conquered or fell on this field of bloody
                        strife? Shall we not with an honorable emulation and sincere affection
                        strive to perpetuate these witnesses of their brave deeds, and with intense
                        devotion consecrate this battle ground, a field, both in its outlines and
                        its consequences, more grand than Waterloo? Let it be the shrine of loyalty
                        and patriotism, whither in all times will come the sons of America, and the
                        pilgrims of all lands, to view with wonder and veneration the sacred scenes
                        of heroic struggles, in which were involved the life of the nation and the
                        perpetuity of liberty.</p>

<b>Democratic State Convention</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This withering editorial about the state convention emphasizes how the
                    Democrats developed "scarcely the ghost of a platform," deserted last year's
                    heros (namely Vallandigham), and "seem to think that the Lincoln administration
                    is no worse than that of Jeff. Davis, for they denounce neither."<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We give elsewhere in to-day's paper a full synopsis of the Democratic State
                        Convention, held in Philadelphia on Thursday last. It was in all essential
                        respects such a convention as met in Harrisburg in July, 1863, and adopted
                        resolutions denouncing pretty much everything connected with the war but
                        Jeff Davis and Vallandigham; but time and experience seem to have taught
                        some wholesome lessons--at least the virtue of silence. The same leaders
                        figured in Philadelphia who figured in Harrisburg; the same Frank Hughes who
                        moved the nomination of Woodward and the endorsement of Vallandigham, was in
                        Philadelphia, and the same convictions are cherished now that were cherished
                        one year ago--and why were we favored with a declaration of semi-rebel
                        principles then, and scarcely the ghost of a platform now? And where is poor
                        Vallandigham? He was a martyr one year ago, whose cause was espoused amidst
                        deafening cheers in Harrisburg, while Lee's artillery were thundering within
                        twenty miles of the convention? He was made the Democratic leader of Ohio by
                        acclamation, and Pennsylvania Democracy responded to his treason with like
                        enthusiasm; but now both are nameless in the conventions of the same party
                        in the same States, and the platform of the great Democracy of Pennsylvania
                        must be searched with legal nicety to find the lurking gem of disloyalty
                        that was frosted to the earth in October, 1863. If Val. was a martyr in July
                        last, he is much more a martyr now. The people have persecuted him by
                        overwhelming defeats; the Supreme Court has persecuted him by declaring that
                        it cannot serve the cause of faithless countrymen; Congress has, by a
                        decisive vote, affirmed the justice of his banishment; the Democracy of Ohio
                        have just declared in the late convention that they will no longer have Val.
                        as a millstone about them; and if ever a martyr needed a kind word, Val.
                        does just now. And yet the Democracy of Pennsylvania leave him to his fate
                        without a word of condolence or sympathy. Where are all its thunders in
                        behalf of the great writ of right? Where its withering denunciation of
                        American Bastil[l]es?--of summary arrests?--of unconstitutional war against
                        our Southern "friends?"--of Emancipation?--of Confiscation?--of Negro
                        troops?</p>
                    <p>Alas! how the mighty are fallen! One year ago they denied every feature of
                        our war policy--every measure designed to vindicate the government against
                        the murderous assaults of treason. Now they seem to think that the Lincoln
                        administration is no worse that that of Jeff. Davis, for they denounce
                        neither. In 1863 they deemed only the administration of Lincoln as meriting
                        their rebuke, while that of Davis escaped without so much as one word of
                        denunciation; but one year of progress and they seem to hesitate whether
                        they may not yet prefer their own government to the usurpation of perjured
                        traitors. True they declare the Lincoln administration to be corrupt, and
                        demand its overthrow and a return to Democratic purity--such we presume, as
                        characterized "J.B" in the Lecompton infamy; and they omit all reference to
                        the existence of treason or traitors on the continent, but it is something
                        in the way of deference to loyalty that they now do only by implication what
                        they did boldly but nine months ago; and what they believe just now, or what
                        they are to believe during the next Presidential contest, they don't pretend
                        to know. They frankly confess that they are prepared to accept any
                        declaration of principles that will insure success, and they so inform the
                        Chicago Convention. They call upon their National Convention--not to adhere
                        to any principle--not to look to the preservation of the Union and the
                        overthrow of treason--not to vindicate the devotion of the party to the true
                        theory of government in this trying crisis, but to adopt such a "declaration
                        of principles" as will be "acceptable to all the States on whom we rely to
                        elect a President," and it is to be done after uniting and conferring with
                        the "other Sovereignities of the North!" The
                        Union is ignored, in obedience to the teachings of Davis; and the general
                        government, and its paramount claims upon the States, are thrust aside to
                        bring out before the people for their approval, that fruitful parent of
                        discord and desolation, Sovereignties instead of States. With such a
                        concession to treason, there is nothing left to battle for; with such a
                        platform, the man supporting it, who at the same time supports a war for the
                        preservation of the Union, is a hypocrite and a traitor either to his
                        convictions or to his country. If South Carolina was a Sovereignty in the
                        Union, who dare coerce her to stay or return to it? If this doctrine be the
                        true interpretation of the compact by which the Federal Union was created,
                        then was Beauregard right in bombarding Sumter; then was he right in
                        defending Virginia; and Lee's cause to-day is the cause of Liberty and law.
                        There can be no middle ground. The States must either be subordinate or
                        sovereign--if subordinate, secession is war, and the government must repress
                        it or cease to exist. If they are sovereign, secession is right, if the
                        people of a State desire it, and coercion is wanton, wicked desolation. To
                        declare therefore in recognition of the "Sovereignties of the North" is to
                        declare a recognition of the right of secession, and to vindicate everything
                        in the crimsoned history of treason during three years of relentless war.</p>
                    <p>The Convention that declared the National Union but a fiction and a fraud, by
                        recognizing above its sacred landmarks the "Sovereignties of the North," and
                        that instructs the Chicago Convention to adopt any sort of principles which
                        may be "acceptable to all the States on which we rely to elect a President,"
                        presented Gen. McClellan as its candidate. Whether he is of such easy
                        political virtue as to approve the companionship in which he finds himself,
                        and whether he admires the policy of instructing him to believe anything and
                        everything that will win in the next political campaign, time must
                        determine; but of one thing the Nation will not be indifferent. If he
                        accepts the doctrine that subordinates the Federal Union to the caprices of
                        petty "sovereignties," then was he wise in ever refusing to deliver battle
                        to the enemy, for to fight in such a cause would have been to draw his sword
                        in the atrocious murder of his countrymen.</p>

                    <p>Col. Hallowell, a young citizen of Philadelphia, and a veteran in the war,
                        commanded the Massachusetts 54th, which behaved so splendidly in the
                        desperate battle of Oluster, or Ocum Pond as it is termed in the official
                        dispatch of Beauregard. An officer writes: "Before going into battle the
                        54th was double-quicked for a mile, and, as they went in, General Seymour
                        said to Colonel Hallowell, 'The day is lost; you must go in and save the
                        corpse.' He did go in and save it, checked the enemy, held the field, and
                        was the very last to leave, and covered the retreat." Another correspondent
                        says: "I hear loud praises of the 54th Massachusetts 8th United States, and
                        1st North Carolina (colored.) They went up at the double quick when our
                        advance was nearly destroyed, and saved the left from being turned, in which
                        case the whole force would have been annihilated. The conduct of the troops
                        is represented to have been uniformly admirable. The colored troops did
                        nobly. Colonel Hallowell, in an address to his regiment, told them he could
                        not find fault with a single officer or man. And I could but admire their
                        patience while waiting to have their wounds dressed, and to be conveyed to
                        the hospital from the steamer. In the 8th U.S. colored, one of the
                        battle-flags was lost, but not till after eight men had been killed in the
                        color guard."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We had a nice, long gossipy chat yesterday with old Aunty Diluvian, and
                        really think some of her remarks worth jotting down. "What a pity it is,"
                        said the old lady, "that our boys and girls are allowed to run the streets
                        at will. In my time, the excuse for the rising generation was "boys will be
                        boys," but now the trouble is, boys will not be
                        boys, nor will girls be girls. Little do parents know what their Billys and
                        Sallys are doing, while they sit quietly at home,
                        perfectly satisfied that Providence will look after their children;
                        complacently thinking that they are training up their little folks in the
                        way they should go. I tell you "as the twig is bent the tree's inclined."
                        Yes, bent crooked, inclined to evil ways! In my day we had no Sunday
                        Schools, and my parents made it their bounden duty, as well as pleasure, to
                        instruct us all in the Holy Scriptures every Sunday; but now-a-days fathers
                        and mothers delegate this obligation to a teacher, without inquiring into
                        his qualifications, turning a blessing into a curse. For a poor child that
                        cannot attend school during the week, and for any child that has Godless
                        parents, the Sunday School is an excellent institution, but not so to one
                        transferred by christian guardians to an incompetent and careless
                        instructor. Mind you, I've not one word to say against Sunday Schools; and
                        give them full credit for all the great good they have done; but I don't
                        like to see parents giving up their places to the Sunday School teachers,
                        who surely should be considered only as supplementary. No, home training is
                        half the battle, and if each one would attend to his own children first and
                        other people's next, the world would grow better very fast."</p>
                    <p>Stoneman made his raid, Kilpatrick too, and others known to fame. Be it our
                        task to note one on a smaller scale, but equally unfortunate to the raiders.
                        Last week on Tuesday morning a Lieutenant of the 20th Cavalry, accompanied
                        by one Sergeant and as many privates, made a reconnoisance [sic] in force
                        (that is a forcible reconnoisance) in to the room of one of the boarders at
                        Montgomery's Hotel. The raid was in some respects perfectly successful, the
                        enemy's property being seized en masse and promptly confiscated, even to the
                        commanding officer's dressing case, hair grease, brushes and combs, towels,
                        handkerchiefs, etc, etc. The troops retired in good order and still better
                        time, without any straggling, but were unfortunately discovered by a
                        guer[r]illa belonging to the Hotel, who gave the alarm. Our cavalry were
                        pursued, and not being well mounted (that is, not having horses,) were soon
                        overtaken and captured--one of them in a stable, termed in military parlance
                        a cul-de-sac--by the assistance of some U.S. Troops, who turned on their
                        brethren in arms; particularly, we would mention, a Captain of cavalry, who
                        not satisfied with their seizure, must needs lodge the prisoners of war in
                        jail, and take measures to have them prosecuted. Such is fame, such is
                        glory, and such is life; unsuccessful in jail; successful, an Alexander, a
                        Caesar, or a Napoleon. We are sorry to say that the property was recovered,
                        some in good order and some not so, particularly the latter. We would like
                        to give the name of the Lieutenant commanding the raid, but as he may have a
                        mother or a sister, we refrain.</p>
                    <p>Among the many incidents of last summer's invasion, we have never seen the
                        following in print. A colored clergyman, named Lewis Nelson by name,
                        happened to be in Chambersburg, on his regular circuit, at the time Jenkin's
                        cavalry first arrived. He and five others concealed themselves in a wheat
                        field east of town, from Monday evening till Wednesday morning, without
                        food, when they were taken prisoners by a squad of Rebel cavalry. The
                        officer in command examined them as to whether they might be contrabands or
                        not, and sent off the four others in charge, retaining Nelson; and observing
                        some white men two or three fields off, sent his men after them. Our colored
                        preacher thought it would be good time now to achieve his liberty, and
                        forthwith drew from his pocket a pistol and shot the officer, not inflicting
                        however a dangerous wound. The two closed, and after a protracted tussel the
                        negro succeeded in possessing himself of his enemy's carbine. By this time
                        another of the Rebs had come up hot foot to the assistance of his comrade;
                        but out black skinned hero raised his gun and said he'd shoot unless they'd
                        promise to let him go. The promise was given with a "don't shoot Uncle," and
                        away sped Lewis Nelson, with his trophy, glad and worthy of the freedom he
                        had won by his own right hand.</p>
                    <p>We would earnestly advise ladies not to think for one moment of traveling
                        alone on the railroad at present. We know of a lady's being grossly and
                        repeatedly insulted by some soldiers on the Cumberland Valley cars, within a
                        few days, because she was alone. We have no right to expect a Conductor to
                        protect the ladies on a train of half a dozen cars, carrying perhaps three
                        hundred passengers; but we have a right to expect any one who possesses a
                        particle of self respect to knock the teeth down the throat of any
                        scoundrel, whether dressed in blue or black, who presumes to utter in the
                        presence of a lady improper language, or still worse to address it to her.
                        God help our country, if on our public thoroughfares there are more rowdies
                        than decent men, and a lady must not only be exposed to insult, but can find
                        no man to punish the rascal as he deserves.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Palmer arrived in this place on Monday last, having been appointed to
                        a Captaincy in the 21st Penna. Cavalry, by Gov. Curing, as a compliment to
                        his extraordinary exertions in our valley during the past summer. Should the
                        Lieutenant ever become a Major General, we shall still persist in calling
                        him Lieutenant, for as Lieutenant Palmer he lived among us, made friends of
                        old and young, and when occasion offered, fought for us with his whole heart
                        and soul. We venture to say that there is not a little boy or girl, a man or
                        a woman in Chambersburg, who does not know and love him. He has so
                        identified himself with us that we claim him as our own. Who that saw him
                        alone stopping the panic of Milroy's train as they rushed through our
                        streets like mad devils, will ever forget him? And who that saw him every
                        now and then as he appeared among us while Lee's army occupied the town, did
                        not feel that something was being done for our safety. Let all our women
                        cry, "God bless him!" and let the men shout, "Three cheers for Captain
                        Palmer!"</p>
                    <p>We hardly know what to say about the weather, for we have had rain, and snow,
                        and sunshine, ice and storm, overcoats and shirt-sleeves, umbrellas and
                        sun-shades. There must surely be a mistake somewhere. Some persons suppose
                        the late spring to be owing to the combination of the coal dealers.</p>
                    <p>Our town is, moderately speaking, dirty with a little exaggeration it might
                        be called filthy. How easy it would be for the Town council to pass an
                        ordinance compelling every occupant of a house to keep the gutter and half
                        of the street opposite his premises clean. No, we will all wait till
                        mid-summer, and then when the Pestilence comes we will wonder at the
                        "mysterious dispensation of Providence," forgetful of "Hercules and the
                        wagoner."</p>

                    <p>The Valley Spirit appeared last week in a new suit
                        of beautiful type and wearing upon its clean face every evidence of
                        pecuniary prosperity. It is conducted with most commendable energy, and
                        deservedly ranks as one of the leading Democratic papers of the State. In
                        all save its political principles, we record its success with satisfaction.
                        The same paper announces the dissolution of the firm and the withdrawal of
                        Wm. Kennedy, Esq. Messrs. Hampsher and Keyser remain and will henceforth
                        conduct the Spirit. Mr. Kennedy, it is
                        understood, will soon commence the publication of a new Democratic paper in
                        Shippensburg, and locate there permanently to pursue his profession of the
                        law. He is a keen and vigorous writer, and when a little more chastened in
                        style by the rude lessons of experience, he will attain a high rank as a
                        political disputant. In the frequent controversies between this journal and
                        the Spirit under his direction, the personal
                        relations of the writers were ever unchanged, and he will bear with him to
                        his new field of operations the kindest personal wishes of the
