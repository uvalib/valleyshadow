<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Union Men! the time for argument is past. Action, earnest, systematic,
                        tireless action alone remains to fulfil[l] the measure of loyal duty. In
                        less than one week the people of the North must determine by their suffrages
                        whether the war for the life of the Republic shall be arrested in the midst
                        of our victories by a humiliating "cessation of hostilities"--whether our
                        sacrifices of brave men fallen in our country's cause, and of millions of
                        treasure, shall be pronounced vain and fruitless.</p>
                    <p>The issue cannot, must not be evaded. It stares every loyal man in the face;
                        is plain as if written in letters of living light, so that he who runs may
                        read, and the subtlest sophistry is defied to conceal the momentous issue
                        from the candid, intelligent and faithful citizen. If Gen. M'Clellan shall
                        be chosen President it must be accepted by friend and foe at home and
                        abroad, as a verdict in favor of Peace upon any terms, even at the cost of
                        dismemberment; while if the national verdict is for Mr. Lincoln, as it
                        surely must be, it is a declaration that the war, now to all human
                        appearances on the threshold of final and complete success, shall be
                        prosecuted until despairing traitors yield to the majesty of the laws and
                        the unity of the States.</p>
                    <p>We appeal to faithful men to appreciate the issue and give it that effort its
                        crowning importance merits. It is fraught with the peace, the order, the
                        safety of, every citizen, for the maintenance of government is the first
                        duty--the last refuge of all. If we would accept a degrading peace our
                        government would be without honor and power, and its millions of suicides
                        would be without shame; and anarchy would be the sad fate of the fairest
                        continent of the world. We should be without credit, without security,
                        without law, and oppressed in every hand; the direst despotism would be at
                        last welcomed as the fruits of our perfidy to our own and a sacred country's
                        cause.</p>
                    <p>The loyal hearts beat strong with confidence of final triumph. Indiana has
                        spoken by 22,000 majority; Ohio by over 50,000 and Pennsylvania by over
                        12,000--with one accord declaring for the preservation of the government and
                        the vindication of the honor of brave armies. Thus foreshadowed by the
                        October verdict, the Nation cannot turn upon itself in November. But it must
                        be decisive, as it can be. The faithful people would stand appalled, should
                        the result of the great struggle of Tuesday next exhibit the Union ticket
                        but barely successful. And that is possible if there be remissness or over
                        confidence. Already the most glaring friends are shown to be in course of
                        consummation by our desperate and unscrupulous foes, and every loyal heart
                        must be quickened and every loyal arm strengthened to give overwhelming
                        victory to the Right. Forward loyal men! The day is at hand--the crowning
                        triumph is within your grasp, and enduring Peace, through victory, must soon
                        be restored to our Union, in honor, might and Freedom!</p>
