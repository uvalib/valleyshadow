                <excerpt>"They forget that Slavery is the parent of this cruel war and its
                    wide-spread mourning and desolation; that the unnatural strife that has made a
                    continent tremble from centre to circumference and dotted our fair land with
                    unnumbered hecatombs of untimely dead, is but the bitter stream the ever

                    common glory in the record of National greatness, it is not within the province
                    of diplomacy to dictate how the terrible sword of retributive justice shall
                    fall."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>We do not close our eyes to the fact that there are thousands of men whose
                        honest aspirations are for the safety of the Republic, who voted against Mr.
                        Lincoln at the late election because they feared that under his
                        administration, the slavery issue may subordinate the preservation of our
                        Nationality. That those apprehensions are imaginary and not in any sense
                        real, and that they are measurably or wholly the natural fears of past born
                        prejudice insensibly asserting its supremacy, we do not doubt; but let us
                        deal with men and prejudice as they are for in the preservation of our
                        imperiled government there is enough to demand, the energies and cordial
                        co-operation of every faithful citizen. None can be spared by mere
                        abstractions enough must be spared of positive hostility to our country's
                        cause. For those who have [illegible] institutions whose beneficence they
                        have enjoyed, and who would espouse any side of any cause to weaken the
                        loyal power of the Nation, we have no words of explanation, for none could
                        make them faithful; but we would not thrust from our side in the great
                        battle for Liberty and Law those who, however mistakenly, desire to secure
                        enduring Peace and an honored Union for ourselves and posterity.</p>
                    <p>"Recall your Emancipation Proclamation" is the stereotyped objection of many
                        honest men who but for long cherished and lingering prejudices would be
                        foremost among the faithful in this momentous struggle. To them it is a
                        stumbling clock because their habits of thought and the affiliation of years
                        with the devotees of Slavery, have left convictions which stubbornly resists
                        the light of truth and progress. They will concede that Slavery is dead; in
                        many instances sincerely and in all cases effect to rejoice that it cannot
                        survive the war; but with the same breath they will insist that it must die
                        some peaceable, calm and honored death, rather than pass away I the midst of
                        the convulsive throes of revolution. They forget that Slavery is the parent
                        of this cruel war and its wide-spread mourning and desolation; that the
                        unnatural strife that has made a continent tremble from centre to
                        circumference and dotted our fair land with unnumbered hecatombs of untimely
                        dead, is but the bitter stream the ever disturbed and disturbing fountain of
                        Human Bondage; and having hung the dark pall of fratricidal war upon a
                        people with a common language, a common history and a common glory in the
                        record of National greatness, it is not within the province of diplomacy to
                        dictate how the terrible sword of retributive justice shall fall.</p>
                    <p>We are not of those who believe that precedents or adopted policies must be
                        perpetual. We hold that change in obedience to enlightened progress is more
                        wise than the pride that yields not to the ever shifting canvass of the
                        present. We do not care <emph rend="italic">how</emph> slavery shall die,
                        nor does the honored author of the Emancipation Proclamation. He aims at the
                        great end; the disenthralment of a great people from the gigantic element of
                        disorder and death in their midst, and step by step as the people and the
                        interests of the Nation have demanded, he has steadily but surely advanced
                        toward the crowning consummation of deliverance. That the Emancipation
                        Proclamation was an imperious necessity at the time it was issued we cannot
                        doubt. It was just then as essential to our national safety as has ever been
                        a victory in the field, and its beneficent aim was confessedly but a reflex
                        of the settled convictions of an earnest people involved in a death struggle
                        with a relentless foe. That it was regret[t]ed by many is but the truth of
                        history. Those who counseled with their tears looked for increased
                        desperation on the part of the insurgents, and many who blessed its
                        universal proffer of Freedom trembled lest it should fail in crowning its
                        own proposed deliverance with success. That the wounded, writhing monster
                        itself should greet such a deadly thrust at its vitals with curses loud and
                        deep, was but natural; but each day strengthened the right and weakened the
                        power of crime, until nearly four years of war brings us to a great national
                        verdict teaching in unmistakable terms, that Treason and Slavery must die,
                        and that to that great end the whole Moral, Physical and Financial power of
                        the People is pledged.</p>
                    <p>What we would have honest but doubting men understand is that the extinction
                        of Slavery is now conceded by friend and foe. Loyal men of every shade
                        demand that it shall die as the colossal suicide of the world's history;
                        that it shall not survive the unholy strife it senselessly [illegible] in
                        the midst of peace and prosperity. They have no fixed form by which it must
                        pass from existence, but that it must henceforth be a thing, a blot, a
                        blistering stain of the past, is as firmly settled as the stars in their
                        spheres. And with their voices are now mingled the voices of the leaders of
                        crime themselves. the cause they revolted to maintain has strewn their paths
                        thickly with the fruits of humiliation and shame, and they, in their
                        desperation, now counsel how they can make slavery deluge itself in the
                        final overthrow of treason. Its abandonment is gravely [illegible] by the
                        usurpers who claim to be the Executive of the revolted States; and his
                        Congress is distracted with the same restless, ever disturbing issue. They
                        now proclaim to us and to the civilized world that Slavery is <emph
                            rend="italic">not</emph> an issue in this struggle; that it may die and
                        the contest survive and they are about to yield to the last resort of crime
                        and cast from them the giant parent of disorder and woe, to enable them, as
                        a last refuge, to elicit the sympathies of christian nations in their mad
                        perfidy and wanton war.</p>
                    <p>When the traitors themselves who seized upon slavery as a pretext for armed
                        revolt insist the government abandon it to its late and [illegible] that it
                        has the [illegible], what is there to divide loyal men on the issue. As to
                        how it may die, when all agree that it has already suffered its death blow,
                        and must not survive, the bloody struggle is [illegible] hard, is not a
                        question of moment. The Emancipation proclamation cannot be in the way of
                        peace. It is the offspring of the war power of the organic laws and the
                        exercise of those powers must cease when [illegible] to the laws cease. The
                        channels of adjustment known to [illegible] and the civil power of the
                        government, must then resume their supremacy, and whatever may have been the
                        success of the measure growing out of the exercise of the extraordinary
                        powers for the [illegible] it cannot survive the restoration of the
                        government to the laws and [illegible]. By the [illegible] law of the
                        civilized world, the Emancipation proclamation was [illegible] judge. So
                        long as it is in force its powers are supreme. No slave [illegible] command
                        can by any known law [illegible] become a slave. But should [illegible] and
                        a measure of military necessity could not survive to complete its work.
                        Slaves not actually made free by the operation of such a measure could not,
                        after a return to peace, be liberated by its power. What means shall be
                        adopted to adjust the issues growing out of the war, we cannot now foresee;
                        but the steps taken will be in accordance with the requirements of the
                        Constitution, vesting the peace making powers in the President and Congress.
                        They, with the courts, may hold that the act of rebellion destroyed Slavery.
                        It being the creature of our organic law, and that protecting power having
                        been spurned, rejected and defied by armed resistance, has been forfeited
                        and cannot be revived--or Congress may prefer, as is now warmly urged by the
                        friends of the administration, that an amendment of the Constitution
                        abolishing Slavery shall be adopted by the States. These and the additional
                        resort of a convention of the States for their revision of our organic law,
                        are all in harmony with the purposes of the administration and the people,
                        who demand that Slavery shall cease to be a disturbing element in our midst.</p>
                    <p>Agreeing as do the people without distinction of party and the administration
                        that Slavery must not survive the war, let no man permit his partizan
                        prejudices to cloud his devotion to the great cause of saving our government
                        from armed rebellion. Let us unite its brethern [sic] to destroy the
                        military power of the foe, and when resistance ceases, as in time it must,
                        we full well assured that no mere abstraction will be allowed for a moment
                        to retard a just and honorable peace that gives promised enduring
                        tranquil[l]ity by the removal of the crowning cause of our discord and
                        desolation.</p>
