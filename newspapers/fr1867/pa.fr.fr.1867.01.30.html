<b>Reconstruction</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Almost two years has passed since the end of the war, relate the editors,
                    yet in that time Congress has failed to lay out a clear reconstruction plan that
                    enjoys broad support among Republicans. The implications of the current state of
                    affairs in Washington are deeply troubling, they warn. With the "breach between
                    the sections still widening," the continued impasse will only make the task of
                    finding an agreeable solution all the more difficult.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The serious diversity of sentiment prevailing in the councils of the
                        Republican members of Congress, on the question of reconstruction, is justly
                        exciting grave apprehensions in the public mind; and as but thirty days
                        remain for the present Congress to act, the people are compelled most
                        reluctantly to accept the postponement of reconstruction to the 40th
                        Congress. The mere delay is in itself of little moment; but the fact that
                        after two years of earnest effort, no common platform for the restoration of
                        the rebellious States has been harmoniously devised, naturally casts doubt
                        and uncertainty upon the future. Mr. Stevens was compelled to move to table
                        his own bill last week, and as yet there is no substitute that promises to
                        marshal greater strength. If the differences related to mere matters of
                        detail, they could be easily reconciled; but the debate on Mr. Stevens' bill
                        developed the most radical antagonism among the Republican members, which
                        cannot be readily compromised. While one portion of the House resisted it
                        because it was too radical, others opposed it with equal earnestness because
                        it was too liberal, and between the two it could not but fail.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stevens' bill having failed, what next? Had the Southern States accepted
                        the constitutional amendments, the solution of the whole problem would be
                        comparatively easy. The faith of the nation was plighted by the ruling
                        power, that compliance with those amendments in good faith and in all
                        respects would entitle the excluded States to admission; but the fact that
                        terms so magnanimous have been rejected with one accord by those who
                        committed the crime of causeless rebellion is a grave admonition to the
                        nation that its peace, safety and even its perpetuity demand some sterner
                        adjustment. What it shall be, is for Congress to determine. The man chosen
                        by a loyal people to the Vice Presidency, and called to the execution of
                        this great task by treason's crowning hate, has proved false to his highest
                        and holiest duties, and upon the Representatives of the people devolves the
                        work of reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>Considering that outside of Congress there is no trusted aid in the
                        restoration of the rebellious States, in the other branches of the
                        government, does not every dictate of patriotism demand speedy harmony in
                        Congress? The longer this question is delayed, the more difficult will be
                        its solution; and if delayed another year for want of a fixed and just
                        policy, it is within the range of probability that the struggle will be
                        protracted beyond another Presidential election, with treason steadily
                        growing more and more defiant and the breach between the two sections still
                        widening. Such delay would be most perilous alike to the nation and to the
                        great issues decided by the war. The faithless men of the north, who have
                        ever been ready to make common cause with treason, would be strengthened in
                        their efforts, and with them would be strengthened also the deadly foes of
                        free government in the South. From being criminals they would appear as
                        dictators of their own destiny and rulers of the government they sought to
                        destroy, and the great struggles of 1865-6 would have to be fought over
                        again by the people.</p>
                    <p>We do not pretend to say wherein Congress is in error as to the policy of
                        reconstruction. Of that the members who have to discharge this duty are the
                        best judges; but we cannot too strongly impress upon them the necessity of
                        early and decisive action. First of all they must meet on some common
                        platform of adjustment--one on which all loyal Representatives can stand--so
                        that they can rely upon perfecting their work regardless of perfidy
                        elsewhere. If Mr. Stevens' bill is defective, let some one produce a better
                        one, and let the author of each policy bear in mind that in this wide
                        diversity of sentiment there must be concession--not the compromise of right
                        with wrong, nor the compromise of the loyal power of the nation with
                        unrepentant traitors--but such concessions between faithful men as will
                        preserve the substance of the logical results of the war. To this end we
                        invoke the aid of every Republican Senator and Representative. It is their work to perform, and exclusively their work;
                        and they must do it under all circumstances, with a singleness of purpose
                        looking to impartial Justice and enduring Freedom.</p>

                    <p>An old and ever loyal citizen of Virginia, who once resided in this place,
                        gives the following portrait of affairs in Virginia:</p>
                    <p>The South is not only broken down and destitute, but apart from the
                        deleterious effects of Johnson's policy, its incorrigible perversity of
                        spirit, retarded a tendency towards healthy, recuperative reconstruction;
                        but since Johnson's apostasy from, and direct antagonism to, Republican
                        principles, that perversity among rebels, because encouraged by the
                        omnipotence of Presidential influence, has grown into such fixed and
                        determined, implacable hatred of radicalism, that, instead of promoting
                        harmonizing results, its developments indicate a purpose, on the part of
                        rebels, to encourage disaffection, foment the elements of discord, and thus,
                        if possible, make more insuperable the barriers to a national compromise.</p>
                    <p>Our national representatives alone are worthy of the confidence of the
                        nation. To their vigilance, wisdom and energy, under God, do we owe the
                        glorious ameliorative and reformatory results of the war. And now after
                        their sublime achievements, that an apostate President should basely
                        interpose his executive authority, to overthrow the structure of national
                        glory they reared, is not only intolerable, but a crying insult to the
                        national honor and a wanton outrage of the national confidence. Southern
                        loyalists have been sadly dishearted by the vast multitudes in the North
                        who, by their votes, gave utterances of opposition to the wise and just
                        measures of our national councils. Ah! thought we, the wisest of men will
                        err, if deficient in the advantages of an experimental education. Had they
                        had my advantages of observation for the last forty-four years, how
                        differently would they have thought, felt and acted. How indignantly would
                        they have spurned favoritism or political affiliation with the rebels. But
                        ignorant of the real character of Southern oligarchists they, in their
                        blindness, have been "led like sheep to the slaughter," yet, we fear, not as
                        innocently. We can make no other inference from their conduct, than that
                        their preferment of Southern rebels and their domestic institutions, was so
                        strong as to make them willing to sacrifice Southern loyalists and the great
                        interests of the Union in its maintenance. I mourn over and am ashamed to
                        contemplate, that character of that portion of the North that has
                        contributed its political influence to sanction the apostasy of the
                        Executive, and to commend his betrayal of the sincere confidence and buoyant
                        hopes of the national party which, by their votes, honored him with his
                        position. Was ever treason as black as his? Neither Judas, nor Arnold, was
                        characterized by the infamy of betraying their cause after the consummation
                        of its utmost triumphs. Nay, both these acted under the mitigating doubt of
                        its final success. But Johnson, after he held the scepter of acknowledged
                        conquest in his grasp, and was looked up to by his exultant votaries, with
                        the hope that he would crown their loyal wishes by his sincere adherence to
                        the policy of the Union party, as indicated by its loyal representatives, in
                        a manner that puts the claims of the rivals at defiance, renounces his
                        devoted friends, and recreantly assumes the advocacy of the rebel miscreants
                        who, at the close of the war, he had with so much embittered vehemence
                        denounced.</p>
                    <p>To show you the baseness of his character, I will give you a short chapter of
                        his dealing against me as Postmaster. Soon after the surrender a floating
                        rumor proclaimed me Postmaster. The rebels anticipating this, as they knew
                        me to be the only eligible loyalist in town, and alarmed at the probability
                        of its truth, immediately formed a league against me to prevent, if
                        possible, the certainty of my getting the office, and to secure it for a
                        drunken rebel. To effect this they got up a secret petition, and even had
                        the address through flatteries and festive entertainments, to secure the
                        signatures of the Union officers quartered here, to aid their treacherous
                        designs against me. But firmly apprised of their movements, I gave immediate
                        information of them to the Postmaster General, whereupon Gen. Curtin was
                        dispatched to investigate their conduct, who arrested and took them to
                        headquarters, where they were adequately punished. Thus, in this instance,
                        did I see my enemies signally overthrown. The February following, a young
                        Confederate Colonel, yet wearing his faded military laurels, undertook, by a
                        violent assault upon my aged person, while at my post of duty in my office
                        and without any provocation, to revenge himself and party upon me for my
                        success in getting the office. But he "caught a Tartar," for I overthrew the
                        proud champion in less time than David achieved his feat over the
                        Philistine, and that to his own satisfaction and the dismay of his
                        supporters, some fifteen or twenty of whom were present. This, however, made
                        them only more determined in their future opposition, for nothing short of
                        my ruin was their aim. Hence, having heard me express some sentiments of
                        opposition to the policy of Johnson, they, to gratify their malignant
                        revenge, availed themselves of this and reported me to the Postmaster
                        General, as an ultra radical, and, favored by Johnson's recreancy, they
                        thus, by a secret petition, secured my removal. The persons concerned in
                        this plot claim to be Christians, yet the deed, because based in pure rebel
                        malice against me as a loyalist, was an instance of villainous robbery. Yet
                        all this was done to me and mine by these monsters, aided by the omnipotent
                        influence of Johnson, the prince of traitors, without whose traitorous
                        complicity they could not have accomplished their purposes, and who, by
                        loyal men in the South, is the most detested of all creatures. He is a
                        reproachful caricature to the name of man, and his traitorous recreancy will
                        make the blackest stain on the pages of our country's history. Arnold's and
                        Burr's will acquire light from the contrast with his. I wrote to the
                        President, to the Postmaster General, the Auditor, and to members of
                        Congress on the subject, and it is the general belief that I will again get
                        the office. Since I lost the office the salary has been considerably
                        increased.</p>
