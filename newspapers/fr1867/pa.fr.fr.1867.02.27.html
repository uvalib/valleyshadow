<b>The Morn Breaks Brightly</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors celebrate the passage of the Military Reconstruction bill,
                    which they claim "cannot fail to rally the whole nation to the fulfillment of
                    its just and highest duty to Freedom and Mankind."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We give elsewhere in to-day's paper the Reconstruction bill passed finally by
                        both branches of Congress last Wednesday, and now in the hands of the
                        President for his approval or veto. What he may do with it matters little,
                        save so far as his action may indicate his purpose to persist in Wrong or
                        yield gracefully to the inevitable triumph of Right. The bill passed the
                        Senate by the overwhelming vote of 35 to 7--Pennsylvania, as usual,
                        furnishing two votes to proclaim her shame,--and in the House by 125 to 46,
                        being a strict party vote. One of the most significant signs of the times is
                        the manly support given the bill by Hon. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, one
                        of the ablest and most earnest of the President's supporters. If the
                        President shall sign the bill, his action will indicate his acceptance of
                        the inexorable march of events under the guidance of a determined and loyal
                        people, and will hasten and smooth the way to complete restoration. If on
                        the contrary, as we anticipate, he shall interpose his veto, the bill will
                        become a law notwithstanding, by the largest vote ever given to any
                        contested measure in our national legislature, and will be enforced either
                            by the President or over the President. He takes his choice either to do right or see it
                        done without his aid, and in defiance of his persistent but now harmless
                        apostasy. Under existing laws, the President can hold the bill until the
                        meeting of the next Congress, (the 5th of March) as it was not sent to him
                        until within ten days of adjournment; but if he should smother the bill by a
                        "pocket veto," the next Congress will re-enact the bill into law within the
                        first fortnight of the session, by a stronger vote than that by which it
                        passed last week.</p>
                    <p>We invite the dispassionate consideration of men of all parties to the
                        details of the bill. It goes to the very root of the malady that has been
                        festering in the rebellious States since the war, now and again erupting in
                        the shape of the Memphis, New Orleans and other massacres, and making
                        loyalty a term of reproach throughout the whole country embraced in the
                        rebellion. Every effort has been made--even to criminal leniency on the part
                        of the Executive--to regain the controlling people of the South to fidelity,
                        order and law; but each concession and every step toward generous pardon,
                        has but nerved disloyal arms and made disloyal hearts mingle their
                        implacable hatred for free institutions with the intensest hate for every
                        loyal statesman, every loyal measure, and every loyal citizen who claimed
                        the South as his home. Our military commanders, from Grant down, none of
                        whom are charged with radicalism, give concurrent testimony that the
                        submission of the rebellious people is but a mockery and a lie, and that the
                        safety of loyal men and freedmen in those States is solely in the military
                        arm of the government. With one accord these heroic chieftains deprecate the
                        subordination of the civil to military rule, and have resolutely struggled
                        to restore the civil powers to supreme authority; but all have informed the
                        government that they utterly despair of even ultimate success, as long as
                        leading rebels fill every public position and dictate the policy and laws of
                        that section. There is not an Executive in one of the rebellious States who
                        did not give his best efforts to dismember the Union. None others could be
                        chosen, and to be even suspected of luke-warmness in the cause of treason
                        during the war, has thus far been fatal to the aspirations of every citizen,
                        however distinguished or useful he has been.</p>
                    <p>The act of Congress places the pretended governments of the rebellious States
                        in their proper position. As State governments, or as governments of States,
                        they are but colossal monuments of Executive usurpation; but Congress
                        pronounces them as provisional only, and subordinates them entirely to the
                        military authority, and provides for their early extinction. The practical
                        effect of the bill is to bring the rebel States under martial law, but it
                        wisely provides that the proper exercise of the duties and prerogatives of
                        the civil powers will restrain the interference of military authority, and
                        provides for their early extinction. The practical effect of the bill is to
                        bring the rebel States under martial law, but it wisely provides that the
                        proper exercise of the duties and prerogatives of the civil powers will
                        restrain the interference of military authority in any way whatever. It
                        provides for the faithful and impartial administration of justice--a feature
                        thus far entirely novel in the government of those States since the war; and
                        it sends to all--to traitors South and their impotent but still malignant
                        abetters in the North--the long needed admonition that henceforth there
                        shall be impartial justice and entire equality before the law in every
                        section of the Union.</p>
                    <p>Most wisely, we think, Congress has not stopped with merely providing for the
                        maintenance of justice in the rebellious States. Earnestly as some of the
                        truest men in Congress resisted the acceptance of the Blaine Amendment, (the
                        fifth section of the bill) it cannot be questioned that the principle
                        involved in it met the overwhelming approval of the Republicans throughout
                        the country, and its adoption will be hailed with the profoundest
                        satisfaction. While the action of the rebels warranted almost any degree of
                        harshness in the laws for their government, yet the nation has in every way
                        manifested its desire that some definite terms for the restoration of the
                        seceded States should be proposed in such shape that they could, by
                        voluntary acceptance, place themselves again within the folds of the Union,
                        and at the same time give ample power for the enforcement of the terms in
                        case they should be rejected. The only plausible complaint against the
                        proposed amendments to the constitution, was the want of any positive
                        assurance that their adoption would facilitate restoration. Willing to grasp
                        any pretext for refusing to accept them, under the advice of a perfidious
                        Executive, they refused to accept what was in fact the plighted faith of
                        Congress that the adoption of, and faithful conformance to, those amendments
                        would restore the States to representation and all their sovereign rights.
                        That refusal has quickened the nation to appreciate the great peril of rebel
                        rule, and now treason is about to crown its utter overthrow with manhood
                        suffrage--a fruition that the persistent malignity of treason only was
                        potent enough to achieve.</p>
                    <p>We hail this action of Congress as the bright morn of Peace and Union; and
                        breaking as it does amidst the gloom, with every attribute of justice in its
                        refulgence, it cannot fail to rally the whole nation to the fulfilment of
                        its just and highest duty to Freedom and Mankind. It may be delayed or
                        embarrassed for a time by those who hate free institutions and blindly
                        resist the inevitable; but we cannot doubt that the result must, sooner or
                        later, be the cordial restoration of every section to fraternity again, and
                        the great Republic of the world will go on, in discharge of its sacred
                        mission, to prove that the noblest and strongest government of the earth is
                        so because it is most just, and therefore most blessed by the Great Ruler of
                        all!</p>

                    <p>Whereas, No legal State governments or adequate

                        shall be divided into military districts, and made subject to the military
                        authority of the United States, as hereinafter prescribed; and for that

                        his duties and enforce his authority within the district to which he is
                        assigned.</p>

                        judgment, it may be necessary for the trial of offenders, he shall have
                        power to organize military commissions or tribunals for that purpose, and

                        without unnecessary delay, and no cruel or unusual punishment shall be
                        inflicted; and no sentence of any military commission or tribunal hereby

                        election of delegates, and when such Constitution shall be adopted by a
                        majority of the persons voting on the question of ratification who are
                        qualified as electors for delegates, and when such Constitution shall have
                        been submitted to Congress for examination and approval, and Congress shall
