<b>Can A Republican Vote For Judge Sharswood?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors dismiss the Democrats' attempts to woo support from Republican
                    rank-and-file members for Judge Sharswood's candidacy, and express doubt over
                    the Democrats' sudden change of heart toward him. They question the motives
                    behind the Democrats' decision to field Sharswood a candidate now and not ten or
                    fifteen years earlier. What, they ask, has changed?<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We think not. A concerted and persistent effort is made, however, by
                        Democratic prints, to press his name upon Republican voters on the score of
                        abstract fitness for office as a Judge.</p>
                    <p>It is possible to concede to the friends of this eminent citizen of our
                        Commonwealth all that they claim for him, without finding any sufficient
                        reason for forsaking the man whom we have ourselves named, because we deemed
                        him also worthy, or for opposing, in behalf of individual merit, the
                        principles we have vowed to maintain. The selection of a good man for their
                        candidate is a novelty in Democratic tactics. It is, accordingly, a
                        suspicious circumstance, and gives fair cause for doubts as to motives in so
                        presenting him, and good reason for hesitation in supporting him.</p>
                    <p>The veteran wirepuller of the Harrisburg Convention declared that for fifteen
                        years, Judge Sharswood had deserved this nomination. In that interval the
                        people have filled six vacancies on the Supreme Bench. Why, in no one case,
                        was Sharswood presented for election? Less able men, but bitter partisans,
                        were preferred to him. Those years are divisible into two periods--in the
                        first the Democracy ruled the State with absolute sway, but in the second,
                        in common with their friends and allies of the South, they suffered the
                        mortifications of an astounding opposition and overwhelming and righteous
                        defeat. Why, when a nomination was an election, was the present nominee
                        never heard of--why, when disaster followed disaster and the party sorely
                        needed the succor of a pure name was not the integrity, with the ability, of
                        Sharswood called in aid? The answers to these questions are not
                        complimentary to the wisdom, the sincerity, honesty or good sense of the
                        Democratic party. Sharswood was neglected, in their day of power, because he
                        was distasteful to the party. Taking their policy from their Southern
                        friends, this miscalled Democracy valued, highest, the smartness which is
                        akin to roguery, and the facility which borders on deceit, and took as their
                        model of a public man, him who was able, with abundant professions for the
                        public good, to lead the masses in the interests of a clique. Those
                        ante-bellum years were the millennium of demagogues. If the present
                        Democratic estimate of Judge Sharswood is to be taken, he could not, of
                        course, flourish in that era. His peculiar talents were not marketable.
                        Contempt for the people and that audacity which prosperous imposture always
                        breeds, led the Democratic party in its impatience to overcome an impudent
                        opposition to try force in 1860 to gain a cherished end. They began with
                        winning Bull Run. It has proved to be their last victory. For seven years
                        the nation, enlightened at last and indignant, has fought this false
                        Democracy in the field and at home, has completely overthrown it: unmasked
                        all its shame, and we hope, resolved never to trust it again. In these years
                        of unvarying loss, of repeated humiliation, the Democracy exhibited the
                        consistency of effrontery and defiance, but set up in succession, their most
                        radical and virulent leaders, with the hope that the frankness and boldness
                        of despair might win for them back that power which, gained for them at
                        first by a league for evil, they had maintained by hypocrisy and lost by
                        treason. They, happily, failed in every attempt. The people had learned to
                        know a public enemy, even in disguise, and repudiated in Pennsylvania the
                        tricksters whose manlier allies they shot in Virginia. In such times, a man
                        like Sharswood is worse than useless as a leader. If upright, his purity is
                        a rebuke and a foil to his followers foulness--if able, he cannot be blinded
                        to their aims--if firm, he cannot be bent--if patriotic, he cannot be used
                        at all. It is little wonder, that, though for fifteen years he has been
                        known by his friends to be fit, he has yet been left upon the District
                        Bench. How comes it, then, that, at last, this moribund faction essays to
                        honor themselves by placing him at the head of their column? Have they
                        repented of the evil they have done, recanted their errors, made public
                        confession of their wrong doing and openly resolved to seek hereafter only
                        the best methods of promoting the public welfare? Their platform contains
                        nothing of the kind.</p>
                    <p>Their resolutions are either unmeaning platitudes or re-affirmations of old
                        abominations. They have learned nothing, even from the war. They do not seem
                        to know that they have made the very name of Democrat offensive to patriotic
                        ears, but, sitting in solemn councils, they promulgate, to a disdainful
                        people, propositions which must fail in credence as well because of their
                        intrinsic absurdity as of the ill repute of their advocates. Holding, thus,
                        to their former tenets and practice, exhibiting, in curious admixture, the
                        hypocrisy and the frankness which, singly, served and failed them, by turns,
                        they of right ought to be doubly obnoxious to popular rebuke. To avert this
                        renewal of censure, they have humbled themselves before a man whom they
                        first neglected and then feared. His availability is accepted as the
                        antidote to his integrity, and success, through him, is prayed for as the
                        reward of their humility. No regard for the man or jurist has prompted this
                        nomination. Proffered now it is almost an insult. The nominee has, however,
                        seen fit to accept it, and has, by so doing, redeemed the contest, in some
                        measure, from its, of late years, disgraceful features. Since '61, there has
                        been little honor in beating back, periodically, the incursions of these
                        Sioux and Cheyennes of our politics--it has been a necessary but irksome
                        labor to suspend progress to attend to them. With a respectable leader,
                        although the subordinates and the rank and file are unchanged, the captive
                        will be a nobler one, though the fight is no harder. Having become their
                        leader, which gives character to the other, the commander or the army? Can
                        the one reform the many or be rendered powerless by the determination of the
                        multitude? Is the Democracy, temporarily, elevated to the sublimity of
                        common honesty or will Judge Sharswood sink, for the campaign, to a simple
                        of charlatans and humbugs? The latter is the more probable, when we remember
                        the terrible intensity shown by the party since it avowedly called on evil
                        to be its good. As such, as the voluntary head of all that is reactionary in
                        our national progress; as the willing exponent of a party, which, by its one
                        wing, endeavored to overturn the temple of our freedom, preferring to
                        worship strange gods amidst its ruins to serving as less than high priest
                        within its walls; which, by its other wing, fostered, instigated and
                        promised to support all the violence as well as the aims of the first, and
                        is answerable for all the blood shed, misery, and despair, wrought by the
                        accursed war their joint machinations brought on; as the intended means by
                        which these ousted conspirators seek to regain the power they deliberately
                        abused; as a stepping stone, only, meant and valued as such, can a
                        Republican, who believes his creed, who detests Democracy for its teachings
                        and its fruits, be led for a moment to weigh the possibility of voting--not
                        for Sharswood--but through him, for the return to power of all that has ever
                        a clog and a hindrance to our good? To help a Republican to such a vote,
                        however, the snuffy old collocutors of the Harrisburg Convention prate of
                        the distinction between law and politics and affect to deprecate their
                        confusion. When, pray, did they first learn this lesson? When, it suiting
                        his party aims, has a Democratic Judge, deciding a question bordering upon
                        politics, ever failed to follow his party proclivities and decide for the
                        wrong? Was it when Taney uttered an infamous lie and sought to damn living
                        and unborn millions to a Democratic hell on earth; when Woodward decided the
                        draft unconstitutional, the disfranchisement of deserters ex post facto, or when this immaculate Sharswood
                        pronounced legal tenders an impossibility? The first dictum was, directly
                        and avowedly, in the interests of slavery, then an existing institution--the
                        last were meant to impede, to break down, a war, which was fast destroying
                        slavery, and, with it, Democratic hopes and voters. In every such case,
                        hitherto, in practice, a Democratic judiciary had dragged party politics
                        into law. Now, forsooth, the doctrine is a strict severance! Who believes
                        them? Who doubts but that it is a bait to catch fools with--that being, now,
                        "outs," they laud a virtue they never practised, and that if, by the aid of
                        simpletons, they become "ins," they will, at once, lapse into traditionary
                        beliefs and practices?</p>
                    <p>In choosing a judge, he should be estimated by the school he adopts. But the
                        Democratic school is an obsolete one. Its opinions date from the antiquity
                        of ten years ago. The earth, when Noah left Ararat, was not more changed
                        from the earth the antediluvian beheld, than the America of to-day is unlike
                        that of 1860. A deluge of blood has washed it, and new men and new beliefs
                        now occupy and possess it. Woodward and Clymer and Sharswood, as thinkers,
                        are as truly of a forgotten age as if their tombs were moss-grown and
                        sunken. We have no need for them--they linger superfluous on the stage as
                        would be politicians. To the first two, cards of dismissal have been given
                        by the people--they have agreed to go into retirement accordingly, but they
                        pray, like resigned Lord Chancellors, for Sharswood's success, that they
                        may, some day, come back.</p>
                    <p>But, it is useless--beyond the Styx of defeat the three ghosts will soon roam
                        in company, lamenting the days when they moved in the regions of the upper
                        air of unmerited success. In Sharswood's stead who will have place? At this
                        moment, for ourselves, we have a nominee, also a District Judge, who as a
                        man, a scholar, and a jurist need yield precedency to no Democrat. As a
                        patriot his record is a brilliant one--his tongue and pen have done good
                        service for the national cause in her time of peril, his time, money and
                        influence have been lavishly given when every contribution was of value.
                        Unlike his adversary, whose voice was silent during all that varying
                        conflict--judicial reserve the convenient pretext--but whose associations
                        were with and whose endorsement, now comes from, them who attained the worst
                        eminence in tory opposition, there is and has been no concealment of opinion
                        or sympathy. In ability, integrity, legal attainments, and in experience the
                        Republican candidate is as fit as his competitor to occupy the Supreme
                        Bench. In sympathy with the great movement in favor of human rights--the
                        stumbling block of faction, but the glory of the age--comparison cannot be
                        instituted between them. The voter, accordingly, who can forget his
                        principles, and, by aiding a man to place, recall his bitterest antagonists
                        to power, is either insincere or bewitched.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article contains information drawn from the annual statement from
                    Directors of the Chambersburg School District. According to the report, total
                    receipts from taxes and other sources amounted to $10,839 and expenditures for
                    salaries and other costs totaled $10,641 leaving a balance of $198. During the
