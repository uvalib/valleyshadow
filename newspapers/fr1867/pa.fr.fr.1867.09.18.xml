                    <p>By the President of the United States of America:</p>
                    <p>A PROCLAMATION.</p>
                    <p>WHEREAS, In the month of July, Anno Domini 1861, the two Houses of Congress,
                        with extraordinary unanimity, solemnly declared that the war then existing
                        was not waged on the part of the Government in any spirit of oppression, nor
                        for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or
                        interfering with the rights or established institutions of the States, but
                        to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and to preserve
                        the Union with all dignity, equality and rights of the several States
                        unimpaired, and that as soon as these objects should be accomplished the war
                        ought to cease;</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">And Whereas</emph>, The President of the United States,
                        on the 8th day of December, A. D., 1863, and on the 26th day of March, A.
                        D., 1864, did, with the objects of suppressing the then existing rebellion,
                        of inducing all persons to return to their loyalty, and of restoring the
                        authority of the United States, issue proclamations, offering amnesty and
                        pardon to all persons who had directly or indirectly participated in the
                        then existing rebellion, except as in those proclamations was specified and
                        reserved; and whereas, the President of the United States did on the 29th
                        day of May, A. D., 1865, issue a further proclamation with the same objects
                        before mentioned, and to the end that the authority of the government of the
                        United States might be restored, and that peace, order and freedom might be
                        established, and the President did by the said last mentioned proclamation,
                        proclaim and declare that he thereby granted to all persons who had directly
                        or indirectly participated in the then existing rebellion, except as therein
                        excepted amnesty and pardon with the restoration of all the rights of
                        property, except as to slaves, and except in certain cases where a legal
                        proceeding had been instituted, but upon condition that such persons should
                        take and subscribe an oath therein prescribed, which oath should be
                        registered for permanent preservation; and whereas, in and by said last
                        mentioned proclamation of the 29th day of May, A. D., 1865, fourteen
                        extensive classes of persons therein speedily described, were altogether
                        excepted and excluded from the benefits thereof; and whereas, the President
                        of the United States did, on the 2nd of April, A. D., 1866, issue a
                        proclamation, declaring that the insurrection was at an end, and was
                        thenceforth to be so regarded; and, whereas, there now exists no organized
                        armed resistance of misguided citizens or others, to the authority of the
                        United States, in the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, North
                        Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas, and
                        the laws can be sustained and enforced therein, by the proper civil
                        authority, State or Federal, and the people of said States are well and
                        loyally disposed, and have conformed, and if permitted to do so, will
                        conform in their legislation to the condition of affairs, growing out of the
                        amendment to the Constitution of the United States, prohibiting slavery
                        within the limits, and jurisdiction of the United States; and whereas, there
                        no longer exists any reasonable ground to apprehend that the within States,
                        where were, involved in the late rebellion and renewal thereof, or any
                        unlawful resistance by the people of said States, to the Constitution and
                        laws of the United States; and, whereas, as large standing armies, military
                        occupation, martial law, military tribunals and the suspension of the
                        privilege of habeas corpus, and the right of trial by jury, are, in time of
                        peace, dangerous to the public liberty and incompatible with the individual
                        rights of the citizen, contrary to the genius and spirit of our free
                        institutions and expansive of the national resources, and ought not
                        therefore to be sanctioned or allowed, except in cases of actual necessity
                        for repelling invasion or suppressing insurrection or rebellion; and
                        whereas, a retaliatory or vindictive policy, attended by unnecessary
                        disqualifications, pains, penalties, confiscations and disfranchisement,
                        now, as always, could only tend to hinder the reconciliation among the
                        people and the national restoration, while it must seriously embarrass,
                        obstruct and repress the popular energies, national industry and enterprise;
                        and whereas, for these reasons it is now deemed essential to the public
                        welfare to the more perfect restoration of the Constitutional law and order
                        that the said last mentioned proclamation, so as aforesaid issue on the 29th
                        day of May A. D. 1865 should be modified, and that the full and beneficent
                        pardon conceded thereby should be opened and further extended to a large
                        number of persons who by its aforesaid exceptions have been hitherto
                        excluded from Executive clemency.</p>
                    <p>Now, therefore, be it known, that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United
                        States, do hereby proclaim and declare that the full pardon described in the
                        said proclamation of the 29th day of May, A. D., 1865, shall henceforth be
                        opened and extended to all persons who directly or indirectly participated
                        in the late rebellion, with the restoration of all privileges, immunities
                        and rights of property, except as to property with regard to slaves and
                        except in cases of legal proceedings under the laws of the United States,
                        but upon this condition, nevertheless, that every such person who shall seek
                        to avail himself of this proclamation, shall take and subscribe the
                        following oath, and shall cause the same to be registered for permanent
                        preservation in the same manner, and with the same effects with the oath
                        prescribed in the said proclamation of the 29th day of May, 1865, namely: "I
                        do solemnly swear, or affirm in presence of Almighty God, that I will
                        hereafter faithfully support, protect and defend the Constitution of the
                        United States and the Union of the States thereunder, and that I will in
                        like manner abide by and faithfully support all laws and proclamations which
                        have been made during the late rebellion with reference to the emancipation
                        of slaves, so help me God.--The following persons, and no others, are
                        excluded from the benefits of this proclamation, and of the said
                        proclamation of the 29th day of May, A. D., 1865, viz: 1st. The chief or
                        prescribed chief executive officers, including the President, Vice President
                        and all heads of departments of the pretended Confederate or rebel
                        government, and all who were agents thereof, in foreign States and
                        countries, and all who had or pretended to hold in the service of the said
                        pretended confederate government a military rank or title above the grade of
                        brigadier-general, and the naval rank or title above that of captain, and
                        all who were or pretended to be Governors of States, while maintaining,
                        abetting or submitting to and acquiescing in the rebellion. 2d, all persons
                        who in any way treated otherwise than as lawful, prisoners of war, persons
                        who in any capacity were employed or actively engaged in the military or
                        naval service of the United States. 3rd. All persons who at the time they
                        may seek to obtain the benefits of this proclamation, are actually in civil,
                        military or naval confinement, or custody or legally held to bail either
                        before or after conviction, and all persons who were engaged directly or
                        indirectly in the assassination of the late President of the United States,
                        or in any plot or conspiracy in any manner therewith connected.</p>
                    <p>In testimony, whereof, I have signed these presents with my hand, and have
                        caused the seal of the United States to be thereunto affixed.</p>
                    <p>Done at the City of Washington, the 7th day of September, one thousand eight
                        hundred and sixty-seven. By the President,</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Step by Step the Presidential autocrat moves forward. Never, from seed time
                        to harvest, might a naturalist have traced the evolutions of a vegetable's
                        growth with more of satisfaction at the certainty of his observations, than
                        may a citizen of the Republic, follow the unfolding of Johnson's plan of
                        usurpation. Like a plant, it is to-day at its period of efflorescence--the
                        fruit will speedily follow the flower.</p>
                    <p>Contemplating the last act of the usurper, we detect its relation to the acts
                        which preceded it, which were necessary conditions to its performance, and
                        its connection with such other acts as must yet be done, ere the plan is
                        consummated.</p>
                    <p>They are mistaken who deem Johnson other than a persistent, tireless,
                        schemer, whose pursuit of an idea will not terminate sooner than his power
                        to follow it. What he is to-day, he was when he was inaugurated. Rodin, the
                        Jesuit, might falter as soon as he. Having the re-establishing of the
                        Democratic party in view and his own reconciliation with the slaveholders to
                        be effected as a consequence, he has not slumbered or slept since March
                        1865, upon that purpose. Hence the hundred expedients he has resorted to,
                        that he might mould the shaking communities of the South to his ends, or
                        might delay the moulding when he could not control, until in the future he
                        might set aside or surmount the difficulty. In the outset, he refused to
                        assemble Congress--but himself assumed to guide at his will, the movements
                        of communities larger and more convulsed than all the States of the North
                        German confederation, which even Bismarck could not so openly or effectively
                        direct. With eager haste he anticipated Congress and wielded greater powers
                        than a monarch. It was not the audacity of a fool who rushes in where angels
                        fear to tread, but the deliberate resolve to once do what could hardly be
                        undone. In the same train have been all subsequent acts. Has he not largely
                        effected his purpose? Congress, to whom it belonged to direct the settlement
                        of the war and its questions, did not reverse his actions. Perhaps they
                        thought they ought not, in view of the circumstances. So Johnson believed
                        they would think, and acted accordingly. Are not his encroachments, save the
                        last, substantially ratified by this Congress? They have, it's true,
                        overridden the veto and enacted laws repugnant to his pretensions, but have
                        they or their laws, in any case, restored the status quo or checked the
                        issuing of his coming move? With a quiet regularity on the contrary, as
                        Nature evolves her wonders, the logical sequent has followed its premise
                        until we have arrived at the Proclamation of Amnesty by the grace of
                        Johnson. Here then we are,--the First Consul and a Council of Four Hundred!
                        In any other land it would be safe enough to predict a <emph rend="italic"
                            >coup de'etat</emph> and an extension of the consul's term. Perhaps
                        Johnson don't mean this, no doubt he would hesitate at attempting it in a
                        land of common schools, yet acquiescence, too ready and unquestioning in his
                        present attempts might inspire the hope, as their complete success would go
                        far to furnish the means. So bold a stroke would possibly, also, be
                        unnecessary, if the results of what he has already done would be to restore
                        the Democratic party to power, which we deemed Johnson's original motive,
                        but, supineness now would make the advance to this easy, as an ineffectual
                        resistance might produce the other in the struggle. We take it, therefore,
                        that this alternative has been looked at--Democratic mastery under the forms
                        of the Republic or without them--or if necessary and very easy, a revolution
                        with the same end, to wit, Democratic rule under any form.</p>
                    <p>The Amnesty proclamation has no significance for us save as one of a series
                        of moves and as an indication of purpose. So far as its effects on
                        individuals are concerned, and the number to be benefited by it, if allowed
                        to have its full effect, we care little. The classes yet excepted embrace
                        but few. No one knows how many. Special pardons have hitherto been granted
                        to most of the members. They who remain may still be pardoned, if the
                        Johnson assumption be still tolerated.</p>
                    <p>But, if the Amnesty be followed by the claim that Johnson's grace
                        rehabilitates a traitor; that whom he binds and whom he looses is loosed or
                        bound on earth, despite the will of the people; and, if this claim be
                        acquiesced in, any fool can see that our President is an elective monarch
                        and our Congress a body, in truth "on the verge of the government." It may
                        be deemed weakness to admit the possibility of the Congress resting quietly
                        under this assumption of power to pardon wholesale; still more to dream that
                        such subsequent claim will be admitted; yet, we do fear the one and are sure
                        that silence, or half measures towards it, will bring the other. Whilst we
                        fear, taking our inspiration from the recent past, we have hope as well in
                        the people who have ever been radical enough to meet an evil or treat a
                        scoundrel as was deserving, as in the ultimate determining by Congress to
                        meet encroachment by effective measures. There is much of truth in the
                        demagogue's belief that the people are grumbling asses--that they will bear
                        longer as communities than as individuals, but there is this oversight in
                        the scheming of our chief of demagogues, that, the people of this land
                        differ from every other people in the degree of their intelligence. They
                        will not be content with murmurs forever. They see, as clearly as their
                        servants, the limitations they have placed on their delegations of power and
                        they will soon, as we trust, at the coming elections and through their
                        Congress evince their sense of the temerity which seeks for selfish ends to
                        abuse the privileges of office.</p>
                    <p>The distinction between the terms amnesty and pardon is as wide as it is
                        vital. Even the greatest blunderer in the use of language never uses them as
                        synonyms. They differ as words in their etymological import--the former
                        indicating oblivion as to acts and without prime or chief reference to the
                        actor--the latter a giving back of something forfeited or endangered and
                        with a close reference to the donee. The one is a word of familiar, daily
                        use in social life--the other a technical term having a limited and precise
                        signification. The terms differ in the manner of their use, in that amnesty,
                        regards men in the gross, in classes--pardon is extended to the individual.
                        They are totally dissimilar if we consider the time of their
                        application--amnesty being the boon granted to offenders immediately upon
                        the offence and before the formal processes in inquisitorial and retributive
                        or vindicatory justice. Amnesty may precede even arrest--pardon only
                        relieves from the penalty of a sentence, pronounced after trial, or from the
                        remainder of a partially endured pain. With all of these differences mankind
                        are familiar. The history of any people furnishes, in profusion, examples of
                        their use. No man, hitherto, on this broad earth has ever urged to sane men,
                        the possibility of terms identity. The granting of amnesty for political
                        offences has ever been deemed the choicest flower of the prerogative of the
                        supreme power of the State. Pardons are usually granted by the executive
                        authority. It is consummate audacity to hope that at this day, in this land,
                        a jealous people will suffer their executive to wrest from them their chief
                        privilege upon so bald and untenable as well as so dangerous an assumption.
                        Least of all will they, when at the best, the scarcely concealed object is
                        to recall to power a set of demagogues who ruled and sought to ruin them,
                        and who, untaught by reverses, unabashed by rebuke, seek, with more
                        pertinacity than a Chatham street clothes-dealer, to retain their ears and
                        force their confidence. Although it is somewhat late to reverse the engine
                        and return to the point whence our drunken engineer has treacherously guided
                        the train, full-freighted with human interests and human hopes, and turn it
                        upon the true trackway of progress, yet it may be done.</p>
                    <p>This journal was the first to descry the danger, to mark the divergence from
                        the right way, and to proclaim the utter worthlessness and hypocrisy of him
                        whom the assassin's bullet had elevated to power. We review the warning with
                        tenfold earnestness, and demand in the name of the people he despises and is
                        now aiming to betray, that the shortest, sharpest, surest remedies which the
                        Constitution affords be applied. Let the President be impeached and cast
                        down from the office he has disgraced</p>
