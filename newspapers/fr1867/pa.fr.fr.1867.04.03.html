<b>Confiscation</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 19th of March Mr. Stevens delivered his great speech on his bill for
                        the confiscation of rebel property. Owing to the very feeble condition of
                        his health he had to stop when he had spoken but a few minutes, and the
                        speech was, by unanimous consent, read by Hon. E. M'Pherson, the Clerk. We
                        give the speech entire:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Speaker--I am about to discuss the question of the punishment of
                        belligerent traitors by enforcing the confiscation of their property to a
                        certain extent, both as a punishment for their crimes and to pay the loyal
                        men who have been robbed by the rebels, and to increase the pensions of our
                        wounded soldiers. The punishment of traitors has been wholly ignored by a
                        treacherous Executive and by a sluggish Congress. I wish to make an issue
                        before the American people and see whether they will sanction the perfect
                        impunity of a murderous belligerent and consent that the loyal men of this
                        nation who have been despoiled of their property shall remain without
                        remuneration, either by the rebel property or the property of the nation.</p>
                    <p>To this issue I desire to devote the small remnant of my life. I desire to
                        make the issue before the people of my own State, and should be glad if the
                        issue were to extend to other States. I desire the verdict of the people
                        upon this great question.</p>
                    <p>What I ask of this House is to give a square vote upon the direct question by
                        yeas and nays. I pray you do not evade or kill it by a side wind. When you
                        have given such vote I shall be satisfied, whatever may be the result.</p>
                    <p>I may say in advance that my remarks will be voluminous and tedious. Any
                        gentleman who has any business for the next hour and a half may well attend
                        to it; but I pray him to be here to vote, as I desire to understand the
                        feelings of the House and of the people.</p>
                    <p>The bill is important to several classes of people.</p>
                    <p>It is important to our wounded and maimed soldiers, who are unable to work
                        for their living, and whose present pensions are wholly inadequate to their
                        support.</p>
                    <p>It is important to those bereaved wives and parents whose habiliments of woe
                        are to be seen in every house, and proclaim the cruel losses which have been
                        inflicted on them by the murderous hands of traitors.</p>
                    <p>It is important to the loyal men North and South who have been plundered and
                        impoverished by rebel raiders and rebel legislatures.</p>
                    <p>It is important to four millions of injured, oppressed and helpless men,
                        whose ancestors for two centuries have been held in bondage, and compelled
                        to earn the very property a small portion of which we propose to restore to
                        them, and who are now destitute, helpless, and exposed to want and
                        starvation under the deliberate cruelty of their former masters.</p>
                    <p>It is also important to the delinquents whose property it takes as a fine, a
                        punishment for the great crime of making war to destroy the republic, and
                        for prosecuting the war in violation of all the rules of civilized warfare.
                        It is certainly too small a punishment for so deep a crime, and too slight a
                        warning to future ages.</p>
                    <p>No committee or party is responsible for this bill. It is chargeable to the
                        President and myself. Whatever merit it produces is due to Andrew Johnson.
                        In the summer of 1864 he said in a public speech, "Let me say now is the
                        time to secure these fundamental principles, while the land is rent with
                        anarchy and upheaves with the throes of a mighty revolution. While society
                        is in this disordered state, and we are seeking security, let us fix the
                        foundations of the government on the principles of eternal justice, which
                        will endure for all time. Shall he who brought this misery upon the State be
                        permitted to control its destinies? If this be so, then all this precious
                        blood of our brave soldiers and officers, so freely poured out, will have
                        been wantonly spilled. All the glorious victories won by our noble armies
                        will go to naught, and all the battle-fields which have been sown with dead
                        heroes during the rebellion will have been made memorable in vain.</p>
                    <p>"Why all this carnage and devastation? It was that treason might be put down
                        and traitors punished. I say the traitor has ceased to be a citizen, and in
                        joining the rebellion has become a public enemy.</p>
                    <p>"Treason must be made odious, and traitors must be punished and impoverished;
                        their great plantations must be seized and divided into small portions, and
                        sold to honest, industrious men. The day for protecting the lands and
                        negroes of these authors of rebellion is past. It is high time it was. I
                        have been most deeply pained at some things which have come under my
                        observation. We get men in command, who, under the influence of flattery,
                        fawning and caressing, grant protection to the traitor, while the poor Union
                        man stands out in the cold." This is all the eloquent language of Andrew
                        Johnson as "he was." This was the text which I took up and elaborated in a
                        speech to my constituents at Lancaster in September, 1865, and which has
                        been much criticised by humane sympathizers with rebels. Andrew Johnson was
                        the apostle whose preachings I followed. His doctrine pervades and animates
                        this whole bill. Whatever of justice is in it is due to him. I call upon his
                        friends to stand by him in this, his favorite policy. If you now desert him,
                        who can you expect to defend the "much enduring man" at the other end of the
                        avenue? Having thus rendered unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, I
                        will proceed to defend the course recommended by him, who above all others
                        knows what is due to traitors.</p>
                    <p>This bill, it seems to me, can be condemned only by the criminals and their
                        immediate friends, and by that unmanly kind of men whose intellectual and
                        moral vigor has melted into a fluid weakness which they mistake for mercy,
                        and which is untempered with a single grain of justice, and to those
                        religionists who mistake meanness for Christianity, and who forget that the
                        essence of religion is to "do unto others what others have a right to expect
                        from you." It is offensive to certain pretentious doctors of divinity who
                        are mawkishly prating about the "fatted calf, the prodigal son and the
                        forgiving father." They forgot that there is no analogy between the cases.
                        The thoughtless youth having received a part of his father's estate, and
                        probably taking a load of corn to market, fell into bad company and
                        contracted the loathsome vice of drunkenness, and spent the money in rioting
                        and debauchery, and like all drunkards, made his bed with the swine and fed
                        on husks; but like one case only in a thousand, he reformed, joined the
                        total abstinence society, washed himself clean, brushed his clothes, and
                        with repentant steps returned to his father's house. Well might his aged
                        parent rejoice; well might he kill the fatted calf at such a rescue. But how
                        venial was such offence compared with this murderous rebellion!</p>
                    <p>When the great ancestor of this bloody race had slain his brother, and
                        trembling met his Judge and sought for pardon, what was the answer? "The
                        voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. And now art
                        thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy
                        brother's blood from thy hand. When thou tillest the ground it shall not
                        henceforth yield unto thee her strength--a fugitive and a vagabond shalt
                        thou be in the earth." When Cain cried out that his "punishment was more
                        than he could bear," the Judge who administered justice in mercy drove him
                        forth into stern, inexorable exile. He taught no forgiveness for such sins.
                        He prated of no "fatted calves."</p>
                    <p>I proceed to consider the bill. By the act of 17th July, 1862, treason is
                        made punishable by death, or some smaller punishment, at the discretion of
                        the court. Before punishment can be inflicted for treason, or misprison of
                        treason, the party must be duly convicted in a court of the United States.
                        Not so with the balance of the bill. All the rest of the law (after the
                        first four sections) refers to persons engaged in the belligerent army, or
                        officially connected with the government known as the "Confederate States of
                        America," or to those who voluntarily aided that power. While that law
                        supposed that most of the people composing that army and government were
                        traitors, yet they are dealt with in all the provisions which refer to
                        confiscation merely as belligerents making an unjust war. The forfeitures
                        which follow from a conviction for treason are left to the operations of the
                        common law.</p>
                    <p>The fifth section enacts that "to insure the speedy termination of the
                        present rebellion it shall be the duty of the President of the United States
                        to cause the seizure of all the estates and property, money, stocks, credits
                        and effects of the persons hereinafter named in this section, and apply and
                        use the same, and the proceeds thereof, for the support of the army of the
                        United States." Then follow the enumeration of all the officers of the army
                        and navy of the confederate government; all persons engaged in the army or
                        navy, or aiding said Confederate States of America, unless they laid down
                        their arms within a given time.</p>
                    <p>To secure the condemnation of property thus seized, proceedings in rem are to be instituted wherever the property
                        may be found, which proceeding shall follow the proceedings in admiralty or
                        revenue cases, and the same shall be condemned as enemies' property, and
                        become the property of the United States, and the proceeds paid into the
                        Treasury of the United States.--(Seventh section act of 17th July, 1862.)</p>
                    <p>The eighth section provides that the court shall make all necessary orders,
                        and the marshals shall make deeds and conveyances for such property to the
                        purchaser, and then such titles shall be good and valid.</p>
                    <p>This law is unrepealed. It is in full force, and stands on the statute-book
                        as one of the laws which the President swore to execute. Would to God he had
                        obeyed his oath. Let us see that we obey ours.</p>
                    <p>It may be objected that the Government is stretching its powers in making
                        such confiscations. That was a question well considered when the act of 1862
                        was passed. It must be remembered that this is not an open question; we are
                        merely considering the enforcement of an existing law. But I will briefly
                        review some of the arguments in favor of the right. We are treating these
                        belligerents simply as enemies, and their property as enemies' property now
                        in the possession and power of the conqueror. By the law of nations, in its
                        most stringent provision, all the property, liberty and lives of a conquered
                        enemy who has waged an unjust war are at the disposal of the victor. Modern
                        civilization will seldom justify the exercise of the extreme right. The
                        lives, the liberty, and, in most cases, the real property of the vanquished
                        are left untouched.</p>
                    <p>The property, however, of the vanquished is held in some shape liable to pay
                        the expenses and damages sustained by the injured party. If peace is brought
                        about by treaty, it is usually stipulated that the expenses and damages
                        shall be paid by the defeated belligerent. As such remuneration must be
                        levied as taxes on the subjects, it does subject all their property to this
                        burden. Where there is no government capable of making terms of peace, the
                        law-making power of the conqueror must fix the terms. This gives them
                        sufficient right to take just such property as it may deem proper. Where the
                        subdued belligerent is composed of traitors, their personal crimes aggravate
                        their belligerent offense and justify severer treatment, just as a tribe of
                        savages are treated with more rigor than civilized foes.</p>
                    <p>From such a people much more might and ought to be exacted than from a
                        honorable enemy. Whenever example requires it, heavy fines should be imposed
                        and the criminals reduced to poverty, as was properly required by our
                        excellent President. Vattel says: "When, therefore, he has subdued a hostile
                        nation, he undeniably may, in the first place, do himself justice respecting
                        the object which has given rise to the war, and indemnify himself for the
                        expenses and damages which he has sustained by it." Halleck (p. 457) says
                        that by strict right property on land and real estate is subject to seizure,
                        though seldom enforced with an ordinary enemy.</p>
                    <p>All writers agree with Vattel (p. 369): "Thus a conqueror who has taken up
                        arms not only against the sovereign, but against the nation herself, and
                        whose intention it was to subdue a fierce and savage people, and once for
                        all to reduce an obstinate enemy, such a conqueror may, with justice, lay
                        burdens on the conquered nation both as compensation for the expenses of the
                        war and as a punishment." Apply these principles to the case in hand. The
                        cause of the war was slavery. We have liberated the slaves. It is our duty
                        to protect them and provide for them while they are unable to provide for
                        themselves. Have we not a right, in the language of Vattel, "to do ourselves
                        justice respecting the object which has caused the war, by taking lands for
                        homesteads for these 'objects' of the war?"</p>
                    <p>Have we not a right, if we chose to go to that extent, to indemnify ourselves
                        for the expenses and damages caused by the war? We might make the property
                        of the enemy pay the four billions of dollars which we have expended, as
                        well as the damages inflicted on loyal men by confiscation and invasion,
                        which might reach a billion more. This bill is merciful, asking less than
                        one-tenth of our just claims. We could be further justified in inflicting
                        severe penalties upon this whole hostile people as "a fierce and savage
                        people," as an "obstinate enemy," whom it is a duty to tame and punish. Our
                        future safety requires stern justice.</p>
                    <p>What more "savage or fierce people" than they who deliberately starved to
                        death sixty thousand prisoners of war; who shot or reduced to bondage all
                        captive soldiers of the colored race; who sought to burn our cities through
                        secret agents; who sent infected materials into our most populous towns to
                        destroy non-combatants, old men, women and children, by the most loathsome
                        and fatal diseases; and who consummated their barbarism by the assassination
                        of the mildest of rulers, and the best of men? If this is not a "fierce and
                        savage enemy" whom we have a right to reduce to absolute submission and
                        dependence, point me out one to whom the language of Vattel will apply. You
                        would do great injustice to those mild savages who owed us no allegiance, by
                        pointing to those who perpetrated the massacre of Wyoming; or to the
                        Camanches, or the wild Indians of the West, or the fierce tribes of the
                        Oronoco--and yet you seize their lands and expel them from their native
                        country.</p>
                    <p>I suppose none will deny the right to confiscate the property of the several
                        belligerent States, as they all made war as States--or of the Confederate
                        States of America; for no one ever denied the right of the conqueror to the
                        crown property of the vanquished sovereign, even where the seizure of
                        private property would not be justified by the circumstances. That would
                        give us all called for in the first section of the bill. I believe Texas has
                        about 110,000,000 acres. She retained all her public lands at the time of
                        annexation on the condition of paying her own debts, and afterwards called
                        on the United States Government for the payment of those very debts, and
                        procured it. I know not how much the other States may have--possibly enough
                        to make up, with Texas, 150,000,000 acres. But it is said that any of the
                        property of the sovereign is subject to seizure by the conqueror. In
                        ordinary wars between monarchies such is the fact; but that is not the case
                        where the war is made on a whole hostile people--"a fierce and savage
                        people." But, admitting the limitation to prevail, still it does not
                        obstruct us.</p>
                    <p>Here is a belligerent made up of men whose crimes had forfeited all their
                        rights, independently of their belligerent liabilities. But beyond that, the
                        case of republics is very different from absolute governments, where the
                        people are responsible for nothing--are guilty of nothing. The sovereign and
                        his estate may well be distinguished from his subjects and their estates.
                        But in republics the people--the whole people--are the sovereigns. All the
                        responsibility of the acts of the government falls upon the people. Their
                        individual property must answer for the expenses, damages, and indemnities
                        which fall on the government of the nation. The Romans, from whom we derive
                        our national law, held that the private property of every citizen might be
                        seized, because he was a sovereign, a part of the governing power. But it
                        matters not what you may think of the efficiency of the act of 17th July,
                        1862. The laws of war authorize us to take this property by our sovereign
                        power, by a law now to be passed. We have a subdued enemy in our power; we
                        have all their property and lives at our disposal. No peace has been formed.
                        No terms of peace or reconciliation have been yet proclaimed, unless the
                        proclamation of the President can make peace and war. The Constitution
                        denies him any power in either case. Then, unless Andrew Johnson be king,
                        the terms of peace are yet to be proclaimed. Among those terms, as we have
                        shown, we have a right to impose confiscation of all their property--to
                        "impoverish" them, as Andrew Johnson has told us; to "divide their large
                        farms and sell them to industrious men." This is strict law and good common
                        sense. Now, then, without reference to any former act, we have a right to
                        seize the property named in this bill, and ten times more. You behold at
                        your feet a conquered foe--an atrocious enemy. Tell him on what terms he may
                        arise and depart or remain loyal, but do not embrace him too hastily. Be
                        sure first that there is no dagger in his girdle.</p>
                    <p>The President has been throwing thick around him decrees and proclamations
                        and speeches upon subjects wholly beyond his jurisdiction. He assumes that
                        his declaration of a fact creates a fact, however false it may be. His
                        constitutions dictated to hordes of rebels; his declaration that the States
                        are States in the Union; his proclamation that peace is restored, he has
                        cunningly put forth as cumulative evidence of the condition of the
                        Confederate States. Not one of them is better than waste paper. All put
                        together are but accumulated nonsense. Does he expect to deceive or bewilder
                        Congress by such incoherent assumptions? I think that Congress will proceed
                        in that calm, unimpassioned, but unwavering course which distinguishes the
                        statesmen from the demagogue.</p>
                    <p>Having, as I conceive, justified the bill which I seek to have enforced, let
                        us now look to the provisions of the bill under consideration.</p>
                    <p>The first section orders the confiscation of all the property belonging to
                        the State governments and the National governments which made war upon us,
                        and which we have conquered. I presume no one is prepared to object to this,
                        unless it be those who condemned the conquest. To them I have nothing to
                        say, except to hope that they will continue consistent in their love of the
                        rebels; to show an exuberant humanity into which is merged and submerged all
                        the exalted feelings of patriotism.</p>
                    <p>The second section requires the President to execute an existing law which he
                        is sworn to execute, but the performance of which oath is an abeyance.
                        Certainly such law should be enforced or repealed; it is a mockery to allow
                        it to stand on your statute books, and be not only not enforced, but
                        violated every day by the Executive Government.</p>
                    <p>The third section furnishes a more convenient and speedy mode of adjudicating
                        such forfeitures, and more consistent with the military condition of the
                        conquered States.</p>
                    <p>The fourth section provides first, that out of the lands thus confiscated
                        each liberated slave who is a male adult, or the head of a family, shall
                        have assigned to him a homestead of forty acres of land (with $100 to build
                        a dwelling), which shall be held for them by trustees during their pupilage.</p>
                    <p>Let us consider whether this is a just and politic provision.</p>
                    <p>Whatever may be the fate of the rest of the bill, I must earnestly pray that
                        this may not be defeated. On its success, in my judgement, depends not only
                        the happiness, and respectability of the colored race, but their very
                        existence. Homesteads to them are far more valuable than the immediate right
                        of suffrage, though both are their due.</p>
                    <p>Four millions of persons have just been freed from a condition of dependence,
                        wholly unacquainted with business transactions, kept systematically in
                        ignorance of all their rights, and of the common elements of education,
                        without which none of any race are competent to earn an honest living, to
                        guard against the frauds which will always be practiced on the ignorant, or
                        to judge of the most judicious manner of applying their labor. But few of
                        them are mechanics, and none of them skilled manufacturers. They must
                        necessarily, therefore, be the servants and victims of others, unless they
                        are made in some measure independent of their wiser neighbors. The
                        guardianship of the Freedman's Bureau, that benevolent institution, cannot
                        be expected long to protect them. It encounters the hostility of the old
                        slaveholders, whether in official or private station, because it deprives
                        these dethroned tyrants of the luxury of despotism. In its nature, it is not
                        calculated for a permanent institution. Withdraw that protection and leave
                        them a prey to the legislation and treatment of their former masters, and
                        the evidence already furnished shows that they will soon become extinct or
                        be driven to defend themselves by civil war.</p>
                    <p>Withhold from them all their rights, and leave them destitute of the means of
                        earning a livelihood, the victims of the hatred or cupidity of the rebels
                        whom they helped to conquer, and it seems probable that the war of races
                        might ensue which the President feared would arise from the kind treatment
                        and the restoration of their rights. I doubt not that hundreds of thousands
                        would annually be deposited to secret, unknown graves. Such is already the
                        course of their rebel murderers; and it is done with impunity. The clearest
                        evidence of that fact has already been shown by the testimony taken by the
                        "Central Directory." Make them independent of their old masters, so that
                        they may not be compelled to work for them upon unfair terms, which can only
                        be done by giving them a small tract of land to cultivate for themselves,
                        and you remove all this danger. You also elevate the character of the
                        freedmen.</p>
                    <p>Nothing is so likely to make a man a good citizen as to make him a
                        freeholder. Nothing will so multiply the productions of the South as to
                        divide it into small farms. Nothing will make men so industrious and moral
                        as to let them feel that they are above want, and are the owners of the soil
                        which they till. It will also be of service to the white inhabitants. They
                        will have constantly among them industrious laborers, anxious to work for
                        fair wages. How is it possible for them to cultivate their lands if these
                        people were expelled? If Moses should lead or drive them into exile, or
                        carry out the absurd idea of colonizing them, the South would become a
                        barren waste.</p>
                    <p>When the wisest of monarchs, the Czar of Russia, compelled the liberation of
                        twenty-five million of serfs, he did not, for a moment, entertain the
                        foolish idea of depriving his empire of their labor, or of robbing them of
                        their rights. He ordered their former owners to make some compensation for
                        their unrequited toil, by conveying to them the very houses in which they
                        lived; and a portion of the land which they had tilled as serfs. The
                        experiment has been a perfect success. It has brought the prosperity which
                        God gives to wisdom and justice. Have they not a right to it?</p>
                    <p>I do not speak of their fidelity and services in this bloody war. I put it on
                        the mere score of lawful earnings. They and their ancestors have toiled, not
                        for years, but for ages, without one farthing of recompense. They have
                        earned for their masters this very land, and much more. Will not he who
                        denies them compensation now be accursed, for is he an unjust man? Have we
                        not upon this subject the recorded decision of a Judge who never erred? Four
                        millions of Jews were held in bondage in Egypt. Their slavery was mild
                        compared with the slavery inflicted by Christians. For of all recorded
                        slavery--Pagan, Heathen or Mohammedan--Christian slavery has been the most
                        cruel and heartless, and of all Christian slavery American slavery has been
                        the worst. God, through no pretended, but a true Moses, led them out of
                        bondage, as in our case, through a red sea--at the cost, as in our case, of
                        the first-born of every household of the oppressor. Did he advise them to
                        take no remuneration for their years of labor? No! He understood too well
                        what was due to justice. He commanded the men and women to borrow from their
                        confiding neighbors "jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment." They
                        obeyed him amply, and spoiled the Egyptians, and went forth full-handed.
                        There was no blasphemer then to question God's decree of confiscation. The
                        doctrine then was not "satanic." He who questions it now will be a
                        blasphemer, whom God will bring to judgement.</p>
                    <p>If we refuse to this down-trodden and oppressed race the right which Heaven
                        decreed to them, and the remuneration which they have earned through long
                        years of hopeless oppression, how can we hope to escape still further
                        punishment if God is just and omnipotent? It may come in the shape of
                        plagues, or of intestine wars--race against race, and the oppressed against
                        the oppressor. But come it will. Seek not to divert our attention from
                        justice by a puerile cry about fatted calves!</p>
                    <p>The fifth section provides that $500,000,000 shall be raised out of the
                        confiscated property for two purposes: the increase of the pensions of our
                        soldiers and the payment to loyal despoiled citizens. Is there any justice
                        in this? We have seen that by the law of nations they were liable to pay all
                        the expenses and damages of the war. Those expenses cannot be less than five
                        billions of dollars, including our debt and what was paid with taxes--the
                        damages were probably half a billion more. To exact but one-tenth part is
                        mercy unexampled in national magnanimity. In the great mutiny in India, in
                        which so many millions of the original owners of the soil were engaged, and
                        who held proprietary rights under well defined titles, the government
                        declared that their engagements had been cancelled by the rebellion, and
                        that the propriety right in the soil was confiscated to the government,
                        which would dispose of that "right as to it might seem fitting." No one ever
                        complained that this exceeded the power of the victors. Why so tender when a
                        small punishment is to be inflicted on our enemy? Three hundred millions of
                        dollars put at interest at six per cent. would just about double the present
                        pensions. Eight dollars a month to men unable to work is wholly inadequate
                        to their necessities. That rate was fixed when the pay of soldiers was but
                        eight dollars per month--it is now sixteen dollars. The increased price of
                        all necessaries of life renders that necessary. The pensions should be
                        increased in the same proportion. Their present allowances is a mere
                        mockery; it must be doubled out of some fund. Shall it be at the cost of
                        loyal men, or of those who mangled and slew our noble soldiers? You talk of
                        pity? Pity for whom? Your tears flow for pompous traitors; ours for maimed,
                        halting, crippled patriots.</p>
                    <p>I know there is a cry for the perfect impunity of the enemy. It is a
                        dangerous and unwholesome doctrine. Inflict salutary punishment to prevent
                        future civil wars and to punish the criminals; "their brothers' blood cries
                        to us from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive their brothers'
                        blood from their hands." All this blood cannot sink into the ground
                        unavenged; the ghosts of these murdered martyrs will not go down, but will
                        haunt their murderers to the bar of eternal judgement.</p>
                    <p>Is there anything in the practice of nations to condemn this confiscation?
                        Nothing; but everything to justify it. When a city or people in alliance
                        with Rome conspired to levy war against her, on being conquered, she was not
                        unfrequently deprived of half her population, and their lands taken and
                        given to Roman colonists. Where all is justly forfeited, including their
                        lives, to leave them a part is great mercy. I need not cite the examples of
                        Greece and Macedonia. They were severer than Rome. Now I would not exact
                        much personal punishment. I have never believed in bloody penalties. I have
                        long since adopted the milder views of Boccaria and Montesquieu. But when I
                        say that, it does not mean impunity to criminals. Heavy pecuniary punishment
                        should take the place of personal inflictions. Rome at one time decreed that
                        no blood should be shed except in hostile conflict. But for making war on
                        the republic and lesser crimes, she interdicted to the "malefactor fire and
                        water," which was the form of her sentence of banishment. Such banishment
                        involved the forfeiture of all their estates, real as well as personal.
                        While they allowed the malefactor to depart with life, they reduced him to
                        poverty. Such was the fate of Cicero when he went into exile. It was from
                        the study of this Roman law, no doubt, that our learned President took the
                        idea contained in his speech, "traitors must be impoverished." He will, I
                        hope, pardon us for not being hard-hearted enough fully to carry out his
                        wishes.</p>
                    <p>Certain gentlemen seem hard to learn, either from the writings of the learned
                        publicists or from the passing or visible events of the present age. The
                        German empire had many features similar to our own. It was composed of
                        twenty-eight States, each independent in its own municipal government and
                        laws, but each subject to the general government of the empire in whatever
                        came within its jurisdiction. By its constitution all the States were
                        pledged to perpetual union. This pledge had come down to them through ages.
                        It had a congress of members from each of the States, which was sitting
                        permanently, whose acts were to bind each member of the confederacy. War
                        broke out between two of the principal powers. The minor States ranged
                        themselves under the banner of the one or the other. Prussia triumphed. Did
                        the constituent parts say, "We lay down our arms, peace ensues, and we claim
                        our old rights, as they were under the constitution of the German empire? We
                        could not go out of that empire, for our constitution declared that it
                        should be perpetual."</p>
                    <p>No. None of the vanquished powers were so idiotic as to set up such
                        pretences. No one was foolish enough to suggest it to the conqueror. Prussia
                        took up these submissive States and dealt with them according to the
                        universally acknowledged laws of war. She first imposed the expenses of the
                        war upon the conquered belligerents according to what she deemed equitable.
                        Austria bore forty-five millions, Saxony ten millions, Bavaria three
                        millions, and so on. She refused to let the States participate in the
                        government, but incorporated several of them into the kingdom of Prussia.
                        Why do not these injured parties invoke the indignation of the civilized
                        world? Because they knew that the verdict would be against them. They knew
                        that the war destroyed the constitution of the German Empire and annulled
                        the treaties of 1815, that all must be subject to the will of the conqueror.
                        Where is our statesmanship, that we suffer the enemy to escape from the
                        payment of the costs and damages of the war? Where is our patience, that we
                        suffer them to clamor about rights under the Constitution? Where is our
                        courage, that we suffer the President to head this new rebellion?</p>
                    <p>The remaining part of the sum levied, to wit, $200,000,000, is to remunerate
                        loyal men in both sections who, in consequence of their loyalty, have been
                        plundered and had their property destroyed by the invading armies and
                        raiders of the enemy, or by the unjust seizure and confiscation of the
                        property of loyal men in the rebel States. Who objects to this? Whoever
                        does, let him put his name on record that the country may fairly judge on
                        which side his sympathies lie. By the usages of nations, the property of the
                        citizens of the belligerent power taken or destroyed as a military
                        necessity, is paid by the government. But property taken or destroyed by the
                        enemy is not paid by the government. Strictly speaking, the property of
                        citizens of the hostile government, though friendly to the conqueror, cannot
                        be charged to the victor. But in civil war it seems to me that a distinction
                        should be made, and those who have suffered for their adherence to the
                        parent government should be taken care of in adjusting the conditions of
                        peace. We know there are loyal men in the South who are large sufferers.
                        There are a still larger number in the North who are made larger sufferers,
                        neither of whom have any chance of being remunerated, except through this
                        Congressional legislation. Neither of them can ever receive a dollar out of
                        the Treasury of the United States. I know not whether $200,000,000 will pay
                        them. Certainly it would be a great relief. I need not enumerate the sort of
                        damages to which I refer. Southern loyalists who have suffered are
                        everywhere to be seen. The valley of Virginia and the course of Sheridan's
                        operations are full of them. The smoking ruins of Lawrence and Chambersburg,
                        almost every county of Missouri and Maryland, and the frontier portions of
                        Ohio, are samples of the latter.</p>
                    <p>If we had been between two regular governments, both of which survived the
                        war, the victor, in the treaty of peace, would require the vanquished to pay
                        all such damages, as well as all the expenses of the war. If neither had
                        conquered the other they would probably be silent, and each bear his own
                        loss. Congress is dictating the terms of peace. If she does not provide for
                        these meritorious claimants she will be bound in honor to pay them out of
                        the national Treasury. If she does not, individuals will be wronged, and the
                        nation dishonored. This bill is very merciful toward a cruel, outlawed
                        belligerent, who, when their armies were dispersed, would gladly have
                        compromised if their lives were saved.</p>
                    <p>Those who will be affected by this bill will not exceed 70,000, out of a
                        population of six millions of whites, for this is a people of aristocrats
                        and subjects; of a proud nobility and a cringing poor peasantry. Those
                        seventy thousand persons own about three hundred and ninety millions of
                        acres of land out of the five hundred millions in the Confederate States.
                        This, together with the town property, cannot be worth less than ten
                        billions of dollars ($10,000,000,000). This estimate includes no man's
                        property who was worth less than ten thousand dollars; nor does it include
                        any personal property, which may perhaps swell it to twelve billions of
                        dollars. The fine proposed would be but one-twentieth of their estates. Were
                        ever such great malefactors so gently dealt with? It were well if all their
                        large estates could be subdivided and sold in small tracts. No people will
                        ever be republican in spirit and practice where a few own immense manors,
                        and the masses are landless. Small independent landholders are the support
                        and guardians of republican liberty. But it is said that very many of these
                        men have been pardoned by the President, and their forfeited estates
                        restored to them.</p>
                    <p>I must take the liberty to deny that the pardon, or any other power vested in
                        the President, can withdraw these forfeited estates from the confiscation
                        decreed by Congress. Nothing less than an act of Congress can divest them
                        from the United States and bestow them on the pardoned belligerents. No one
                        denies that the President possesses the pardoning power. This power is
                        conferred on the Chief Executive for wise purposes, to correct the errors
                        and mistakes of courts, and imperfections of human laws. Bacon says, "The
                        power of pardoning offences is inseparably incident to the Crown, and this
                        high prerogative the King is entrusted with upon a special confidence that
                        he will spare those only whose case, could it be foreseen, the law itself
                        may be presumed wrong to have excepted out of the general rules which the
                        wisdom of man cannot possibly make so perfect as to suit every particular
                        case." (6 Bac. Abr., 138.)</p>
                    <p>How well the President has adhered to the object of this high prerogative
                        others must judge. The special pardons granted cannot indeed be over four
                        thousand of the subjects of confiscation. The pardons are granted for the
                        crime of treason. I shall not question that such pardons may be pleaded in
                        bar of any prosecution for treason, and save the traitor's property from the
                        forfeiture which results from the conviction of that crime.</p>
                    <p>But the act of July 17, 1862, under which these forfeitures arise, has no
                        reference to treason, (except the four first sections, under which we do not
                        ask the action of the Executive.) It declares the property of certain
                        belligerents, enemies of the United States, subject to seizure, and orders
                        it to be appropriated, as enemies' property, to the services of the United
                        States Government. In perfecting the forfeiture it does not intend to
                        prosecute the owners for their crime, but treats their property as that of
                        any enemy who was captured as lawful prize. How can the President by a
                        pardon restore the property thus vested in the United States? Suppose the
                        delinquent were an alien enemy and as such his property or land was ordered
                        to be seized by act of Congress? Could the President dispense with that law
                        by his sovereign power and arrest the forfeiture in its transit to the
                        treasury? The belligerent has been guilty of no crime as belligerent of
                        which the Executive could absolve him. Neither the war-making power nor the
                        power to make peace is in the President. The power to declare war is vested
                        in Congress alone. The power to make peace rests with the President and the
                        Senate. The power to dispose of the property of a conquered people is vested
                        in the sovereign law-making power of the nation, which in this republic is
                        Congress. A King of England once claimed and exercised the right to dispense
                        with an act of Parliament. But the Parliament vindicated its rights, and by
                        an act (1 Ws., 111) declared all such pardons and charters void, and that no
                        "dispensation by non-abstante of or to any
                        statute or any part thereof be allowed. Have we the courage and the virtue
                        of our British ancestors?</p>
                    <p>But at the most the pardons extend to but 14,000 out of 70,000 wealthy
                        belligerents. While there is not the least pretence in law that the
                        President, by pardon or otherwise, can wrest this property from the
                        Government, yet it is melancholy that the Executive should confederate with
                        traitors, and by his own act and his own individual responsibility attempt
                        to take billions out of the Treasury of the United States to enrich bloody
                        traitors; to impose burdens on the loyal men who risked life and property to
                        save the nation, that fawning rebels might live in affluence and glorify
                        him. But even if all those now pardoned were beyond our reach, there are
                        still several thousands who are not shielded by these potential charters.
                        That will suffice for the small sum which this bill requires.</p>
                    <p>While all must mourn over the melancholy spectacle of the attempted robbery
                        of loyal men and the suffering relations of the martyrs of liberty, by one
                        who should be their guardian, let us deal fairly, and place the
                        responsibility where it justly belongs. Andrew Johnson, before he was
                        President, held, as we have seen, the following language. In a speech
                        already referred to, made in the summer of 1864, he said:</p>
                    <p>"Why all this carnage and devastation? It was that treason might be put down
                        and traitors punished; therefore, I say that traitors should take a back
                        seat in the work of reconstruction. [No "restoration" then.] I say the
                        traitor has ceased to be a citizen, and in joining the rebellion has become
                        a public enemy. He forfeited his right to vote with loyal men when he
                        renounced his citizenship and sought to destroy our Government. [Then there
                        was no being in the Union, and entitled to "equal rights."] Treason must be
                        made odious, and the traitors must be punished and impoverished. Their great
                        plantations must be seized and divided into small farms, and sold to honest
                        and industrious men. The day for protecting the lands and negroes of these
                        authors of rebellion is past. It is high time it was. I have been most
                        deeply pained at some things which have come under my observation. We get
                        men in command who, under the influence of flattery, fawning and caressing,
                        grant protection to the traitor, while the poor Union man stands out in the
                        cold, often unable to get a receipt or a voucher for his losses."</p>
                    <p>How well he describes men when they get in command, "who, under the influence
                        of flattery, fawning and caressing grant protection to traitors, while loyal
                        Union men stand out in the cold." For some after he "got in command," he
                        held the same honest language. But, unfortunately, he had inherited the
                        Prime Minister, the chief bane of his predecessor, who, oily and adroit,
                        gradually gained his confidence and misled his judgment. He boasts that the
                        plan of the Administration is his plan, invented by him and carried on by
                        him. This is doubtless true. It cannot be the President's plan, for it
                        contradicts all his well considered declarations. But in process of time he
                        was beguiled. While he was "clothed and in his right mind" he uttered the
                        thoughts and sentiments of a statesman; but Seward entered into him, and
                        ever since they have both been running down steep places into the sea. Nor
                        do I expect he will be cast out without "sore rending."</p>
                    <p>Without impeaching the motives of the President, it is the duty of Congress,
                        in vindication of its proper rights and prerogatives, to declare that he has
                        arrogated to himself powers and attempted to do and enforce acts for which
                        he can find no warrant in the Constitution and laws of the nation. Invested
                        as he is with command of the army and navy, with all the executive powers of
                        the different departments, if he should be permitted to usurp still further
                        powers, and take control of the States, and the organization of Congress, is
                        there not danger that some future Executive, some ambitious Caesar, will
                        cross the Rubicon, and march his legions upon the capital? While protecting
                        the President in the exercise of all his legitimate duties, and in times of
                        national peril making large allowance for patriotic acts of doubtful
                        legality, great care should be taken that he does not draw to himself all
                        the powers of the government, and thus enable him to become a despot. This
                        is one of the sacred duties of Congress which, if they fail to discharge,
                        they deserve the severest censure, for they betray a nation--nay, more, they
                        betray the cause of universal liberty. To maintain this position is
                        difficult, and requires great fortitude and moral courage. How apt is poor
                        human nature to yield to smiles or the frowns of power! How difficult to
                        determine to cast from you all chance of influence and patronage! How
                        difficult to resist the temptations of office and emolument! And yet all
                        this must be done, or this great people, instead of being free, will become
                        the heritage of tyrants.</p>
                    <p>Ten States of this Union have cast off their allegiance, and by the common
                        acknowledgement of all, have forfeited all their rights under the
                        Constitution. To become again legitimate States in the Union, so as to
                        entitle them to equal rights with the other States, the Constitution
                        requires the sanction of Congress. It matters not whether such power is
                        attributed to the provision to admit new States, or to the clause
                        guaranteeing republican forms of government; in either case Congress is the
                        only power authorized to act; so has the Supreme Court of the United States
                        decided in Luther versus Borden, and elsewhere. The law-making power
                        providing for the case, the President's whole functions are to execute the
                        laws. If the "Confederate States of America" are a conquered power, the
                        President as Commander-in-chief, may hold them in military rule until the
                        sovereign power of the nation declares by what laws they shall be governed.
                        Sovereignty rests with the people, and is exercised through their
                        representatives in Congress.</p>
                    <p>But the President has assumed not only the military control of these
                        conquered States, but he has attempted to give the force of laws to his
                        proclamations and decrees, whereby he has determined what acts shall entitle
                        them to all the rights of States in the Union. He has imposed upon them
                        forms of government without their consent, and without the consent of
                        Congress. He has allowed a small minority of their votes to register his
                        constitutions, and without submitting them to the ratification of the
                        people, he has declared them legitimate organic laws, and the States
                        "reconstructed." He has imperiously required of Congress to treat them as
                        equal in all their rights to the loyal States, without inquiring whether
                        they are entitled to representation, and dogmatically informed them that
                        their only power is "each house for itself to inquire into the qualification
                        and election of members who present themselves and claim their seats." If
                        his order is not obeyed he obstructs legislation, and "forbids" Congress to
                        pass laws in the absence of such members. What more could a king do but
                        place the crown upon his head? The King of England, for one hundred and
                        fifty years, has not ventured to oppose his single will to the will of the
                        nation, and veto a bill which had passed the Parliament of the realm.
                        England has had her servile and timid Commons, ready to register the edicts
                        of the Crown; but for the last hundred years such a body would have been
                        hurled from power and doomed to infamy by the English people and by history.
                        We are now undergoing the test of courage and the integrity of a republican
                        Congress. How many may be craven none can tell, for who can judge of his own
                        strength? History will record their names. Men now obscure may thus obtain
                        the advantage of becoming famous.</p>
                    <p>But it is said that Mr. Johnson is but carrying out the policy of Mr.
                        Lincoln. That, if true, would not justify his errors. But it is not true. In
                        the midst of the war Mr. Lincoln had but little time or little occasion to
                        examine into the question of reconstruction. Until the enemy was conquered,
                        everything was made subservient to that great object. Attempts to distract
                        the "confederate" government were made by recognizing parts of her territory
                        as loyal. Such was the case with small portions of Louisiana. The President
                        encouraged them to assume the form of a State; but Congress never sanctioned
                        it. The President by his message and proclamation of December, 1863,
                        suggested a mode of reconstruction. But in it he distinctly disclaimed all
                        right to control Congress in the matter, and declared that his suggestion of
                        a plan did not exclude other plans. He said, "For the same reason it may be
                        proper to say that whether members sent to Congress from any State shall be
                        admitted to seats constitutionally, rests exclusively with the respective
                        houses, and not to any extent with the Executive."</p>
                    <p>He defines more carefully what he meant in this proclamation in a well
                        prepared speech delivered three days before his death, (14th of April,
                        1865.) He said:</p>
                    <p>[From the National Intelligencer of April 12, 1865.]</p>
                    <p>"In this I have done just so much and no more than the public knows. In the
                        annual message of December, 1863, and accompanying proclamation, I presented
                        a plan of reconstruction (as the phrase goes) which I promised, if adopted
                        by any State, should be acceptable to and sustained by the Executive
                        Government of that nation. I distinctly stated that this was not the only
                        plan which might possibly be acceptable; and I also distinctly protested
                        that the Executive claimed no right to say when or whether members should be
                        admitted to seats in Congress from such States."</p>
                    <p>How different from our present Secretary of State!</p>
                    <p>That good man, who never willingly infringed upon the rights of any other
                        department of the Government expressly accorded to Congress alone the power
                        to declare "when or whether members should be admitted to their seats in
                        Congress from such States." It is not to be denied that his anxiety for the
                        admission of members from Louisiana-or rather from New Orleans, and
                        adjoining parishes--gave uneasiness to the country. The people had begun to
                        fear that he was misled, and was about to fall into error. If he would have
                        fallen into that course, it was well for his reputation that he did not live
                        to execute it. From being the most popular, he would have left office the
                        most unpopular man that ever occupied the Executive chair. But that
                        over-ruling Providence that so well guided him did not permit such a
                        calamity to befall him. He allowed him to acquire a most enviable
                        reputation, and then, before there was a single spot upon it, "he sailed
                        into the fiery sunset,"</p>
                    <p>"And left sweet music in Cathay."</p>
                    <p>Here, if there were anything in common but their station, what a temptation
                        to draw a parallel. But it would be unprofitable, especially in this debate.
                        For what we say at the graves of admired friends, or statesmen, or heroes,
                        is not biography. The stern pen of history will strip such eulogies of their
                        meretricious ornaments. But there is no danger that the highest praise that
                        the most devoted friends could bestow on him would ever be reversed by
                        posterity. So solid was the material of which his whole character was
                        formed, that the more it is rubbed the brighter it will shine. Mr. Lincoln,
                        also, was of humble origin, (and who is not that is formed of the coarse
                        clay of humanity?) and earned his living by manual labor. But he had too
                        good taste ever to boast of the accident of his birth, or to weary the
                        public ear with the tautological recital of his menial employments. He rose
                        to the chief magistracy of the great republic by his sterling patriotism,
                        sober habits and modest worth. He was not thrown into power by any moral or
                        political convulsion. His elevation was no accident, but the result of the
                        cool judgment of a nation of freemen. No man ever assumed such vast
                        responsibilities under such difficult circumstances, except, perhaps,
                        William the Silent. How similar in their lives--how alike in their deaths?</p>
                    <p>If there was danger, and I admit there was some apprehension that Mr. Lincoln
                        would be beguiled by his chief adviser into a course which would have
                        tarnished his well-earned fame, that good guardian who had guided him so
                        well kindly preserved him from that calamity. Death is terrible. Death in
                        high places is still more lamentable; but every day is showing that there
                        are things more terrible than death. It was better that his posthumous fame
                        should be unspotted than that he should endure a few more years of trouble
                        on earth. All must regret the manner of his death; yet, looking to futurity
                        and to his own personal position, it may be considered happy. From the
                        height of his glory he beheld the promised land, and was withdrawn from our
                        sight. In the midst of the most exquisite enjoyment of his favorite
                        relaxation he was instantaneously taken away, without suffering one pang of
                        death. Like the prophet of the Lord who knew not death, he was wrapt from
                        earth to heaven along a track no less luminous than his who ascended in a
                        chariot of fire with horses of fire. Would to God that some small portion of
                        the mantle of our Elijah had fallen on his Elisha.</p>
                    <p>Treason planned to change the ruler, but not to destroy the government, has
                        always been treated as less culpable than an attempt to destroy the
                        government. An old writer says: "Amongst our ancestors treachery against the
                        country was death and forfeiture of all estate, both real and personal.
                        Against the king it was only loss of life and personal estate."</p>

                    <p>THE FIRST CASE.--Mr. Thompson, the conductor of the passenger railways in
                        Philadelphia, has been arrested upon the charge of violating the recent law
                        relative to colored people riding in the cars. The complainant is Caroline
                        R. Lacount, a teacher in a colored school. She alleges that on Monday about
                        noon she hailed the car. The driver paid no attention to her. She then
                        caught the eye of the conductor, but he looked at her, and refused to stop
                        the car. He says that when the complainant hailed him his car was nearly
                        half a square in advance of her, that he was behind time, and that he did
                        not refuse to stop, but beckoned to her to take the next car. The law under
                        which this action is brought makes the Railroad Company liable to an action
                        for debt in the sum of $500, and the conductor to a penalty not exceeding
                        $500 nor less than $100, and imprisonment not exceeding three months nor
                        less than thirty days, for each violation of the act.</p>
