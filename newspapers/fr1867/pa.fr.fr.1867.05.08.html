<b>Another Swing</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Questioning the purpose and timing of the President's decision to travel to
                    Raleigh, NC, to re-inter his parents in a grand ceremony, the editors suggest
                    that Johnson's motives are influenced less by filial devotion than by politics.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The good people of Raleigh, North Carolina, with patriotic hands, have
                        gathered up the scattered dust of Mr. Johnson's immediate paternal ancestor,
                        and with grateful hearts propose to deposit it beneath a pile of sculptured
                        marble, at which interesting ceremony it is announced the son will make it
                        suit to be present. The identity of the remains has not been conclusively
                        established, but it is altogether probable that the dust thus gathered is
                        all that remains of one who, we doubt not, was a very worthy man in his day
                        and generation, but whose only claim to distinction now is the fact that he
                        was instrumental in bringing into being Andrew Johnson, President of the
                        United States. It will seem strange to some, considering the long public
                        service of the son, the many prominent positions he has filled, that it
                        never before occurred to the good people of Raleigh, that the humble man was
                        entitled to some distinction by reason of his paternity; others will think
                        it queer that the President should have waited twenty or thirty years after
                        his parent's demise, to visit his last resting place, while others, still
                        more curious, will wonder how many poor famishing creatures in and about the
                        city of Raleigh the amount invested in this monument, and what is yet to be
                        expended in the President's visit there, would have saved or relieved if
                        appropriated for that purpose. We have no doubt that all these things will
                        be satisfactorily explained. To get to Raleigh and return, the President
                        will be obliged to swing an immense circle, and frequent opportunities will
                        be afforded him by admiring crowds to elucidate all these points, and many
                        others equally as obscure. He is to be accompanied by a retinue of friends
                        and favorites, and it is proposed to make the swing in all respects as
                        brilliant as that accomplished last summer by his Excellency. It is to be
                        hoped that another route will be chosen than the one he followed six years
                        ago in coming to Washington, or if not, that a suitable military escort will
                        be provided. The country has not forgotten the dangerous courtesies that
                        were then extended to him by the enthusiastic Virginians, and it is not
                        strange that some uneasiness should be felt for his safety now. We would
                        suggest that the gallant Custer, him of the golden locks, be recalled from
                        the Indian war and placed in supreme command of the Presidential escort. His
                        fitness for such a position was clearly established in the swing of 1866. If
                        the necessities of the border, however, will not admit of his being
                        recalled, let the distinction be conferred upon the devoted Fullerton or the
                        admiring Steadman. Both are experienced in the conduct of such campaigns and
                        either would give assurance of safety and success. There are other reasons
                        why one of these heroes should be preferred to all others--a good portion of
                        the country through which the President will pass is largely peopled by
                        negroes, who as a class, are proverbially grateful and oftentimes
                        exceedingly enthusiastic in manifesting their gratitude. Gens. Fullerton and
                        Steadman are both fully acquainted with the habits and nature of this
                        people, having carefully examined and studied them under the operations of
                        the Freedman's Bureau. It is possible that the freedmen at a sight of the
                        Moses who led them from bondage into their present free estate will be
                        excited into ecstasies that will be unpleasant if not dangerous to the
                        individual himself. From their intimate knowledge of these people and their
                        influence over them, we could draw a reasonable hope that either of these
                        twin heroes would be able to control their enthusiasm so as to render it
                        harmless to Mr. Johnson. We are induced to make this suggestion by no other
                        consideration than a due regard for the President's comfort and safety, and
                        a desire to allay the apprehensions of the public. We have no special desire
                        to see either of these officers promoted over others except as their merit
                        entitles them to the honor and the public interest requires it. We deem this
                        explanation proper lest we might be charged with favoritism towards those we
                        have named. The Presidential party will start about the middle of the
                        present month, and as it is part of the arrangement to join with the loyal
                        citizens of Charleston in celebrating the Fourth of July and returning by
                        water to stop at Fortress Monroe to consult with the "first statesman of
                        modern times" on question of public policy, their return need not be looked
                        for before the "melancholy days."</p>
