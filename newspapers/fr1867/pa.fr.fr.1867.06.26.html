<b>Into Port!</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors praise Chief Justice Chase's ruling at the session of the
                    Circuit Court in Raleigh that debts owed citizens of the loyal states by
                    southerners were not voided as a consequence of the late war.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>It is reported that Congress will meet for an extra session beginning on
                    July 3rd. The extra session is necessary to insure that President Johnson does
                    not "nullify" the reconstruction laws recently passed by that body. Johnson's
                    attempts to interfere with the process already underway, the piece contends, has
                    rendered him "more odious to the loyal people of the country than ever before."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>MR. JOHNSON, by all his ill advised interference with the peaceable work of
                        reconstruction, as it was proceeding in the Southern States, has made an
                        extra session of Congress unavoidable. It has been semi-officially announced
                        that hereafter the administration will not suffer the removal of State
                        officials by the department commanders in the Rebel States, and that the
                        various functions of the several departments of these States must not be
                        interfered with. This determination of the President practically nullifies
                        the Act of Congress, and renders necessary some supplementary action. For
                        this purpose an extra session has been called for the 3d of July. We are
                        compelled to regard this action on the part of the President as the most
                        unfortunate step he has yet taken, both for the country at large and for
                        himself. He has opened a Pandora's box from which may come the most serious
                        evils, to trouble and vex the entire land. Congress can do nothing less than
                        make good what is previously declared to be the law, while it may do a great
                        deal more. Its action will be determined in its character by the President's
                        resistance. It must be unyielding and uncompromising. It cannot recede and
                        is most likely to advance. Mr. Johnson is powerless to defeat its purpose,
                        but he may have to learn this at a fearful cost to himself, and after much
                        painful anxiety to the public. By his interference he excites all the
                        opposition that his earlier course had aroused, but which had been
                        measurably allayed by the success of the reconstruction scheme, and renders
                        himself more odious to the loyal people of the country than ever before.
                        This necessarily follows for the reason that his course if pursued at length
                        would disappoint the hopes of the North for a speedy restoration of the
                        Union, and re-open a struggle which the country deplores, and all this too
                        when there is no necessity for his interference and but the feeblest pretext
                        to justify it. Like certain familiar historical characters, Mr. Johnson may
                        be remarkable for his very retentive memory, but then like them he is
                        unfortunate in not learning anything. In this he may yet require a severe
                        discipline.</p>

<b>A State Convention</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors happily note that the Miners Journal, "one of the most reliable
                    and radical newspapers in Pennsylvania," has come out in favor of the proposed
                    constitutional convention. The journal calls for the implementation of a set of
                    reforms similar to those outlined by the Repository.<br>

<b>Texas</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports from Texas indicate that the President's efforts to thwart the will
                    of Congress have already had an impact: judges in the Lonestar state have
                    refused to hear the testimony of blacks, declaring the law allowing it
                    unconstitutional and refusing to recognize "any authority except that of the
                    State of Texas." Thus far, President Johnson, his Cabinet, and the Attorney
                    General have refused all appeals to remove the judges.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Important Opinion By Chief Justice Chase</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article discusses the land-mark opinion handed down by Chief Justice
                    Chase in which he ruled that "debts due to citizens of loyal States are not
                    discharged by payment to rebel receivers."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Constitutional Convention</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In light of the corrupt practices that marked the last legislature, the
                    Commercial endorses the call to convene a Constitutional Convention to reform
                    the state's legislative process.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Pittsburg Commercial</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The holding of a Convention to revise the Constitution of Pennsylvania is
                        attracting increased attention from the press and from prominent citizens. A
                        deep feeling pervades the Commonwealth on account of the scandalous
                        management at Harrisburg, and a determination has been formed that a remedy
                        shall be devised and applied. The shamelessness with which money was
                        demanded at the last session, not by a few, but by most of the members, as
                        the condition upon which they would hinder or help legislation, has become
                        widely known, and has created an indignation that will not be easily
                        pacified.</p>
                    <p>In the earlier stages of legislative corruption it was the habit of even
                        debauched and mercenary members to act upon a class of bills, known under
                        the designation of "public," with at least a show of decency and conscience,
                        and to exact gratifications only on bills popularly known as "private." That
                        distinction, which preserved a lingering tradition that "public" business
                        was to be transacted upon considerations of utility and principle, has been
                        swept away. Instances have become frequent of members bluntly demanding on
                        matters purely public, "How much money is there to be had?"</p>
                    <p>Towards the close of the last session some gentleman had determined to
                        institute criminal proceedings, against various members for taking bribes.
                        These gentlemen were appalled when met by a threat to retaliate upon the
                        members from their own county; and a show of hands was made, disclosing
                        incontestable evidence that it could be done and that effectually. Rather
                        than bring their own neighbors and acquaintances into disrepute and trouble,
                        the proceedings were unwisely abandoned.</p>
                    <p>On a previous occasion we referred to an attempt made by the members in
                        framing the General Appropriation Bill, to vote themselves larger salaries
                        than they were entitled to. We explained how the bottom of the Treasury was
                        reached, and how, after trying to turn the Sinking Fund into the General
                        Fund, that it also might be exhausted, the salaries were made considerably
                        less than was intended, because the money could not be found to make them
                        larger. But another scheme was resorted to, last winter, on a larger scale
                        than ever before, for increasing the emoluments. The greater portion of the
                        Senators and Representatives took on sons with them, who were appointed to
                        places of one sort or another about the Legislature. So many of the members
                        were concerned in this dodge that they were enabled to make the pay of these
                        youngsters all they dared. This practice is greatly to be reprobated. It has
                        come to amount to taking indirectly from the Treasury sums that the members
                        dare not take directly.</p>
                    <p>In the present temper of the people--and it is not likely to cool--a
                        Constitutional Convention would provide stringent remedies for existing
                        abuses. The prevailing nepotism would be knocked unceremoniously on the
                        head. Private legislation, as it is termed, would be absolutely prohibited.
                        The requirement would be made absolute that all legislation should be by
                        general laws, applicable everywhere and to all alike, the Courts in the
                        respective counties being charged with the duty of seeing that all
                        associations of citizens desiring corporate franchises, and all existing
                        companies desiring amendments conformed to the rule established. The session
                        would be limited to not exceeding sixty days, the pay of members rigidly
                        fixed, and the number of members very much increased. Provision would
                        doubtless be made for compelling parties giving bribes to become witnesses
                        against members taking bribes.</p>
                    <p>In the Republican ranks the feeling is decided that the Williamsport State
                        Convention ought to take strong ground in favor of a Constitutional
                            Convention.--Pittsburg Commercial.</p>
