<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our attention has been informally called of late, to the oft talked of
                        projects for another railroad in this county. Charters have been from time
                        to time procured in Harrisburg, for roads to lead to and from different
                        points, but the energy of the applicants has always, apparently, been spent
                        in the application. Having talked the matter over freely with well informed
                        parties, we have the following suggestions to offer. In making them, we
                        distinctly disclaim having anybody's interests in special view, but we look
                        to the welfare of the county of Franklin. Let a road be begun, as soon as
                        maybe, to lead, ultimately, to Gettysburg. Starting at Chambersburg, it need
                        not now go farther than Caledonia Furnace, at the base of the South
                        Mountain. These ten miles were surveyed, together with the Mountain
                        crossing, in the summer of 1866, and were found to offer an easy, gradual
                        ascent of half the maximum rate in plain grading. They can be made at a very
                        cheap rate and will speedily become one of the most profitable branch roads
                        in the State. Upon the line of the road stand a large furnace, six flouring
                        mills, and ten saw mills. The lime trade, the creation and growth of the
                        last ten years, now employs a large number of teams in transporting our kiln
                        products to Adams county. This trade will, gladly, come to the road's
                        terminus at the mountain foot, rather than to the scattered kilns in the
                        valley. In amount, the freights upon lime alone will prove no mean addition
                        to a company's revenues. The moment that a road is talked of, in earnest, by
                        anybody to run from Chambersburg eastward, the Mont Alto Iron Company, we
                        are informed, stand ready to assist in its building, and to tap it at or
                        near Fayetteville with another branch road to their own works. The whole of
                        the immense freight, disposable by this company, will be placed on the road.
                        It is said, moreover, that the completion of railroad facilities will lead
                        at once to the erection of a first-class Anthracite Furnace, the business of
                        which will exceed the whole of the present freighting of the Cumberland
                        Valley Railroad, and prove itself a sufficient support for the new road. The
                        energetic proprietors of those works, whose restless eyes have explored as
                        well the ravines of the South Mountain as the slopes at its foot, will
                        rapidly, even if no one else has enterprise enough to attempt it, develop
                        the wonderful richness of our mineral deposits. For, we assert that within
                        the limits of our broad Commonwealth, the State of iron par excellence,
                        there are no such beds of iron ore as those of south-eastern Franklin,
                        whether quantity or quality be considered. With a railroad, their
                        development is certain and immediate. It is premature, perhaps, to attempt a
                        depicting of the prosperity which a work so feasible would bring, yet we
                        cannot forbear saying that the farmers of Venango county did not, more
                        nonchalantly, tread over their grease-spots and around their oil springs,
                        ten years ago, than do the citizens of portions of this county over their
                        mineral wealth.</p>
                    <p>We think the town of Chambersburg has a deep interest in the building of this
                        road. A single line of railway never builds a town. At the least, a
                        crossroads is required to push it forward.</p>
                    <p>Fayetteville, Funkstown, Quincy and Waynesboro are directly concerned in the
                        project. The plan proposed is the only chance they ever will have while
                        steam propels and locomotives run. The districts of country in which these
                        villages lie, the most fertile, populous, and productive in the county, will
                        be benefited, the day the roads are completed, in a degree not to be
                        measured by the cost of the road. We call on the business men of
                        Chambersburg and of the eastern half of the county to consider this matter
                        and to act upon it as speedily as they can.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Several months ago the Hon. Mr. Randall, we believe, introduced a proposition
                        in Congress for the repeal of the existing National Bank Act and the
                        substitution of legal tenders for the national currency. We do not remember
                        that he then made any serious complaint against the soundness of the system.
                        If there was any special point of dissatisfaction it was that the bank
                        circulation, being based on Government bonds, all the benefits were enjoyed
                        by the banks without any participation in them by the Government. His
                        ostensible object was to save the country the eighteen or twenty millions of
                        gold which was paid to the banks in annual interest on their bonds deposited
                        with the United States Treasurer. Fortunately the proposition met with
                        little favor at the time, and was but little discussed. It has become more
                        popular of late. Moreover, the discovery has suddenly been made that the
                        whole system is rotten and specially open to abuses of all sorts, and that
                        the public interests demand a radical change. As is always the case when new
                        measures of reform are suggested, there are a great many persons, wholly
                        ignorant of the first principles of finance, who join in the sweeping
                        condemnation; and each successive failure among the weaker banking
                        institutions elicits a renewed cry of alarm. Reports are circulated
                        unfavorable to their credit and general management, most of which have no
                        foundation in truth, but which nevertheless tend greatly to create popular
                        mistrust.</p>
                    <p>No doubt some of the banks are shaky and will break, as others have already
                        done; but when have there been so few failures as under the present system?
                        When have there been fewer frauds and defalcations, or fewer revelations of
                        corruption among bank officers? There will always be temptation, under
                        whatever system, to use the credit of the banks for individual profit, and
                        no safeguards can be made wholly secure against dishonesty. The truth is,
                        that no system has been devised during our existence as a nation so nearly
                        perfect or so well adapted to the public necessities and the public
                        protection. All the objections now raised against it were brought before the
                        notice of Congress when it was under consideration. They were fully
                        discussed then, and the fact that the National system was adopted in face of
                        all objections is the strongest argument against any change now.</p>
                    <p>Great stress is laid upon the assumption that the banks are specially favored
                        by drawing interest upon their deposited bonds, while they receive
                        additional interest from loaning out their circulation; whereas they enjoyed
                        the same privilege under the safety fund banking law of New York, only that
                        they issued notes to the full amount of the
                        stocks deposited to secure their circulation, instead of only ninety per
                        cent. as now. In other States the advantages were equal, or greater. But the
                        National Banks do not receive the full interest on their three hundred
                        millions of circulation, because fully one-fourth is kept constantly in
                        their tids, to meet the daily requirements of their business.</p>
                    <p>One very serious thought to be considered by those who would force the Banks
                        into liquidation is, that the Banks hold more than one-fourth of the
                        national debt in bonds deposited for their circulation, and as security for
                        public deposits. Should these bonds, which are now kept permanently from
                        sale, be suddenly thrown upon the market, it would very seriously affect the
                        public credit. The real fact is, that this proposed measure for a forced
                        cancellation of the national currency is but one remove from a violation of
                        the public faith; it is nearly akin to that other measure of
                        semi-repudiation which would pay the gold interest on the Five-Twenty bonds
                        in paper currency. The public should be cautious how they indorse any of
                        these plausible financial schemes which shrewd speculators are so fond of
                        conjuring up for their approval.</p>
                    <p>We have now a uniform currency, which is a blessing of itself; the Government
                        being responsible for the circulation, bill holders are secured against
                        loss. Even when banks fail, as they have done, their notes are just as good
                        as any others, for the Government must redeem them. The safety of
                        depositors, to be sure, is only assured by the successful character of the
                        business done by the banks, although beyond the capital they have a further
                        security in the individual responsibility of the stockholders. In this
                        respect they are as well off as under any previous system. In addition to
                        the salutary checks provided by law, there are examiners appointed by the
                        Treasurer to make periodical investigations. It is doubtful if any change in
                        the present system could be made for the better, though it has its defects,
                        and may possibly be improved upon. Most of the intelligent portion of the
                        community have a general idea of its operation. They may well question the
                        policy of the measure proposed. That a forcible withdrawal of the National
                        Bank circulation would be alike injurious to the interests of those banks
                        and the general interests of the country is beyond peradventure. One effect
                        at least would be to retard for an indefinite period the resumption of
                        specie payments. Indeed, forced contraction of any sort, even when limited
                        to $4,000,000 a month as authorized by law, is not calculated to produce the
                        effect anticipated, as the result proves. We are certainly no nearer specie
                        payments now than when the Enabling Act was passed. Political quiet and
                        confidence is needed more than new measures of finance.</p>
