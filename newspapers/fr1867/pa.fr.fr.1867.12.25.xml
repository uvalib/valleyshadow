                    <p>Jefferson Davis sailed for New Orleans on Friday last, attracted thereto by
                        the beneficient administration of the Fifth Military District Commander. Mr.
                        Davis has long been prominent in American politics by reason of his
                        steadfast devotion to the Constitution and his high regard for the laws of
                        the land. His patriotic feelings have been outraged by what he considers the
                        unconstitutional and revolutionary measures of the present Congress, and he
                        now seeks a home in a military district, the Commander of which promises to
                        restore the reign of law and order. He proposes, we understand, to recall
                        from the West Indies, Mexico and Brazil those of his friends who, rather
                        than endure the flagrant violation of the Constitution they so much loved,
                        by a revolutionary Congress, expatriated themselves after the close of war.
                        Under the administration of Gen. Hancock they will be permitted to enjoy all
                        their former rights and privileges, and their patriotic feelings will be
                        secure from outrage by unconstitutional practices in high places. Louisiana
                        and Texas have bright prospects before them.</p>

                <summary>The article states Jefferson Davis set sail for New Orleans last Friday,
                    and notes that, under the administration of Gen. Hancock, the Commander of the
                    Fifth Military District, he "will be permitted to enjoy" all his "former rights
                    and privileges." The article predicts that the area will soon become home to
                    many of the former rebels who fled to Central and South America in the wake of
                    the Confederacy's defeat.</summary>

                    <p>The Alabama loyalists have prepared a Constitution which judged by its
                        conformity to democratic ideas and principles is perfect in all its
                        framework. It permits no distinction to be made in any of the civil affairs
                        of the State on account of race, color or former condition. It takes a man
                        for what he is worth, irrespective of all such accidents, and guarantees
                        equal and exact justice to all. The rebels oppose the consummation of this
                        great work because it would deny them the enjoyment of their former
                        supremacy. They are not satisfied to be considered in law as good as other
                        men, but demand some constitutional guarantee that will keep beneath their
                        level those who once were kept then by servitude. The Democracy oppose it
                        because the political enfranchisement of the Southern blacks will leave them
                        nothing but a name. Let justice be done through the Slaveocracy be humbled
                        and the Democracy dissipated.</p>
