<b>Vox Populi Suprema Lex</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial offers an elaborate justification for the enactment of the
                    Reconstruction Bill, based upon the notion that they represent the truest

<b>Democracy and Its Judges</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>During the late war, contend the editors, Democratic judges did their best
                    to undermine the nation's efforts to maintain the union. The current Democratic
                    candidate for Supreme Judge is no different. Among his most grievous actions,
                    they relate, he ruled "against the legality of the currency of the country, and
                    strove to embarrass its financial management, at the most perilous period of the
                    war." His election, the editors warn, will tip the balance of power within the
                    state to the "law-perverting party."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The "Democracy" are a most hopeful and forgetful set of culprits. Nothing
                        dampens their expectations; and the scorn with which the country has
                        repudiated them again and again is lost sight of in their greedy press for
                        spoils. A fellowship in guilt bands them together in sympathy; and like
                        their brethren of Mosby's gang, when they are overwhelmed and scattered,
                        they rally by instinct, and push forward anew in their "lost cause." Here
                        and there, where they catch the loyal party off guard, they make a dash and
                        gobble up an office, and then they are as jubilant as when they could
                        promote desertions or read the details of a rebel victory. But if they are
                        forgetful, the country remembers. She remembers how they broke her peace,
                        slew her sons, dishonored her name, and bore her down with the burden of a
                        stupendous debt. She remembers with what infamous zeal they labored to
                        cripple her, as she strove with the mighty power that sought to crush her
                        into anarchy and ruin. She remembers how their leaders, when in high places
                        in government, instead of protecting her from her insulting and threatening
                        enemies, encouraged them by remissness and justified them by apologies, and
                        most wickedly out-lawed her. How the democratic Attorney General found no
                        law, which would permit the government to save its life, and with what
                        malignity he labored during the bitter years of the war to prove that she
                        was not entitled even to the law of nature, self-preservation. How his voice
                        rang out through the darkness of those days in angry protests against her
                        efforts to keep the government of the people from perishing from the earth.
                        And she sees to-day this disaffected man, stung to desperation by the
                        indelible disgrace that clings to him as a leprosy, warring against her
                        peace with the animosity of a Simon Grity, and perverting his great talents
                        to inflict upon her still more dishonor. She remembers, too, how it has been
                        in the name of the law, that this unfaithful party has sought to accomplish
                        its destructive ends. In the eyes of the misnamed Democracy it was
                        unconstitutional to preserve the unity of the nation by arms. The Judges of
                        their persuasion were adroit in interpreting the law against every thing
                        done in the interest of the government. Democratic Judges pronounced the
                        drafts illegal, and encouraged disloyal and indisposed persons to refuse
                        responding to the call, or deserting from the ranks if they had entered.</p>
                    <p>The present Democratic candidate for Supreme Judge decided against the
                        legality of the currency of the country, and strove to embarrass its
                        financial management, at the most perilous period of the war. And now
                        Democratic expounders of the law are aiding a wicked and debauched
                        President, in his warfare against the loyal people and in behalf of the
                        subjugated traitors, by distorting law, and justice and truth, and
                        righteousness, to give plausibility and speciousness to his flagrant
                        defiance of law and order. Through their advisement, he has fomented riots
                        and bloodshed; has pardoned and exalted the most iniquitous rebels; has
                        stricken down the purest patriots; has given the control of States to men
                        whose hands are dripping in the blood of our brethren; and has defied and
                        insulted our Representatives.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy of Pennsylvania are now mustering for the canvass, which is to
                        elect a Supreme Judge for the State, who will give the balance of power
                        either to the law-loving or law-perverting party. They will leave no effort
                        untried to succeed. They would cheerfully give us a Governor, or Assembly,
                        if they could fill the bench with men who will nullify whatever laws we may
                        pass. Their fight now is for unjust Judges. True to their instincts they
                        offer as a successor to Woodward a man of his own kidney, a man to whom
                        Judge Jere. Black gives his full endorsement. This should be enough to teach
                        a loyal man how to vote, even if he did not know the antecedents of Judge
                        Sharswood. The people have had enough of Democratic Judges, enough of
                        Democratic rulers for the remainder of this century, at least. Spurned by
                        the manlier portion of the rebels themselves, dragging out a precarious and
                        sickly existence by the patronage of a dying administration, the loyal and
                        intelligent people of Pennsylvania, will not sully her good name by
                        sustaining them with their votes.</p>

                    journals, and contends the true cause for the attacks stems from the Democrats'
