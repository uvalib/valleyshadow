                <transcript>
                    <p>On Tuesday next the highest honor and the most responsible trust in the gift
                        of the State will be conferred by the legislature. It is the richest fruit
                        of the loyal victory so nobly won by the faithful men of Pennsylvania, and
                        must bring honor or shame to our mighty Commonwealth for six years to come.
                        The humiliation imposed upon a generous people by a shameless apostate, is
                        to be retrieved, and the Republicans of the State demand of the legislature
                        that their noblest trust and their dearest interests shall not be bartered
                        to a political adventurer, who never won a position but by fraud, and never
                        left one but with dishonor.</p>
                    <p>We admonish the legislature and the People of the State, that there is
                        imminent danger of a nomination for Senator, not only in insolent defiance
                        of the wishes of the People, but one that will do positive violence to the
                        earnest hopes of nineteen-twentieths of the loyal voters of the State. <emph
                            rend="italic">Why</emph> there is such peril, we need not explain. It is
                        known to all who read and think--from man to child the story is familiar
                        everywhere; and no legislator can be held blameless who aids or tolerates
                        the success of the effort.</p>
                    <p>Already the same baleful influences which are expected to secure the election
                        of Simon Cameron to the Senate, have compassed the control of the various
                        channels of political power about the legislature; and all disguise is
                        thrown off as the lobby and subsidized presses boast that the victory is
                        won--that the purchase is consummated--that the sacrifice to pelf and
                        plunder of the richest jewel of loyal triumph is complete. With almost one
                        accord the People protest. With the perfidy of Cowan and the treachery of
                        Johnson staining past Republican victories, they have demanded tested
                        fidelity and some measure of statesmanship in the Senator to be chosen, and
                        they will revolt as never before if this monstrous wrong shall be
                        successful.</p>
                    <p>Not a district, county, or township in Pennsylvania has asked the election of
                        Simon Cameron by any sort of action of the People; and not a single loyal
                        press has preferred him in obedience to the sentiment of its Republican
                        readers. On the contrary; wherever the People have spoken their voice has
                        been for another, and often coupled with a positive injunction that Cameron
                        shall not be the man in any event. Three-fourths of the loyal press have
                        indicated their choice--an honest, unpurchased expression--and of all the
                        counties and districts which have instructed, but one is at variance with
                        the general preference for our honored Executive, and that was for Mr.
                        Stevens in his own home. Nor has this sentiment changed. Presses may be
                        controlled; legislators may be made forgetful of their solemn obligations to
                        their constituents, but the People are above and beyond the reach of the
                        corrupting influences which are brought into requisition to make a Senator.</p>
                    <p>We ask the legislature to pause before this appalling betrayal of the loyal
                        men of the State is consummated. Before the ungracious task is performed,
                        let each man be mindful that he who enters into this crusade against the
                        integrity of the Republican organization, leaves hope behind him. It cannot
                        be successful save at the cost alike of the individuals who support it and
                        of the organization that has, in an evil hour, trusted them. The People ask
                        of their servants that they so perform this important duty--so confer this
                        highest honor--that our great State shall be honored, and Freedom and
                        Justice have a faithful champion, regardless of the blandishments or plunder
                        of power. It will <emph rend="italic">not</emph> be well for those who are
                        heedless of this earnest demand of an earnest People!</p>

                    consequences of selecting Simon Cameron to be the state's next Senator because
                    such a decision would represent an "appalling betrayal of the loyal men of the
                    State." Should the Legislature not heed this warning and perpetrate this

                    <p>Editorial Correspondence of the Franklin Repository.<lb/> Harrisburg, Jan. 7,
                        1867.</p>
                    <p>It would be idle to attempt to disguise the fact that there is danger of
                        Cameron's nomination by the Republican caucus. Had his purpose to effect a
                        nomination on Wednesday night last not been frustrated by the boldness of
                        some twenty members, who resolved that they would not be bound by a trick so
                        palpably venal, he would have pressed the Senatorial nomination through at
                        that time with whip and spur, and thenceforth had the vantage ground of a
                        caucus endorsement. But it was one of the things he did not dare to do, and
                        thus compelled to bow to the will of the People, who, as a mass, are his
                        deadly antagonists in this struggle.</p>
                    <p>I would be faithless to the integrity of the Republican organization, did I
                        not declare that a majority of the legislators desire some pretext for
                        giving their support to Cameron. I have seen men come here with honest
                        purpose to reflect the wishes of their constituents, stagger from day to day
                        and finally fall into the bewildering, seething whirlpool of corruption that
                        is ever reaching for them and drawing them almost imperceptibly into its
                        fearful, fatal embrace. To-day it is defiantly flaunted into our faces that
                        a clear majority is fixed and settled beyond per-adventure, and the first
                        part of the boast is not without foundation. But time--even but a few
                        days--may prove a great leveler and place the venal victor in disgraceful
                        defeat. The People are moving in different sections of the State. In
                        Allegheny they have called public meetings, and are sending up the earnest
                        appeal of their faithful men in behalf of the integrity and life of their
                        organization. In every portion of the State the humiliation of Cameron's
                        triumph is so keenly felt, that there will be hundreds if not thousands of
                        true Republicans here before the nomination to demand that their choicest
                        gift, and their most responsible trust shall not be shamelessly bartered in
                        open market to one who has no just claim to statesmanship, and who has never
                        won an honor save by fraud or purchase.</p>
                    <p>Thaddeus Stevens and Col. Forney have at last appreciated the peril of the
                        situation, and they will be here this evening to throw themselves into the
                        gaping breach made by Cameron's lobby. They come in earnest, and mean to
                        struggle as earnest men to avert the threatened national disgrace. The
                        published statement that Curtin had declined in favor of Stevens is entirely
                        without foundation. He never proposed or contemplated such a course. He will
                        remain in the field to which he has been called by the imperative demand of
                        the Republicans of the State, until the great struggle is over, and if he
                        fail of success, his hands and record will be clear. But that the friends of
                        Stevens, Grow and Curtin will cordially co-operate with Cameron is certainly
                        true, and they can scarcely fail to succeed. They have first of all a common
                        political organization to save, and the common interests and honor of a
                        mighty commonwealth to shield from consuming shame, and they will act with
                        unbroken ranks to perform this task. That once done, the friends of all the
                        candidates opposed to Cameron will doubtless act wisely and with reference
                        to success. I do not now see how any other than Curtin can combine
                        sufficient strength to defeat the corruptionists. Certain it is that the
                        Cameron men desire most of all that Curtin should be taken from the field,
                        and in the present aspect of affairs his withdrawal would render Cameron's
                        nomination inevitable. With such a result as likely to follow his
                        declination, he could do so only at the sacrifice of honor. He can afford to
                        be beaten, but he will not be a suicide. If fraud shall overthrow him now,
                        it needs no prophetic mind to forecast the enthusiasm and determination with
                        which the loyal People will make the rejected stone their crowning ornament.

                <summary>In his column, the Repository's correspondent acknowledges that, despite
                    his deep reservations and opposition, there is a good chance that Simon Cameron
                    will win in his bid to capture the Senate seat. The only hope to rescue the
                    state from this predicament, he laments, lies with Gov. Curtin, who is the only
                    politician with sufficient strength to "defeat the corruptionists" currently
                    manipulating the selection process in Harrisburg.</summary>

                    of a "'Life Insurance Manual'" would yield a dramatically different conclusion.</summary>
