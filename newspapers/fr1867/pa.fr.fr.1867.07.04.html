<b>The Ticket and the Platform</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report that the Republican State Convention, held last
                    Wednesday in Williamsport, was quite successful, and offer their support for
                    Henry W. Williams, the party's nominee for the state supreme court. The editors,
                    however, lament the convention's failure to address the need for constitutional
                    reform in the party platform.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We give elsewhere in this week's issue a full account of the proceedings in
                        the Republican State Convention, held at Williamsport on last Wednesday.
                        They appear to have been marked with unusual unanimity, and, so far as we
                        are able to judge, are heartily approved by the entire party throughout the
                        State. The candidate chosen is Hon. Henry W. Williams, at present Judge of
                        the District Court of Allegheny county, which position he has filled for two
                        consecutive terms with credit to himself and to the satisfaction of his
                        district. We know nothing of him personally, but from the concurrent
                        testimony of political friend and foe, we accept him as a candidate
                        unexceptional in point of character, eminently qualified as a jurist for the
                        high position, and positively reliable as a truly loyal and worthy
                        gentleman. The Pittsburg Post, the leading
                        Democratic journal of the West, says of him:--"The nomination of Hon. Henry
                        W. Williams as a candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court is a good one. He
                        was the best man named among the candidates before the Republican
                        Convention, and possesses legal and moral qualifications for the responsible
                        position to which he has been nominated." When a man of opposite political
                        belief can extract such praise from such a journal, he must have positive
                        virtues and qualities to recommend him, that vituperation and abuse could
                        not well conceal from public view.</p>
                    <p>The platform, so far as it goes, faithfully reflects the views of the
                        Republican party of Pennsylvania. We had earnestly hoped that the Convention
                        would declare itself in favor of constitutional reform. We thought we saw a
                        great necessity for such a declaration, and still believe that the good we
                        aim is attainable only in this way. Such a declaration would have entirely
                        relieved the party of the odium that was engendered by a faithless
                        legislature, and which, without a positive disavowal and disapprovement,
                        must operate to some extent against our success as a party. As it is, we
                        have a dead weight to carry that might easily have been thrown aside and
                        made a stumbling block for our opponents, they with characteristic political
                        knavery having contented themselves with denouncing the sins of other men
                        and cloaking their own. Then again we were anxious that the party should be
                        brought up to the high level on which our friends in other States have
                        planted their colors. We wanted a clear, distinct utterance from the
                        convention on the subject of impartial suffrage. This was denied us, and we
                        sincerely regret it. Still, however, there is enough in the platform to
                        cheer and encourage the friends of freedom and loyalty everywhere. There is
                        nothing equivocal or unmeaning in it. It requires no interpreter. It is
                        plain, positive, direct and frank on every question that is named, and, will
                        commend itself to every impartial mind. With the candidate and platform we
                        are satisfied, and shall labor earnestly and zealously for their complete
                        triumph, in the hope that their success will be the precursor of the
                        ultimate adoption, of what we considered to be important, if not necessary,
                        conditions in the present campaign. All hands to the ropes!</p>
