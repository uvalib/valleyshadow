<b>How About Our Standard?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Sounding a rally cry, the editors admonish Republicans to get to work in
                    the face of the recent election setbacks. Despite the party's poor performance,
                    they say, the results should not be taken as sign to stray from the party's
                    guiding principles. That "would lead to irretrievable disaster."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Shall we lower it, or shall we keep it flying proudly as before? Shall we
                        blot from its folds any of the great truths that we have inscribed thereon,
                        and which have been alike our battle cry and our creed, or shall we emblazon
                        them anew in fresher and more unfading colors?</p>
                    <p>Before our forces shall again be marshalled for the fight, these questions
                        must be determined. They are urged upon us by reason of the apparent
                        reverses we have lately sustained. Those who have hitherto acted with us and
                        aided as best they knew in pushing on the good work thus far, affrighted at
                        the result of the late elections, and taking counsel of their fears, advise
                        that we float another banner when next we meet the enemy: in other words
                        that we compromise somewhat of our principles, abate somewhat of our
                        demands. These are more anxious for the success of the party than for the
                        triumph of its faith.</p>
                    <p>There are others anxious for the final and complete enthronement of
                        Republican ideas, but who likewise affrighted at our late defeat would
                        degrade our political struggle by introducing tactics that would obtain in
                        no higher contests than Spanish bull fights. As the matidore is slow to
                        display the red lining of his coat, and careful not to excite his savage
                        enemy beyond his power to subdue by too great a display, so these men would
                        have us deal with our political adversaries. They would have us bedim our
                        colors in order that our adversary may not be excited with a dangerous
                        phrensy.</p>
                    <p>Can we afford to do either? We think not. To the first we reply that a
                        divorce of the Republican party from the principles it has preferred and the
                        principles it has taught, must and will lead to irretrievable disaster. As
                        well might you expect to separate soul from body without impairing the life
                        of the latter, as to take from the Republican party the only animating
                        principle it has, and expect it to flourish as before.</p>
                    <p>It dare not deny a single principle of truth, justice or human freedom. These
                        stood sponsors at its baptism, and devoted it to the noble work of elevating
                        man by defending him in the exercise of all his rights. To that great work
                        it must address itself, and if we believe in the invincibility of truth
                        itself we must have faith in our ultimate triumph as a party. Just as long
                        as we deserve success we shall achieve it, and to deserve it we must be
                        faithful to our principles and devoted to the cause. We cannot, we dare not
                        compromise with the enemy if we hope for final success. Such a course might
                        bring with it a temporary success, but like the apples of the Dead Sea, it
                        would turn to ashes in our hands. It would be the precursor of complete
                        ruin. Rather let us fly the old banner with the triumphs of the past
                        emblazoned thereon, and underneath in letters of living light, human freedom
                        and equal rights.</p>
                    <p>To the second we reply, that we can suffer anything better than dishonor.
                        With our quarrel just, we must triumph sooner or later. Neither subterfuge
                        nor artifice will take the place or do the work of honest boldness. The
                        truth will inspire more courage than artifice can excite. What we need is to
                        realize better than ever the inherent justice of our cause, and from that we
                        will draw more enthusiasm than the enemy will phrenzy. The contest will be
                        shorter too, and when the victory shall have been gained ours will be the
                        rejoicing. To one and all then we say, stand by the colors as they are,
                        without one word or line erased, and hold them firmly until the end.</p>

<b>A Small Mistake</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite their rivals' claims to publish nothing but "the pure
                    unadulterated, wholesome truth," the Repository editors contend that the Valley
                    Spirit either committed a grievous error in its coverage of the recent election
                    in Virginia or lied.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"Negro supremacy is simply an impossibility in Virginia, if white men
                    there act as white men should. If they don't, it is their fault, and not the
                    fault of the negroes."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We beg, leave once again to remind our neighbor of the Spirit of the promises they made their readers when they first
                        assumed the management of the paper. We have observed of late, what to us
                        seemed very wide departures from the excellent rule of practice they
                        established, and which they promised their readers should be strictly
                        observed to the end, that the Spirit might be "a
                        fountain from which all may drink pure, unadulterated, wholesome truths."</p>
                    <p>We would not for a moment think of charging our friends with wilful
                        misrepresentation. That, we are persuaded, they are incapable of; but it is
                        astonishing how, despite good intentions and honest motives, men are
                        sometimes made to give expression to the grossest errors under the semblance
                        of truth. In the last number of the Spirit, there
                        appeared an article on the result of the late election in Virginia, in which
                        it is stated that "had all the whites who were registered voted against the
                        Constitution, they would have been powerless to defeat it, inasmuch as the
                        number of blacks voting exceeded the number of whites registered." Ingenious
                        as our neighbors are, they can hardly square this by the rule they have
                        adopted. The truth is, that the registry in Virginia showed an excess of
                        twenty thousand white voters, and that the negroes carried the election
                        simply because they exercised their privileges and the whites did not. Negro
                        supremacy is simply an impossibility in Virginia, if white men there act as
                        white men should. If they don't, it is their fault, and not the fault of the
                        negroes. Will our neighbor please correct!</p>
