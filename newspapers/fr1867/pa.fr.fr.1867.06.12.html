<b>Far Off Chats With Old Friends</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Lamenting the fact that he is 1,000 miles away from where he had expected
                    to be by this time, McClure blames his slow progress on the persistent threat of
                    Indian attacks and the unpredictable weather of the Rocky Mountains, the
                    "'Switzerland of America.'" McClure offers a rather critical assessment of the
                    military commanders, who, charged with protecting the overland route to the
                    west, have allowed the Indians to retain the upper hand. "The history of the
                    settlement of the United States by the whites is but a continuous history of the
                    mastery of the pale faces over the red man," McClure writes, "and yet we have

                    Indians are the "scourges of this nation" and, as a "class," must therefore be
                    "exterminated." It is not necessary to "kill" all of them, she explains, but

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Correspondence of the Franklin Repository.</p>
                    <p>NO. XXVIII., PITTSBURG, June 6, 1867.</p>
                    <p>It is a matter of sincere congratulation, that Col. McClure has gone to the
                        far west, and is carrying his common sense with him. His letters are having
                        extensive influence, in opening the eyes of the American people to the
                        monstrous absurdity of our Indian policy. No nation can afford to have a
                        foreign power in her midst; but the Republic of America has dozens such.
                        Every separate tribe is a separate nation, independent in its action, and
                        owing no obedience to our laws. If one Indian comes upon our territory and
                        commits a murder, our laws in theory, hold him responsible; but if any
                        considerable number combine and commit any number of murders, they are at
                        once recognized as belligerents. Those religious people who are most zealous
                        for the enforcement of the law "Who so sheddeth man's blood, by man shall
                        his blood be shed," are foremost to denounce as barbarians, all who would
                        apply this law to Indians. No number, or atrocity, of murders can bring the
                        red man under the penalty; and the reason given is that he has been wronged.
                        Is it not generally admitted that a vast majority of all criminals have been
                        wronged, and that their crimes are, more or less, the result of that wrong,
                        but who, on that account, advocates immunity in crime? The Slave was
                        certainly as cruelly wronged as ever has been any great class of the human
                        family, but even the most fanatical Abolitionist never gave this as a reason
                        why he should avenge his wrongs by murdering the innocent; or that if he had
                        attempted to do so, the course of Justice should be suspended on account of
                        his wrongs. The true state of the case is that Slaveholders and Indians have
                        so compelled the respect of the working masses, by their sovereign contempt
                        of labor, that they have been our American aristocracy, and we have regarded
                        them much as the peasantry of England do their Earls and Dukes. They are our
                        privileged classes. A Slaveholder could hiss into the faces of the working
                        men of the North, his contempt. "Would you have us black our own boots, and cut our own firewood, and our wives and daughters work in the kitchen?" He
                        could do this, and afterwards command their votes by the hundreds of
                        thousands. An Indian can shoot white men to express his contempt for their
                        meanness in hoeing corn, and white laboring men unite in the cry of "Poor
                        Indian" to shelter him from the punishment of his crime. We have been so
                        impressed with the magnificence of<br> "The master who waves<br> His whip
                        of dominion o'er hundreds of Slaves,"<br> and the wild independence of our
                        poker-playing-lazy Indian, that we forget the meanness of stealing the wages
                        of the poor; and the filth and crawling creatures which infest the persons
                        of one class of our aristocrats. Honest industry has bowed before the
                        savagery and crime of idleness and pride. The Slaveholder and the Indian
                        have been pampered and pitied, and made the scourges of this nation.</p>
                    <p>To remedy this evil these classes, as classes, must be exterminated. It is
                        not necessary to kill all the people; but we are rapidly exterminating
                        Slaveholders, by taking away their power to live without labor, and we must
                        do as much for the Indian. We must take away his treaty right to commit
                        murder; Stop the whole treaty business, treat them as subjects of our
                        Government, amenable to its laws, and entitled to its protection, give each
                        head of a family an inalienable fee simple title
                        to 160 acres of land, whenever he chooses to select it, compel him to work
                        on public roads and other necessary improvements, tax him, and make him work
                        out his taxes. When he works protect him in holding the proceeds of his
                        industry; make him send his children to school; if he steals imprison him;
                        if he commits murder, hang him; if he loafs, let him starve. Why should
                        white men toil and pay taxes to feed Indians, and support them in their
                        haughty contempt of labor? Why should our now enormous taxes be swelled by
                        millions, spent in mischievous military parades, called expeditions against
                        Indians. Indians regard these expeditions with even more contempt than Lee
                        did M'Lellan's Washington dress parades. They go around our military like a
                        hawk around a barnyard hen, and fighting them by the rules of civilized
                        warfare is simply a contrivance for furnishing salaries and fat contracts to
                        officers and contractors. It is impossible they should do anything effectual
                        in preventing Indian outrages. JANE G. SWISSHELM.</p>
