<b>Plea To The Ignorant No. 2</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors chastise their Democratic counterparts throughout the state for
                    publishing an article allegedly from the Salem Journal, a fictitious newspaper,
                    that calls the Dutch, English, and Irish in Pennsylvania "'ignorant, stupid, and
                    stolid.'" Publication of the article, the editors contend, was a blatant attempt
                    by the Democratic party to sway voters against Judge Williams, the Republican
                    candidate for Supreme Justice and a native of New England. Yet, they note, this
                    is just the last in a long line of stunts pulled by the Democrats since 1861
                    designed to manipulate public perceptions.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Democratic organs have probably discovered ere this that the Salem Journal article was a creature of their own. But
                        did they find the forgery so successful as political capital that they have
                        determined to procure a genuine article of the same tenor from the New
                        England Press. If so, surely the address of the Democratic State Committee
                        will bring it. Can any man--let him be of New England or Patagonia--having a
                        modicum of brains and a knowledge of the merest rudiments of logic, come to
                        any other conclusion, upon reading that address, than that those addressed
                        are "ignorant, stupid, and stolid," whether Dutch, English or Irish. Such
                        premises being laid down an intelligent being can make no other inference.
                        But we hold that these are altogether faulty, and we protest against this
                        misrepresentation of our people. We do not believe that even a respectable
                        minority of those wont to vote the opposition ticket straight can be cajoled
                        by such contemptible pleas as constitute the Democratic address. We are sure
                        there is too much intelligence and common sense among that sturdy class--the
                        back-bone of the State--which the opposition--in their forgery, accredited
                        to the mythical Journal,--denominate the "Solid
                        Dutch" to allow them to entertain for a moment the arguments to ignorance
                        and prejudice contained in that address.</p>
                    <p>We read therein that the Democratic organization is devoted to the
                        maintenance of its "immortal principles;" that it is "proud of its years,
                        its triumphs and its heroism in disaster." In '61 one of its mortal
                        principles was the perpetuation of Slavery. It has shared the fate of all
                        things mortal. "Slavery is dead." In '61 one of its principles was that a
                        State could not be coerced. Since that time several have been subjected to
                        this treatment. Does the "principle" still live? In '61, and thereafter,
                        until the overthrow of the confederacy they argued the right of secession.
                        To-day, that principle is in the condition of Lazarus after he had been four
                        days buried; it offends the nostrils of loyal men and many another thing
                        smells as sweet even to Democratic nasal organs. During the dark days of the
                        war they declared the contest a failure; at the close, deeming this
                        principle dead, they consented to its burial, but it seems the obsequies
                        were premature; for one, Andrew Johnson, a resurrectionist, has since
                        unearthed this too hastily interred "principle," and the opposition finding
                        therein remaining a spark of life, have ever since been busy blowing upon
                        it, with the hope that the thing will yet prove "immortal." We hope ere long
                        to see the Democracy following that "principle" of this party of "immortal
                        principles." The South went to war in its defence and failed. Is State
                        sovereignty dead or merely in abeyance? Another of the principles, to the
                        maintenance of which it is devoted is the perpetuation of inequality of
                        rights among men. This has in it the seeds of death, soon they will do their
                        work, and "Liberty and Equality" will then be no longer an unmeaning phrase
                        when applied to the condition of our people.</p>
                    <p>We wish the Chairman of the Democratic State Committee had noted some of the
                        "immortal principles" to the maintenance of which the "Democratic
                        organization" is so devoted. We can name many that have proved mortal, some
                        that are dragging out a sickly existence, but any that bear upon them the
                        marks of immorality we wot not of. Again the Democratic organization is
                        "proud of its years, its triumphs and heroism in disaster." "Proud of its
                        years," forsooth! The old man in his dotage boasts of his years. "Its
                        triumphs," what have they been? Has it had any during the last six years?
                        "Its heroism and disaster." Does it refer to the noble bearing of Davis, Lee
                        &amp; Co. during the last days of the rebellion? Or to the formation of
                        the National Union Party, or yet again to its gallant support of Johnson and
                        his policy? Will the chairman of the "Democratic organization" have the
                        goodness to inform us upon these points.</p>
                    <p>We will not insult our intelligent readers by animadverting upon the false
                        assertions in this precious document; they are so patent that the "wayfaring
                        man though a fool" may detect them. There is a little shallow sophistry in
                        this hotch-potch, however that may as well be pointed out. It compares the
                        taxation of '60 with that of '65. The public debt of '60 with the public
                        debt of '67. The expenses of the government for the year 1860 with those for
                        the year 1867. All this difference according to this column of falsehoods,
                        by courtesy called an address--is the direct work of the Republican party.
                        The rebellion had nothing to do with it. The sympathizing of the "Democratic
                        organization" with those in rebellion, by which the war was protracted did
                        not increase the public debt, of course not. We have no doubt that William
                        A. Wallace could show to his own satisfaction and to the satisfaction of
                        those who are thick-headed enough for the purposes of such an address, that
                        the public debt was lessened thereby. Finally, we have the substance of the
                        stupid forgery accredited to the non-existing Salem Journal incorporated in an address to the "Democrats of
                        Pennsylvania." We have "George Sharswood--a Pennsylvanian, a man of pure
                        morals," &amp;c., pitted against his "opponent, Henry W. Williams--a
                        native of New England, and comparatively unknown to our people." Who dare
                        defend Pennsylvania against the charge of being a "poor, ignorant, stupid"
                        State when the chairman of a party, that hopes to obtain a majority in a
                        poll of five hundred thousand votes--aims to secure that majority by the
                        publication of such a despicable plea. The chairman further says that Henry
                        W. Williams "prior to his nomination was said to be a worthy gentleman and an able
                        lawyer." Dogberry lamented much that he had not been "writ down an ass." The
                        Chairman of the "Democratic organization" has taken good care that no sorrow
                        shall come to him hereafter through neglect on the part of any one to write
                        him down a black-guard. He has forestalled regret on that account by doing
                        it for himself in the passage just quoted. Only a low fellow could write it.
                        If Henry W. Williams, since his nomination by the Republican party, has
                        ceased to be the worthy gentleman and able lawyer he "was said" to be before
                        it; if his connection with that party detracts from his legal ability and
                        gentlemanly qualities; if such be the effect of affiliation with the party
                        of progress, where, in the name of heaven, stands Judge Sharswood to-day. If
                        evil communications corrupt "pure morals," then it is high time for the
                        "session"--of which the Judge is a member, to be examining into the status of their brother.</p>
                    <p>We have faith in the intelligence of the masses, and therefore we believe
                        that such arguments to ignorance as the Journal
                        forgery and the "address of the Democratic State Committee," will conduce to
                        the success of the Republican party. Hence we hope the Democratic
                        organization will continue to forge or concoct still other argumenta ad ignorantitum.</p>

<b>Union and Action</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article provides a celebratory account of the Republican Party County

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article praises Secretary Stanton for his unflinching loyalty and

                    President pleaded with him to stay.<br>

<b>Grant and the Secretaryship</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After noting that Gen. Grant has assumed Sec. Stanton's post, the piece
                    speculates on the general's political loyalties, contending that he will follow
                    a path similar to the one taken by Stanton. Consequently, it questions the
                    excitement generated in the Democratic press about Grant's appointment.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The position of the General, assumed upon his relief of Mr. Stanton, is a
                        vexed question in the newspaper realm, at present. The copperhead press is
                        ecstatic, and claim him as a captive to their cause; while the lamenting
                        Republicans believe that he regarded his assignment to the War office in the
                        light of a military order, which he had no right either to disobey or object
                        to. We believe that Grant is in full sympathy with Secretary Stanton, and
                        that he purposely meant that the people should know of his sympathy, when he
                        publicly expressed his "appreciation of the zeal, patriotism, firmness and
                        ability with which Mr. S. had ever discharged the duties of Secretary of
                        War." Gen. Grant hardly regards these virtues as disqualifications for the
                        Secretaryship! It is believed by those, who have the best opportunities to
                        know, that the General and the Secretary are in full accord. But a short
                        time will show. Should Grant accept the assignment to the War Department in
                        the interest of Johnson, for the purpose of deposing Mr. Stanton, and
                        becoming the instrument in the hands of a corrupt administration for the
                        disgracing of the brave officers, who gained their glory under him and
                        reflected no mean share of their own fame upon their commander in chief; if,
                        we say, Gen. Grant could show himself capable of such meanness, he has not
                        renown enough to save him from the just indignation of the people, who love
                        and honor him for the services he rendered the country, and would abandon
                        him as soon as he proved false to his own good name. The cause is higher
                        than any man, however famous, and whosoever opposes it will go down. There
                        is nothing in the character of Grant which would make us mistrust him. On
                        the other hand, we feel gratified that he has taken Mr. Stanton's place, if
                        Mr. Stanton had to go. The Democracy will find no cause to rejoice in the
                        change; they have not made him prisoner. They fought him unsuccessfully in
                        the field; they cannot conquer him in the Cabinet.</p>
