<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In the article, the editors distance themselves from the opinions expressed
                    by Jane Swisshelm in her column regarding Gen. Grant and Judge Williams, of

                    early war he was looking for conciliation--may be true, but they point out that
                    Grant "was faithful, skillful, and successful, and he thus filled the measure of
                    the nation's want."<br>

<b>The Indian War</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the editors, the "last hope of a peaceful solution of our

                    the terms of the treaties agreed to with U. S., and have "practiced the most
                    revolting cruelties" upon white settlers. Consequently, the Indians "must be
                    placed beyond the pale of progress."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The last hope of a peaceful solution of our Indian troubles seems to have
                        vanished, and it is not impossible that we shall have a summer of fierce
                        conflict with the Indians of the Plains. As yet the Sioux and the
                        Cheyennes--two of the most powerful tribes in existence--are alone in actual
                        hostilities against the whites, but it is understood that they are
                        negotiating treaties with other tribes to join them in a general war, and a
                        number of tribes will soon be allied with them unless arrested by prompt
                        treaties. In that event the war will be general throughout the Territories,
                        and cannot, with our meagre force in the field, be terminated for at least a
                        twelve-month. We have not more than 5,000 men in the field for offensive
                        operations against the Indians; and the inadequacy of the force can be
                        properly appreciated when it is considered that our force is divided into
                        two distinct armies, each operating in different directions and beyond all
                        support from each other. Gen. Augur has moved North from Omaha to avenge the
                        Fort Phil Kearney massacre, and Gen. Hancock has moved South to the Smoky
                        Hill region of Kansas and Colorado.</p>
                    <p>After all is said that can be said of the villainy of Indian Agents, and all
                        is confessed as true that is alleged by the Indians, there is not the shadow
                        of justification for the course pursued by the hostile Indians. The vast
                        tide of emigration to the new gold regions of Montana and Idaho necessitates
                        the opening of a direct route with the North-west from Fort Lawrence, by
                        which some hundreds of miles are saved in distance; the crossing of the
                        Rocky range entirely avoided in the route to Montana, and fine water and
                        pasturage for trains secured. The white man did not thrust himself upon this
                        new route without leave. A council was held at Fort Lawrence last spring,
                        and a treaty was executed with due solemnity by the chiefs of the tribes
                        interested, and the new route was declared open to emigrants. Believing that
                        faith could be reposed in the treaties made, a large number of trains passed
                        over the new route last summer, and the very same Indians who had
                        participated in the treaty at Fort Lawrence, returned to the Powder and
                        Yellowstone regions to murder emigrants with the ammunition they had
                        received from the government under the stipulation of their own treaty.
                        There was not a single team passed the route without either entire or
                        partial destruction, and there were hundreds of soldiers and civilians
                        barbarously murdered. We believe that in every instance they inhumanly
                        butchered their prisoners, scalped all without regard to age, sex or
                        condition, and in many cases practiced the most revolting cruelties. They
                        offer as an excuse for their hostility that the Yellowstone region is the
                        winter home of the Buffalo north of the Platte, and that the advent of the
                        pale face will soon leave them without their chief resource for food. This
                        is measurably true; but the Indians were called upon to name their terms for
                        the cession of this thoroughfare, and they fixed and received it, and they
                        must now be taught that their covert disregard of their faith, forbids
                        future treaties tolerating their presence where progress carries the pioneer
                        and civilization. This war so unfortunately inaugurated by the Indian must
                        now make him recede again with all his race beyond the march of empire
                        toward the setting sun, and it is not improbable that it will well nigh
                        exterminate their warriors before the task is completed.</p>
                    <p>Equally inexcusable is the hostility of the Indians on the Smoky Hill route,
                        running north-west from Junction City (Fort Riley) in Kansas, to Denver,
                        Colorado. The Union Pacific Railroad is in course of construction over this
                        route at the rate of a mile per day, and it was not attempted until the
                        right to do so was treated for with the Indians recognized as the
                        proprietors of that section. As in the North, so on this route,--they have
                        made treaties to secure a supply of arms and ammunition, and have at once
                        proceeded to relentless butchery of all whites--men, women and children--who
                        are unfortunate enough to fall into their hands. Every day we read of some
                        capture and butchery of the Indians on one or both of these routes, and, it
                        seems to be their pride to deserve a high distinction for savagery. When met
                        by Gen. Hancock recently in council, they professed an earnest desire for
                        peace, and left him under the promise that they would promote harmony and
                        good feeling between themselves and the whites, and they have proved their
                        sincerity by departing from the council to renew their indiscriminate
                        butcheries. With such creatures it is worse than idle, it is criminal, to
                        attempt to make treaties, and the stern purpose and strong arm of the
                        government must give the people of the Territories peace and safety by the
                        removal of the Indians to some place where they will not be annoyed by
                        civilization.</p>
                    <p>The war now inaugurated by the treachery of the Indians must be accepted by
                        the government as a notice that no binding treaties can be made with them.
                        They must be placed beyond the pale of progress. They have solemnly agreed
                        by treaty to all the government and emigrants ask, and their next security
                        to the white man will be entenuation or exile. Thus far they have committed
                        their appalling atrocities with apparent impunity. They have massacred whole
                        garrisons, and the government has made no demand for the rendition of the
                        leaders who directed it, nor has any order gone forth to teach them that
                        every violation of the rules of warfare must be fearfully atoned for. This
                        must now be done, and done speedily, and when it is promised the fearful
                        faith must be kept, until the Red Man recedes still another step toward his
                        sad but inevitable destiny.</p>
