<b>The Political Lesson of 1867</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In his first editorial since departing for his tour of the Rocky Mountains,
                    McClure laments the Republicans' poor performance in the recent elections. He
                    asserts the results are a consequence of the public's reaction to rampant
                    political corruption. Should the party's troubles continue in the Presidential
                    election in 1868, he avows, it "would turn back the tide of progress" and lead
                    to the "practical re-enslavement of the Freedmen."<br>

                    <p>Editorial Correspondence of the Franklin Repository</p>
                    <p>UNION CITY, Montana T., Nov. 4, 1867:</p>
                    <p>Pennsylvania has faltered in her devotion to the great cause for which she
                        gave 300,000 of her noblest sons as warriors. Full 50,000 martyred heroes,
                        and the voice of mourning still heard in almost every household, attest the
                        fidelity of her people to our free institutions. The State was not,
                        therefore, lost because the people are any less loyal or patriotic now than
                        when they gave their men and their treasure to sustain the government; nor
                        is the result any criterion by which to judge future political struggles.
                        Ohio, too, has fallen to a nominal majority for the Republican State ticket;
                        given over the legislature and a U.S. Senator to Vallandigham and Pendleton,
                        and defeated the Manhood Suffrage amendment by from 40,000 to 50,000
                        majority. Indiana has receded, in local elections, to a small Republican
                        preponderance, and Iowa has fallen off 10,000 under the influence of local
                        issues. New York will doubtless follow Pennsylvania and elect unimportant
                        State officers and probably a legislature of the Democratic faith, and New
                        Jersey cannot withstand this floodtide surging against her ever doubtful
                        Republican supremacy. Massachusetts has vibrated in the political balance,
                        but will save the State from the confederated hosts of free rum, bread and
                        butter office holders and expectants, and Democracy. The States of the
                        North-west will maintain the Republican supremacy, but light-polls and
                        sumptuary laws will diminish the majorities. Thus, with California
                        sacrificed to the struggles of mean ambition, we have the political record
                        of 1867.</p>
                    <p>What are its lessons?</p>
                    <p>In view of the Presidential struggle just approaching this inquiry is one of
                        the gravest import. If the contest of 1868 should be lost, then, indeed,
                        shall we have made our sanguinary and victorious battle-fields "memorable in
                        vain." With any triumph that would be achieved in the name of the Democracy,
                        every devoted friend of the "Lost Cause" who has consistently nourished his
                        implacable hatred of the government he sought to overthrow in blood, would
                        be inspired with fresh hopes to subvert, by indirection, what he failed to
                        subvert by crowning treason with honor, and clouding the triumphs of our
                        heroic living, and the memory of our lamented dead, with lasting obloquy. It
                        would turn back the tide of progress when upon the threshold of noblest
                        fruition, and make the great Republic of the world recede, over the mute and
                        eloquent graves of its defenders, to the practical re-enslavement of the
                        Freedmen, and again stamp upon our escutcheon the blistering blots of
                        inequality and caste. It would leave us a nation without honor, without
                        faith, without credit, and justly without a place in the sympathy of the
                        christian world.</p>
                    <p>The timid, the time-serving and the venal have each their ready explanations
                        of the disaster in Pennsylvania, but all leave the great sore unprobed. The
                        State was wantonly sacrificed to unvlishing venality and notorious
                        incompetency. The last legislature prostituted the party's sacred citadel of
                        power to groveling cupidity and unscrupulous ambition, and bartered its
                        highest honors to be worn in consuming shame. Of nearly fifty who thus
                        betrayed their responsible trusts, not half a score succeeded in attaining a
                        re-nomination, and nearly or quite half who did, have been repudiated by
                        outraged constituents. Of the thirty or more who violated pledges or
                        instructions, not one returns to the legislature of 1868. But one Senator
                        who aided in this crowning wrong, was re-nominated, and he was free from the
                        imputation of violated faith, but he falls largely behind his ticket, and
                        has plunged Erie county back more than enough to defeat Judge Williams for
                        the Supreme Bench. Was not the public sacrifice too costly for mere personal
                        vindication?</p>
                    <p>As is most natural, when the centre of Republican power was debauched, its
                        streams coursed out their deadly poison into every portion of the State.
                        Allegheny sacrificed 1,000 or more of her majority to overthrow a faithful
                        Senator, while the perfidious acts of some of those who had been rewarded
                        with her honors, paralyzed other thousands into inaction, even when her
                        favorite candidate headed that ticket. The Blair district sacrificed two
                        Senators on the altar of faction, reared by legislative wrongs. The Lycoming
                        district--both Senator and Members--is thrown away in like manner.
                        Philadelphia bowed to the importunities of inordinate greed and ambition
                        rather than the wishes of the people, and she has sown to the wind and
                        reaped the whirlwind. Franklin made a struggle to recover from her
                        humiliating betrayal, but the contest was unequal and she was overborne;
                        while Adams, under the same paralysis, added one-third to the Democratic
                        majority. To all these mill-stones upon the neck of the Republican party
                        must be added the confessed inefficiency of the campaign management, and it
                        is wonderful that the State was not lost by thousands instead of hundreds.</p>
                    <p>These are unpalatable truths, and few there be who dare to tell them, while
                        all must appreciate the fidelity of the painful picture. The guilty will
                        smart under self-accusations, and complain earnestly, perhaps malignantly,
                        because the fatal errors of the past are pointed out to save us from future
                        disasters; but the day is near at hand when those who are faithful to truth,
                        and to the honor and integrity of Republicanism will enjoy its confidence in
                        Pennsylvania. I am one of those who can wait until the Republican party
                        vindicates itself.</p>
                    <p>These errors are of the past. They cannot be undone, but fearful has been the
                        atonement for them. The fact that such atonement has been sternly demanded,
                        and retribution relentlessly adjudged against the guilty, proves that the
                        Republican party is jealous of its fame, true to its sacred duties, and will
                        resent, with its high seal of reprobation, every infraction of its purposes
                        or stain upon its honor. Let the past, therefore, belong to the past. Its
                        appaling errors are covered by its still more appaling retributions. The
                        present and the future call Republicans to their sublimest duties. They have
                        the Executive, the legislature and every department of power in
                        Pennsylvania. They cannot but be admonished of the inexorable fiat of the
                        People demanding Reform, and that fidelity shall mark the progress of
                        Republican rule. The men of the new legislature have left their predecessors
                        festering by the waysides behind them, consigned to rottenness by their
                        constituents. They have been borne into power, over the marked dishonor of
                        those who came before them, to retrieve the perfidy of the past, and clear
                        the decks of the Republican ship for the last great struggle with our
                        country's foes. It is expected of them that their record shall be blameless;
                        faithful to every interest of the State and of the Republic, and such as the
                        whole Republican party can commend with pride to the people when it shall
                        come up for review. The coming State Convention will have stern duties to
                        perform in this crisis. It should be uninfluenced by fear or favor. It
                        cannot afford to yield to begging pretenders who are ever seeking empty
                        endorsements to bolster wasted reputations. It should discard all personal
                        interests, however worthy the claimants, and look solely to the great end to
                        be attained. It should speak for men as it means, and as its principles and
                        success demands; and, casting aside all the conflicts of those who seek to
                        climb into place over its battlements, organize the Republican party for
                        VICTORY, AND FOR DECISIVE VICTORY IN 1868!</p>
                    <p>It is claimed by many that the elections of 1867 demonstrate the issue of
                        Manhood Suffrage in the States. I do not so regard it. It may be a question
                        of years, but it is the destiny of irresistible progress. Either suffrage
                        must become universal, without discrimination against citizens on account of
                        race, or the advancing tide now coming up from the Southern States must
                        recede back to intolerance and slavery. It was lost by nearly 50,000 in
                        Ohio, and would to-day be voted down with a yell in Pennsylvania, but so was
                        Emancipation rejected but five years ago, even with all the pressure of war
                        to uphold it. The Proclamation of Mr. Lincoln made Ohio Democratic by 6,000
                        in 1862; made Indiana Democratic; made Horatio Seymour Governor of New York;
                        made New Jersey elect a Peace Executive; made Pennsylvania lose her State
                        ticket and one-third her loyal Congressmen, and emboldened our Supreme Court
                        to attempt to nullify the conscription law--then the last hope of our
                        fearfully imperiled nationality. On a direct issue, for or against
                        Emancipation, the great Central States and Indiana would have given half a
                        million adverse majority. How would they vote to-day? The same States would
                        have voted even stronger against arming slaves, or free negroes. They now
                        accept the negro as a soldier and accord him the credit that nearly 100,000
                        of our sable heroes, who died to save our free institutions, demand for
                        their living comrades. Ohio, Democratic by 6,000 in 1862, was Republican by
                        100,000 in 1863, and Pennsylvania reversed the verdict of 1862, re-elected
                        Gov. Curtin in 1863 by 16,000, and would have made it 50,000 had her
                        soldiers not been disfranchised. The people of New York hurled back their
                        rioters and faithless officers, and has since been up to every demand of
                        progress. New Jersey now points with pride to the Republican Executive and
                        Senators as fruits of her atonement for the error of 1862. Indiana, in her
                        first election thereafter, gave her largest Republican majority.</p>
                    <p>Under the Reconstruction acts of Congress the freedmen are voters in every
                        Rebel State, and among the most earnest advocates maintaining this right are
                        many of the leading Southern soldiers and statesmen who are opposed to the
                        policy of Congress. In those States Manhood Suffrage is an accomplished
                        fact, and no party will ever advocate its restriction there. In New York
                        there has been limited negro suffrage for many years--perhaps from the
                        organization of the State. In several of the New England States it is an
                        accepted policy that encounters no opposition from either party--its ablest
                        advocate being the Boston Post, the New England
                        organ of the Democracy. In the west, Iowa, and Nebraska have adopted it, and
                        no one proposes to take a step backward, while the Chicago Times, the leading western organ of Democracy, demands
                        that its party shall adopt Manhood Suffrage as part of its creed. In all the
                        Territories the negroes vote, and it is indelibly written in the laws of
                        progress that no future State will enter the Union with restricted suffrage
                        on account of color. Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota (where it was barely
                        defeated two years ago,) and Wisconsin are about to follow Iowa in accepting
                        it; and Missouri will shortly be side by side with Tennessee in the advance
                        march of justice. He who thinks that Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and New
                        Jersey will stand still, or retrograde, while the world moves on around
                        them, sadly misjudges the logic of events--Pennsylvania would not vote as
                        fervently against it to-day as she would have voted against free schools but
                        a little more than a quarter of a century ago, and the same regions that
                        voted most overwhelmingly against free schools, would today vote most
                        ferociously against impartial suffrage. With such a tide from every quarter
                        sweeping against our great centres of political power, I think the race that
                        voted with the whites for the framers of national constitution, and
                        continued to vote for half a century in Pennsylvania, will vote again in
                        every State within the next decade. It will not come by any arbitrary notion
                        of the general government, but by the sober, steady advancement of the
                        people. And when the Negroes become voters, they will be courted and
                        harangued with tender sentiment, by Democratic leaders who now appeal to
                        every base instinct to deny them the right of suffrage. The issue may be
                        defeated for a time, and each defeat will but strengthen it. Men may fall
                        who have the manhood to advocate it; but all who have abiding faith in the
                        fidelity with which the people will perfect the mighty revolution now in
                        progress in this nation, will look hopefully, confidently for this great
                        consummation. It is founded on the principles of eternal justice that those
                        who are governed, and taxed and required to defend the country's honor and
                        flag with their lives, shall have a voice in their government, and it cannot
                        fall without shattering our boasted structure of Universal Freedom.</p>
                    <p>I do not hope that the negro, when enfranchised, will always vote with those
                        who have disenthralled him. As he advances under beneficient laws, he will
                        accept the vices as well as the virtues of the superior race. While under
                        the guidance of education most of them will appreciate and support the
                        policy that elevated them, many others will gravitate through ignorance and
                        prejudice and vice to lower strata disciples of Democracy. If we had
                        universal suffrage now, the Five Points of New York, and the 4th Ward of
                        Philadelphia, would vote more negroes than any other district in either of
                        these cities, and how they would vote, Ben Wood and Billy M'Mullin would
                        know. The Democratic resolvers against negro equality in Chambersburg would
                        canvass Wolffstown with each returning election and gather the floating
                        Africans in to vote the Democratic ticket, and it will not be denied that,
                        under the natural inspirations of the Democracy, they would capture a
                        liberal portion of them. But the race, as a race, would vindicate the wisdom
                        of enfranchising them by commendable progress in intelligence, virtue and
                        good citizenship. It is a humiliating reflection that in this struggle there
                        are those of the ruling or white race, who confess themselves so poorly
                        endowed by their Creator that they must demand discriminating laws to retard
                        the negro from equality with them. There are those who make this claim
                        justly, and they are entitled to sympathy, but the progress of the age
                        cannot by arrested because of their misfortune. It is not their fault, as
                        they show conclusively by their earnest appeals for protection, that they
                        cannot compete with the negro in the race for social and personal
                        distinction, and it is most natural that they should invoke the supreme
                        might of the law to degrade the ignorant, homeless, down-trodden bondman
                        beneath them; but the time has come when this people must open up
                        unrestricted channels of advancement for every race and thus perfect their
                        boasted column of Freedom, then he who falls upon this mighty column will be
                        broken, and he upon whom it falls will be buried in oblivion. A.K.M.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Of all the vain conceits that possess the mind of the political demagogue,
                        that is the most preposterous which assumes that the narrow boundaries that
                        circumscribed the vision and faith of a party or a nation at any given
                        period of its existence, must still be held as the true measure of its
                        responsibilities and policy under totally different circumstances and times.
                        The duties and responsibilities of American Statesmen at the time our
                        Independence was won and our Government was organized, were met and
                        discharged with ability and fidelity; and that, in the face of an opposition
                        which bowed with obsequious deference to the wisdom and ability of George
                        the III in his management of the Colonies of America. Our fathers of the
                        Revolution impressed with a deep sense of the duties of the hour, dared to
                        follow their conception of a free government to practical consummation. They
                        gave to the world and to posterity a tangible form of the aspirations which
                        had gone up to heaven from liberty loving souls, enthralled for centuries in
                        the despotism of Europe or shut up in her prisons for conscience sake. We
                        say they did and dared in the face of the tory predictions of anarchy and
                        ruin which would follow the establishment of a Republic on the continent of
                        America. The powerful government of the United States now vindicates their
                        wisdom and their courage. Now while we render all due praise and honor to
                        the noble men who launched our ship of state, and to those who true to the
                        behests of freedom and progress guided her safely through storms of
                        political strife up to our present crisis of National danger, we cannot
                        forget the trials and dangers of the past, and ignore the fact that a
                        departure from the fundamental principles of true republicanism--the
                        political equality of all men--was the rock upon which the ship of state had
                        well nigh stranded. And while our political opponents and conservative
                        Republicans with want of wisdom unaccountable, would go back to the flesh
                        pots of Egypt, and are murmuring against every step forward, we would
                        intimate the fathers of the republic in courage and hope, while we
                        reconstruct the great fabric on a foundation not to be shaken. Times change
                        and its necessities change with them. The rivulets and brooks which
                        commingle to form the great Mississippi at its head waters, need not the
                        embankments and levees necessary to its restraint far down in the South. And
                        the men that cry out "tyranny and despotism," at every measure of safety
                        rendered necessary by the floods and waves of rebellion, which have rolled
                        over the nation, would find their fit counterpart, if the small streams
                        which form the great river should, when they have rolled down to Arkansas
                        and Louisiana, lift their voices against the artificial banks, as a cruel
                        constraint of their liberties and privileges, when far up in the North they
                        formed their association.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy have no policy for the future; they would go back if they could
                        to the local statutes of the South which authorized the sale of men on the
                        auction block; which punished with the lash, at the whipping post, men,
                        women and children; and imprisoned any who dared to teach the colored man to
                        read the scriptures. They would now, that slavery is extinct, embalm its
                        memories by holding in serfdom its late subjects. The odium that attached to
                        the condition of a slave is to be perpetuated by political disabilities, and
                        treason in its behalf made honorable by crowning the traitors with full
                        eligibility to places of power in the government they had sworn to destroy.
                        Like the Bourbons of France, they have learned nothing nor forgotten nothing
                        during the terrible conflict through which we have passed, and after having
                        conducted the nation go the verge of ruin by their mal-administration of the
                        government, they imprudently come forward with awful denunciations of "wrath
                        to come" if they are not permitted to frustrate the just policy which has
                        been inaugurated by the Republican party, which saved the nation in the day
                        of its calamity. We call on our contemporaries to sound the watchword of
                        progress--go forward in the work of humanity, "cry aloud and spare not,"
                        until the people be aroused from the fearful lethargy which, during the late
                        campaign, gave to the Democracy the symptoms of returning power.</p>
