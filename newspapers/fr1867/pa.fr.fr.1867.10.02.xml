                <transcript>
                    <p>We appeal to every Republican of this county and to every good man who
                        prefers the interests of the country to those of party, to exert himself to
                        the utmost to secure a full Union vote on Tuesday next, which will make sure
                        a glorious Union triumph. There is no doubt that we have a large majority in
                        this county. The only doubt is whether it can be brought out. There is no
                        question about the appearance of the adversary. They are thoroughly
                        organized. Their last man will be at the polls, to make a final struggle for
                        "the lost cause," another Pickett's charge to break our line for the good of
                        rebeldom. They are elated and hopeful, believing that we are supine and
                        apathetic. They know the great importance of their carrying this State. The
                        President and his co-conspirators are waiting the seeming endorsement of
                        Pennsylvania, to embolden them to an open and desperate revolution in behalf
                        of the traitors. Let but this commonwealth, which was so lavish of her blood
                        and treasure in the dark days of the nation's agony, give her vote for the
                        copperhead Sharswood, and you will find treason as jubilant as when Lee
                        flaunted his victorious banners on our mountain tops in '63. Andrew Johnson,
                        who has so long defied the loyal people whom he betrayed, will boldly set at
                        naught all law but that of his own wicked will, and will plunge the nation,
                        if it need be, into another sea of blood, to enforce his nefarious policy,
                        and give the control of the government into the hands yet red with the
                        slaughter of its defenders. What his purpose really is, remains unrevealed,
                        hidden in the dark bosoms of his plotting confederates, Black, Sharswood,
                        Beauregard, Valandigham, the knights of the golden circle and the Surratts
                        of the land. Perhaps, it will be to suppress the assembling of Congress,
                        what Andrew Johnson has publicly declared not to be a loyal body. May be, a
                        congressional substitute composed to suit his ends of mad copperheads from
                        the loyal States and rebels from the insurgent ones, may be recognized as
                        the legitimate National Legislature, and installed in the halls of the
                        capitol. This is no idle apprehension that may be laughed away. What means
                        the arming and drilling of the militia of Maryland, an organization made up
                        of the home traitors of that State and returned rebels? The reason given by
                        the democracy of Maryland for incurring the great expense of this military
                        organization, is that it is a preparation for defence against invasion.
                        Invasion from where? Is Maryland in danger? Is Maryland a kingdom by
                        herself, in the midst of enemies? Who favor her arming, and who bear her
                        arms? Rebels. That militia is a new born rebel army. It may be employed to
                        disperse your Congress. The streets of Baltimore echo the bold threats of
                        revolution. Leading men of the city speak bravely for repudiation of the
                        national debt; and in this they are sustained openly by the Democracy of
                        Ohio, and secretly by members of the Democracy everywhere. The bond holders
                        of the government are denounced as its foes, an idea which escaped from the
                        lips of the President in his hours of drunkenness.</p>
                    <p>But be the purposes of the Administration and its baleful allies what they
                        may, they are hostile to loyalty. The business men of the country are
                        alarmed--a painful sense of uncertain danger pervades men's minds. All see
                        the pressing forward of traitors, and the thrusting back of the men who
                        saved the government. They see the loyal and tried statesmen driven from the
                        public counsels, and their places filled by miserable panderers to
                        Presidential policy. They behold Grant, Sheridan, Thomas, Sickles, Griffin,
                        Schofield, and their heroic associates treated with contumely and scorn,
                        because they love the people they saved and hold the popular will to be
                        above the autocratic orders of a vicious chief magistrate, who was elevated
                        to his dizzy height by democratic assassins now canonized by that party, and
                        whose gross sensuality and loathsome vices have been unknown among American
                        statesmen, and only paralleled by the most bestial of the Roman emperors.</p>
                    <p>It was on the soil of Pennsylvania, that the decisive battle of the
                        slaveholders' war was fought. Gettysburg sealed the doom of the Confederacy.
                        On Tuesday next, another great struggle is to be had. One that may be as
                        momentous. It may determine whether treason is to have a new lease of life.
                        People of Franklin County, rally to the standard of your country on that
                        day. You will find about it the true men, to whom you looked in your days of
                        trial. There will be Grant, and Sheridan, and Geary, and Meade, and Thomas,
                        and Howard, and the thousand illustrious heroes of the war. Winger, it is
                        true, will not be there. He will be eating his bread and butter among the
                        peace Democracy, who have bought him at his full price. There will be the
                        scarred and mutilated veterans of the war, again in the service of the
                        country. There will be the old men, who gave their sons to the sacrifice,
                        there will be patriots who [*****ILLEGIBLE*****] and gloomed at your
                        defeats--there will center the prayers of the noble band of christian men
                        and women who followed your sons on the battle field and into the hospitals
                        with their humane ministrations. This is a goodly company indeed. Swell its
                        ranks. Come yourselves, and persuade your neighbors to come with you. Do not
                        let us be defeated. Do not let us have a reduced majority. You know how
                        serious is our danger, our country's danger. Can you conscientiously neglect
                        your duty to vote? Will you allow a trifling excuse to keep you away from
                        the polls? Do you acknowledge that the party, which has truth, loyalty,
                        justice, and right with it, is entitled to your suffrage, and that the
                        party, which hates truth, and loyalty, and justice and right, deserves and
                        should receive your stroke?</p>
                    <p>Let no union man in this county reproach himself hereafter, for his absence
                        at the polls, on Tuesday next; or for not working earnestly until then.</p>

                    <p>
                        <emph rend="italic">To the Editors of the Franklin Repository.</emph>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> of the 25th ult., one of the
                        "congenial spirits" in response to his brother in the "true faith," proposes
                        what he conceives to be a more effectual remedy for "political preaching"
                        than a mere "rising and leaving the church." He opines that the Radical
                        preachers would treat the exodus from the church much as the moon did the
                        barking cur, i. e. just go on without minding it, which is most likely. But
                        the true and radical cure in the estimation of this Solon "is to stop the
                        pay," "throw up the pew," "stop paying for such preaching." These outraged
                        christians put us in mind of a colloquy between a seedy young man who had
                        been in a show and his out-side comrade that had contented himself with
                        looking at the ginger-bread tables on the grounds. "I say Bob," said seedy,
                        "this show is a humbug; they didn't show half what their bills called for."
                        "Outrageous," says Bob; "I tell you Jake, if I were you I'd made them refund
                        the money." "Well, well," said Jake, "I, I, but the truth is, I didn't pay
                        any thing, I crawled into the darned thing under the canvass."</p>
                    <p>If these "what say you?" and "that's what I say," were unmasked, no doubt,
                        their pecuniary support and influence for good would be found to be much in
                        the same fix as the cave in the mountain side after the banks round its
                        mouth were dug away; the <emph rend="italic">hold</emph> was left sticking
                        out into the road about fifteen feet.</p>
                    <p>Ridiculous as these vapid and whimsical pratings about political preaching
                        are, we are tempted to serious on the subject, and say that the real trouble
                        with these canting hypocrites is, that they are now cut off from the comfort
                        they had under the teaching they enjoyed from Pro-slavery divines. As there
                        is no slavery to sustain, the pabulum which was made up of scriptures
                        perverted and <emph rend="italic">politics</emph> that <emph rend="italic"
                            >would mix with the perversions</emph>, is now taken away. And as the
                        conscience of the ministry had become enlightened in regard to human rights,
                        and the duties that man owes to man in the sight of God, are made to stand

                <summary>Finally, the piece says, the residents of the lower end of town will get
                    satisfaction. For sometime, they have been "agitating" for the erection of a
                    wagon bridge across the Falling Spring, near King St., and now, at last, it
                    appears the Town Council will approve the construction. As yet, it is unclear
                    what the body intends to do about the footbridge at the Lemnos Edge-Tool factory
                    that was swept away in the late floods.</summary>
