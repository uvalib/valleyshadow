                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the Spirit of the 18th inst., a certain "what
                        say you?" seems to be stirred in spirit by an intolerable grievance he has
                        "observed in many churches," to wit, "A disposition in Pastors to indulge in
                        politics." As a cure for this soul-cramping practice, this pious worshipper
                        suggests "that the true friends of the Christian faith should at once rise
                        from their seats and leave the church to those who favor such proceedings."
                        What particular item of politics is thus made to infringe on the sanctified
                        taste of the complainant, does not appear, but we presume some "high minded"
                        or perhaps humble minded minister has attempted to palm off for bona fide scripture, such passages as "God has made
                        of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their
                        habitation." "If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,
                        ye do well; but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit
                            sin, and are convinced of the laws as transgressors." "As ye
                        would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law
                        and the prophets." In response, we present to the suggestion of this devotee
                        of the true faith once delivered to the Saints by those who preached the
                        "divine origin of slavery," there will be a terrible exodus from the church
                        some of these days. We beg to suggest to this afflicted brother the
                        propriety of getting Andy Johnson or Frank Winger to issue a proclamation to
                        the faithful. Not to dictate, it might be couched in something like the
                        following terms:</p>
                    <p>WHEREAS, Slavery and Democracy after having harmoniously walked together in
                        regulating church and State in the days of our fathers, and under the
                        circumstances then existing, it was altogether fitting that the christians
                        should be regularly edified with the scriptural teaching that the nigger descended from and bore the curse of Canaan;
                        that Slavery was a divine institution, and that "servants should obey their
                        masters in all things;" but</p>
                    <p>Whereas, Caesar has given to the nigger his
                        freedom, and claims to regulate his status as a
                        freeman, it has become necessary that the Democracy should find a new ally,
                        and as infidelity has long contended that God did not "make of one blood,
                        all nations of men," it has been deemed right and proper by the Democracy to
                        seek its aid, and therefore, we have discarded the idea that the nigger
                        descended from either Ham, Noah or Adam, but is a distinct creation, has
                        been sent into the world to torment the Democracy; and</p>
                    <p>Whereas, Having given up the use of all scriptural
                        passages which we once relied on, and having, in defence to our new ally,
                        desired the unity of the human race, it is deemed highly offensive in
                        ministers to remind us of any relationship we sustain toward all men.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I, A. J., or F. W., (as the case may be) do proclaim it to be the
                        duty of conscientious Democrats to leave and withdraw from any church in
                        which by word or deed any such relationship to "all
                        men" is acknowledged, or is sought to be sustained by any scriptures
                        as aforesaid.</p>
                    <p>W.</p>
