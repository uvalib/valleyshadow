<b>Andrew Johnson and Mr. Stanton</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Asserting that no man did more than Edwin Stanton to "crush" the rebellion,
                    the editors lament the resignation of the Secretary of War, who was forced from
                    his position by President Johnson.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The stubborn patriotism of Secretary Stanton has become intolerable to the
                        miserable mischief maker, whom the dispensation of an inscrutable Providence
                        has suffered to humble and shame the American people. Therefore, President
                        Johnson has asked the Secretary to resign. A faithful minister is always
                        obnoxious to a corrupt ruler; and the presence of Edwin M. Stanton in the
                        cabinet is a constant protest against the treachery of the Administration.
                        He stands among his recreant colleagues, like a strong fortress in the
                        enemy's lines, the sole sympathiser with the loyal people, "amid the
                        faithless, faithful only found." With firm heart and unbending will he has
                        resisted their wicked purposes, and while he has not been able to keep the
                        Administration from the hands of the Davis-Black Democracy, he has
                        doubtlessly restrained it from still more audacious crime. Consequently, his
                        continuance in the War Office has become a source of chagrin and vexation to
                        the rebels and their copperhead allies, and of comfort and hope to the
                        law-loving and loyal. No man in the Union has been so much hated and feared
                        by traitors as Mr. Stanton. Called into the council of Mr. Buchanan, as
                        Attorney General, he, unlike his treacherous predecessor, found no
                        pettifogging pleas to obstruct a vigorous dealing with traitors, and his
                        patriotic fervor warmed into something of fidelity that weak and wavering
                        Executive. The esteem and confidence of the true men of the country were
                        given to him, at once. And when Mr. Lincoln found it advisable to change the
                        management of the War Department, his sagacity conformed to the popular
                        voice in inviting this approved public servant to his cabinet. The wisdom of
                        this selection was more than justified. From his first entrance upon public
                        life until the present hour, Sec'y Stanton has never lost the love and
                        admiration of the friends of the government, while he has grown more and
                        more dreaded by its enemies. He was the master spirit of the loyalists
                        during the rebellion. Without him, or such as he if such there were, the
                        issue of the struggle might have been sadly otherwise. No man, in or out of
                        the army, did more, we believe did so much, to crush the gigantic treason as
                        he. His marvellous executive ability brought innumerable forces into the
                        field, equipped and supplied them, and pressed them on to victory. Undaunted
                        by defeats brought upon us by incompetent Generals; undisturbed by the
                        croakings and evil forebodings of the half-hearted and false; he held up the
                        cause with Atlantean power, assured of final success. Through thickening
                        disasters, he stood calm and hopeful, and upon his strong arm the patriot
                        President leaned for support, in the days of darkness and terror. And when
                        Mr. Lincoln was assassinated, and the Secretary of State mutilated almost to
                        death--when the extent and purpose of the conspiracy were unknown, and
                        confusion and dismay seized men's minds, Mr. Stanton assumed the reigns of
                        government; with matchless vigor restored tranquility; and peacefully
                        installed his own and his people's enemy. Who can tell what had been the
                        consequence, had not his steady hand been at the helm, and his tearless eye
                        on the storm! Soon after Andrew Johnson came into power, he worked up the
                        plan of the betrayal of his party; and called about him the wretched
                        outcasts of the peace democracy. The seductions of patronage, and the wily
                        fascinations of the serpent tribe which sunned themselves at the White
                        House, misled from their fealty many prominent men of the Republican party
                        and the majority of the cabinet itself. The Secretary of War, though
                        formerly a Democrat, could not be swerved into a betrayal of his friends,
                        and knew too well the evil intents of the new advisers of the fallen
                        President, to fellowship with them. Failing to corrupt, they slandered him;
                        and the howl was raised from every disloyal creature in the land, to remove
                        him. Johnson was not bold enough to comply, although he employed every means
                        to force him to resign. The representative of the loyal masses in an
                        evil-minded cabinet, he felt it his duty to remain, and fight the people's
                        battles in the Administration. With great boldness and ability, he has
                        opposed the President's projects, and sustained the reconstruction policy of
                        Congress and the People. And now when the rebels insist upon the disgrace of
                        Sheridan, and the weak and wicked President hesitates to execute his wishes;
                        the Secretary declares for the soldier, and draws the war-whoop of his old
                        foes upon himself.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson asks him to resign. Mr. Stanton replies that the public interests
                        which prevailed upon him to accept the office, will prevail upon him to hold
                        it until the meeting of Congress. He is not disposed to yield his place to
                        another tool like Stanberry. By the terms of the tenure of office act, the
                        President has not the power to remove him; though no doubt a pliant Attorney
                        General, who has an extraordinary faculty of evading the letter and spirit
                        of law, will be ready with any opinion his master may need. Mr. Stanton is
                        not easily alarmed. He has an iron will and a lion heart, and will not quail
                        in duty. The position he occupies is exceedingly unpleasant. He is among his
                        bitterest personal enemies, and knows them to be plotting injury to the
                        peace and prosperity, the harmony and good name of his country. He abandoned
                        a lucrative profession, of which he had long stood at the head, to assume
                        the difficult duties of his bureau; he has labored, as no public functionary
                        of the country ever did labor, day and night, until his physical frame,
                        wonderfully robust as it was, gave way frequently from exhaustion. It was
                        his announced intention to resign his Secretaryship as soon as the rebellion
                        was subdued; but the turn the treachery of Mr. Johnson gave national affairs
                        induced him to forgo this cherished purpose. During his whole term of
                        office, Mr. Stanton was far above demagogism. He did absolutely nothing for
                        popularity's sake. He was too earnest to pause to consider what effect his
                        conduct would have upon his personal political fortunes. No man ever served
                        the people so well, and flattered them less. For years, he literally
                        sacrificed himself for the public interest, suffering, as though he heard
                        them not, all manner of reproaches and abuse. The Nation now acknowledges
                        gratefully her indebtedness to him and places him high on her roll of heroes
                        and statesmen. Her loyal sons ask him for one sacrifice more. They implore
                        him to disregard the delicacy of his situation to resist the promptings of
                        his nature which would force him to withdraw from an association with
                        after-the-battle rebels. His holding his position under present
                        circumstances is embarrassing to his gentlemanly instincts. But we think he
                        owes it to Congress and the People, whose confidence he enjoys and whose
                        exponent he is, not to abandon his post. It is the expressed wish of
                        Congress that he should remain on duty, independent of the President, and it
                        is the earnest petition of the people. We have confidence in his firmness
                        and rejoice in the belief that he will allow the public interests which
                        prevailed upon him to accept his position to prevail upon him to retain it,
                        at least until Congress meet.</p>

                    <p>A ROW.--We are compelled this week to chronicle another disgraceful row
                        between some drunken white men and negroes. On Saturday night last, between
                        eleven and twelve o'clock, a difficulty occurred between three white men (or
                        rather boys) and some negroes, at the corner of Main and German streets, in
                        which stones were freely used, but luckily no one injured. The white forces
                        made three attacks on the camp of the darkies, but were each time repulsed
                        and forced to retreat. After the second attack the whites retired, but
                        meeting reinforcements again returned to the conflict. On arriving at the
                        corner of Main and German, and finding no enemy, they made a gallant charge
                        down the latter street, but did not go far before they were met by such a
                        volley of stones as compelled a hasty retreat down Main street, the colored
                        forces following to the German Reformed church, a spirited fire being kept
                        up on both sides. The whites finding themselves outnumbered, and no doubt
                        thinking discretion the better part of valor, then withdrew from the
                        contest, leaving the field in the possession of the colored forces. We do
                        not know how the affair commenced, or who is in fault, but we think it is
                        time scenes of this character were taken in hand by the borough authorities,
                        and an example made of a few of the rioters. This is the third row we have
                        had recently between drunken white men and negroes, and if they are
                        permitted to pass unnoticed, there is no telling where they may end.
                        Throwing of stones indiscriminately in thickly populated portions of the
                        town, not only endangers the lives of those engaged, but also the lives of
                        innocent persons. The lateness of the hour alone, no doubt, prevented the
                        injury of citizens residing near the scene of operations of Saturday night,
                        as the houses on the east side of Main street show many marks of the
                        conflict.</p>
