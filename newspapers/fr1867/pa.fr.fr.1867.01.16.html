<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In light of the "appalling debauchery" that surrounded the selection of the
                    U. S. Senator, the editors refrain from criticizing Col. Stumbaugh, their

                    largely expected. The same, however, does not hold true for Senators McConaughy
                    and Worthington, both of whom deserve to be severely rebuked for ignoring the
                    instructions of their constituents, who overwhelmingly endorsed Gov. Curtin for

                    <p>Editorial Correspondence of the Franklin Repository.<br> Harrisburg, January
                        11, 1867.</p>
                    <p>All efforts to avert the blistering dishonor of the election of Simon Cameron
                        to the first legislative tribunal of the nation have proved utterly futile.
                        The people believed that they had precluded the possibility of such a
                        result, for in no single Senatorial or Representative district in the State
                        does a majority of the Republicans desire his election. On the contrary,
                        nineteen-twentieths of the faithful men who have by noble, patriotic effort
                        given victory to our cause, are earnestly, implacably opposed to him, and
                        demand the election of a tried and trusted statesman to the responsible
                        position of Senator.</p>
                    <p>That the action of the caucus will startle and appall the Republicans of
                        Pennsylvania I cannot question. But few of the overwhelming majority who
                        desired a different choice believed such monstrous perfidy on the part of
                        their legislators within the range of their action. Even the leading men who
                        entered the contest as a forlorn hope with an earnestness worthy of their
                        cause, reposed in fancied safety until it was too late; and many of them,
                        but a few weeks ago, censured me as an alarmist because I raised an humble
                        voice of warning to the people.</p>
                    <p>Knowing as I did, before the late election, that Cameron had debauched both
                        our immediate Representative and our Senator, that he had wrung from our
                        legislative candidate in Perry a written pledge to support him under the
                        threat of defeat, and that he had contracted for a Senator and two
                        Representatives in the adjoining Bedford district in the nominating
                        conference, I could not doubt that elsewhere, as here, he had corrupted the
                        delegated powers while the people rested in confident security. I still
                        hoped, however, that a wrong so unexampled and exceptionless could not be
                        consummated, and I committed the natural error of bowing in silence, rather
                        than peril harmony and success in a struggle involving the most important
                        officers who were to be charged with the safety of our nationality.</p>
                    <p>Had the voices of Stevens, and Forney, and Grow, and their friends, rung out
                        boldly a month ago, as they did yesterday, the Commonwealth would have been
                        spared this indelible blot upon its fame; but all hoped for the crown when
                        the usurper should fall, and feared that he might wound his assailants
                        mortally in the violent throes of his death.</p>
                    <p>Why Simon Cameron was chosen, I need not repeat.
                        The story is familiar to all, even in the humblest and remotest homes of the
                        State. If written in flaming characters on the dome of the capitol, or
                        branded ineffaceably upon the brows of the men who did it, no one would have
                        to learn thereby how the richest jewel of loyal victory had been basely
                        bartered for a price.</p>
                    <p>I have been one of the multitude of witnesses who encompassed this unequal
                        struggle. I did not err in estimating how the legislature was instructed and
                        voluntarily pledged to vote for Senator. More than enough were so
                        chosen--not by trickery, but by the spontaneous expressions of those whose
                        votes were sought--to have made Gov. Curtin the nominee for Senator on the
                        first ballot; and of the residue, not one-half--hardly one in five, dared to
                        avow to their constituents before the election that they would vote as they
                        did last night.</p>
                    <p>When the members had got safely beyond the power of the people by their
                        election, every appliance was made to bear upon them that ingenuity could
                        devise. There were offices for the ambitious, plunder for the venal, and
                        promises for fools. Many came here still strong in their integrity and
                        mindful of their noble people who had confided in them, but I saw them
                        wither and fall like the blighted leaves of autumn; and fall, like one of
                        old, to rise no more. Thus did the harvest of corruption go on until the
                        garners of the master were full.</p>
                    <p>The informal meeting yesterday of those who desired to save the Republican
                        organization from suicide, showed sufficient strength to defeat the power of
                        a subsidized caucus, had not the same influence demoralized the Democratic
                        members. Their nomination of Cowan was but a notice to all that a sufficient
                        number from that side were ready for delivery whenever wanted to consummate
                        the election of Cameron. The fact that to have refused to recognize a caucus
                        because it was improperly controlled, would have been fruitless, made many
                        men unwilling to make a failure in opposition to what had the form of a
                        regular nomination, and men sullenly bowed to conscious wrong. Had it been
                        possible to unite sufficient strength on Mr. Stevens, or Mr. Grow or any
                        other gifted and upright statesman, there would have been a cheerful
                        sacrifice of all personal preferences; but to all such propositions there
                        was no response from those who had resolved upon perfidy. It was otherwise
                        denominated in their bond.</p>
                    <p>To me this result brings no personal disappointment, and calls for no
                        personal resentment. Of Mr. Cameron, I have no reason for personal
                        complaint. That I believe him unfitted, alike in integrity and capacity, for
                        high official trust, is shown by twenty years of earnest resistance to his
                        boundless political pretensions. If I had sought preferment or profit, I
                        would have accepted the repeated invitations to become his partizan. Since
                        the organization of the Republican party, I have labored and sacrificed for
                        its success to the fullest extent of my humble ability and means, and its
                        honors and emoluments I have freely accorded to others. It has had the
                        highest and holiest mission ever committed to any political body of men, and
                        I have steadily looked above the strife for individual advancement to the
                        banner that told the sad story of my country's woes and appealed to
                        patriotism to rescue the New World from man's crowning inhumanity to man, I
                        therefore turn from this success of unmingled wrong in sorrow--now for the
                        noble men who have fallen wounded in the circle of their friends, but for
                        the fate I fear it must irrevocably decree for the Republican organization.
                        How it is to survive such a wanton slaughter of its proudest attributes, I
                        have not the faith to comprehend. It may hurl the polluting parasites from
                        its throne and thus maintain its ascendency to the full fruition of its
                        great work, but it must enter future struggles with its colors stained and
                        its integrity questioned. I go from its gaping wounds, inflicted by unworthy
                        ambition and unbridled venality, to do battle for its vital principles as
                        before, but not for its betrayers, or those who would follow in their
                        footsteps. While the timid, the time-serving, and the unprincipled will
                        cringe that thrift may follow fawning, let it be known of me that I was not
                        of the victors in this blotted triumph, and that in and about the very
                        temple of power, I shall dare to be just, alike to the faithful and to the
                        faithless, for Freedom's cause. Cogi qui potest, nescit
                            mori. A.K.M.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Republican legislative caucus met on Thursday evening last to nominate a
                        candidate for U. S. Senator. The result was clearly concluded before the
                        meeting as it was manifest that Mr. Cameron had secured the control of a
                        majority of the members. As it was an adjourned meeting of the joint caucus
                        that nominated a candidate for Treasurer the week before, Speaker Hall, of
                        the Senate, presided, and Speaker Glass, of the House, acted as Secretary. A
                        motion was made by Senator Bigham to adjourn until Monday afternoon in order
                        to give time to investigate the charges of corruption which prevailed, but
                        it was voted down by the decided vote of 53 to 29, which was about a true
                        test of the opposition to Cameron in the caucus. Senator Fisher, of
                        Lancaster, refused to go into caucus and his vote is not recorded. He was
                        the only absent member. When the caucus refused to adjourn, Senator
                        Billingfelt, of Lancaster, retired and joined Senator Fisher in refusing to
                        participate in the nomination. A ballot was then had with the following
                        result:</p>

                        Grow. . .4</p>
                    <p>In the list of votes for Cameron will be seen the votes of Senator McConaughy
                        and Representatives Stumbaugh and Shuman, all of whom have thereby offered
                        the keenest insult to their constituents, and with them are eighteen others,
                        whose names are given in italics, all of whom were
                            either solemnly pledged to, or instructed by, their constituents to vote
                            for Gov. Curtin. These twenty-one votes added to the twenty-three
                        votes received by Gov. Curtin would have given him forty-four on first ballot, two more than enough to have
                        nominated him. In addition to that number, Senators Bingham, Billingfelt,
                        Browne (of Lawrence) and Fisher, and Representatives McPherrin, Richards,
                        Webb and Wilson--eight in all who voted Stevens or Grow--would have voted
                        for Curtin as between Curtin and Cameron. If therefore, those who were
                        instructed or pledged for Gov. Curtin had not basely betrayed him and their
                        constituents, he would have commanded fifty-two
                        votes against Cameron in the joint caucus. Why he
                        did not receive that vote, is well known to the people, and to them the
                        mercenary puppets, who have bartered their votes and the richest laurel of
                        Republican victory for a price, must render their account.</p>

                    <p>Wilkinsburg, Pa. January 10, 1867.</p>
                    <p>In the last number of the St. Cloud (Minn)
                        Journal, the paper I had the good fortune to establish on the
                        frontier, is a letter on a subject which ought to be of universal interest,
                        and I make no apology for a long extract:</p>
                    <p>"Next morning early we raised anchor and steamed on through a small lake, or
                        rather rice field, to the mouth of Warren's Brook, where we detached a barge
                        brought with us for transporting the goods and provisions for the Indians up
                        this brook a distance of about three miles into and across a small lake,
                        well on our way to Red Lake. In this however we were doomed to
                        disappointment, as in almost everything else connected with transportation
                        on this trip. The freight being all transferred from the steamboat to the
                        barge and a tow line fastened to each side, all of our party, except the
                        clergy, who were left to guard the boat, as well as the entire boat's crew,
                        went to work with a will--some at the tow lines, others with polls prying
                        and pushing. About this time, on a pleasant, clear, shiny Sunday morning
                        might be seen your correspondent with tow line over his shoulder, tugging
                        along slowly but faithfully over unfrozen marsh with about twelve inches of
                        snow covering its uncertain surface; and like the rest, sometimes down and
                        sometimes up, until the perspiration rolled down into his boots; but all to
                        no purpose, for at about noon, after almost superhuman efforts to navigate
                        this more than tortuous stream, we came to a dead lock. It was impossible to
                        go any further unless we could throw the boat out upon the land and turn her
                        bow into the stream again, like turning a plow at the end of a furrow. On
                        looking back, we found that we had come about a quarter of a mile in a
                        straight line, and about two miles by the channel.</p>
                    <p>"In this dilemma it was decided to send four men around to where we had
                        intended to run the barge, with axes to blaze a road across the portage and
                        ascertain the practicability for transportation overland in the direction of
                        Cass Lake. The balance of the men towed the barge to the mouth of the brook,
                        lashed it again to the steamer, and returned to this place, unloading all
                        the freight upon the beach. By this time the road viewers came in and
                        reported the distance across the portage to be about a mile, and the
                        possibility of crossing with teams. The empty barge was then sent around
                        through the brook to the other side of the portage to be in readiness for
                        use should the teams reach there with the freight. Major Clarke returned
                        with the steamboat that night to give directions for bringing over the teams
                        sent by contractors, Burband Bros., to carry the annuity goods and
                        provisions to Red Lake, to meet us at this place and make some other
                        necessary arrangements and return the next morning. He also detailed a
                        certain number of our party to start early in the morning to cut out a wagon
                        road across the portage on the route selected. We pitched our large tent
                        near the goods, and closed the day in an appropriate manner by holding
                        divine service under the administration of the Revs. Knickerbacker and
                        Stewart.</p>
                    <p>"On Monday morning the men selected to open the road left early to perform
                        their duties, which being accomplished they came in towards evening.</p>
                    <p>"Nothing of interest occurred in camp during the day, all waiting anxiously
                        for the return of the steamer, which was delayed by an accident. After
                        shipping six yoke of cattle with the wagons on another barge, and a team of
                        horses with additional supplies on the boat, Major Clarke left the fort
                        early on Tuesday morning with the barge lashed to the boat, to returned to
                        this place. All went well until within about four miles of camp, when they
                        encountered some thin ice formed the night previous, which cut through the
                        hull of the barge, causing it to sink almost instantly, leaving the oxen
                        yoked together and mixed up with the wagons in dangerous confusion in the
                        lake. Through the utmost exertions of all on board, the cattle were
                        extricated and soon swam to shore; the wagons taken on board the steamer;
                        and the barge raised and towed to shore and made secure; when leaving two
                        men to drive the cattle round by land, the boat arrived at the landing about
                        dark, much to the satisfaction of all. The boat returned to the fort the
                        same night. I may remark as a somewhat singular fact, that on the lakes and
                        rivers, in this far northern latitude this steamboat performed her regular
                        trips of thirty miles up to the fifteenth day of November."</p>
                    <p>This letter is dated "Mitchell's Landing, Head of Leech Lake River," and was
                        written by one of President Johnson's dismissed Postmasters. Leech Lake
                        River is a tributary of the Mississippi, and empties into it about two
                        hundred miles above the Falls of St. Anthony. The Mississippi is navigable
                        from these falls to St. Cloud, where it is broken by Sank Rapids. From these
                        Rapids is a navigable stretch of about fifty miles, to Little Falls, and
                        above these, of two hundred and fifty, to the Falls of Pokegeny. The steamer
                        here spoken of piles above Little Falls, and none can get down to anything
                        below two thousand feet above the level of the Gulf of Mexico. Their
                        principle business must be to take care of Indians. The ex-Postmaster, who
                        is assisting in this good work, is a short, stout man, gray haired, easily
                        put out of breath and temper, and exceedingly fastidious about such matters
                        as the polish of his boots, fit of his gloves, &amp;c. In 1862, as
                        Commissary General of State troops, he was very busy drawing, transporting
                        and giving out muskets, cartridges, &amp;c., to shoot the people he is
                        now wading the swamp, with a tow line over his shoulders, to feed and clothe
                        and make comfortable for the winter. Then he slept in his dismantled house,
                        after his wife and children had been sent to a place of safety, and nightly
                        expected the war whoop and scalping knife of the warriors who lurked in the
                        surrounding woods, murdering stray passengers, and only withheld from a
                        general attack by the preparations made to repel it. Now they are lying in
                        their wigwams playing "Poker," and waiting for him to haul up their winter's
                        supply of pork and flour. The provisions represent the justice of the "white
                        chief" at Washington, who has supplied "the noble sons of the forest" in a
                        desultory sort of way with guns, ammunition, scalping-knives, blankets,
                        beads, bread and pork, for a long series of years.</p>
                    <p>Of course the cargo reached its destination in good times, or the assembled
                        braves, tired of playing Poker, and burning with a sense of wrong, would
                        have sought redress by baking as many white babies as they could find, in
                        cook stoves, ham-stringing their mothers and burning the houses. But no!
                        They know that the white warriors are at home, and "their natural sense of
                        justice" would not have led to such vigorous measures, but would have
                        resorted to a war upon the fish of the lake and the bears of the forest for
                        a supply of food. This account of the mode of carrying bread to the hungry,
                        presents such a vivid picture of the sin and folly of our Indian policy,
                        that I would God every American would carefully consider it.</p>
                    <p>The country over which these commissioners are dragging flour and pork and
                        beans, is capable of raising forty bushels of wheat to the acre, one hundred
                        bushels of corn, potatoes, of a quality so superior that one who has only
                        eaten such as grow in this latitude can have no idea of; and in quantities
                        surpassing belief. Of other ordinary root crops, beets, parsnips,
                        &amp;c., the ground will yield about four inches deep of the surface
                        measure, and much sweeter and more tender than those grown in more Southern
                        latitudes. Pennsylvania State Fairs, show no finer melons, pumpkins or
                        squashes. The woods and thickets team with all manner of wild fruits, which
                        grow in this State, and the marshes with cranberries. The numerous lakes and
                        streams abound with Pike, Pickerel and Bass, some so large that it requires
                        a strong man to throw them out, when caught with hook and line, while the
                        prairies wave with grasses which produce the best beef, mutton and venison
                        grown on this continent. The men who live on this soil are stalwart fellows,
                        stout of limb and strong of arm. They play Poker, and massacre women and
                        children, while the United States Government sends them provisions, at a
                        cost of transportation and delivery, over fifty times the original purchase
                        money!</p>
                    <p>The cargo spoken of in the above letter was going to the Red Lake Chippewas,
                        and would have to be portaged across the water shed which divides the waters
                        of the Mississippi from those of the Red River of the North. The treaty
                        which calls for their delivery was made since the Sioux massacre. A
                        Congressional commission was on its way to make that treaty, when the
                        Siouxes broke out, and the commissioners were obliged to return, as that
                        belt of the country lying between the Miss. and Red Rivers was so overrun by
                        the savages, that every white inhabitant was murdered or driven out, and it
                        was six weeks before a sufficient force of troops could be mustered to go
                        across it to the relief of Fort Abercrombie. These Red Lakers say they were
                        good Indians all the time; but it was hard to learn where all the bad
                        Indians came from, who cut off all communication on every side and invested
                        the Fort, night and day, keeping the garrison so constantly harassed, that
                        the women, in addition to making cartridges, sometimes relieved guard.</p>
                    <p>It would be useless to recall these scenes except as a warning. Experience
                        ought to teach wisdom; and as our Government has been "carrying coal to New
                        Castle," and systematically fostering the Indian's contempt for labor,
                        during all her past dealings with them, and the result has been most
                        disastrous, is it not time the policy should be changed?</p>
                    <p>"The wrongs of the Indian" are a standing subject with a large class of
                        sensible people, as well as with sentimental philanthropists who require
                        some distant object on which to exercise their benevolence; but they
                        overlook the starting point of some of these wrongs which is the
                        acknowledgement of a right to monopolize the land. The North did the South
                        an irreparable wrong in acknowledging her claim to a monopoly of labor. The
                        slaveholders, whom we attempted to secure in their claim to the labor of the
                        slave were more deeply wronged than the slaves; for, there is no way in
                        which one can so effectually injure a man as to aid him in doing wrong to
                        another. If the Indians had retained all the land of this continent,
                        according to their original claim, how many millions must have perished of
                        want, and by groundless wars, in Europe? Does any one doubt that God
                        intended this land to be cultivated, and as a home for the millions crowded
                        out of this world? Does any one doubt that he made the earth for the use of
                        the people he made to live in it, or believe it is his will that one man, or
                        class of men, should hold one hundred times as much as is required for his
                        or their support, while ninety-nine are, in consequence, deprived of homes?</p>
                    <p>The entire system of our government is based upon the idea that an English
                        nobleman has no right to hold thousands of acres, as a deer-park to descend
                        to his heirs forever, while thousands of Englishmen are thereby deprived of
                        the right to own even the smallest homestead. Why, then, should an Indian
                        nobleman hold, in perpetuity, his thousands of acres of deer park while the
                        laboring white man starves in city garrets, denied the right of a home? But,
                        if the claim of the Indian is founded in national justice this is the
                        position of affairs, and we are all living by his sufferance. The truth is
                        that Indians have just as much right to life, liberty, land and the pursuit
                        of happiness as white men have; and not any more. As the government has
                        decided that one hundred and sixty acres is a proper allowance for the home
                        of a white family, why is that not enough for an Indian family?</p>
                    <p>No justice can be secured to the Indian until the system of treaty making is
                        abandoned, until we cease to recognize foreign nations in our midst, cover
                        their outrages under their right to make war, and furnish them causes, in
                        the frauds necessarily growing out of the false relations we have
                        established. There is no use to talk of cultivating peace by sending honest
                        men to carry out our treaty stipulations. There are not enough honest men in
                        the land to attend to the Indian Department of the government, and if there
                        were they could not all be spared for that business. The treaties themselves
                        are all wrong, not only because they acknowledge foreign powers in our
                        midst, communities who are not subject to our laws, but because they offer a
                        premium for idleness, and its attendant crimes. These annuities are the
                        strongest inducements to vagabondism which our government could offer; and,
                        as the tree is known by its fruits, the condition of the treaty Indians is
                        its most emphatic condemnation.</p>
                    <p>If it is best to buy instead of take the land, it should be paid for at once, so
                        that they may feel the responsibility of their own future support. They
                        should be fully incorporated into our government as members of the family,
                        individually, each and all being held accountable to and protected by our
                        laws. Their right to homesteads should be held sacred, or even especially
                        guarded by laws forbidding their transfer, and they should be encouraged to
                        remain on the land they now occupy, or, if they emigrate, to come eastward.
                        Thus, instead of being confirmed in their savage habits, and picking up the
                        border vices of civilization, they would gradually grow into valuable
                        citizenship, and become a blessing instead of a terror and a spreading
                        plague of moral pollution. It would be well for Pennsylvania if every Indian
                        who ever had a home on her soil had remained, left his bones under her
                        sward, and his descendants on its surface to this day. There has always been
                        plenty of room, and the driving out of the Indians, before the march of
                        civilization, is an outrage which cries to heaven. England incorporated the
                        Indians of her American possessions with her white subjects, and stretches
                        the aegis of her laws over them, and they are useful laborers, obedient to
                        those laws, and rapidly advancing in civilization. During all the massacres
                        in Minnesota the English subjects, in Selkirk Settlement, dwelt in peace,
                        amid an overwhelming number of Indians. Why? Simply because those Indians
                        had not been taught to consider themselves independent of the government,
                        and entitled to life without labor. If an Indian commits murder, in the
                        British dominions, he gets hanged, just like a white man. If he steals he is
                        imprisoned, if he does not work he starves, according to the divine law,
                        which says, "He that will not work, neither shall he eat." Let our
                        government throw her Indian Bureau into the Potomac, put a washstand in its
                        place, and have done with class legislation, establish a system of equal
                        laws, pay cash for the land she purchases or stop buying; and she need no
                        longer draw rations in boats across marshes, by manpower, to feed sturdy
                        beggars, cultivate idleness and crime, and bring her credit and authority
                        into contempt, so that the most enterprising class of her citizens are
                        murdered by the thousand, with impunity, and her tax payers robbed of money
                        by the millions. There never can be an end to the frauds of the Indian
                        Bureau until that ancient piece of lumber is floated out to sea and sunk.
                        The temptations are certainly irresistible, by men of ordinary integrity,
                        and if there were no frauds, but that of taxing the industrious to feed the
                        idle, of giving a premium for vagabondism by leaving those who would work
                        without protection against those who will steal, the whole system would be a
                        disgrace to any half civilized country.<br> JANE G. SWISSHELM.</p>
