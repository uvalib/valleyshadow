<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Tension continues to mount in Maryland where the legislature's actions have
                    provoked considerable outrage among the state's residents. Their chief concern
                    is that the body will call for a new convention to repeal all the constraints
                    and suffrage restrictions placed upon the men "who aided the rebel cause either
                    in Lee's army or at home."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Rumors are swirling in Washington that the Republicans and the President
                    have reached an accord on a new Reconstruction policy. The editors contend that
                    these efforts are "futile," however, since the "unrepentant rebels of the South"
                    seem disinclined to accept any legitimate offers, as judged by their rejection
                    of the constitutional amendments.<br>

<b>Constitutional Reform</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Although they differ on the exact measures necessary to achieve the goal,
                    Republican journals throughout the state have voiced their unanimous support
                    behind the proposal advanced by the Repository to revamp the legislative system.
                    "The question of impartial suffrage is manifestly coming upon us," say the
                    editors, and it "cannot be postponed indefinitely."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The response of the leading journals of the State, of both political parties,
                        and of all shades of affinity in the Republican organization, to the
                        proposition of this journal for a fundamental reform in our system of
                        legislation, presents a degree of earnest unanimity never before manifested
                        on any question of State policy. While a few journals have made valuable
                        suggestions as to details, with a single exception, (the York Republican) as far as we have noticed the
                        expressions of the press, all favor the general principles proposed and ask
                        of the legislature that the issue of a convention be submitted to the people
                        for their decision. The York Republican,
                        unquestionably a sincere advocate of reform, still lingers around the hope
                        that the remedy is in more careful legislative nominations, but it is
                        forgetful of the fact that its remedy has been tried time and again and
                        signally failed. In times past the people have revolted at the acts of their
                        servants, and elected reform candidates only to find them more venal, if
                        possible, than their discarded predecessors.</p>
                    <p>However leading journals differ in the details of the necessary reform
                        measures, all assent to the proposition that increase of numbers must
                        elevate the integrity of our legislators. This policy is not new or untried.
                        Maine with hardly one-fifth of our population, has 141 members in the
                        popular branch of the legislature; Connecticut with but one-sixth of our
                        population, has 236 members; New Hampshire with scarcely one-eighth our
                        population has 326 members; Rhode Island with less than one-twelfth our
                        population has 72 members; Massachusetts with less than one-half our
                        population has 240 members, and Vermont, with about one-eighth our
                        population has 237 members. If our House of Representatives was based on the
                        ratio of Connecticut, we would have 1500 members; if based on the ratio of
                        New Hampshire, our House would contain over 2500 members, or if based on the
                        ratio of Massachusetts, we would have over 600 members. In all these States,
                        where the popular branches contain large numbers, we have no record of
                        venality in their history, while in the list of smaller bodies there is
                        scarcely an exception. Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Nevada now have
                        legislative committees of investigation inquiring into their own
                        corruptions; New Jersey has just transferred one of her legislators from the
                        House to the penitentiary, and New York has become as notorious as
                        Pennsylvania as being the victim of the lobby.</p>
                    <p>We are prepared for every possible sort of unfair and unmanly resistance to
                        this proposed reform. The devotees of the lobby will invent all manner of
                        perplexing questions to intimidate sincere men from demanding a convention;
                        but all such suggestions should be accepted as coming from those who would
                        perpetuate the sway of corruption in the enactment of our laws. Already we
                        have seen it intimated that a convention would at once bring up the issue of
                        manhood suffrage. Perhaps it would--indeed, we think it certainly would; but
                        let it come. It will come, and we shall [illeg]
                        and on the order of its coming. If it will not present itself to strike
                        terror in the ranks of the Democracy, and startle to confusion the sickly
                        conservatives, in one way, it will in another way, and they who would dodge
                        it are more cowardly than wise. The true way is to meet that issue, as well
                        as all other issues the people may be likely to agitate in amending their
                        constitution, boldly and manfully, and let them be decided. The question of
                        impartial suffrage is manifestly coming upon us. It cannot be postponed
                        indefinitely. It may or may not be adopted; but it cannot be denied the
                        trial, and the sooner political managers of all parties appreciate the fact
                        the better. If proposed by the tedious process of the legislature, it may
                        fall or succeed as some other overshadowing question sweeps the political
                        field; but if presented by a convention, as a distinct and separate
                        proposition, so that no vital question of reform would be endangered by the
                        suffrage amendment, the issue would be definitely determined in our State.
                        We are not clear that a majority of the people of Pennsylvania wish
                        impartial suffrage, but certainly enough believe it to be right to warrant
                        the submission of the proposition fairly to the vote of the State for
                        decision. Let the drivelers and the corruptionists understand that the chief
                        danger to the Republican party now is an unmanly evasion of the question of
                        impartial suffrage, for such is the truth. It can be met by a convention
                        without peril--it cannot be smothered and dodged without disaster.</p>
                    <p>That the unbiased sentiment of the People is overwhelmingly in favor of a
                        radical reform, will not be doubted by any rational and honest observer; and
                        it is merely a question whether this legislature
                        will grant it or whether others will be chosen to
                        the next legislature to propose a convention. That it will be distasteful to
                        a majority of the present legislature to propose to the people a remedy for
                        their own infidelity, seems natural enough, and it can be had this session
                        only by the earnest, imperative demand of a faithful press and an outraged
                        people. It may thus be secured, and the culmination of evil made to bear the
                        fruits of integrity; but we warn the people and the press that it will
                        require ceaseless vigilance and tireless effort to accomplish it. If done at
                        all now, it should be done speedily. The people should vote on the question
                        of a convention in June next, so that, if called, delegates would be elected
                        next October, and the year 1868 would be thenceforth memorable in our
                        history as ending the supremacy of corruption in the channels of political
                        power in Pennsylvania.</p>

<b>Burning of Chambersburg</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In spite of Gen. Early's assertion in his account of the burning of
                    Chambersburg that he is to blame for what transpired there because he issued the
                    initial attack order, the editors maintain that Gen. McCausland "is alone
                    responsible" for the "barbarous, brutal wholesale manner in which the order was
                    executed."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The rebel Gen. Jubal A. Early has published a small work purporting to give
                        an account of his Valley campaigns, and in it he gives his explanation of
                        the burning of Chambersburg. When it is considered that Gen. Early has
                        preferred perpetual exile to submission to the government, and that Gen.
                        McCausland has filed an application for a pardon to enable him to return,
                        the statement of Early that he alone is responsible for the burning of
                        Chambersburg may be properly appreciated. The order of Early directed the
                        burning of a portion of Chambersburg to retaliate
                        for some six houses specified as having been burnt by Hunter, and it did not
                        direct the indiscriminate burning and plundering of the town. For the
                        barbarous, brutal wholesale manner in which the order was executed, Gen.
                        McCausland is alone responsible. With this explanation we give Gen. Early's
                        statement relative to the affair. He says:</p>
                    <p>While at Martinsburg it was ascertained beyond all doubt that Hunter had been
                        again indulging in his favorite mode of warfare, and after his return to the
                        Valley, while we were near Washington, among other outrages, the private
                        residences of Mr. Hunter, a member of the Virginia Senate, Mr. Alexander R.
                        Boteler, an ex-member of the Confederate as well as of the United States
                        Congress, and Edmund L. Lee, a distant relative of Gen. Lee, all in
                        Jefferson county, with their contents, had been burned by his orders, only
                        time enough being given for the ladies to get out of the houses.</p>
                    <p>A number of towns in the South, as well as private country houses, had been
                        burned by the Federal troops, and the accounts had been heralded forth in
                        some of the Northern papers in terms of exultation, and gloated over by
                        their readers, while they were received by others with apathy. I now came to
                        the conclusion that we had stood this mode of warfare long enough, and that
                        it was time to open the eyes of the people of the North to its enormity by
                        an example in the way of retaliation.</p>
                    <p>I did not select the cases mentioned as having more merit or greater claims
                        for retaliation than others, but because they had occurred within the limits
                        of the country covered by my command, and were brought more immediately to
                        my attention. I had often seen delicate ladies, who had been plundered,
                        insulted, and rendered desolate by the acts of our most atrocious enemies,
                        and while they did not call for it, yet in the anguished expression of their
                        features while narrating their misfortunes, there was a mute appeal to every
                        manly sentiment of my bosom for retribution, which I could no longer
                        withstand.</p>
                    <p>The town of Chambersburg, in Pennsylvania, was selected as the one on which
                        retaliation should be made, and M'Causland was ordered to proceed with his
                        brigade, and that of Johnson and a battery of artillery, to that place, and
                        demand of the municipal authorities the sum of $100,000 in gold, or $500,000
                        in United States currency, as a compensation for the destruction of the
                        houses named and their contents; and, in default of payment, to lay the town
                        in ashes, in retaliation for the burning of those houses and others in
                        Virginia, as well as for the towns which had been burned in the other
                        Southern States. A written demand to that effect was sent to the municipal
                        authorities, and they were informed what would be the result of a failure or
                        refusal to comply with it.</p>
                    <p>I desired to give the people of Chambersburg an opportunity of saving their
                        town by making compensation for part of the injury done, and hoped that the
                        payment of such a sum would have the desired effect, and open the eyes of
                        the people of other towns at the North to the necessity of urging upon their
                        Government the adoption of a different policy. M'Causland was also directed
                        to proceed from Chambersburg toward Cumberland in Maryland, and levy
                        contributions in money upon that and other towns able to bear them, and if
                        possible to destroy the machinery at the coal pits near Cumberland, and
                        machine-shops, depots and bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as far
                        as practicable.</p>
                    <p>On the 20th of July, M'Causland crossed the Potomac near Clear Spring, above
                        Williamsport, and I moved with Rhode's and Ramsear's divisions and Vaughn's
                        cavalry to the latter place, while Imboden demonstrated with his and
                        Jackson's cavalry toward Harper's Ferry, in order to withdraw attention from
                        M'Causland. Breckinridge remained at Martinsburg and continued the
                        destruction of the railroad. Vaughn drove a force of cavalry from
                        Williamsport, and went into Hagerstown, where he captured and destroyed a
                        train of cars loaded with supplies. One of Rodes' brigades was crossed over
                        at Williamsport, and subsequently withdrawn. On the 30th, M'Causland being
                        well under way, moved back to Martinsburg, and on the 31st the whole
                        infantry force was moved to Bunker Hill, where we remained on the 1st, 2d,
                        and 3d of August.</p>
                    <p>On the 3d of August M'Causland reached Chambersburg, and made the demand as
                        directed, reading to such authorities as presented themselves, the paper
                        sent by me. The demand was not complied with, the people stating that they
                        were not afraid of having their town burned, and that a Federal force was
                        approaching. The policy pursued by our army on former occasions had been so
                        lenient that they did not suppose the threat was in earnest this time, and
                        they hoped for speedy relief.</p>
                    <p>M'Causland, however, proceeded to carry out his orders, and the greater part
                        of the town was laid in ashes. For this act I alone am responsible, as the
                        officers engaged in it were simply executing my orders, and had no
