<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Across the country, and even in the states lately in rebellion, assert the
                    editors, there is growing public sentiment in favor of granting blacks the right
                    to vote. The lone exception to this shift in sentiment is among Northern
                    Democrats whose blind devotion to slavery and fear of economic competition with
                    blacks in postbellum society has stifled their ability to move on and join the
                    rest of the world in welcoming the dawn of a new era in American history.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Like the Bourbons of France, the Democracy of the North learn nothing and
                        forget nothing. They triumphed for years by blind devotion to Slavery, and
                        schooled themselves and their children to hatred of the African, and fears
                        of his successful competition with them in the race for social and political
                        honors. They even bowed down to the demands of the slave power when it
                        pronounced the Union a mere loose association that could be broken at will,
                        and when traitors denied to the government the inherent power to preserve
                        itself, every Northern Democrat echoed the same sentiment, and declared
                        coercion to be a crime. Nor did its awkward folly stop there. It staggered
                        through the war, ever afraid to avow its sympathy and belief, and too false
                        to learn how dear to all were the blessings of our beneficient system of
                        free government. When, in order to save the Republic, Slavery was stricken
                        down, there was a protest as broad and as deep as Democracy could make it,
                        and when the emancipated slave entered the Union ranks to defend our common
                        flag, he was declared a dolt and a coward, and his presence in the army was
                        pronounced an insult to the white soldier, and a needless wound to our
                        "erring brethren" of the South. But step by step the world moved on, and
                        Progress with Justice and Humanity emblazoned on its banner, until the still
                        unrepentant traitor made negro enfranchisement an imperative necessity.
                        Again the unlearned and unlearning Democracy revolted, and the doleful
                        appeals for protection against the social and political equality of the
                        negro resounded from every stump, as frightened Democratic orators plead
                        their own cause against the advancement of the African. At last manhood
                        suffrage dawned upon the National capital, and after the returned rebel
                        soldiers and their congenial sympathizers had exhausted their indignation,
                        they marched up to the polls, side by side with the negro, and the negro
                        triumphed. The peace was unbroken; no violent convulsion in either nature or
                        politics followed his voting, and his right and his power are now, and
                        forever henceforth, accepted facts in the capital of the country. There may
                        be political changes in Congress in time. Other parties than the Republicans
                        may wield the power of the government, but none will abridge suffrage on the
                        ground of color or caste.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the whole Union, and especially in the States lately in rebellion,
                        the progress of public sentiment toward manhood suffrage is sweeping
                        opposition from its course. In South Carolina, and in its very capital, the
                        whites and blacks met and mingled by thousands last week, to consider the
                        State of the country. The whites were not adventurers or those who are
                        classed as traitors to the South. On the contrary, such lordly Democratic
                        leaders and rebel warriors as Gen. Wade Hampton, and ex-U. S. Senator
                        Desasseure, and others equally eminent, spoke from the same stand with sable
                        orators, to an audience dotted with an equality of pale and dusky faces. The
                        proud Hampton pronounced in favor of political equality, and his liberality
                        was responded to by Nash and Picket, who with unlearned but eloquent tongues
                        proposed for their white friends universal amnesty. On the same day some
                        3,000 negroes met in Savannah, Georgia, and were addressed by both blacks
                        and whites, all uniting in proposing peace, brotherhood and impartial
                        rights. Even in proud Virginia, the wet-nurse of treason and the boasted
                        mother of statesmen, the voices which were defiant until now, begin to
                        advocate the supremacy of the laws, and the acceptance of the principles of
                        universal justice. Soon the negro, long the abject slave, will peacefully
                        deposit his vote side by side with his old oppressor, and before another
                        autumn shall tint Virginia's mountains, manhood suffrage will be the
                        accepted and fixed policy of the Old Dominion. Nor is it looked upon as a
                        temporary expedient. It is as immutable as the eternal laws of truth, and it
                        will abide perpetually, while the blind passions which protested will fade
                        into forgetfulness. Truly, the world moves!</p>
                    <p>In Pennsylvania our political Bourbons are still stumbling and snarling about
                        the negro. While Wade Hampton was speaking with and to his ex-slaves in
                        South Carolina, recognizing them as citizens and cordially conceding all
                        their rights, the Democracy of the Pennsylvania legislature were resorting
                        to revolutionary measures to defeat a bill forbidding railroads to
                        discriminate against negroes, and they fitly represented their party. Here
                        in Pennsylvania last of all will the Democracy learn that the negro is a
                        citizen, and may progress in social and political rights in defiance of the
                        prejudices which belong to other days. Nevertheless the world does move and
                        will move, and those who move not with it, will be forgotten in the
                        advancement of the age.</p>
