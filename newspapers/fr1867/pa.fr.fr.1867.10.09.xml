                    <p>Before this issue shall be placed in the hands of our subscribers, the voters
                        of Pennsylvania will have decided which party shall bear the honors of the
                        election. We confidently expect that the good old Commonwealth will prove
                        true to her fame, and will bestow her gifts upon the men who were true to
                        her, and who won for her the renown she has enjoyed among her loyal sister
                        States. If indifference or false security has kept her patriotic masses from
                        the polls, she will have inflicted upon the cause of good government, peace
                        and national prosperity a wrong that will shadow her bright record.
                        Pennsylvania has nothing in common with the Democratic party. Her interests
                        have always been opposed by that corrupt organization. For many years, she
                        was deluded by their professions, and was unwavering in her devotions, to
                        them, casting her vote almost uninterruptedly for their candidates. The
                        return she received was always treachery. She turned her back upon her best
                        friend and placed one of her most pretentious sons in the second place
                        within the gift of the people. With vile ingratitude, he falsified his
                        pledges to her, and accepted the base distinction of casting the vote which
                        struck down her industry. The Democratic politicians she sent to Congress
                        always betrayed her interests in low subserviency to their southern
                        taskmasters. They consented to all these arrogant masters demanded. It
                        mattered not to them whether her labor was rewarded or discouraged; she was
                        dear to her unfilial sons, only for the vote she could give. They treated
                        the sensibilities of her people with disdain and scorn. Her broad domains
                        they made the hunting ground for miserable fellow beings fleeing from a
                        bondage whose remembrance makes the heart sick, and compelled her proud sons
                        and gentle daughters to withhold the hand of charity from the starving
                        slave, and to join in the chase after the panting fugitives. They made her
                        help to hew down one after another of the barriers, which had been erected
                        to hedge in this ever-encroaching crime against humanity. They persuaded her
                        to applaud every wrong that was perpetuated against equality and justice,
                        and good will to man. But her humiliation was not yet complete. Again one of
                        her sons--aye, her favorite son--was chosen to the highest position in the
                        land, and another of her pets was made his chief advisor. The hour which the
                        traitors had longed for, since the brave days of Jackson, had come--an hour
                        when imbecility and wickedness held the executive power. At once all
                        disguise was abandoned, and open, impudent, daring threats against the
                        government were freely indulged in under the very shadow of the Presidential
                        Mansion; and the property of the people was stolen, and their arms winked at
                        by the President, nay apologized for, while his venomous Attorney-General
                        bewildered the infatuated dotard with miserable legal speculations and
                        subterfuges, until the trembling old man believed he would injure the
                        constitution by preserving a country for the constitution.</p>
                    <p>And when the nation aroused itself for the struggle for its existence, giving
                        the lie to the Democratic assurances to the south that Pennsylvania would go
                        with them in their rebellion, who opposed the arming of our State? Who voted
                        against the advance of pay to our armies? Who objected to granting the right
                        of suffrage to our gallant soldiers in the field? Who sheltered and
                        encouraged deserters? Who denounced the volunteer as a hireling? Who
                        pronounced the war as unjust, and a failure? Who sought to depreciate our
                        currency and bankrupt the government? The same men who now glorify rebels,
                        who strike hands in political fellowship with the traitors, and demand their
                        admission into Congress to legislate upon the reestablishment of the Union
                        and settling its policy? The same men who dishonor the heroes of the war,
                        and enshrine as the objects of their idolatry the criminals whose mad
                        ambition steeped our continent in blood, and bowed us with the heavy burdens
                        of taxation. To give our noble State to the rule of this party would be her
                        last calamity. Such a disgrace would be intolerable. All her instincts are
                        loyal. To find herself in such a bondage would be a stain she could not
                        endure. She would arouse herself and shake off the shame. We do not fear
                        that she will suffer this mortification. But we urge upon our friends to
                        strengthen themselves for the future. To organize afresh; and to renew the
                        contest; to prepare for future victories, and not to rest until the Union is
                        fully restored, until the rights of all its citizens are secured. Then and
                        not until then will peace and prosperity come upon the country. This is the
                        mission of the Republican party. This it only can accomplish. When this
                        consummation, so devoutly to be wished, is attained, new issues may create
                        new organizations. Until it is attained all other issues should be held
                        subservient. All other issues are subordinate and trivial. The party
                        inspirited by such high aims and purposes must be sustained by the people.
                        It is their party. It is the party to which and for which the hopes and
                        prayers of the friends of mankind everywhere centre. It is the party of the
                        present, it will be the party of the future. It is the party which is
                        crowned with the unfading laurels of the holiest war that the pages of
                        history record--the party which has furnished the loftiest examples of
                        statesmanship--the party which has crushed out the greatest crime that has
                        existed among men, and brought liberty and happiness to millions of
                        oppressed and sorrow-laden fellow beings.</p>
                    <p>Let us all be proud of such a party, and labor with renewed energy to
                        preserve it until it finish the mission to which it has been called.</p>

                    destroying a quantity of hay and seed as well as a valuable sleigh stored
                    inside. The fire spread to other buildings owned by Criswell before finally
                    being extinguished through the exertions of local firemen and citizens. The
                    blaze is believed to be the work of an incendiary; suspicion rests with a man
                    fired by Criswell the day before.</summary>

                <summary>A. K. McClure's "large frame barn" was destroyed in a fire last Wednesday;
                    the barn was occupied by John Linn and contained his crop, which did not escape
                    the flames. Both suffered an estimated $3,000 damages.</summary>

                    <p>The fall fashions in bonnets are thus described: The coquettish Fanchon and
                        other summer varieties have given place to stately and elegant chapeaus, the
                        distinguishing feature of which is the diadem. The diadem may be set upright
                        across the front of a close fitting shape, or will require a sharp rising in
                        front to admit the bandeau, which is generally trimmed with sprays of rich
                        flowers of satin or velvet box plaits. Crowns are quite flat and broad, and
                        many of the shapes are much larger than have been worn for the last two
                        years. Gold is introduced profusely among the ornaments of the early fall
                        bonnets. The most beautiful hues of the fall woods, convolubois vines,
                        branches of oak, maple and rose trees, sprays of fern and drooping tassels
                        of willows, acorns and berries, form a rainbow over some rich shade of
                        imperial velvet or satin. The return of amber has passed away, and all
                        attempts to introduce it have failed.</p>
