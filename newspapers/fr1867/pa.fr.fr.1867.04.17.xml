                    <p>The Russian-American treaty has been ratified by the U. S. Senate, and, as
                        the ratification by Russia is not a matter of doubt, it only remains for
                        Congress to appropriate ten millions two hundred thousand dollars in gold,
                        to pay for our new acquisition, to make the bargain and transfer complete.
                        It is intimated that the House will hesitate before making such an
                        appropriation, but we have no expectation of failure in that quarter. If the
                        Senate could be manipulated to ratify the treaty with but two dissenting
                        votes, (Fessenden and Ferry) we look for the same influence to control a
                        majority of the members of the House and place money in the hands of Mr.
                        Seward to consummate his contract. True it will be urged with great
                        earnestness and force that nobody thought of purchasing Russia-America; that
                        nobody wants it; that it will benefit nobody but Russia, and that it will be
                        a constant and fearful drain on the treasury to protect and govern it; but
                        in defiance of all such objections, the money will most likely be
                        appropriated and the territorial possessions of the United States will be
                        extended to the region of the North pole, with the classic countries of
                        Kamtschatka and Tehucktchi as our nearest neighbors across Behring's Strait
                        in the far Northwest.</p>
                    <p>Russia has long been the owner of a vast wilderness North-west of the British
                        Possessions, containing nearly half a million square miles, and inhabited by
                        some 3,000 Cossacks and 50,000 barbarian Indians. Beyond these valuable
                        acquisitions to our social and political strength, the new territory gives
                        lavish fruit in huge ice-bergs and impassable snows, and furnishes the
                        highest mountain on the continent. The Southern border of the main body of
                        the proposed acquisition touches the North Pacific Ocean and the Sea of
                        Kamtschatka, and its Northern boundary is on the Antarctic Ocean. It is not
                        connected by land with the United States, the nearest point of the main body
                        being from fifteen hundred to two thousand miles North of the extreme
                        North-western territory of Washington. A group of Islands which Russia has
                        kindly thrown in have a tolerable climate and their Southern border
                        approaches within six hundred miles of our present possessions. There are no
                        white settlements in any part of the Russian territory beyond trappers and
                        temporary sojourners in the fur interest, and it is not pretended that the
                        time will ever come, when any considerable portion of the territory can be
                        so peopled as to protect itself from the hostile tribes of the lowest and
                        most barbarous character which now inhabit it.</p>
                    <p>When we glance at the map of the United States, and find that with all our
                        progress we have yet to people to a self-sustaining point nearly two thirds
                        of the territory we now own, the wisdom of adding to our uncivilized
                        territory half a million square miles of land located five thousand miles
                        from any government starting point, must be gravely questioned by the
                        people. Just now the savages render labor and its products, and even life
                        itself, insecure in all the territories, covering more than half the area of
                        the Union, and for many years to come we must spend millions of money
                        annually to protect those who are willing to develop the rich agricultural
                        and mineral regions of the far west. To this heavy cost must now be added
                        many millions more to protect the adventurers in additional territory
                        one-fifth the size of the whole United States. True, it may be answered that
                        nobody will go there, and therefore no army will be needed, but if so, for
                        what have we paid our ten millions and more in gold? By the terms of the
                        treaty this government is bound to protect the citizens of all nations
                        there, and if a bevy of Russians, or North-polers, or Dr. Kane's Esquimaux
                        conclude to settle there, or even to take a brief summer's hunt with the
                        thermometer at forty degrees below zero, all they have to do is to call on
                        our government, and they must be protected. We are bound by the stipulations
                        of the treaty to govern and protect the inhabitants, and to do this we must
                        have territorial Governors, Secretaries, Marshals, &amp;c., each of whom
                        must have a small standing army to protect himself from making a breakfast
                        some fine frosty morning for some of the savages, who inhabit that
                        delightful country. We must also have Delegates in Congress, and the Speaker
                        of the House will soon recognize "the gentleman from Sitka" or "the
                        gentleman from Equimaux," in the deliberations of our national legislature.
                        In short, we have agreed to pay ten millions two hundred thousand dollars
                        for territory that Russia does not want, that we will never want, and that
                        nobody can ever hope to want; and we propose to do it, too, when we have a
                        crushing national debt, and more than half of our present territory,
                        exclusive of the South, requiring military protection. Could folly go
                        farther? We confess now that it might, but until now, no one would have
                        dreamed that it could make such gigantic strides in high places. We shall
                        probably next be waked up some morning to learn that Seward and Johnson have
                        purchased Greenland and the fee simple to the North pole, and why not? If
                        the immense ice-bergs and interminable snows of Russian America are a luxury
                        worth millions of money, why should not the still grander icy mountains and
                        still deeper snows of Greenland be worth more?</p>
                    <p>It may be "manifest destiny"--the plea for every robbery we have ever
                        committed and every territory we have bought, but have we not already paid
                        dearly enough for our submission to "manifest destiny?" By this treaty we
                        wrong no one but ourselves, but why must we do that? We have more than
                        enough room for all the possible increase of our population for the next
                        century, and if ever more should be wanted, it will not be in the region of
                        Russian America. We hardly hope that Congress will refuse to appropriate the
                        money to ratify this treaty, but if the wants of the nation, and the already
                        heavy burdens of the people, are considered, Russia will be permitted to
                        keep her American territory for another hundred years at least.</p>

                    reconstruction, arguing that the confiscation of rebel property "is the doctrine
                    of common sense and common justice." Until such policies are adopted, the
                    country will have no "genuine peace and prosperity."</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>IMPORTANT TO TAX PAYERS.--The provisions in the amended Internal Revenue bill
                        have not been published, and as they were of importance to all, we give an
                        abstract of the principal provisions:</p>
                    <p>Costs of suits and other legal proceedings arising from ordinary business are
                        to be treated as other expenses of such business, and may be deducted from
                        the gross profits thereof.</p>
                    <p>If the members of a family have made separate incomes, the returns may be
                        made separately by the proper parties, and a ratable portion of the $1,000
                        exempted from the income of each. The parent, as the natural guardian of the
                        minor child, is required to make return for him. But where any other
                        guardian or trustee has been appointed, the return should be made by the
                        latter. If the minor has no guardian or trustee, he should make return
                        himself. If he refuse or neglect, an independent assessment must be made as
                        in other cases, omitting penalty.</p>
                    <p>For the purposes of the exemption of $1,000, husband and wife are to be
                        regarded as members of the same family, though living separate, unless
                        separated by divorce or other operation of law, so as to break up the family
                        relation. Minor children and their parents should be counted members of the
                        same family, whether living together or not.</p>
                    <p>If a tax payer has a minor child in the service of the Government receiving a
                        salary, such parent should include in his income return so much of the
                        salary of his child as is not subject to salary tax.</p>
                    <p>Gifts of money, when clearly not in the nature of payment for services
                        rendered, or other valuable consideration, are not liable to taxation as
                        income. Amounts received on life insurance policies and damages recovered in
                        actions of tort are exempt from income tax.</p>
                    <p>Lawyers and physicians may return either the actual fees received during the
                        year, without regard to the time when they accrued, or the amounts due to
                        the business of the year. But when the taxpayer has heretofore adopted one
                        method, he cannot be allowed to make use of the other.</p>
                    <p>If the manufacturer or dealer has been in the practice of estimating his
                        annual profits by taking inventories of stock, he should take the cost value
                        on such stock, unless he has taken the market value in making previous
                        returns. Whichever method has been adopted by the taxpayer should be adhered
                        to uniformly.</p>
                    <p>If interest accrued during the year on notes, bonds, &amp;c., is good and
                        collectable at the end of the year, it should be returned as income whether
                        actually collected or not.</p>
                    <p>The fact that income is devoted to the payment of debts does not release the
                        same from liability to income tax.</p>
