<b>The Chignon</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article discusses the latest in women's fashion in London--the Chignon.
                    The article cautions women from wearing chignons because they allegedly promote
                    the growth of lice, which "thrive amid the grease and heat, and grow fat and
                    saucy at 360 deg. Fahrenheit." To support this allegation, the piece includes a
                    number of mock testimonials from the parents of women and girls who have sported

<b>Constitutional Convention</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors defend their position on the issue of legislation in the face
                    of criticism levelled by the Patriot and Union, which labeled the proposed
                    constitutional convention a "'Yankee scheme to run around organic laws, and take
                    snap judgement upon the people.'" The editors recognize their plan is not

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Patriot and Union
                        does us the justice to publish our disclaimer of the purposes it charged us
                        with entertaining, in regard to the proposed Constitutional Convention, and
                        at the same time takes occasion to denounce the proposed Convention as a
                        "Yankee scheme to run aground organic laws, and take snap judgement upon the
                        people." It would have been more satisfactory if our contemporary had given
                        us some reason for the faith it professes and preaches. What it says in
                        regard to fixed ratios and legislative districts, even though true, would
                        not warrant any such conclusion as the above, and we are compelled to look
                        elsewhere for the cause of its hostility to the proposed measure. We
                        suggested a basis of representation that we thought just and equitable, one
                        that could hardly fail of making the Convention a fair exponent of the
                        popular will, and expressed at the same time a perfect willingness to favor
                        any other plan that our contemporary could suggest that would effect the
                        same thing equally as well. We care not what the basis of representation is,
                        only so that it will insure a correct expression of the sentiments of the
                        people. The plan we suggested may be faulty and partial--though we fail to
                        see how--yet this fact in no wise makes a Convention any the less necessary,
                        still less does it warrant any one in denouncing the proposed Convention as
                        a Yankee trick, &amp;c. It may not be possible without an utter
                        disregard of all principles of justice and fair dealing to establish a basis
                        of representation that would insure to the Democracy the control of the
                        Convention, but that is the fault of the people and can hardly be urged as a
                        fair objection to the measure itself. It certainly is possible to frame and
                        adopt some method whereby both parties would have an equal chance in the
                        contest, and the wishes of the people be honestly expressed. This is what we
                        want and what we will try to have. Any thing else we will condemn as
                        earnestly as we favor this.</p>
                    <p>The plan proposed by the Patriot is to let the
                        Constitution alone and elect good and true men as representatives. A most
                        admirable plan if it could only be adopted and practiced upon; but if the
                        statements of our friend in regard to the last half dozen Legislatures are
                        to be credited, the impracticability of the plan is apparent. The Patriot has championed the cause of honesty and
                        purity ever since its own party lost the ascendency in the State, yet
                        according to its own showing matters have gone from bad to worse until the
                        Legislature has become a byword and reproach. Under this plan when can we
                        look for reform? The evil has become intolerable and we must have speedy
                        relief. Can we afford to allow another half dozen years of doubtful
                        experiment?</p>
                    <p>It is worse than idle to talk about the purity of our legislative bodies
                        depending upon the ascendency of any particular party. That time has never
                        been yet when the faithless and venal were confined to either party. They
                        batten as well in minorities as in majorities, and as long as they can do
                        this they are content. To charge all the blame upon one party, and to acquit
                        the other entirely, is part of a system of political tactics that has grown
                        useless, and can only be practiced with success now upon a few of the
                        ignorant and bigoted. It is high time the Patriot
                        would make a change.</p>
                    <p>In the same article our contemporary reminds us of the fact that the
                        Constitution provides a method for its own correction. This is true, but we
                        favor the other as being more efficient and more likely to correct the
                        abuses from which we suffer. The method provided by the Constitution leaves
                        the suggestion and discussion of proposed changes and alterations to the
                        Legislature, elected probably without any regard to them. We would prefer a
                        Convention composed of the wisest and best of our citizens, men in whose
                        patriotism, ability and integrity all could rely, and elected for the
                        express purpose of reviewing and revising our organic law. Our present
                        Constitution is the result of the labors of just such a body. There is
                        nothing novel or strange in a Constitutional Convention, and instead of
                        being illegal, irregular and unconstitutional as the Patriot alleges, it is warranted by the highest law, and has
                        always been recognized as the true method of Constitutional emendation. The
                        same power that makes can correct or destroy. If the Constitution that now
                        governs us is not the work of the people then it is without any binding
                        force whatever, if it is the work of the people then it is within their
                        power to do with it as they please.</p>
                    <p>While it is perfectly competent for the Legislature to call such a
                        Convention, we would have no serious objection to submitting the question to
                        the people whether or not such a Convention should be called. We cannot see
                        that anything more could be accomplished by this course than that would be
                        sure to follow the other. The matter is for the final determination of the
                        people, and what difference would it make whether the Convention was called
                        by them or the Legislature? If the result of its labors is not approved by
                        them they can reject it and that is the end of it. They are the final
                        arbiters and there can be no such thing as thwarting their will or defeating
                        their purposes. There would be no chance to play a "Yankee trick" or take
                        snap judgement if any one were disposed to do so. But if by consenting to
                        submit to the people the question of a Convention we can make of the Patriot an ally in this matter, we will most
                        cheerfully do so, and accept any other suggestion it may make that improves
                        upon the plan we have proposed. As we said before, all we want is a fair
                        expression of the people, and we held our views upon this question, as upon
                        all others, subject to any modification or change that can be commended to
                        our better judgement.</p>

<b>Six Years Ago and Now</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"Six years have witnessed the emancipation of 25,000,000 serfs in Russia; the
                        liberation of 4,000,000 slaves in the United States, and the virtual
                        manumission of 3,000,000 negroes in Brazil. It is a glorious six years
                        work--32,000,000 of men restored to freedom, and a curse taken off three of
                        the largest empires in the world."--N. Y.
                        Tribune.</p>
                    <p>The above few lines of a newspaper editorial embrace, within themselves, a
                        compendium of the history a revolution as important in the political world,
                        as all the formidable volumes of the records of the reformation contain in
                        regard to religious liberty. Six years ago tyrants could gaze complacently
                        upon the map of the country whose fertile wheat fields, rich mines and vast
                        snow covered hunting grounds extended over one-half the area of Europe,
                        besides practically unlimited wilds of territory in Asia and America, and
                        could smile approvingly upon the servitude of the poor serf of Russia, as a
                        precious proof, a certain demonstration, that the world had never thrown off
                        the yoke of slavery and that men yet knew universal freedom, in reality,
                        only as a vague uncertain idea, looming up in the dim distance along the
                        political horizon, far off and unexpected as the last great judgement day.
                        Few dreamed how rapidly ever since the forced march of Russia forward in
                        civilization, intelligence and all that is good, during the reign of Peter
                        the Great, she steadily advanced toward freedom and right, until the fetters
                        of serfdom fell from the last of her subjects. Six years ago the United
                        States of America stood before the world the champion of liberty, and yet
                        strange anomaly, within the limits of our country, by our own laws, four
                        millions of people were held in servitude more cruel, more heartless and
                        more debasing than were ever slaves on earth subjected to before. Our
                        Goddess of Liberty was compelled to hold under a cloak, a chain to bind each
                        human being of one race, who flying from the tyranny of Africa's petty
                        potentates, found on arriving at a Southern port in the land of freedom, a
                        bondage infinitely worse than that from which he had fled. Six years ago
                        throughout many States of our Union, Slavery was a holy word, not to be
                        named except in reverence. Six years ago in all the rebel States was reared
                        a traitorous de facto government, whose boasted
                        corner stone was Slavery. Now the last stain of Slavery is removed from our
                        escutcheon and every human being in our land is free. Six years ago in the
                        vast empire of Brazil three millions of men were held in chains,--chains not
                        so heavy, not so cruel as those in our own country, but still chains of
                        slavery and oppression. The echo of the last gun of the slaveholder's
                        rebellion had scarcely died upon the air, the last groan of the slave within
                        the United States had scarcely ceased, when the edict went forth to loose
                        the fetters of the bondmen throughout Brazil, and three millions more
                        freemen, three millions fewer slaves inhabit the earth. Never since
                        government began, were the lovers of free government blessed with so
                        cheering evidences that all forms of despotism and oppression are surely
                        fading from the face of the earth, as during the last six years, in which so
                        many men have been released from shackles the most irresistible and
                        hopeless, as well as the most savage and degrading. But while we rejoice and
                        are encouraged by the glorious results, let the friends of freedom suspend
                        no effort in the great conflict for human liberty--</p>
                    <p>"Not yet<br> Mayst thou unbrace thy corslet, nor lay by<br> Thy sword; O
                        Freedom."</p>
