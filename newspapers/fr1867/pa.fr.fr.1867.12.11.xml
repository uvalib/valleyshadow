                    <p>While all Americans, from the men with the best minds in the country down to
                        those with the most simple and ignorant of the day, are forming plans, and
                        alike in the halls of Congress and in the little group around the family
                        fireside are proposing theories for changes in the financial policy of our
                        Republic; when taxation is drawing a powerful brake on every manufacturing
                        wheel and pulley in the land and takes a heavy toll from every product of
                        agriculture; when rich and poor alike feel an inconvenient want of
                        sufficient money to meet the ordinary exigencies of life, and we have so
                        great temptation to rid ourselves of our national burdens for the present,
                        even at the price of placing greater difficulties in the way of our progress
                        and prosperity in future years; let us beware lest we are betrayed into
                        dishonor and probably ruin by permitting ourselves to be led into the
                        specious snares of some system for repudiating our government securities by
                        gradual and subtly concealed processes of financial jugglery; by giving ear
                        to plans apparently calculated only to postpone the payment of our debts
                        indefinitely at the pleasure of the debtor and regardless of the specific
                        terms of the loan, but in reality tending to a state of governmental
                        finances which must eventually result in absolute repudiation. We know there
                        are many men in the territory of the late rebel confederacy, and some even
                        claiming a home among the loyal people of the North, who to-day desire and
                        advise open and immediate repudiation of our debt. But the loyal people of
                        this country are too numerous, too honest and too wise ever to be in any
                        danger from a frank and aboveboard plan, for and iniquitous and disgraceful
                        refusal to pay the securities for which the national faith has been pledged.
                        The government bonds were given in a day of trial, for money lent to the
                        government during a desperate war waged against the nation's life, and
                        without that money which purchased arms and ammunition, and clothing and
                        food, for our armies in the field, the Union would have gone down before the
                        cannon of the Slaveholders' rebellion. Our people are not blind to these now
                        historic facts, and they know too well the sacred nature of the debt ever to
                        openly repudiate it. They know that in <emph rend="italic">foro
                        conscientiae</emph> every cannon and shell, musket and cartridge, every
                        battle-flag, belonging to the nation, every stone in our capitol, every acre
                        of our public domain, all our public possessions, and not less all our
                        private property are as it were mortgaged for the payment of our
                        government's indebtedness. The American people are also fully aware that
                        policy and the safety of the country, aside from honor and honesty, require
                        that we should be scrupulously exact in fulfilling our promises to repay our
                        creditors. When the great rebellion was inaugurated we found it impossible
                        to carry on the war without borrowing large amounts of money, and we learned
                        to prize our government's credit as we valued our national existence. We all
                        comprehend that if we do not pay our just debts already contracted, when the
                        next formidable enemy foreign, or domestic, advances toward Washington, no
                        one will be willing to lend to a dishonored borrower, and for want of money
                        to maintain war we must meet our foes at a disadvantage under which it is
                        not probable even the bravery of our soldiers will be able to triumph.
                        Americans understand these dangers and the nation will not drink the poison
                        unless it be disguised. It is concealed financial dangers we ought most to
                        dread, and already alarming propositions for hazardous changes in our
                        financial system begin to appear on the surface of American politics. We
                        need scarcely advert to the notorious Ohio plan to pay off, at once, all our
                        bonds with a flood of depreciated non interest bearing greenbacks, which
                        would soon become as worthless (we do not mean to detract from or question
                        the value of the wisely limited number of greenbacks already issued), as the
                        oyster-shell money of the regime of William the Testy. The scheme is too
                        preposterous, too transparent, to deceive even the most credulous and
                        unwary. But there are other projects for changing the shape of our debt
                        which are more dangerous, because they present more engaging features, and
                        come clothed in honest garments, not in the criminal convict suit of fraud.
                        Some of them are the result of the thought of able and patriotic men, who
                        would rather lose their right arm than pen a word in favor of what they
                        believed national dishonor. False doctrines, however, all the world over are
                        not less fraught with evil because they are promulgated by tried and trusted
                        leaders. Prominent among these plans stands that to pay in greenbacks part
                        of those of our bonds which were fairly understood as pledged to be paid in
                        gold, and thus deluge the country with a depreciated currency--inflate
                        prices, by inflating prices increase the necessary annual expenditures of
                        government, so plunge the government deeper and deeper into debt, thus
                        necessitating a further issue of more and more paper money--while the
                        disordered and continually depreciating currency would embarrass trade,
                        check manufactures and eventually undermine the national wealth to so great
                        a degree that repudiation would be the only escape toward regaining a
                        healthy financial basis. Another mode of gradual repudiation sometimes
                        resorted to by governments is simply to indefinitely postpone payment of
                        their securities, which may be done either by a decree that they will not be
                        paid until a subsequent time, or by compelling the creditors to accept in
                        their stead other securities made payable at some time far in the future.
                        This practice is not only dishonest but if wantonly persisted in amounts to
                        practical repudiation. If a government wish to postpone payment of a loan,
                        let them give notice to the creditors, that such of them as may so desire,
                        will be at liberty to exchange their securities for others payable at a
                        subsequent time, and then let the government borrow on new bonds issued to a
                        later day, gold or its bona fide equivalent, to pay off at the time they
                        fall due such of the old bonds payable in gold as the holders ask the money
                        for. Of course there are cases where a government's credit is bad in which
                        this cannot be done, as the money cannot be borrowed on the new bonds and
                        "necessity knows no law." But the credit of the United States has not sunk
                        to that point yet, and if we deal honorably with those who have trusted our
                        national good faith, it never will sink so low. We do not desire to propose
                        any pet project of our own for solving the great financial questions, but we
                        ask the people to require that whatever course we may pursue shall not lead
                        to dishonesty and so destroy our public credit. We must try each plan
                        however plausible and from whatever source, first by the all important
                        criterion of honesty, and if it is not entirely honest we should reject it
                        without further consideration. Strict adherence to honest principles is our
                        only safeguard against final repudiation. We should remember the terrible
                        consequences of repudiation by a government are the same, whether to the
                        creditor of an eastern potentate, who asking payment is not only met with a
                        rejection of his just claim, but loses his head for the presumption and
                        temerity of his demand, or to the lender to a more civilized country, who is
                        paid with a flourish of national honor, in a currency of no real value,
                        proportionate to the consideration he has given and the risk he has taken.
                        Let us be careful that we are not in a future hour of need compelled to pay
                        for borrowed money not only a fair interest, proportionate to the
                        inconvenience occasioned the lender in losing the use of his money for the
                        time, but also an additional premium, in substance a consideration for a
                        risk that we may choose never to pay back value, and thus we be forced to
                        allow insurance as well as interest proper on our securities. Let us keep
                        our escutcheon clear of dishonest stain. And while we should pay our
                        interest punctually and the principal as speedily as we can without
                        disastrously crippling our manufactures and trade, we should not be
                        disheartened into lending ear to unfair projects, because we cannot wipe out
                        all our debt in a breath. "The world was not made in a day" and we must bide
                        our time to be rid of our creditors justly. With all our practically
                        boundless natural resources, and so strong a tincture of what political
                        economists term "the effective desire of accumulation" in the American
                        temperament, our country's wealth must increase year by year in almost a
                        geometrical progression, and when a few more harvest moons have rolled over
                        the land, the mighty flood of our augmented wealth will wash out our now
                        formidable debt, as the wide river without an effort floats from sight, a
                        log, which the little rivulet, near its source, could not move with a
                        struggle.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The story of the indignant juror, who after having voted one hundred times
                        for acquittal against the eleven solid votes of his fellow jurors for
                        conviction, prefaced his request to the Court for a discharge by the remark
                        that he had sat sixteen hours with eleven of the stubbornest men God ever
                        made, and that there was no chance of bringing them to terms, is
                        traditional, and for aught we can show to substantiate the fact of his
                        existence, the said juror may be a myth. But it is of no consequence now
                        whether the story is true or false. Its only purpose was to illustrate a
                        particular kind of human weakness, and since Mr. Johnston, our illustrious
                        President, has furnished the world with a stronger and better illustration
                        of the same thing, we can well afford to part company with the juror
                        aforesaid. From this time forth, whenever an illustration of these
                        particular defects in human character shall be needed to point out a moral
                        or adorn a tale, it stands to reason that the excessive vanity and unlimited
                        obstinacy of a President will be preferred to the immodest assurance and
                        unreasonable persistence of our old friend the juror. Apart from any
                        advantages Mr. Johnson may have had over him by reason of his exalted
                        position, the example he furnishes will make a better and more pointed
                        illustration. The juror's speech, as an illustration, was good,
                        unquestionably, but compared with the last message of his Excellency it is
                        tame and flat; and besides is not nearly so comprehensive as the message. In
                        addition to the positive qualities of conceit and obstinacy, the message
                        illustrates other unfortunate trials of human character just as well.
                        Inordinate vanity is not illustrated any better than brazen effrontery and
                        impudence; nor is mulish obstinacy better exemplified than reckless audacity
                        and unblushing dishonesty. The juror, never so far as we know, insulted his
                        fellows at any time during the sixteen hours confinement, nor did we ever
                        hear of his proposing to dispense with their services and bringing in a
                        verdict himself. It may be that he wasn't altogether fair in his arguments,
                        but the story does not relate this against him, and we cannot in justice
                        assume that he was. But on the other hand, see how magnificently Mr. Johnson
                        does all this and more. He tells Congress--a body generally supposed to know
                        a thing or two, and credited by many with somewhat of honor and patriotism,
                        composed at present of about two hundred and fifty members, more than two
                        thirds of whom have dared to differ with his Excellency, encouraged to do so
                        by the popular sentiment of the country,--that they are oath-breakers, and
                        faith-breakers and Constitution-breakers. Did the world ever hear more
                        magnificent impudence than this? Harmless it may be, but still downright,
                        positive, excellent impudence. Just think of it. Mr. Johnston is President;
                        how he became President is immaterial. Because Congress will not permit him
                        as President to usurp all the powers of the Government, he turns upon it
                        with his sublime impudence and effrontery, and charges it with being guilty
                        of the very crimes for which he is now in danger of impeachment. He says it
                        has broken faith with the country, inasmuch as it declared while the war was
                        in progress that it was being conducted for the preservation of the Union,
                        and now that it is over it alleges that the war, though triumphant, severed
                        the Union. Mr. Johnson before he was President declared that in the great
                        work of reconstruction loyal men alone should take part, and that all who
                        had been disloyal should take back seats. On declarations such as these he
                        was trusted and accepted by the people as their Vice President. No sooner is
                        he placed in power than he breaks faith with those who elevated him and
                        deserts to the enemy. Refreshing impudence in such a man to upbraid others
                        for bad faith! He declares that Congress by interfering in the government of
                        the late rebellious States violated the constitution; when he, Andrew
                        Johnson, President, had set it the example, by placing military governors
                        over each of them, and with an assumption of power that would have seemed
                        arrogant in a Sultan or a Czar, compelled their legislatures to make laws to
                        suit him. He accuses it with trying to prevent an early restoration of the
                        Union, when he, as President, is using his influence to prevent the Southern
                        States from accepting the generous terms offered them, and is refusing to
                        execute the laws enacted for that purpose. We challenge the world for a
                        better illustration of brawling impudence than this. Then again he tells
                        these same intractable and unfaithful servants of the public, that he, in
                        consideration of their offences, has deliberated much upon and felt very
                        anxious to reach a proper conclusion in regard to the question of how far
                        his duty as President will require him to go in opposing their
                        unconstitutional measures, and with most admirable audacity, after
                        denouncing what they have already done as violative of every principle of
                        the constitution, and as highly dangerous to the organic structure of the
                        Government, tells them to their teeth that if they will do such things he,
                        "the elected defender of the people," "must take the high responsibilities
                        of his office and save the life of the nation." How? By civil war, he says.
                        In the name of all the Gods at once, was ask, was ever mortal so heroically
                        audacious as this man? Plunge the country into civil war for what? Because a
                        majority of the men who compose the 40th Congress will not abuse themselves
                        by a faithless disregard of their duty to the country, and their pledges to
                        the people as he has done himself; because they will not quietly submit to a
                        usurpation of power by him that would make him a despot and them slaves. For
                        these reasons he unbridles his audacity and threatens to ride rough shod
                        over all who have the temerity to stand in his path. His dishonesty finds
                        expression in every paragraph. With an utter disregard for truth, he
                        suppresses important facts and taxes his ingenuity to invent others. He
                        maligns and impugns the motives of others, and claims for himself a fidelity
                        and integrity that would, if he possessed them, make him another and a
                        different man. With the skill and flippancy of the accomplished demagogue,
                        he makes professions and gives assurances, while at the same time his
                        official action is directed to the accomplishment of the very opposite of
                        what he professes and promises.</p>
