<b>Sympathies of the Age</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors lambaste their counterparts at the Philadelphia Age, a

                    and given them new hope that they might achieve what they "failed to secure by

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We must acknowledge that the aggregate result of the fall elections is
                        against us. It is useless to seek the cause of our defeat. It is worse than
                        idle for leaders, who differ slightly as to the means of attaining the same
                        end, to criminate and recriminate. It matters little now whether our defeat
                        in New York was caused by the lukewarmness of professed party organs, or
                        wholesale corruption. Whether in Pennsylvania by apathy or the negro, or by
                        other causes equally as plausible. We are rather concerned about the effect
                        the success of those, who during the late war, were so closely connected
                        with the enemies of the Republic, will have upon the decision of the great
                        questions which now agitate the nation. Those who voted against us in
                        October and November opposed the war at every stage; fought every measure
                        taken for its preservation. They pronounced the making of the national
                        currency a legal tender unconstitutional; the draft was unconstitutional;
                        emancipation was unconstitutional and a great infringement of the rights of
                        their Southern allies. Many of them fought against us with arms in their
                        hands, and, according to their confederates, it would be a monstrous wrong
                        to disfranchise them. What will a party composed of such elements do when it
                        comes into power? is a question which every true friend of the nation should
                        ponder well. It is natural to suppose that they will endeavor to remedy,
                        according to their notions, what they deem to have been done amiss, and how
                        they will reconstruct the States lately in rebellion is not left to
                        conjecture. All they want yet to give them complete control of the
                        government is the restoration of the rebels to all the rights and privileges
                        which they enjoyed before their rebellion, without any guarantees as to
                        their future behavior. But--thanks to the better mind which prevailed in the
                        past--there yet remains a loyal Congress, and thanks to fleeting time a
                        disloyal President's term of office draws near its close. Unless they
                        succeed in the great contest next fall, their present success will do them
                        little good and will do their unreconstructed friends much harm. The latter,
                        taking time by the forelock, anticipating the action of the Democratic party
                        if entirely successful, have begun already to set at defiance the laws of
                        the land. As far as it lies in their power they are preparing the way for
                        the abrogation of the enactments which gave freedom to four millions of
                        slaves. They exult at the partial success of this despicable party, because
                        they hope to secure through it what they failed to secure by their appeal to
                        arms. They know that when that party holds the reins of government their
                        cause is no longer the "lost cause." The anti-progression party, grows upon
                        its denunciation of the radical party and not from any intrinsic merit. It
                        has offered no plan of reconstruction while it denounces that of the party
                        in power. It rants about the corruption in State and national affairs, but
                        wherever they hold the reins--in New York City for example--their rottenness
                        is without precedent. In fact the aim of their tactics is to get control of
                        the government. There is no evidence anywhere of an intention on their part
                        to deal fairly with the great questions at issue. They have changed no
                        opinion held and advocated by them during the war, and every one knows that
                        those opinions were radically antagonistic to the principles in defense of
                        which the war was waged. The most bitter exponents of these opinions,
                        Vallandingham, Vorhees, Pendleton, &amp;c.--are to-day the headers and
                        the candidates for the prospective honors of the party. These men croak of a
                        war of races through the action of the radical party, and with the same
                        breath stir the worst prejudices of their ignorant followers against an
                        inoffensive and weak race. Once in power the march of progress stops, nay
                        worse than that, from that moment we go backward. The questions which we
                        fondly thought were forever settled will then be re-opened and the result
                        may be another appeal to arms. We will not however borrow trouble. We have
                        got a loyal Congress, loyal governors and we believe a great majority of the
                        people are with us upon the great questions of the day. Let us only be
                        vigilant and active, and all will be well.</p>

<b>The November Election</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article supplies the results from the elections held last week: in New
                    York, New Jersey, and Maryland the Democrats won by sound majorities; in
                    Massachusetts and Minnesota the Republicans triumphed; and in Kansas, voters
                    defeated Constitutional Amendments to allow "female and colored suffrage."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>That blacks "voted almost to a man in favor of a constitutional convention"
                    in the recent election in Virginia should come as no surprise, relates the
                    article. After all, they can differentiate friend from foe. If whites continue
                    to abuse blacks and deny them employment opportunities for expressing their
                    political independence, future acts of "crime or violence" committed by the
                    freedpeople will be the sole responsibility of the white people of Virginia.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the recent election in Virginia the negroes voted almost to a man in favor
                        of a constitutional convention, and for just such delegates to the
                        convention as the majority of Whites did not want.</p>
                    <p>There was nothing surprising in this, at least to any one who had credited
                        the Negro with sufficient judgment to discriminate between friend and foe.
                        That he should want to exercise the rights of citizenship, since he is
                        compelled to bear its burdens, it is natural, just as natural as it was for
                        him when a slave to covet his freedom. That he should use his ballot so as
                        to secure the former, might be expected just as naturally as that he should
                        use his legs in days gone by to secure the latter. Any other course on his
                        part would have indicated a stupid ignorance or sottish indifference that
                        would have satisfied all minds of his utter unfitness for the endowment. But
                        just because he did what he ought to have done, and what would have degraded
                        him in the estimation of the rebels themselves if he had not done, they turn
                        upon him with a ferocity that would disgrace even the negroes were the
                        situation of the parties reversed. They propose to drive him from
                        employment, to deny him the common right of all God's creatures, that of
                        toil, and to bring upon him all the horrors of absolute and hopeless want.
                        Such madness and stupidity combined, have seldom been equalled in the same
                        people. Even supposing that there existed a necessity for some vindicatory
                        measure, the thing proposed is the very refinement of nonsense itself. The
                        community that would attempt it would soon find that its own was the greater
                        punishment, and we know of no people who would be likely to discover the
                        unpleasant truth sooner than the Virginians themselves. They, least of all,
                        can afford to do this thing; yet they have commenced in downright earnest,
                        and to-day there are thousands of Negroes in Virginia in enforced idleness
                        and perhaps want. Idleness is the Devil's work shop; want is his
                        opportunity. Whatever of crime or violence results from this mad course, let
                        the responsibility of it be correctly fixed. That considerable of both will
                        come if the present purpose of the white people of Virginia is persisted in,
                        who can doubt?</p>
