                <transcript>
                    <p>The Republican State Convention will meet at Williamsport on the 26th of the
                        present month. Its chief business will be to nominate a candidate for the
                        Supreme Bench, and to declare the purposes and faith of the great party it
                        represents. It will, we believe, be composed of good and true men, who will
                        be influenced in their action by a patriotic desire to do that which will
                        best promote the interest of the party and the State. We hope to see it far
                        removed from the one man power, and earnest and zealous in the great work of
                        building up and strengthening the cause of loyalty and liberty throughout
                        the country. We feel no special interest in the selection of the candidate.
                        We have no preferences to urge. The convention could not go very far wrong
                        in selecting any of the many able men who have been named in connection with
                        the office. They are all eminent in their profession, and either will give
                        entire satisfaction to the party and to the State at large, if elected. We
                        do feel, however, great interest in the matter of declaring the sentiments
                        and objects of the organization. We hope to see it done with great care, and
                        only after a full deliberation and fair discussion. New exigencies have
                        arisen, and new issues have been forced upon us. The public mind is
                        exercised on questions that have not as yet been declared upon by any
                        representative body of the party. These questions must be met, and met
                        fairly. We cannot hope to steer safely without a correct chart, no matter
                        how excellent our pilot. First of all, we hope to see the convention take
                        high ground on the subject of legislative reform. The party cannot afford to
                        burden itself with the great load of infamy that was heaped up by our last
                        Legislature, neither can it hope to escape an ugly dilemma by passing over
                        in silence what is of itself notorious, and denounced by the good and the
                        pure everywhere. We have been accustomed to speak of the Republican party as
                        a party based on great moral ideas. If we wish to make any such claim in the
                        future, we must not only espouse what is right, but we must unhesitatingly
                        rebuke and condemn whatever is wrong among ourselves, as well as among our
                        antagonists; otherwise what has been our greatest boast will become our
                        bitterest reproach. The evil practices that obtain in our legislative bodies
                        are notorious. Corruption has become so general that the public interests
                        are imperiled and the State brought into disrepute. The people demand an
                        immediate and permanent reform and they will have it cost what it may. If
                        they cannot get it through one party they will try the other and failing in
                        that they will secure it by independent action. We do not overstate the case
                        when we say that positive action by our convention in regard to this great
                        question of reform has become a condition precedent to our success as a
                        party. The maintenance of our supremacy as a political organization cannot
                        be expected unless we show ourselves deserving of it, and we can only do
                        this by giving some public assurance, through our convention, that one of
                        the great objects and purposes of the organization is to rebuke venality and
                        to secure immediate reform. It can best do this by committing the party to
                        the support of the measure we have long urged--the calling of a Constitution
                        Convention. This much it can do, and we repeat, that this much it must do if
                        it hopes for the triumph of the party at the coming election.</p>
                    <p>Then again there is the question of a high protective tariff. The Democratic
                        Convention in its resolutions reproaches us with infidelity to our pledge on
                        this great question. Notwithstanding the unfairness of the charge, our
                        adherence to this doctrine must be reasserted in positive and unequivocal
                        terms. We must not lose any of the vantage ground we now hold, but must meet
                        every charge that is made by our opponents with firmness and sturdy
                        resistance.</p>
                    <p>At the same time it must be remembered that we are a party of progress. We
                        act not only on the defensive. On all questions pertaining to the
                        reconstruction of the Union, we must be found on that side that looks to the
                        accomplishment of some great good not yet realized, yet within
                        constitutional reach. As a party we have been committed to a thorough and
                        perfect restoration of the States on the basis of equal right. Much remains
                        to be done before this can be accomplished. Let it be understood that the
                        Republican party still stands pledged to the accomplishment of this final
                        result, and as means thereto, advocates the civil enfranchisement of all men
                        everywhere.</p>
                    <p>These are some of the things which being essentially right and true in
                        themselves as bare propositions, we conceive must be done to place the party
                        correctly before the people, and to secure our triumph at the approaching
                        elections. We appeal in all confidence to the members of the Convention, to
                        see to it that we do not base the high prestige we have achieved, as the
                        party of great moral ideas.</p>

                <summary>At the upcoming Republican State Convention, there are two issues that must
                    be addressed, say the editors. The first and most pressing is to select a
                    candidate to represent the party in the election for the state supreme court.
                    The second is much more difficult; the party must determine and declare its
                    "purpose and faith." The party's stand on three subjects--legislative reform,
                    the protective tariff, and reconstruction--will determine whether the
                    Republicans will maintain their "supremacy as a political organization."</summary>

                <head>The Doings of the Rip Van Winkle at Harrisburg</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>When "Rip" awaked from his score-of-years nap among the Kaatskills, he was
                        still true to King George and merry England, and consistently so, for the
                        soporific whiskey of the jolly bowling Dutchman had made him oblivious to
                        the political charges which had taken place meanwhile. But what excuse will
                        those who assembled in Convention at Harrisburg, on the 11th inst., give for
                        the adoption of resolutions in behalf of "dead issues." True, many of the
                        party have the weakness which brought Mr. Van Winkle to grief, but
                        unfortunately, the vile stuff they imbibe has not the sleep inducing virtue
                        of the article which the Dutchman quaffed. True, it might be alleged that
                        the enemy which so many of the members of this party of mediaeval principles
                        put in their mouths, had stolen away their brains, but to account for their
                        action in this way would require an unwarrantable assumption. These
                        resurrectionists of defunct issues could probably give reasons for their
                        conduct, but undoubtedly they would be like those of Gratiano, "as two
                        grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff."</p>
                    <p>These Pharisees stand up in the high places of the capital, and after
                        thanking God--with their lips--that they are not as the (Re)publicans and
                        other sinners, proceed to say, "We, the delegates of the Democratic party of
                        Pennsylvania," are "profoundly grateful for the return of peace," when they
                        took such strong exceptions to the Supreme Ruler's manner of bringing it
                        about. This profundity of gratefulness comes with rather bad grace from
                        those who opposed the war at every stage. If the South, instead of the
                        North, had conquered the Peace, the representatives of the "dead past" would
                        have been "profoundly grateful," not only for the return of Peace, but also
                        for the instrumentality by which Peace was attained.</p>
                    <p>It is evident that the "delegates of the Democratic party" are but novices in
                        prayers of thanksgiving. They have not cultivated very close communion with
                        the Supreme Ruler, nor studied the manner in which he would be addressed, or
                        assuredly they would not approach him with "buts" and "ifs." They are
                        "profoundly grateful" for one thing, "but deeply anxious" on account of many
                        others, particularly on account of the "trials and delays which impede the
                        complete restoration and reunion of all the States." It is a great pity that
                        these malcontents did not go to the South at the commencement of the
                        rebellion, and join in the fight upon the side with which they sympathized.
                        They would then have progressed with the progress of events, instead of now
                        standing in the way of progress and battling feebly for "dead issues;" they
                        would stand shoulder to shoulder with James Longstreet in the manly effort
                        to secure equal rights to all and permanent union upon that basis, the only
                        one upon which it can be attained.</p>
                    <p>The first resolution adopted at this convention is worthy of the Chinese, who
                        cling not only to "the principles of civil government," but to everything
                        else which their ancestors of two thousand years ago established. It is a
                        wonder these fossils did not resolve "steadfastly to adhere" to the
                        principles of civil government in vogue before King John and Magna Charta.
                        We find in the preamble no profound gratefulness expressed for the overthrow
                        of Slavery. Is this one of the principles which they are resolved to adhere
                        to steadfastly?</p>
                    <p>The second resolution is in advance of their position during and before the
                        war. For this progressive step <emph rend="italic">we</emph> are "profoundly
                        grateful." It is a sort of oasis in a desert of platitudes and nothings. Let
                        them act in accordance with their resolution.</p>
                    <p>The sixth resolution is a neat non-committal piece of composition. Is the
                        Democratic party in favor of free trade or protection? Where is the Daniel
                        to interpret this writing on the wall?</p>
                    <p>Finally, their candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court is generally conceded
                        to be well fitted--so far as legal ability is concerned--for the position,
                        and is their strongest man, but if "evil communications corrupt good
                        manners," there will be a grand falling off in Judge Sharswood's fitness by
                        election day. Their candidate, we believe, has nothing but a legal record,
                        nothing can be urged against him except that he keeps bad company, and if
                        the proverb be true, that every man is known by the company he keeps. Judge
                        Sharswood is not fit for that or any other office. If his political
                        principles are embodied in the Harrisburg resolutions, then it is the duty
                        of every voter to use his utmost efforts to defeat him. The party in its
                        resolutions has ignored the soldier, let the soldiers ignore the party.</p>

                <summary>"Horace" relates that a significant number of prominent rebel sympathizers
                    attended the Democratic State Convention in Harrisburg last week; they came in
                    hope of nominating Judge Woodward for the state supreme court. Woodward's
                    chances were dashed, however, when it became apparent after the first ballot
                    that Judge Sharswood had the greatest support. Horace indicates that members of
                    the committee assigned the task of laying out the party's platform were "sorely
                    perplexed when they came to consider the question of "'negro suffrage,'" lest
                    they might seemingly rebuke their Southern brethren, who are now so beseechingly
                    seeking negro votes."</summary>

                <summary>It is reported that the Republican Louisiana State Convention adopted the
                    name "'Radical Republican Party'" as well as a "thoroughly radical" platform.
                    The convention promised that half the "colored men" would receive half of the
                    offices.</summary>

                    the Democrats "were staked upon the war and there lost," thus they hold little

                    there was no work to be had, the men then left for California. Of the seven or
