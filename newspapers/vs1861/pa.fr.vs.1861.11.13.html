<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Camp Nevin, Hardin Co., Ky. <br>October 30th, 1861.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir:--We left Pittsburg [sic] on Friday evening, October 18th. Our
                        Brigade embarked on six steamboats and were until Monday evening getting to
                        Louisville. We had a very pleasant trip down the river. We were cheered from
                        both sides of the river nearly all the way and in a great many places
                        saluted by the firing of the cannon. Some places fired a gun for the boats
                        that evening and disembarked on Tuesday morning and marched through the
                        principal streets of the city to the old race ground called Oakland about
                        one mile and a half from the city and there encamped and remained until the
                        next morning and then marched into the Rail Road station and were fed by the
                        Subsistence Committee of Louisville. Our regiment remained and took the cars
                        about 5 o'clock P.M., for this place which is between fifty and sixty miles
                        from Louisville, which is on the line of the Louisville &amp; Nashville
                        R.R. We shall move in a few days I expect. They are repairing bridges along
                        the road that were destroyed by the rebels.--Buckners camp is about thirty
                        miles below us, and he is supposed to have from thirty to forty thousand and
                        more coming or expected every day. They expect a Regiment at Louisville
                        to-day from Wisconsin, and more in a few days from Indiana.</p>
                    <p>You can form no idea how much that Subsistence Committee had to do to feed us
                        all at Louisville. The same night we arrived there were about two thousand
                        more from Indiana and Minnesota. That makes over five thousand in one day,
                        and they gave us first rate substantial food. Those people who are union
                        here in this State are very strong. I must close for I suppose I cannot
                        write anything more of interest to you.</p>
                    <p>J. T. S.</p>
