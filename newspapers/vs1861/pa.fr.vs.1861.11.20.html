<b>Extract from a Private Letter</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The following is an extract from a private letter from one of the officers
                        engaged in the bombardment.</p>
                    <p>"I am sure our success will rejoice your heart. It has been complete, and
                        terror runs over the whole country. The negroes are wild, and plundering
                        their master's houses. The whites have been driving the negroes away by
                        force, and shooting them down, but they still come down to the gun-boats.</p>
                    <p>The moment General Drayton took to his horse in the panic of the 7th, his two
                        hundred servants took to the Wabash--This is
                        worthy of notice, as putting down the romance that the slaves were ready to
                        fight for their masters. They surrounded Captain Ammen in crowds, at
                        Beaufort, one of them calling out, in the joy of his heart:--'I didn't think
                        you could do it, massa!"</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the outset of the difficulties which have culminated in open war between
                        the two sections of our country, and when we were imploring the dominant
                        party to make same concessions in order to avert the horrors of fraternal
                        strife, we published official statistics of the resources of the South,
                        taken from the Census reports of our own government. We did this with no
                        purpose of creating or aiding rebellion anywhere, but merely to convince our
                        belligerent Republican friends that the conquest of the South would be no
                        holiday affair, and that in their frenzied partisan rancor they were
                        deceiving themselves as to the powers of resistance of that division of the
                        country. We knew that the South was not the
                        powerless, poverty stricken country that Republicans who passed among their
                        party for intelligent men were in the habit of representing it to be--we
                            knew that it could not be whipped by a mere
                        corporal's guard of United States soldiers, no matter how brave or how well
                        disciplined they might be, and that it could not be starved into submission
                        in a fortnight by cutting off its supplies of flour and bacon; and we wished
                        to cram a little knowledge on these subjects into the heads of those who
                        were brawling for war in preference to compromise. We wanted our own section
                        of the Union, to which we are unchangeably attached, to go into the contest
                        with its eyes open, if it went into it at all, to go in with a full
                        knowledge of the strength and resources of its antagonist, and with adequate
                        preparations for any emergency. For rendering this service to our own
                        section of the country, we were denounced as secessionists by no
                        inconsiderable number of the opposite party, and by a few professing
                        "Democrats" who were several degrees blacker, as well as meaner, than the
                        blackest among Black Republicans. We did not swerve from our course,
                        however, for we very well know that time would vindicate us. And it has.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after the disastrous battle of Bull Run, Gov. Sprague went home
                        to Rhode Island and in an official communication to the Legislature told
                        them that the North deceived themselves in relation to the power and
                        resources of the South, and that the Southern soldiers, instead of being
                        half starved and half clothed, were in all respects better equipped than our
                        own.--Gen. BURNSIDE went home and told the same story. And from that time to
                        this, we have had from one prominent Republican after another, similar
                        confessions of Northern ignorance and self-deception about Southern
                        resources. We have been diligently collecting these Republican vindications of the Valley Spirit, with the intention
                        of laying them before our readers; they can then judge of the extent and correctness of some peoples information who
                        make pretensions to be a judge! When we publish
                        these vindications, as we shall before long, our bitterest political
                        opponent, if he has one grain of fairness in his whole body, he will be
                        compelled to admit that the Valley Spirit was the
                        only newspaper in the county that served the Union cause from the beginning,
                        because it was the only one that gave correct information of the power and
                        resources of the enemy. We shall on this point overwhelm our calumniators,
                        with evidence drawn from the highest Republican sources.</p>
