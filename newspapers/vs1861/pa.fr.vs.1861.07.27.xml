                <excerpt>"If we are to have any more battles, God save us from such Generals as
                    Schneck and some of the other commanders, who figured on Sunday as they are
                    worse enemies than Davis and Lee. Our greatest loss is in the thorough
                    demoralization of our army. It will take weeks to gather the scattered forces in
                    the condition we had them."</excerpt>

                    actions of two newspapermen, Mr. Stedman of the World and Mr. Villard of the
                    Herald. Both of these men attempted to stop the panic and rally the troops
                    during the retreat from Manassas.</summary>
