<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Sunday afternoon last our town was thrown into quite an excitement by the
                        unexpected announcement that the Franklin County companies, belonging to the
                        2nd Regiment, were at the Depot. As soon as the news of their arrival spread
                        our streets were crowded by a dense mass of people all eagerly rushing to
                        the Depot to welcome them home. The companies were marched from the Depot,
                        followed by a vast concourse of people, to the Public Square, where they
                        were dismissed. The men have all, without an exception that we noticed,
                        improved in personal appearance, and the full number that left here come
                        back in excellent condition. They have performed a good share of arduous
                        service during their three months enlistment, but, with a few slight
                        exceptions, all have enjoyed remarkably good health, and return to their
                        homes in fine spirits. Quite a number of the men say that they are ready to
                        re-enlist for three years, and many would have entered the service at once,
                        at Harrisburg, had it not been for the outrageous treatment they there
                        received. We are satisfied, from the feeling among our people that a full
                        regiment could be raised in this county, in less than a month, if the men
                        could be assured that the bad treatment our soldiers have been subjected to
                        would not be repeated. As it now stands, few, if any, would be willing to
                        risk another enlistment for so long a term.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is with no ordinary feelings of regret that we announce to our readers
                        that our esteemed fellow townsman, Mr. J. ALLISON EYSTER, is a prisoner in
                        the hands of the dastardly rebels of Virginia. Mr. Eyster visited
                        Charleston, a short time ago, for the purpose of looking after some business
                        matters, and while there accompanied a friend, a Virginian, to Winchester.
                        While in Winchester he was not, we believe, molested, but shortly after
                        leaving that place, to return home, he fell into the hands of some rebel
                        scouts and was arrested by them and taken back and lodged in the Winchester
                        jail. Several acquaintances of Mr. EYSTER, at Winchester, made efforts to
                        have him released and had hopes of being successful, but before they could
                        accomplish it he, with several other prisoners, was removed to Richmond
                        where he is now detained in the hands of Jeff Davis' minions. We look upon
                        the arrest of Mr. EYSTER as a most wanton outrage. He was not in arms
                        against them, or in any way connected with the army, and is too honorable
                        man to act in the capacity of a spy. There was no charge brought against
                        him--nothing to warrant his arrest, or to justify or palliate, in any way
                        such an outrage on an unoffending citizen of Pennsylvania. Mr. EYSTER has
                        many friends in Virginia and we have no doubt, as soon as his ease is
                        brought to the attention of the proper authorities, that he will at once be
                        released and sent home.</p>

                    insult to Northern Democrats. The article alleges that the army which does his
                    bidding is disproportionately Democratic.<br>
