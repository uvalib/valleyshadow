<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Delivered by Hon. Geo. W. Brewer,</p>
                    <p><br>Before the Franklin County Democratic Convention, Feb. 15, 1861.</p>
                    <p>Mr. President and Fellow-Citizens:</p>
                    <p>The general voice of no ordinary occasion has assembled together in anxious
                        council the democratic party of Franklin County. Hurried events of startling
                        interest and just alarm, have brought us together here, to renew our vows of
                        fealty to the constitution, and to lay our peace offerings upon the altar of
                        a common country. A fearful time of gloom, and peril, to the welfare and
                        prosperity, of our once happy and now distracted country, has summoned from
                        the borders of this ancient county, this large assemblage of anxious faces
                        and beating hearts. What lofty purpose, my fellow citizens, has brought you
                        together? What thought kindles every mind? What emotion fires every breast?
                        You are met here for the purpose of appointing delegates, to represent your
                        county in a General State Convention, to assemble under the call of the
                        Democratic State Central Committee, in Harrisburg, on the 21st day of
                        February, 1861. This day has not brought you here for the ordinary purposes
                        of a County Convention to vindicate the claims of some favorite candidate,
                        or secure the triumph of some cherished measure. But we are here to promote
                        a nobler aim, and accomplish a higher purpose. To make one more earnest and
                        united rally for the constitution, and strike one more heavy and determined
                        blow for the honor and the happiness, the peace and the prosperity, of a
                        kindred people and a country undivided. It is indeed a source of just pride,
                        to be a member of the great conservative democratic organization, and to
                        march to the battle field under its time-honored colors; to mingle in the
                        strife of its heroic struggles, and to share the glory of its peaceful
                        triumphs--But it seems yet a nobler privilege, and a prouder distinction to
                        participate in the holy and harmonious feelings of this place, and to bear
                        an [sic] humble part in the solemn and patriotic deliberations of this great
                        occasion. We are met here as Democrats; as Pennsylvanians; as Americans.
                        Here, it is most true, in harmony and in pride, as the faithful disciples of
                        the illustrious Jefferson, and the devoted followers of the immortal
                        Jackson. But also here as the grateful country-men of the god-like
                        Washington, and all that little band of brave and heroic spirits, whose
                        blood made rich the soil of every battle field, and whose graves like
                        pilgrim shrines are scattered all over the land of the free and the home of
                        the brave. To day the ties of party may indeed be expanded, but will not be
                        weakened. To day the just and protecting principles of the Democracy, may
                        unfold themselves in the power and majesty of their conciliating wisdom and
                        conservative strength, and be made to throw their golden cords, in the
                        beauty and tenderness of kindred sympathy and fraternal affection, around
                        the pale and tottering form of our whole and beloved country, and to bind
                        once more, together the alienated States of this one proud and happy land,
                        in the just and equal bonds of eternal peace and perpetual Union.</p>
                    <p>It is a cheering fact, and I trust it may prove an auspicious circumstance,
                        in the calm and patriotic tone, and in the wide and happy influence of the
                        deliberations, of that memorable State Convention, that it is to meet upon
                        the eve of that blessed day, made sacred in the fondest associations of the
                        human heart, and immortal in the proudest annals of all time, by the birth
                        of George Washington--him who lead the armies of the revolution to
                        victorious battle, and guided the councils of his country to the greatness
                        and grandeur of peace. Would that some might hand could roll away the stone
                        from the sepulchre; would that his august form, could start up from the
                        sheeted dead, and stand again in majestic presence among the living; and the
                        bright and cheering example of his great life of virtue and patriotism,
                        inspire and animate the scene.--Would that his voice, as in paternal
                        accents, it whispered hope and courage to the weary and bleeding troops,
                        through the dark and unsheltered winter of Valley Forge; or rang its clarion
                        note of proud and glorious music, in the fore front of battle, along the
                        unfaltering ranks of triumphant columns marching on to freedom and to fame;
                        over the bloody and hard fought field of Monmouth--could then speak trumpet
                        tongued for the matchless wisdom of that Constitution which bears the
                        sanction of his own great name, and the integrity of that country, whose
                        achievements of arts and arms, are the most worthy monument to his own
                        immortal memory. A constitution, which like the blessed sun of heaven,
                        dispenses its benefits equally to all; and a Union of equal, free and happy
                        States. But not a Union of unfriendly interests; of foreign sympathies and
                        alienated affections, and held together in the fatal and unhappy condition
                        of an unequal brotherhood, by the blighting hand of force and the degrading
                        touch of chains. Not a Union, in which one portion of the country, shall
                        trample upon the clear and cherished rights and immunities of the other, and
                        whose Constitution shall not vouchsafe to every section of the land, in the
                        enjoyment of a common inheritance, the same just and fair security of life,
                        liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But a Union of these States, under
                        that wise and conservative compact, forged and cemented in the white heat of
                        the revolution, and glowing all over with genius and patriotism. A Union
                        made and ordained to "establish justice and insure domestic tranquility"
                        while yet the smoke of battle was rolling away from the gory field, where
                        stong [illegible] and brave hearts had achieved their independence. A union
                        of kindred hopes and kindred sympathies, of common sacrifice and common
                        glory.</p>
                    <p>Yes, sir, a Union, the beneficent parent, under the propitious smiles of
                        heaven of all we are, and of all we may hope to be; a Union of expanded
                        love, of forbearing tenderness and fraternal concord, of free, equal,
                        sovereign and indepenent [sic] States.--May it be the perpetual home of a
                        united and renowned people, and the open asylum of hate oppressed and
                        down-trodden of every clime.</p>
                    <p>The democratic party of Pennsylvania and of the country has now a most
                        important duty to perform, a duty which involves the existence and welfare
                        of the whole country, and carried with it the bright and splendid destiny of
                        human freedom and progressive civilization all over the radiant face of the
                        earth. In other times when dangers thickened along the national pathway, and
                        clouds gathered on the angry sky, the voice of democratic truth was all
                        potential to rally the loyal spirits of the land, and her right arm all
                        powerful, to scatter to the winds, the perils of the Union. And now let that
                        party, always the faithful guardian of the constitution plant her standard
                        high upon that great charter of law and order, and swear to defend and
                        maintain the just and inalienable rights of every section of the country,
                        and to stand firmly and fairly by all the compromises of the constitution,
                        and the patriotic and conservative masses of all parties, will, in
                        forgetfulness of past differences, cheered with a common hope, and animated
                        with a common purpose, swell the ranks of a roused people, to bring back our
                        sister States into the arms of a generous government, and to restore the
                        benignant reign of peace and prosperity to the borders of a dear and
                        distracted country. Our republican brethern [sic] with all the talents and
                        intelligence of their powerful and enthusiastic organization, have shown
                        themselves thus far, altogether unwilling, or unable to meet the alarming
                        issues of the day, or to give quiet and repose, to the just fears and
                        painful anxieties of a distressed and divided people. The oracles of
                        Springfield have spoken but their mysterious revelations, have no word of
                        promise for the listening ear, no beam of hope for the sorrowful heart, of
                        an anxious nation. Let the party of the people assembled here to day, gird
                        their loins for the good and patriotic work. Let them strain every muscle
                        for the accomplishment of the great and righteous purpose. That ennobling
                        work and purpose, is no less than to secure and guard throughout all coming
                        time. the happiness and prosperity of the American people, one and
                        undivided, and to maintain and preserve, unmarred and unbroken, the best and
                        most superb government ever founded by the wisdom and virtue of mortal
                        hands. But it was the work of patience, of thought and of statesmanship, and
                        the result of compromise, of conciliation and of concession. For three
                        quarters of a century, this government has been the pride of its people and
                        the envy of the civilized word. Its commerce has whitened every sea, its
                        arms have been victorious on every field, its industry has made the
                        wilderness vocal with the song of well rewarded toil, and its arts have made
                        themselves a habitation and a name in every school of genius and in every
                        land of story and song. Where now are the thrilling recollections of the
                        past, and the kindling hopes of the future? Where sleeps the heaven-born
                        Genius of the republic? Where slumbers in the dream of death, the patriotism
                        of the nation? Must the sun of liberty which rose in unclouded splendor,
                        upon this free and happy land, go down, through the broken and dishonored
                        fragments of the Union, in darkness and in blood? This surely can not be;
                        will not the God of our fathers, whose right arm delivered them from the
                        House of bondage, vouchsafe to their children, the promise of many days and
                        the beauty of this goodly heritage?--Will not the nation pause? Will not the
                        nation reflect before all is lost for ever? Permit the red hands of lust and
                        ambition, to break down the tower of your safety and your strength, and your
                        children's children may wander over the earth, forsaken and forlorn, without
                        the lamp of liberty to guide their steps in a strange land, and without the
                        sanctuary of a free government, to shelter them from the storms of anarchy
                        and revolution.--But if the Union must be dissolved, ********if no power can
                        stay the uplifted hand, if no human means can avert the sad, and shameful
                        catastrophe; and if this once proud and peaceful land must be rent by
                        fraternal strife and drenched in fraternal blood, and if free institutions
                        must be over thrown by kindred hands, and liberty cloven down in civil war,
                        let the party of the people and the party of the Union, clothed in sackcloth
                        and ashes, leave the imperishable record, of their devotion and patriotism
                        upon the cold marble slab, which shall mark the spot, where moulders the
                        ruins of all that was once cherished and beautiful, happy and prosperous, of
                        the mightiest empire ever reared by human hands, or made hallowed ground all
                        over, by the story of heroic deeds and more heroic virtue.</p>
                    <p>Now why cannot the exciting questions, which are disturbing and distracting
                        the country, be settled and adjusted on fair and honorable terms? Does the
                        South ask anything more than the enjoyment of equal rights and the exercise
                        of equal immunities? Does the South claim for her interests any protection,
                        and demand for her domestic institutions, the advantages of any prerogative,
                        which they are unwilling to concede and guarantee, in their broadest and
                        fullest extent to their brethern [sic] of the North? They ask for their just
                        rights and equal privileges under the protecting wings of that Constitution,
                        which was the work of the common sacrifice, and the common patriotism of the
                        whole country. They plead in the stirring eloquence of our native tongue,
                        for that "justice, general welfare, and domestic tranquilty [sic]" for whose
                        security and establishment, the constitution was ordained and the union of
                        the States made more perfect. But even if the North were clearly in the
                        right, should she not be ready and willing, in the generosity and
                        magnanimity of her power and greatness to concede much, very much indeed,
                        for the sake of the peace , the well being, and the blessed tranquility of
                        the nation. The pen of history, in the wide range of her vast dominions, has
                        never recorded anything so sad and melancholy, as the downfall of the
                        American Republic, and the dismemberment of the American Union. Let the
                        people rise up in the majesty of their sovereign will, and in the mightiness
                        of their great purpose, and their unanimous and potential voice, go forth
                        and ring through the land, the Union must, and shall be preserved. Let their
                        battle cry, go forth and ring through the land, until its deep and swelling
                        music, shall rouse and electrify the whole nation, for "liberty and Union,
                        now and for ever, one and inseparable."</p>
