                        interest, any longer and our people are settling down to their usual
                        occupations in their quiet way as formerly. The fear of an attack from "over
                        the line" has also died out, and we would not be much surprised to hear of
                        our young ladies and gentlemen getting up a pic-nic to Harper's Ferry some

                        mark of regard from the ladies of Chambersburg. The interesting ceremony
                        took place in the Diamond, in the presence of the 7th and 8th regiments and
                        a large concourse of citizens. The flag was presented by W. S. Stinger, on
                        behalf of the ladies in a very neat and able address. Col. Ripley responded,
                        on the part of the regiment, in a speech of great force and beauty. The
                        whole affair passed off very pleasantly and afforded a high degree of
                        gratification to the soldiers as well as our citizens.</p>

                    papers will be mailed for free while semi-weekly papers will have regular
                    postage. The Spirit believes that this is just an attempt by the Times to be
                    sure that the three semi-weekly papers in the area have to pay postage while the
                    Times doesn't.<br>

                    at the turnpike bridge, near Frederick, was fired upon, but escaped. As no down
                    trains have passed Frederick Junction for some hours, it is believed the track
                    or bridges above are destroyed. The country about [Chambersburg] is infested
