                <summary>The Spirit criticizes the New York papers, which dole out a great deal of
                    war advice. The New York Times has developed a plan of how to deal with
                    prisoners of war: when Confederate soldiers are captured, they should be packed
                    off to the interior of the Northern states to learn about civilization. The
                    Spirit disagrees with the Times' proposal and argues that the treatment of
                    prisoners of war should be trusted to the discretion of the Government.</summary>

                    example of genteel behavior for the other soldiers in town because they weren't
                    drunk and they didn't hang around the groggeries or other disreputable places.
                    They looked down upon the "great bulk of our soldiers who are degrading
                    themselves by their beastly habits."</summary>
