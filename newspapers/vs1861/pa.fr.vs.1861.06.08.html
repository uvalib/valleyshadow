<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>No advance movement has been made in Virginia. However, there is a great
                    deal of activity and an "unusual amount of secrecy which excite expectations and
                    curiosity." The morning papers in Washington are filled with accounts of

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A number of papers have printed the statements of a man who claims that he
                    was driven out of Texas for expressing Union sentiments. However, his stories of

                    United States to observe the strictest neutrality in their conduct."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Democrats Always Right</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit is "thoroughly disgusted" with Republican journals that say that
                    the Democrats have "'come round for the Union.'" Democrats have always supported
                    the Union and continue to do so by providing men and money to conduct the war.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>General Scott and Jeff Davis</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A member of the Seventh Regiment wrote in a letter to his father that he
                    had heard a good anecdote about General Scott. When asked what he intended to do
                    with Jefferson Davis, Scott "merely put up his open hand and gradually closed
                    his fingers till his hand was clinched." The soldiers believes that the war will
                    be short because the secessionists are getting alarmed.<br>

</blockquote>
<b>Prisoners</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit criticizes the New York papers, which dole out a great deal of
                    war advice. The New York Times has developed a plan of how to deal with
                    prisoners of war: when Confederate soldiers are captured, they should be packed
                    off to the interior of the Northern states to learn about civilization. The
                    Spirit disagrees with the Times' proposal and argues that the treatment of
                    prisoners of war should be trusted to the discretion of the Government.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Count Trigaut, captain of artillery in the French army, has travelled to
                    Washington to offer his services. He believes that the army needs more light
                    cavalry, like the mounted Chasseurs de Afrique.<br>

<b>Arrival and Departure of Troops</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Two additional regiments have arrived in Chambersburg and several others
                    are still expected. It is rumored that thirty thousand troops will be
                    concentrated in the area in preparation for an assault on Harper's Ferry.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>McMullen's Rangers</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>McMullen's Ranger's left town on Friday morning. These men offered a fine
                    example of genteel behavior for the other soldiers in town because they weren't
                    drunk and they didn't hang around the groggeries or other disreputable places.
                    They looked down upon the "great bulk of our soldiers who are degrading
                    themselves by their beastly habits."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Gen. Patterson</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit directs its readers to note the order issued by Major General
                    Patterson that is in another column of the paper. He is a fine man who the
                    soldiers of Pennsylvania can be proud to follow.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>"No Party Now"</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit criticizes the Republicans of Beaver county, who have placed in
                    nomination a full straight-out Republican County Ticket. The paper contends that
                    Republicans only hold to their pledge of "No Party Now" in counties where the
                    Democrats are in the ascendancy and ignore the pledge in counties that they
                    control.<br>

</blockquote>
<b>Mr. Crittenden for Congress</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Every Union man should exult at the announcement that Mr. Crittenden has
                    been nominated for the Ashland District in Congress. The Union supporters in

</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A committee in New York has offered $500 for the best national hymn or
                    song. The Spirit believes that "Money seldom inspires the muses." While the war
                    has brought forth an immense number of patriotic effusions, none have had the
                    "ring of the true metal."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Traitors</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit criticizes people who make it a business to "hunt traitors where
                    none exist, and subject innocent people to the suspicion of the public and the
                    surveillance of the authorities."<br>
