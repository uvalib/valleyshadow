                <excerpt>"Both Houses have passed the Confiscation Bill, which deprives every master
                    of all his slaves found giving aid to the rebels."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>This announcement will not be a startling one to those of our readers who
                        have watched the recent proceedings in Congress. Both Houses have passed the
                        Confiscation Bill, which deprives every master of all his slaves found
                        giving aid to the rebels. As every slave in the Seceded States must
                        necessarily, by his labor, give aid to the rebellion, this is a virtual and
                        practical abolition of slavery, and was so intended by its authors. The bill
                        was passed against the protest of Crittenden and other conservative
                        advocates of the war, by a vote of 60 to 48. The Abolition of slavery will
                        hereafter be a leading feature in the programme of the war.--<emph
