<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>It is reported "upon high authority" that if England sides with the South,
                    the Emperor Napoleon will side with the North because he doesn't want England to

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The recognition of the Confederacy by the European powers would give great
                    moral support to the South. While the powers appear reticent to anger the
                    federal government, they have also pointed out that de facto governments have

<b>Glad to Hear It</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gen. Patterson has taken charge of the Telegraph Office in Chambersburg and
                    has placed an operator there to supervise all the army-related dispatches. This
                    action pleases the Spirit, which believes that it will "put an effectual stop to
                    the lying sensation dispatches, and bogus news, furnished, from this point, by
                    some hangers-on to the skirts of the army who call themselves 'Reporters' for

                    three-fourths of a mile north of Greencastle. Other troops that recently left

<b>Something Wrong</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>On Tuesday a number of companies from "Camp Chambers" rushed into town to
                    procure food. They complained of the scarcity of provision and the poor quality
                    of the food in camp. The Spirit intends to stand up for the rights of the
                    volunteers and vows to expose any corruption in the procurement procedure if the

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Tuesday morning a number of companies from "Camp Chambers," near this
                        place broke the Guards and rushed to town to procure something to eat. These
                        met appear perfectly reckless and desperate and must become utterly
                        demoralized unless their wrongs are speedily righted. They complain bitterly
                        of the scarcity of provision--the meat, they say, is frequently putrid and
                        the bread never in sufficient quantity, and oftentimes none at all, which,
                        they state was the case all day Monday and Tuesday morning. The hungry men
                        would stand it no longer and made a rush to town for something to eat. We do
                        not know whether it is "red-tape," or too much Whiskey, that occasions this
                        shameful neglect of the men, but from whatever cause it proceeds, we hope to
                        see it remedied speedily and effectually.--We intend to stand up for the
                        rights of our volunteers and unless their condition is improved, and their
                        necessary wants supplied, we will be compelled to make an expose that may
                        occasion some fluttering among the "Brass buttons."</p>

<b>The Difference</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A Republican "neighbor" lauded the Rhode Island Regiment that recently
                    arrived in Chambersburg as being "among the best equipped troops." The Spirit
                    points out that their uniforms cost $8 while the miserable clothing of the
                    Pennsylvania Volunteers cost $17. The Spirit asks what "our neighbor [has to]
                    say in extenuation for this sample of Republican management of our State
                    military affairs?"<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Troops</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Sixteen regiments of Pennsylvania Volunteers, plus nine companies of
                    regulars, are encamped in or have recently left Chambersburg on their way to the
                    enemy lines.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Movements of Troops</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Almost every day and night trains are arriving in town loaded with horses,
                    provisions, and ammunition. The troops continue to arrive and depart.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Southern Papers</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The stoppage of the mail from the Southern states has cut off the Southern
                    press. However, the Spirit doesn't believe that this is a great loss since these
                    papers didn't report on troop movements or any other army related information.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>More Disgrace</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit is outraged that incompetent men are being appointed to command
                    the Pennsylvania troops. They direct the readers attention to the article in
                    column 4, "Appointments not fit to be Made," in which a Republican paper makes
                    the same complaint.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Good Sign</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"All experienced writers upon arms for soldiers denounce the use of pistols
                    for privates and ridicule the idea of knives." The volunteers should instead
                    rely on their bayonets in a close fight.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Coming Election</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In the excitement over the coming of the war, everyone has forgotten about
                    the coming election. The Republicans have urged voters to forget about party.
                    The Juniata Democrat believes that this is a ruse to add strength to the
                    Republican party, which can no longer win voters with their sectional doctrines.
                    They urge every Democrat to "stand up for his country in its hour of trial, but
                    still cling to Democratic principles."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Juniata Democrat</blockquote>
<b>"No More Party"</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Two or three weeks ago, the Republicans insisted that party issues had been
                    set aside in favor of unity. Now, however, it appears that Republicanism has
                    been resurrected as the party members call conventions and make nominations.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Western Reserve of Ohio, a well known abolitionist region, has "thus
                    far responded but feebly to the call for troops." The governor attempted to hide
                    this low turnout by "preventing the mustering into the service of the United
                    States of regiments raised in other quarters of the State, in order to give the
                    abolition corner a chance." However, the War Department ordered him to stop this

<b>A Scoundrel</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

                    Harper's Ferry. In it, he discusses camp life and the fear that, if the Union

                    general act of bankruptcy similar to the one passed following the panic of 1837.
                    The text of the act is included.<br>

<b>Tobacco</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Kentucky and other tobacco growing states will gain great advantage by not
                    seceding because they will not have to face the blockade. While the American
                    government doesn't tax tobacco, the European governments place heavy duties upon
                    it and receive a tremendous amount of revenue from tobacco sales.<br>

<b>An Interesting Table</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit reprints a list, drawn from the 1860 census, of the number of
                    white males between the ages of eighteen and forty five who live in the free
                    states, border slave states, seceded states, and territories.<br>

<b>The Passage of Troops over Railroads</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>

                    to make an abatement of 33 percent of the usual charge for carrying troops or
                    provisions of war. However, all the railroads of the state have in their
                    charters a provision that states that troops and munitions of war shall be
                    carried at fifty percent of the usual rate. The editor questions who makes the
