</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is no news of any importance from the South. Affairs are progressing
                        there much as usual. There has been no attempt, up to the present writing,
                        either to reinforce or evacuate Fort Sumpter. The "Government" we now have seems to be acting on the oscillatory
                        principle--"we will and we won't, we shall and we shan't, we'll be d----d if
                        we do, and we'll be d---d if we don't" They are evidently in a dilemma and
                        which horn they intend to take hold of Old Abe's latest anecdote does not
                        disclose. The Commissioners from the Southern Confederacy are still hovering
                        about Washington and have bearded the "Government" lion in its den without
                        being in the least terrified by its "long military cloak and Scotch cap" or
                        hung for their temerity. Mr. Buchanan was strongly urged and loudly
                        condemned for not hanging their predecessors as traitors, but it seems
                        "things are not now as they used to was [sic];" the so-called traitors have
                        attained a very respectable standing in Republican circles at Washington,
                        and nary "bill of indictment for treason" has been sent up against them.
                        There [sic] latest instructions are to negotiate for the purchase of the
                        City of Washington. In reply to this proposal Old Abe is reported to have
                        told the following anecdote:--"When a boy I caught too [sic] cats and tied
                        their tails together and hung them over a split rail. I left them in this
                        condition all night and on returning to them in the morning there was
                        nothing left of them except their tails hanging over the rail." "Now
                        gentlemen," said Old Abe with a knowing wink, "you can perceive the
                        application there will be nothing left of Washington four years hence worth
                        purchasing." The commissioners were satisfied and pushed their negotiations
                        no further.</p>
                    <p>The latest intelligence form the land of Cotton is to the effect that the
                        secession States are busy ratifying the Constitution and preparing to defend
                        themselves in case of war by raising large imaginary armies. The real war-spirit, if ever existed, seems,
                        however, to be dying out North and South, and the Sons of Mars, in both
                        sections, are assuming the position of the valiant Dutchman who declared
                        that he would "as lief live as die and liefer too." Even the sanguinary
                        McPherson has ceased his blustering about "blood
                        letting" and now coos in strains as gentle as a sucking-dove. The
                        Republicans are coming down handsomely. They would just as soon not fight
                        and all their recent swaggering about "seeking the bubble reputation even at
                        the cannons mouth meant nothing more than that the regular army might stand
                        the brunt of battle when there was any fighting to be done. Perhaps the
                        famous exploit of their Commander-in-Chief, at Baltimore, has destroyed
                        confidence in his pluck and may account for the simmering down on the party
                        of the rank and file. We are happy at all events to perceive that the
                        fighting mania is on the decline and that the outrage of the Republican
                        party, like Bob Acres, is "oozing out at their elbows" This is just right,
                        and we must commend their discretion which is
                        always the better part of valor.</p>
