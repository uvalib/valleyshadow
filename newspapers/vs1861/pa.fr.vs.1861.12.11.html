<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Instead of a war for the Union it is beginning to be feared that the
                        administration will allow it to degenerate into a war for "contracts" and
                        the "nigger." While a hungry pack, whose name is legion, are after
                        government contracts, another set are using every means to drag the nigger
                        into the strife for no other reason, that we can see, than that the war may
                        be prolonged so that fresh contacts may be forthcoming and time allowed for
                        the old ones to be completed. It does very well for those who are filling
                        their pockets by furnishing army supplies, and in innumerable ways plucking
                        the soldiers and the government, to cry "no peace," but the people who pay
                        the taxes to help on the war are curious to know whether their money is to
                        be expended for the restoration of the Union, or for the benefit of
                        contractors and freedom of the negro? It might be worth while, just at this
                        time when a lack of confidence is begining [sic] to show itself as to the
                        design of the war, for the administration to give the people the fullest
                        assurance that the object of the war is the restoration of the Union and
                        nothing else.</p>
                    <p>It wants something of this sort to insure a pull all together on the part of
                        the loyal people over the country. We regret to be compelled to say that the
                        Message and Reports of the different departments fail to give this
                        assurance, or establish that degree of confidence necessary to a speedy and
                        successful crushing out of the fell spirit of disunion now so rampant in the
                        South, and likely to rear its head in the North unless abolition receives a
                        rebuke at the hands of the government. Both Gen. SCOTT and Gen. McCLELLAN
                        proclaimed the joyous tidings, a few weeks ago, that the war would be a short one, and the hopes of the nation were
                        raised to the highest pitch of gladness that the unnatural strife was about
                        to terminate. Are we to be disappointed? Is that abomination of all
                        abominations--abolitionism--to be permitted to frustrate the designs of our
                        Generals, upset their predictions, and kindle a new rebellion in the country
                        before the existing one is quelled? If the abolition policy now inaugurated
                        by a part of the Cabinet, and the present Republican Congress, has the
                        effect, as most assuredly it will, or protracting the war, the people upon
                        whom the war debt falls, and by whom it must be paid, will have no
                        difficulty in understanding the cause that keeps it up--where and to whom to
                        attach blame and will not fail to hold them to a fearful accountability.
                        Will the administration let us know in plain words what we are fighting
                        for--is it Sambo or the Union?</p>
