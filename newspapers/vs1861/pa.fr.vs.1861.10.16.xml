                <excerpt>"Although we have been beaten in the County and in the Legislative and
                    Judicial Districts, we still have good grounds for congratulating our Democratic

                    <p>We have been unable to obtain the official table of the vote in Franklin
                        county. The return Judges met on Friday last and after counting off the vote
                        of the several districts adjourned to meet again on the second Tuesday of
                        November to count the vote of the volunteers that may come in in the mean
                        time. The vote cannot be officially published until the Judges meet again
                        and count this vote and add it to the returns. We give all the returns we
                        could gather up unofficially and they must satisfy our readers for the
                        present.</p>
                    <p>Although we have been beaten in the County, and in the Legislative and
                        Judicial districts, we have still good grounds for congratulating our
                        Democratic friends on the noble efforts they made to sustain their party.
                        They have not labored in vain. Their party organization has been maintained
                        and placed upon a footing that will make it victorious in the future. The
                        plot to destroy the Democratic party has received its quietus, and those who
                        concocted it are now ashamed of their doings. In this Judicial District,
                        where the opposition ticket ought to roll up two thousand of a majority,
                        NILL has less than one hundred! In this county the <emph rend="italic"
                        >honor</emph> of some men here was pledged to Mr. FORWARD that Mr. NILL
                        would receive not less than two thousand of a majority. The Democracy kept
                        it down to less than seven hundred. Surely that is some cause for
                        congratulation.</p>
                    <p>In this borough Nill's friends claimed four hundred of a majority his vote
                        left him but little over one hundred and fifty, and in the district
                        including North and South Wards, Hamilton and Guilford, they counted on six
                        hundred of a majority certain. He received but two hundred and nineteen.
                        This vote shows that the Democratic party is not to be trifled with, and
                        those who imagined they could merge it into a "no party" have received a
                        serious backset.</p>

                <excerpt>"Altogether, there is much in the late election, to gratify the Democracy
                    of the State, and to cause them to take courage and look hopefully to the
                    future, for a triumphant vindication of their past policy and present position."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>From the complexion of the election returns from various parts of the State,
                        which come in very slowly, we have little doubt that the Democrats have a
                        majority of the popular vote, and probably have elected a majority of the
                        members of the House of Representatives. We have never known an election the
                        returns of which it was so difficult to obtain. We publish in this weeks
                        [sic] paper all that have reached us. It will be observed that the current
                        of the vote runs decidedly in favor of the Democratic party, and indicates
                        that it is destined to control the politics of the State in the future. A
                        Democratic Senator is elected in Philadelphia, one in Schuylkill, and in all
                        probability, one in Montgomery and one in Bucks. These are all gains.-- All
                        the old Democratic districts, some of which had gone astray of late have
                        wheeled into line, and given increased Democratic majorities. Northampton
                        gives about 1500; little Lehigh 1700; York 1600; Schuylkill 1500; Cumberland
                        600; Columbia 700; Westmoreland 1000, and so on; and in several counties,
                        such as Lancaster, Lebanon, Chester, &amp;c., where the liberal
                        Republicans united with the Democrats in making their nominations, the Union
                        tickets, composed of Republicans and Democrats, in fair proportions, have
                        succeeded by large majorities over the straight or ultra Republicans.
                        Altogether, there is much in the late election, to gratify the Democracy of
                        the State, and to cause them to take courage and look hopefully to the
                        future, for a triumphant vindication of their past policy and present
                        position.</p>

                <excerpt>"It is evident from this state of things that we are about entering upon a
                    new era in the financial history of the country. Hereafter direct taxation is
                    inevitable, as custom duties will be entirely inadequate to the support of the

                <transcript>
                    <p>It is now authoritatively announced that the receipts of the customs for the
                        present year will not amount to more than twenty million dollars, ten
                        million less than even Secretary Chase's estimate. When the Morrill tariff
                        was first enacted it was claimed that the receipts under it would reach
                        sixty millions, but the circumstances of the country have so changed since
                        then that the estimates of that period are valueless now.</p>
                    <p>It is evident from this state of things that we are about entering upon a new
                        era in the financial history of the country. Hereafter direct taxation is
                        inevitable, as custom duties will be entirely inadequate to the support of
                        the Government and the payment of the enormous debts we are contracting. The
                        foreign trade of the country will, in any event, be much less for several
                        years to come than it has been in the past, and the deficit in our revenues
                        in consequence must be provided for in some other way. This matter will
                        assume great importance before the sitting of Congress, and upon that body
                        will be thrown the delicate and reponsible [sic] duty of originating a new
                        system of ways and means to furnish the Government with money to meet its
                        current expenses and pay its debts.</p>
