                    the suggestion that there be a general cessation of hostilities until Congress
                    can meet and negotiate a peaceful solution. He states that the South desires
                    peace, but that it "is at a loss how to reply without a repetition of the
                    language it has used on every possible occasion that it has presented itself

                    from Harper's Ferry disappointed the Union troops and led to a change in Union
                    plans. In addition, it appears that a battle occurred at Falling Waters between

                    to leave Virginia because they took an oath of allegiance to the Union. This
                    oath was a condition of their release. General Beauregard criticized them for
                    taking their oath, insisting that they should have remained prisoners to "induce
                    the Government to regard disunionists captured in arms against the United States
                    as prisoners of war."<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gen. Beauregard may be planning on retreating from Manassas Junction now
                    that Harper's Ferry has been abandoned. This would allow him to reinforce lines
                    near Fredericksburg or Warrenton Junction, which would be much more difficult to
                    attack.<br>

<b>The Virginia Plan of the Campaign</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Confederate army appears to have undergone a change in strategy. All
                    eyes are turned toward Manassas Junction. Some Southerners believe that
                    Alexandria was a feint to make important movements at Norfolk, Yorktown, or
                    Aquia Creek. General Lee, however, believes that there will be a great battle at

                    as anything from newspapers sources which we have direct from Virginia. It is

<b>Grumbling at the South</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Mercury criticizes the defensive strategy of the Confederate army. They
                    ask why more men weren't stationed at Alexandria and why more aren't at Manassas
                    now. They wonder if a third of the volunteers have been accepted into the army
                    and assert that a large army could drive every Yankee across the Pennsylvania
                    line.<br>

                    confined to the North. The Charleston Mercury, of the 2nd inst., is in a bad
                    way, and feels itself highly aggrieved by the Fabian policy of the Confederate
                    leaders."<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"How very consistent it is in the Republican Journals to doubt the fidelity
                    of men who have, all their lives, been Union men, and at the same time applaud
                    the appointments of Corwin Burlingame, Banks, and others, men who have been
                    praying for a dissolution of the Union for the last quarter of a century.
