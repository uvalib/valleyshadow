                    <p>--On Saturday morning last our citizens on leaving their beds were astonished
                        to find "all out of doors" covered with a bed of snow some four or five
                        inches deep, and this, be it remembered, on the fourth day of the</p>
                    <p><br>Merrie month of May. <br>When the violets are a blooming <br>And the
                        meadows fresh and gay." <br>We will not undertake to account for such an
                        unnatural phenomenon on "natural principles!" We can only surmise, in
                        accordance with scientific rules made and provided in all doubtful cases,
                        that the "Clerk of the Weather" has seceded; cut down the North Pole with
                        the stars and stripes, left the trap-door of Simm's Hole open and vamosed
                        South!</p>
                    <p>If he has been playing the "traitor to the North" in this way we only hope
                        that Uncle Abe's sogers may capture him "down South" and bring him on to
                        "Camp Slifer" to be court martialed and "snow-balled." The men here have a cordial grudge at the old Chap for
                        the "pitiless peltings" he has bestowed upon them and would like an
                        opportunity to reciprocate.</p>
