<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Among the many fraternal and benevolent institutions of our land, none stands
                        higher in public esteem than the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. An
                        off-shoot of an English parentage, with an existence of not quite forty-one
                        years, it numbers its lodges by thousands and its members by hundreds of
                        thousands. Our State alone contains over five hundred lodges, having over
                        forty thousand members.</p>
                    <p>Among such a fraternity, it is natural that the memories of its earlier
                        brethren, whose wisdom formed its laws, and laid deep and firm the
                        foundations of its prosperity, should be treasured up; and accordingly we
                        find that fraternal love is quietly raising
                        monuments, here and there, over the land, to perpetuate their services, and
                        mark their last resting places.</p>
                    <p>Such a Tribute has just been erected, in the Cedar Grove Cemetery, in this borough, by the GRAND
                        and SUBORDINATE LODGES of Pennsylvania I. O. O. F., to the memory of Past Grand Master AARON NICHOLS, the first
                        presiding officer of the Grand Lodge of this State.</p>
                    <p>The Monument is of Connecticut Brownstone--21 feet high--in the earlier
                        Gothic style, and weighs five and three quarter tuns. The base is 5 feet, 3
                        inches square, and 10 inches thick. Above this is an enriched, moulded base,
                        4 feet, 2 inches square, and 1 foot, 3 inches thick, with Gothic foliage
                        partly covering the mouldings. On this rests a third moulded base, broken
                        around the die block, and intersected by a circular base which supports 4
                        columns of about 6 inches in diameter and 2 feet, 8 inches in height. Each
                        side of the die is flushed with a deeply recessed Gothic panel, containing
                        the inscriptions--thus:</p>
                    <p>ON THE WEST.</p>
                    <p>AARON NICHOLS,</p>
                    <p><br>First Grand Master <br>OF <br>THE GRAND LODGE <br>I. O. O. F. <br>OF
                        <br>Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p><br>Born 1778. Died 1856.</p>
                    <p>ON THE NORTH.</p>
                    <p>A</p>
                    <p><br>PAST GRAND, 1806. <br>GRAND MASTER, 1823-4. <br>GRAND TREASURER,
                        1821-6. <br>He rests by the side of his Wife, <br>SARAH.</p>
                    <p>ON THE EAST.</p>
                    <p>"Visit the sick, relieve the <br>distressed, bury the dead, <br>and educate
                        the Orphan." <br>is the command of our laws.</p>
                    <p>ON THE SOUTH.</p>
                    <p>ERECTED <br>BY THE <br>Grand and Subordinate <br>LODGES <br>of Penn'a
                        <br>I. O. O. F.</p>
                    <p>An embattled cap rests upon and protects the die block. Above this is an
                        octagonal moulded base, supporting a circular fluted shaft, made of a single
                        stone, 9 feet high, and richly ornamental with raised Ivy vines and leaves,
                        in the spiral flutes, for two-thirds of its entire height. The base of the
                        Shaft has on it four raised shields, upon which are carved in relief the following Emblems of the Order, viz:
                        On the West, a Past Grand Master's Emblem, the Heart and
                            Hand; on the North, the axe and links;
                        on the East, the All-seeing Eye; on the South,
                            the Bundle of Rods.</p>
                    <p>Surmounting the shaft is an octagonal moulded and embattled Cap, crowned by a
                        beautiful, well-proportioned, draped Urn.</p>
                    <p>The NICHOLS MONUMENT excels in massiveness and beauty of design anything of
                        its kind in this region of the country. It is a worthy tribute to the memory
                        of one of the founders of American Odd Fellowship--an honor to the great
                        brotherhood by which it was erected--a credit to Messrs Ashman &amp;
                        Co., of Baltimore, by whom it was designed and executed, and an ornament to
                        our popular and beautiful Cemetary.</p>
                    <p>The idea of erecting this monument originated with Columbus Lodge, No. 75, of
                        this place, and has been carried out, at an expense of about $550, under the
                        supervision of a joint Committee of Columbus Lodge No. 75 and Chambersburg
                        Lodge, No. 175. Its location, upon the highest ground in the Cemetary, is
                        eminently beautiful, and when inclosed with a neat and substantial railing,
                        it will form one of the most attractive spots in that "City of the Silent
                        Dead."</p>
