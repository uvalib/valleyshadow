<b>The emancipationists . . .</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the emancipationists have gotten themselves entangled in their
                    inconsistencies. They have generally argued that slaves were persons, not
                    property. Now, however, they have adopted a policy of liberating the slaves on
                    the grounds that slaves are rebel property. If the slaves are indeed such
                    valuable property, how can the government set them free and thus lose so many
                    millions of dollars?<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The emancipationists get themselves entangled insome [sic] strange
                        inconsistencies by demanding the liberation of the slaves because they are
                        rebel property. Hitherto they have contended that slaves were not property,
                        but persons. Now they assert that these same negroe [sic] slaves are as much
                        property, and is as liable to confiscation as horses, oxen and munitions of
                        war. If this is the correct doctrine, how can the Government be justified in
                        seizing so large an amount of valuable property, and then turning it adrift,
                        to the value of many millions of dollars' when it would fetch enough in the
                        market after the restoration of peace to defray a large proportion of the
                        expenses of the war? If the slaves are property in one sense, why not in
                        all?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A short time ago one of our Merchants was swindled out of about $75 worth of
                        silks by a young girl. A "contraband" relieved another Merchant of a couple
                        of hams in a sharp way. An attempt at "shoplifting" a piece of calico, by a
                        woman, was made in one of our stores the other day.--An overcoat was stolen
                        from one of our Hotels last week. A young man was robbed on our public
                        streets a few nights ago, and several other thefts have been committed in
                        and about town within a short time past. We seem to be "advancing backwards"
                        in honesty and morality, and as no arrests have been made, and nobody
                        converted from the "error of their ways," it is likely we'll keep advancing so far as law and gospel are
                    concerned.</p>
