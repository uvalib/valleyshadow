<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday afternoon a number of soldiers, from different companies,
                        collected in that disreputable quarter of our town, known as Wolfstown, and
                        for some cause, that we have not been able to clearly ascertain, made an
                        attack upon a house occupied by a colored man named Frank Jones. The windows
                        of the house were broken in, the doors forced open, the stove upset and the
                        colored man and his wife knocked down. In the melee Jones discharged a gun the contents of which wounded two of
                        the soldiers in the legs. The cry was then raised to "kill the nigger" and
                        he immediately fled from the house going out of the backdoor and crossing
                        the lots in the direction of West Market street. When his flight was
                        discovered a Lieutenant in one of the Pittsburg companies, attached to the
                        Seventh Regiment, who had arrived on the ground, called for "six good men"
                        to follow him, and led off in pursuit of the negro. The soldiers pursued the
                        man to the residence of GEORGE EYSTER, Esq., on Federal Hill, where they
                        found him concealed in the kitchen chimney.--They dragged him from the
                        chimney but assured the lady of the house, Mr. Eyster not being at home,
                        that they would do him no harm, that they intended only taking him to jail.
                        This we believe, was the sole intention of the party who first arrested
                        Jones.--They brought him down the yard until near the gate, at the lane
                        leading to the barn, here they were met by the Lieutenant who had given
                        chase from Wolfstown, who ordered the men, who had hold of Jones, to stand
                        aside when he instantly discharged his revolver into him, the first ball
                        striking him in front of the body. Jones then turned and made for the fence,
                        when four other shots were fired at him, from the same pistol, in rapid
                        succession, the ball striking him in the back. While this was going on one
                        of the soldiers was beating him over the head with a heavy club. He fell on
                        receiving the fifth shot when a number of bayonet and sword wounds were
                        inflicted upon him. He was a long time dying while the Lieutenant and the
                        soldiers stood around him and would not permit any one to afford him any
                        relief.</p>
                    <p>A large and excited crowd soon collected at the spot and threats were very
                        freely made to burn the body, quarter it, &amp;c. Several shots, one of
                        which accidentally struck a soldier in the right groin, inflicting a severe
                        wound, were fired, at the dead body. Mr. Eyster, upon whose premises the
                        body lay, and who is Prosecuting Attorney for the county, obtained a company
                        of soldiers from Gen. WILLIAMS to keep down further disturbance and to have
                        the body removed. This company was marched to the spot where the body lay
                        but through the order of a subordinate officer was marched back and the body
                        suffered to remain on the ground exposed to further mutilation. Mr. EYSTER
                        then, with the assistance of some citizens, removed the body to the jail and
                        had it locked up. 'Squire Hammond summoned a Jury of Inquest and a post-mortem examination of the body ordered to be
                        made. This duty was assigned to Drs. HAMILTON and BOYLE who on Sunday
                        morning made a thorough dissection of the body at the jail, and before the
                        Jury of Inquest described the number, extent and character of the wounds on
                        the body. It appears from their testimony that there were twenty wounds in
                        all, six being bullet wounds and the balance incised and contused wounds.
                        One of the shot wounds in the back was described as having passed through
                        the shoulder blade and through both large cavities of the heart and lodged
                        in the breast bone in front. Another of the wounds was described as a sword
                        wound passing through the arm, entering the chest, breaking a rib, and then
                        deeply penetrating the lung. After the examination the body was laid out in
                        suitable grave clothing, placed in a coffin, and sent home to the family of
                        the deceased, who had it buried on Monday forenoon.</p>
                    <p>The soldiers wounded by Jones are in the Hospitals of their respective
                        regiments, and their injuries, though severe, are doing well. The soldier,
                        accidently shot, it is also thought will recover from his wound.</p>
                    <p>We understand the finding of the jury implicates four persons in the killing
                        of Jones. One has already been arrested, and warrants are in the hands of
                        the proper officers for the arrest of the other parties implicated.</p>
                    <p>We purposely refrain from mentioning names, or making any comments that would
                        excite or prejudice the public mind against the parties envolved in this
                        unfortunate occurrence. It would be highly improper to do so as the matter
                        will undergo a legal investigation, and the accused will be dealt with, not
                        as public opinion, but, as justice may determine.</p>
                    <p>The particulars of the affair, as we have given them above, are mainly
                        derived from the evidence taken before the Coroners jury.</p>

                    dead letter, requiring a certain number of whites to each hundred blacks on
                    every plantation are now rigidly enforced."<br>
