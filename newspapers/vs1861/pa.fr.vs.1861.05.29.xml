                    that contained three hundred passengers. It is difficult for journalists to
                    determine the particulars of the seizure because the government refuses to let
                    civilians cross over into Virginia. The paper complains that "This role is

                <commentary>The following article "seems to us to be a very correct exposition of
                    the rights and the duties of citizens of the United States." While every man has
                    the right to express dissent, every man also "owes certain duties to the
                    government which he cannot escape."</commentary>

                    for artillery and there was thus no authority for recruiting this company.</summary>
