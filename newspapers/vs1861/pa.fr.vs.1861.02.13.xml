                    <p>Among the many fraternal and benevolent institutions of our land, none stands
                        higher in public esteem than the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. An
                        off-shoot of an English parentage, with an existence of not quite forty-one
                        years, it numbers its lodges by thousands and its members by hundreds of
                        thousands. Our State alone contains over five hundred lodges, having over
                        forty thousand members.</p>
                    <p>Among such a fraternity, it is natural that the memories of its earlier
                        brethren, whose wisdom formed its laws, and laid deep and firm the
                        foundations of its prosperity, should be treasured up; and accordingly we
                        find that <emph rend="italic">fraternal love</emph> is quietly raising
                        monuments, here and there, over the land, to perpetuate their services, and
                        mark their last resting places.</p>
                    <p>Such a <emph rend="italic">Tribute</emph> has just been erected, in the <emph
                            rend="italic">Cedar Grove Cemetery</emph>, in this borough, by the GRAND
                        and SUBORDINATE LODGES of Pennsylvania I. O. O. F., to the memory of <emph
                            rend="italic">Past Grand Master</emph> AARON NICHOLS, the first
                        presiding officer of the Grand Lodge of this State.</p>
                    <p>The Monument is of Connecticut Brownstone--21 feet high--in the earlier
                        Gothic style, and weighs five and three quarter tuns. The base is 5 feet, 3
                        inches square, and 10 inches thick. Above this is an enriched, moulded base,
                        4 feet, 2 inches square, and 1 foot, 3 inches thick, with Gothic foliage
                        partly covering the mouldings. On this rests a third moulded base, broken
                        around the die block, and intersected by a circular base which supports 4
                        columns of about 6 inches in diameter and 2 feet, 8 inches in height. Each
                        side of the die is flushed with a deeply recessed Gothic panel, containing
                        the inscriptions--thus:</p>
                    <p>ON THE WEST.</p>

                        1821-6. <lb/>He rests by the side of his Wife, <lb/>SARAH.</p>
                    <p>ON THE EAST.</p>
                    <p>"Visit the sick, relieve the <lb/>distressed, bury the dead, <lb/>and educate
                        the Orphan." <lb/>is the command of our laws.</p>
                    <p>ON THE SOUTH.</p>
                    <p>ERECTED <lb/>BY THE <lb/>Grand and Subordinate <lb/>LODGES <lb/>of Penn'a
                        <lb/>I. O. O. F.</p>
                    <p>An embattled cap rests upon and protects the die block. Above this is an
                        octagonal moulded base, supporting a circular fluted shaft, made of a single
                        stone, 9 feet high, and richly ornamental with raised Ivy vines and leaves,
                        in the spiral flutes, for two-thirds of its entire height. The base of the
                        Shaft has on it four raised shields, upon which are carved <emph
                            rend="italic">in relief</emph> the following Emblems of the Order, viz:
                        On the West, a Past Grand Master's Emblem, <emph rend="italic">the Heart and
                            Hand;</emph> on the North, <emph rend="italic">the axe and links;</emph>
                        on the East, <emph rend="italic">the All-seeing Eye;</emph> on the South,
                            <emph rend="italic">the Bundle of Rods.</emph></p>
                    <p>Surmounting the shaft is an octagonal moulded and embattled Cap, crowned by a
                        beautiful, well-proportioned, draped Urn.</p>
                    <p>The NICHOLS MONUMENT excels in massiveness and beauty of design anything of
                        its kind in this region of the country. It is a worthy tribute to the memory
                        of one of the founders of American Odd Fellowship--an honor to the great
                        brotherhood by which it was erected--a credit to Messrs Ashman &amp;
                        Co., of Baltimore, by whom it was designed and executed, and an ornament to
                        our popular and beautiful Cemetary.</p>
                    <p>The idea of erecting this monument originated with Columbus Lodge, No. 75, of
                        this place, and has been carried out, at an expense of about $550, under the
                        supervision of a joint Committee of Columbus Lodge No. 75 and Chambersburg
                        Lodge, No. 175. Its location, upon the highest ground in the Cemetary, is
                        eminently beautiful, and when inclosed with a neat and substantial railing,
                        it will form one of the most attractive spots in that "City of the Silent
                        Dead."</p>
