                <origin/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The debates in both houses of Congress last week, on the slave question 
                    were highly interesting and important.  The resolution introduced in the 
                    Senate by Mr. Mason, for an inquiry into the Harper's Ferry affair, gave 
                    rise to the discussion in that body.  The resolution is admitted on all 
                    hands to be a proper one, yet the Republican Senators have, in an 
                    apparently factious spirit, delayed its passage.  These same gentleman, 
                    however, have unanimously and with every appearance of sincerity, 
                    denounced Brown's enterprise, and disclaimed for themselves and the 
                    great mass of their people any sympathy for such interferences with our 
                    rights.</p>
                    <p> Helper's book is the subject under discussion in the House of 
                        Representatives.  Many of the Republican members, including Sherman, 
                        their candidate for Speaker, recommended the book for general 
                        circulation in the Presidential canvass of 1856.  They cannot relieve 
                        themselves of the odium which justly attaches to their act, but it is 
                        gratifying to see that they repudiate the sentiments of the book and 
                        seem ashamed of the business.  Sherman and others declare that they hold 
                        no opinions hostile to the rights of slaveholders, and that they never 
                        read or saw Helper's publication, although they endorsed it!  As 
                        remarked by a member, Mr. Sherman is not the right sort of man for 
                        Speaker, as he might sign bills without knowing what they contain.  It 
                        is proper, however, that he should have the benefit of his own 
                        explanation.  We state therefore that Francis P. Blair says Helper 
                        promised to expunge "the obnoxious matter" from the work, and it was 
                        upon this assurance that many members of Congress were induced to 
                        recommend it.  The New York Tribune also says, the extracts from 
                        Helper's book, published in the papers, "were not in the compendium 
                        prepared for general  circulation, and the Congressional names appended to them are, 
                        therefore, morally forged, as they never recommended any such 
                        sentiments."</p> 
                    <p>Some of the Democratic members improved the opportunity to 
                    make a little party capital.- -Senator Mallory, of Florida, thought 
                    "the only safety for the country would be found in the Democratic 
                    party."  Mr. Reuben Davis, of Mississippi, proclaimed in the House that 
                    "it was the duty of all conservative and patriotic men to rally to the 
                    support of the Democracy, the only national party."  Senator Iverson, of 
                    Georgia, another Democrat, was not quite so complimentary.  "He believed 
                    the Northern portion of the Democracy was as rotten on this question as 
                    the Black Republicans."  If Sherman was elected Speaker of the House, he 
                    would counsel his constituents to break up the Union.  "That would be 
                    his advice, but he did not know that his people would follow it, for he 
                    was considered even in Georgia a little ultra." Rather so.</p>
                    <p> The intemperate zeal of a certain class of Southern members was illustrated 
                        at one stage of the debate.  Mr. Nelson, of Tenn., delivered an eloquent 
                        and patriotic speech in favor of a peaceable settlement of the pending 
                        difficulties, when what does Mr. R. A. Pryor do but pounce upon him as 
                        fiercely as if he had advocated abolition sentiments.  We regret that 
                        the management of affairs for Virginia and the South is not left to such 
                        men as Mr. Millson, of Norfolk, whose calm and statesmanlike speech was 
                        in striking contrast to the harangues of some of his colleagues.</p></transcript>
