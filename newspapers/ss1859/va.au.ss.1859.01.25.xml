                    19th, 1859.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Staunton Spectator--<lb/>Dear Sir:  
                        Within the last two days I have seen the communication of your  
                        correspondent "Waynesboro," addressed to me in your paper of the 11th 
                        inst., censuring  the Superintendent of Transportation for the winter 
                        arrangement of the Freight trains  West of the Blue Ridge.  On the 31st 
                        ultimo, a number of gentlemen residing in  Waynesboro, addressed me a 
                        private letter on the same subject.  The subject was  submitted to the 
                        Board yesterday, and I now send you a copy of my answer to Messrs.  
                        Bell, Reeder and others, together with a note from the Superintendent of 
                        Transportation, which I hope will prove satisfactory.   Very 
                        Respectfully, E. Fontaine  Office Va. Central Railroad Co.</p>
                    <p>Richmond, 
                        Jan. 5th, 1859.<lb/>Messrs. Jno. J. Bell and Thos. J. Reeder and 
                        others--Gentlemen:  I have received  your communication requesting that 
                        the arrangements for running the trains may be  changed back to what 
                        they were previous to the late winter arrangement, and have  given to it 
                        the respectful consideration to which it is entitled.  My answer is 
                        delayed a  day or two to embrace an opportunity for conference with the 
                        Superintendent of  Transportation.</p><p>I am happy in believing that you do 
                            not belong to the class who take pleasure in  complaining of the 
                            management of the Company, and therefore trust that you will be  
                            prepared to believe that the Superintendent would not wantonly subject 
                            your  community to inconvenience by any change in the running of the 
                            trains.--That officer,  as well as myself, appreciates the importance of 
                            making the Company popular, but I am  sure you will agree with me, that 
                            popularity ought not to be sought at the sacrifice of  the interests of 
                            the stockholders.  The schedule of running one set of trains on a  
                            Railroad cannot very readily be appreciated with all the reasons calling 
                            for its  adoptions by those who are not familiar with the various 
                            details, each operating on  another, and consequently we have to ask of 
                            those who do not approve that they will  not suffer themselves to 
                            believe that a change would be made without adequate  reasons therefor 
                            [sic].
                            The most important object to be obtained in working a Railroad 
                            is the saving of  expense; gross receipts may be large, but if obtained 
                            by a disregard of expense there will be no profit!  These are the 
                            considerations which have induced the Superintendent to  reduce the 
                            number of trains which are run during the winter; and if it does result 
                            in  denying to your community some of the conveniences they enjoyed in 
                            the summer, I  hope they will not complain, when continued without 
                            serious loss to the company.</p>
                            <p>The same consideration has recently 
                                required that the Night Train to Charlottesville  should be 
                                discontinued.  The anxious expectations of the Stockholders to receive 
                                some  dividends, which they have a just claim to expect, forbids the 
                                continuance of any  arrangements which does not promise some profit.</p>
                            <p>I 
                                    am told that for some time past, the passenger receipts from the Car 
                                    running with  the freight between Waynesboro and Millboro have been 
                                    insufficient to justify the  expense of running.  I am also told by the 
                                    Superintendent, that the stopping of the  Freight at night at Greenwood, 
                                    promotes the convenience and advantage of operations  in the Tunnel.  He 
                                    also says that it saved some extra running.
                                    You may rest assured, 
                                    Gentlemen, that it would be very agreeable to the  Superintendent as 
                                    well as myself to gratify you in all these arrangements, if it could  be 
                                    done consistently with the interests of the Company.  That officer is 
                                    held specially  responsible for effecting all the judicious economy he 
                                    can in his department, and I  trust your good judgement and good wishes 
                                    for the Company, will sustain him in his  efforts.</p>
                            <p>I regret that you 
                                        cannot be gratified in this case.</p></transcript>
