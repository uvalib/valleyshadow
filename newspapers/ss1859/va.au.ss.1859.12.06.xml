                <head>John Brown's Sympathizers</head>
                <origin/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript><p>Meetings were held at various places in the North, on Friday, to 
                    express sympathy for John Brown.  The meeting in Philadelphia was rather 
                    stormy.  Speeches were made by Lucretia Mott, Dr. Furness and others, 
                    during which there were strong demonstrations of displeasure on the part 
                    of a portion of the audience with the sentiments uttered.  The disorder 
                    culminated during the address of a colored preacher.  Cheers for 
                    Virginia, for the United States, and for Gov. Wise were called for and 
                    given with a will, and groans for John Brown followed for a considerable 
                    time.</p>
                    <p> Several meetings of sympathizers were also held in New York.  The 
                        meetings very generally expressed sympathy with Brown--hoped that his 
                        death would be the means of breaking down slavery--congratulation at his 
                        readiness to die for liberty, and an emphatic endorsement of the 
                        doctrine that "the blood of martyrs is the seed of the church."  At Dr. 
                        Cheever's church there was a fair attendance, though many of the 
                        audience were attracted by curiosity, rather than by any hearty 
                        confidence in the occasion and its claims.</p>
                    <p> At Boston Brown's execution attracted considerable crowds about the 
                        newspaper offices as the evening editions were issued, and several 
                        individuals promenaded the streets with crape attached to their persons. 
                        Religious services were held in several of the colored churches the 
                        most part of the day.  Otherwise there were no manifestations unusual to 
                        everyday life in the city.  Tremont Temple was crowded at night to 
                        commemorate the hanging, and speeches were made by Garrison, Pierpont 
                        and others.</p>
                    <p> The church bells were toiled at Worcester, Massachusetts, from 10 
                        o'clock to 12.  In the evening a great meeting was held in Mechanic's 
                        Hall, which was addressed by prominent gentlemen of the city, clergymen 
                        and others.  It was the largest meeting that has been held in a long 
                        time.  Three thousand persons were in the hall.  At the close a 
                        collection was taken up for Brown's family, which was very 
                        successful.</p>
                    <p> At Manchester, New Hampshire, the sympathizers met 
                        with very 
                        little sympathy.  An attempt was made to toll the obsequies of Old Brown 
                        from the City Hall bell.  It had struck four or five times when Mayor 
                        Horrington appeared among the sympathizers in the belfry, and ordered 
                        them to desist.  One of them refused, when the mayor dropped him through 
                        the scuttle by the most convenient mode, and the bell didn't ring any 
                        more.</p>
                    <p> At Providence, R. I., the sympathizers held a large meeting, at 
                        which speeches were made, &amp;c.  The feeling of the larger part of the 
                        community, it is said, was strongly against the meeting.</p>
                    <p> At Syracuse, N. Y., the City Hall was densely packed with citizens 
                        Friday evening, who listened for over three hours to speeches expressing 
                        sympathy for John Brown and his family. The City Hall bell was tolled 63 
                        times, the strokes corresponding with Brown's age.  The sympathy for 
                        Brown and his family is very strong here.</p> <p>A meeting of over five 
                            thousand people was held at Cleveland, Ohio, Friday night, and many 
                            speeches were let off.  Strong resolutions were adopted.  The hall 
                            was dressed in mourning.</p></transcript>

                <head>Freedom and Slavery</head>
                <origin/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript><p>We 
                    have never entertained a doubt that the condition of the Southern slaves 
                    is the best and most desirable for the negroes, as a class, that they 
                    have ever been found in or are capable of.  There is abundant evidence 
                    to prove that the black man's lot as a slave, is vastly preferable to 
                    that of his free brethren at the North.  A Boston paper of recent date 
                    tells of a likely negro man, twenty-eight years old, who purchased his 
                    freedom in Virginia and removed to Boston.--He is sober, industrious and 
                    willing to work, but instead of meeting with sympathy from the 
                    Abolitionists, he had been deceived, cheated and driven from their 
                    presence.  The writer describes him as bemoaning his hard lot, weeping 
                    like a child, lamenting that he had ever left his former master, and 
                    declaring that if he had the means he would gladly return to the old 
                    Virginia plantation.  And this, we have reason to believe, is not an 
                    isolated case, but the experience of a large majority of emancipated 
                    slaves and run-away negroes in the Northern States.</p>
                    <p> But the most remarkable testimony on the subject, is borne by no 
                        less a personage than the notorious Henry Ward Beecher.  In a recent 
                        sermon, Mr. Beecher says the free colored people at the North "are 
                        almost without education, with but little sympathy for ignorance." "They 
                        cannot even ride in the cars of our city railroads.  They are snuffed at 
                        in the house of God, or tolerated with ill-disguised disgust." The negro 
                        cannot be employed as a stone mason, bricklayer, or carpenter.  "There 
                        is scarcely a carpenter's shop in New York in which a journeyman would 
                        continue to work if a black man was employed in it."  There is scarcely 
                        one of the common industries of life in which he can engage.  "He is 
                        crowded down, down, down, through the most menial callings to the bottom 
                        of society."  "We heap upon them," says Beecher, moral obloquy more 
                        atrocious than that which the master heaps upon the slave.  And 
                        notwithstanding all this, we lift ourselves up to talk to the 
                        Southern people about the rights and liberties
                        of the human soul, 
                        and especially the African soul."</p>
                    <p> Every word of this is no doubt true, and yet even Mr. Beecher is an 
                        gent of the "under ground railroad," actively engaged in fomenting 
                        dissatisfaction among slaves, and stealing them away from the section 
                        where they have protection and sympathy, only that they may become, in 
                        other regions, objects of atrocious moral obloquy.  Such is the 
                        philanthropy of Abolitionism!</p>
                    <p> The intelligent, christian slave-holder at the South is the best 
                        friend of the negro.  He does not regard his bonds-men as mere chattel 
                        property, but as human beings to whom he owes duties.  While the 
                        Northern Pharisee will not permit a negro to ride on the city railroads, 
                        Southern gentlemen and ladies are seen every day, side by side, in cars 
                        and coaches, with their faithful servants.  Here the honest black man is 
                        not only protected by the laws and public sentiment, but he is respected 
                        by the community as truly as if his skin were white. Here there are ties 
                        of genuine friendship and affection between whites and blacks, 
                        leading to an interchange of all the comities of life.  The slave nurses 
                        his master in sickness, and sheds tears of genuine sorrow at his grave.  
                        When sick himself, or overtaken by the infirmity of age, he is kindly 
                        cared for, and when he dies the whites grieve, not for the loss of so 
                        much property, but for the death of a member of the family.--This is the 
                        relation which slaves generally, and domestic servants universally, 
                        sustain to their white masters.</p>
                    <p> There is a vast deal of foolish talk about the delights of freedom 
                        and the hardships of slavery.  In one sense no one, white or black, is 
                        free in this world.  The master orders his slave to work in a certain 
                        field, when he perhaps would prefer to go elsewhere--this is slavery.  
                        But is the master free to do as he pleases!  Not so.--He is driven by as 
                        stern a necessity to labor with his hands or confine himself to 
                        business, as the slave ever feels.  We are all therefore slaves.--But 
                        when the man, whatever his complexion, recognizes 
                        the fact that his 
                        lot is ordained of God, and cheerfully acquiesces, he becomes a free man 
                        in the only true sense.  He then chooses to do and to bear what 
                        otherwise might be irksome and intolerable.</p>

                    a slaveholder is the "best friend of the negro," because slaveowners and slaves

                <origin>Charleston Mercury</origin>
                <excerpt>"But in the midst of its retching [over praise of Brown] the Mercury finds
                    consolation in the growth of disunion sentiment in Virginia."</excerpt>
                    <transcript><p>The Charleston Mercury is extensively disgusted at the broad and 
                    pathetic farce that has been played off before the public about the 
                    hanging of that hoary villain, `Old Brown.'"  The "marches and 
                    counter-marches of the ponies and cessation of ponies--Governor Wise, 
                    the energetic, and his troops," &amp;c. &amp;c., have stirred the bile of that 
                    journal to its lowest depths. This is certainly "the unkindest cut of 
                    all."  But in the midst of its retching the Mercury finds consolidation 
                    in the growth of disunion sentiments in Virginia.  It says:</p>
                    <p> "We are happy to perceive a decided change in the tone of the public 
                        press of Virginia, indicative, we trust, of a change also in her people. 
                        The Richmond Whig no longer advocates a union of Southern Whigs and 
                        Black Republicans to control the House of Representatives or win the 
                        Presidential election.  The Richmond Examiner no longer urges that the 
                        South should be ignored in the Charleston Convention, and the Democratic 
                        party at the North be alone relied on to vindicate these rights, 
                        although they will not, or dare not, avow them.  Hunter and Douglas do 
                        not make ugly faces from columns, in kaleidoscope harmony.  Spoils and 
                        President-making, removed to an advantageous distance by the decided 
                        overthrow of the Democratic party throughout the Northern States, seem 
                        now subordinate to Southern safety and honor.  The signs are cheering 
                        that Virginia will be herself again.  The boast of one of her presses 
                        that `there are no disunionists in Virginia,' if true six months ago, we 
                        trust is now a thing of history, never again to be asserted, until the 
                        South is safe and free in the Union, or independent out of it."</p> 
                    <p>Resolutions have been offered in the South Carolina House of 
                        Representatives looking to the establishment of a Southern 
                        Confederacy.</p></transcript>

                <origin/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript><p>The following account of the last hours and execution of John Brown, 
                    was despatched from Charlestown, by telegraph, on Friday afternoon, the 
                    2nd inst.</p>
                    <p> At an early hour the town was in more than usual stir, even for the 
                        stirring times that have fallen upon this neighborhood.  Soon the 
                        movements of the military drew all the citizens of the place, and all 
                        others who had been able to gain admittance to the town, to the vicinity 
                        of the place assigned for the execution.</p>
                    <p> Brown's Interview with the Other Prisoners.<lb/> The prisoner was 
                        brought out of jail at eleven o'clock.  Before leaving he bid adieu to 
                        all his fellow prisoners and was very affectionate to all except Cook.  
                        He charged Cook with having deceived and misled him in relation to the 
                        support he was to receive from the slaves. He said he was led by him to 
                        believe they were ripe for insurrection, but he had found that his 
                        representations were false.  Cook denied the charge, and made but little 
                        reply to Brown. The prisoner then told the Sheriff he was ready, when 
                        his arms were pinioned, and he walked to the door apparently calm and 
                        cheerful.  He wore a black slouched hat, and the same clothes worn 
                        during his trial.  As he came out he was taken under guard of the 
                        military.  Six companies of infantry and one troop of horse, with Gen. 
                        Talliaferro and his entire staff, were deployed in front of the 
                        jail.</p>
                    <p> The Execution.<lb/> At the door of the jail an open wagon with a 
                        pine box, in which was a fine oak coffin, was waiting for him.  He 
                        looked around and spoke to several persons whom he recognised, and, 
                        walking down the steps, was assisted to enter the wagon and took his 
                        seat on the box containing his coffin along with Jailor Avis.  He looked 
                        with interest on the fine military display, but made no remark.  The 
                        wagon moved off as soon as he had taken his seat, flanked with two files 
                        of riflemen in close order.</p>
                    <p> On reaching the field the military had already full possession, and 
                        pickets were stationed at various points.  The citizens were kept 
                        back at the point of the bayonet fro
                        m taking any position except 
                        that assigned them--nearly a quarter of a mile from the scaffold.  
                        Through the determined persistence of Dr. Rawlings, of Frank Leslie's 
                        paper, the order excluding the press was partially rescinded, and the 
                        reporters were assigned a position near the General's Staff. The 
                        prisoner walked up the steps firmly and was the first man on the 
                        gallows.  Jailor Avis and Sheriff Campbell stood by his side, and after 
                        shaking hands and bidding an affectionate adieu, he thanked them for 
                        their kindness.  They then put the cap over his face and the rope around 
                        his neck.  Mr. Avis asked him to step forward on the step.  He replied, 
                        "you must lead me, as I cannot see."</p>
                    <p> The rope now being adjusted, the military order was given.  The 
                        soldiers marched and counter-marched and took their position as if an 
                        enemy was in sight.  Nearly ten minutes were thus occupied, the prisoner 
                        standing meanwhile, Mr. Avis inquired if he was not tired. Brown 
                        replied--"No, not tired; but don't keep me waiting longer than 
                        necessary."  The arrangements of the military having been completed, at 
                        fifteen minutes past eleven the trap fell.  A slight grasping of the 
                        hands and twitching of the muscles was visible, and then all was quiet.  
                        The body was several times examined and his pulse did not cease beating 
                        for 35 minutes.  It was then cut down and placed in the coffin and 
                        conveyed under a military escort to the depot, and there put in a car to 
                        be conveyed to Harper's Ferry's by special train, at 4 o'clock.</p>
                    <p> The whole arrangements were carried out with a precision and 
                        military strictness that was most annoying.  The general conviction is 
                        everywhere entertained that the rumors of the intended rescue were 
                        altogether an egregious hoax.</p> <p>Incidents Previous to the 
                            Execution<lb/> This morning Capt. Brown executed an instrument 
                            empowering Sheriff Campbell to administer on all property of his in this 
                            State, with directions to pay over the proceeds of the sale of his 
                            weapons, if received, to his widow and children.<p/>
                            <p> Sheriff Campbell bid Brown farewell in the cell.  He returned 
                                him thanks for his kindness. Brown was then taken to the cell of the 
                                negroes, Copeland and Green.  He told them to stand up like men and not 
                                betray their friends, then handed to each a quarter of a dollar, saying 
                                that he had no more use for money, and bid them good bye.  They made no 
                                remark except to return his salutation.  He next visited the cell in 
                                which Cook and Coppie were confined, chained together.  To Cook he said, 
                                "you have made false statements."</p>
                            Cook replied--"What do you mean?"</p>
                    <p> Brown--"Why, by stating that I sent you to Harper's Ferry."</p>
                    <p> Cook--"Did you not tell me in Pittsburg to come to Harper's Ferry 
                        and see if Forbes had made disclosures?"</p>
                    <p> Brown--"No sir.  You know that I protested against your coming."</p>
                   <p> Cook closed the conversation by replying--"Captain Brown, we remember 
                    differently," at the same time dropping his head.</p>
                    <p> Brown then turned to Coppie and said: "Coppie, you also have made 
                        false statements, but I am glad to hear you have contradicted them.  
                        Stand up like a man."</p>
                    <p>He then handed Coppie a quarter, shook him and Cook by the hand and 
                        left the cell.</p>
                    <p> He then returned to Stevens' cell and spoke kindly to him.</p>
                    <p> Stevens said--"Good bye, Captain; I know you are going to a better 
                        land."</p>
                    <p> Brown--"Yes, I know I am."  He then counselled Stevens to firmness, 
                        warned him against betraying his friends, and closed by also presenting 
                        him with a quarter.</p> 
                    <p>He did not visit Haslett's cell, having always persisted in denying 
                        any knowledge of him.</p>
                    <p> On his way to the scaffold, Mr. Sadler, the undertaker, who was in 
                        the wagon with him, remarked--</p>
                    <p>"Captain Brown, you are a game man."</p>
                    <p> Brown--"Yes, I was so trained up.  It was one of the lessons of my 
                        mother.  But it is hard to part from friends, even when newly made."  
                        Brown continued the conversation by remarking on the beauty of the 
                        country, which he said "he never had the pleasure of seeing before."--On 
                        reaching the gallows field, he said--"Why are none but the military 
                        allowed within the enclosure.  I am sorry the citizens have been kept 
                        out."  Observing Mr. Hunter and Mayor Green standing by, he said to 
                        them--"Gentlemen, good bye," his voice not faltering in the least.</p> 
                  <p>  Whilst on the scaffold Sheriff Campbell asked him if he would take a 
                    handerkerchief in his hand and drop it as a signal when he was 
                    ready.--Brown replied.  "No, I do not want it. But do not detain me 
                    longer than is actually necessary." </p><p>Military Arrangements<lb/>. 
                    It is understood that a portion of each of the military companies now 
                    assembled here are to have leave of absence, but that all are to return 
                    and be present at the execution of the other prisoners on the 16th.</p> 
                    <p>The Remains of Brown<lb/> A despatch from Harper's Ferry, dated 10 
                        o'clock, P. M., Friday night, says:  The remains of Brown arrived here 
                        in a special train at 9 o'clock, and will be taken on by Mrs. Brown and 
                        her friends, by express direct to Albany, New York.  It is their desire 
                        to avoid all public demonstration, and it is determined that the body 
                        shall not be visible anywhere on the route to North Elba, New York, 
                        where it will be interred in the family burying ground.  Mrs. Brown 
                        acknowledges very warmly the courtesy and kind treatment extended to her 
                        by the citizens and authorities of Virginia.</p></transcript>

                <origin/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript><p>At a called meeting of the State Opposition Committee, held 
                    in their room in the Whig building, the night of 28th November, 1859, 
                    the following proceedings were had.</p>
                    <p> Whereas, the State Central Committee of the Opposition party of 
                        Virginia have recommended that a State Convention be held in the city of 
                        Richmond, on the 14th day of December next, for the purpose of 
                        suggesting to the country at large some basis on which Union loving men 
                        of all sections might combine, to form a constitutional, national and 
                        conservative party, to secure the rights and to preserve the Union of 
                        the States, and to supersede the party now in power:  And, whereas, the 
                        recent invasion of our State at Harper's Ferry, and other hostile 
                        demonstrations have produced a state of feeling, which, if not 
                        incompatible with, at least endangers, a calm and reflective survey of 
                        the difficulties and embarrassments which now disturb the peace and 
                        harmony of the country; trusting that the lapse of a short period of 
                        time may bring forth a distinct demonstration of a sounder and more 
                        conservative sentiment--desiring to use all honorable means to 
                        tranquilize the disturbances which now so unhappily threaten the general 
                        weal and public welfare--and ardently wishing to bring about some 
                        national organization, by virtue of the supremacy of which the Union of 
                        the States and the States of the Union shall be and remain as they were 
                        contemplated by the Constitution and its framers:--Now, therefore, the 
                        State Central Committee of the Opposition party of Virginia do recommend 
                        that the holding of the said Convention be postponed until the 22nd day 
                        of February next.</p>
                    <p> The Committee are aware and regret that the time between now and the 
                        14th of December is short, yet there is abundant time to inform all the 
                        delegates of the proposed change, so as not to subject them to 
                        inconvenience; and they are also aware that most of the counties of the 
                        State have deputed delegates to attend, on the 14th of December, but 
                        this is not a matter of important consideration, as the same delegates 
                        will of course attend as delegates, on the 22nd day of February next.  
                        Believing that, at this particular time, the people would be reluctant 
                        to leave their homes, and, under all the circumstances, deeming it wise 
                        to postpone the holding of the Convention, the Committee do earnestly 
                        recommend the adoption of the foregoing suggestions, and invoke all the 
                        counties of the State, which have not appointed delegates to do so 
                        between now and the 22nd day of February, and thus let the Opposition 
                        party of Virginia form a nucleus, around which Union-loving men may 
                        gather, and by which the Constitution may be preserved.</p></transcript>

                <origin>New York Observer; Christian Observer (Philadelphia)</origin>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript><p>The New York Observer speaking of the 
                    sermons on Thanksgiving Day, says:  "Of the five hundred pulpits of this 
                    city, we believe that not five uttered a word of approbation of the John 
                    Brown invasion of Virginia.  We do not speak with positive knowledge of 
                    any great number.  But we know that the radical pulpit is the noisiest 
                    and runs the most readily into the newspapers:  that the sympathizers 
                    with the conspiracy are blatant in their denunciations of the law that 
                    has the murderers in its righteous hand.</p>
                    <p> "Of the five hundred preachers in this city we have heard of but 
                        TWO, who ventured to give the sanction of their pulpits to the support 
                        of the highest crime perpetrated in this country since the treason of 
                        Benedict Arnold.  One of these preachers, of course, was the man who 
                        curses from Union Square, and the other is still so obscure that we will 
                        not give him the notoriety he would be glad to get by a notice in the 
                        newspapers.  On the other hand, we hear from a large number of the 
                        most commanding, influential, popular and intelligent pulpits of this 
                        city, that they bore explicit, uniform, earnest and unanimous testimony 
                        against the conspiracy in all its features, designs, plans and acts.  
                        And with one voice they consented to the sentence of death pronounced 
                        upon the conspirators as just and necessary."</p>
                    <p> The Christian Observer of Philadelphia gives the same report of the 
                        sermons preached in that city on Thanksgiving Day  Even the Rev. Dr. 
                        Bacon, of New Haven, who, if we mistake not, was a Sharp's rifle man in 
                        the days of the Kansas trouble, has undergone a reaction.  In his 
                        Thanksgiving Day sermon he took the opportunity sharply to rebuke the 
                        unmanly, unpatriotic, unchristian spirit manifested at the North in 
                        regard to the Harper's Ferry's affair.</p></transcript>

                <head>Visit of Mrs. Brown to Charlestown</head>

                <transcript>
                    <p> A letter from Charlestown, on Thursday, the 1st inst., 
                    says:  At day break this morning the reveille sounded from the head 
                    quarters of twenty different companies, arousing those who retired late 
                    rather earlier than comfort would warrant.  The morning was spent in 
                    counter- marching, drilling, and rifle-practice, and nothing of special 
                    interest occurred until 12 o'clock, when a carriage accompanied by 
                    twelve mounted guards was dispatched for Harper's Ferry to bring up Mrs. 
                    Brown, the wife of the prisoner, who arrived there last evening.  She 
                    was accompanied by a gentleman and lady, two of her relatives, whom 
                    rumor soon announced to be the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher and lady, but 
                    like rumor generally in this region was altogether unfounded.  The 
                    directions given to the guard, however, was not to allow them to 
                    accompany her--that the order of the Governor was to give her permission 
                    alone to enter the town, and all others must be excluded.</p>
                    <p> At 3 o'clock a dress parade of the entire military here assembled, 
                        and eight companies were directed to form in front of the jail, from 
                        whence they were ordered to clear an open space of about three hundred 
                        yards on each side, forming a hollow square with all the pomp of a grand 
                        military reception.  The four brass howitzers were stationed in the 
                        centre of the square, and there seemed to be an evident intention to 
                        appal the poor woman with the military majesty of the Commonwealth of 
                        Virginia.  All the citizens were compelled to fall back, and there was 
                        even some disposition to prevent them from standing in their own doors 
                        to witness the spectacle. At half-past 3 o'clock, the cavalcade from the 
                        Ferry, surrounding the carriage containing Mrs. Brown, and Captain 
                        Moore, of the Black Hawk Rangers, who had been delegated to accompany 
                        her, arrived in front of the Court House, when the military escort 
                        reported to General Taliaferro the accomplishment of their mission.</p>
                    <p> During this scene Mrs. Brown seemed calm and collected, but bore 
                        on her features the evidence of an internal anguish that was 
                        unmistakable.  She was met at the steps of the jail by Sheriff Campbell, 
                        who took her arm and escorted her within the walls to take her last 
                        interview with her husband.</p>
                    <p> The interview lasted from four o'clock in the afternoon until near 
                        eight o'clock in the evening, when Gen. Taliaferro informed them that 
                        the period allowed them had elapsed, and that she must prepare for her 
                        departure to the Ferry.  The carriage was again brought up to the door, 
                        the military took possession of the square, and with an escort of twenty 
                        mounted men, the cortege moved off, Captain Moore, of the Montgomery 
                        Guards, accompanying her.</p>
                    <p> The interview was, I learn, not a very affecting one, but rather of 
                        a practical character with regard to the future of herself and children, 
                        and the arrangement and settlement of business affairs.  On first 
                        meeting they kissed and affectionately embraced, and Mrs. Brown shed a 
                        few tear, but immediately checked her feelings.--They stood embraced 
                        and she sobbing for nearly five minutes, and he was apparently unable to 
                        speak.  The prisoner only gave way for a moment and was soon calm and 
                        collected, and remained firm throughout the interview. At the close they 
                        shook hands but did not embrace, and as they parted he said, "God bless 
                        you and the children,"  Mrs. Brown replied, "God have mercy on you, and 
                        continued calm until she left the room, when she remained in tears a few 
                        moments and then prepared to depart.  The interview took place in the 
                        parlor of Captain Alvis, and the prisoner was free from manacles of any 
                        kind.</p>
                    <p> During the course of the conversation Mrs. Brown asked him if he had 
                        heard that Gerrit Smith had become insane, and had been sent to an 
                        Asylum at Utica.  He replied that he had read of it in the papers, and 
                        was sorry to hear it, but immediately changed the subject.</p>
                    <p> Brown dictated his will, which directed that all his property should 
                        go to his wife, with the exception of a few presents and bequests 
                        which he made.  On the way to Charlestown, Mrs. Brown informed Capt. 
                        Moore that she had not seen her husband since last June, about six 
                        months ago, and that they had been separated, with the exception of a 
                        few days, for nearly two years.--They had, however, corresponded, and 
                        she always felt a deep interest in the cause in which he was 
                        engaged.</p>
                    <p> There was an impression that the prisoner might possibly be 
                        furnished with a weapon or with strychnine by his wife, and before the 
                        interview her person was searched by the wife of the jailor, and a 
                        strict watch kept over them during the time they were together.  Mrs. 
                        Brown has undoubtedly been received with every courtesy and respect, and 
                        her coming gives general satisfaction to the community.</p>
