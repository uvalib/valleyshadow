                    but have instead merely stressed their personal qualifications. The Spectator
                    wants them to provide their positions on the questions of national importance,
                    including the tariff, the purchase of Cuba, the Monroe Doctrine, the Pacific
                    Railroad, and "various other questions," including the admission of Oregon,

                    Three negro men entered the tobacco store of Mr. Jno. B. Evans on 
                    Saturday night for the ostensible purpose of making some 
                    purchases.--While two of them engaged the attention of Mr. Evans, the 
                    third snatched up a bundle of buckskin gloves and made tracks.  Mr. E. 
                    is not certain who the fellow was, but one who is suspected has been 
                    arrested.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors: It is said that 
                    there is reason in all things, but I think no good reason can be given 
                    for so frequent interruptions of the business of our County Court by 
                    political meetings.  It may do very well for the people of Staunton, but 
                    you may depend that the country people complain very heavily.  We have 
                    to ride, or walk if we have not a horse (for the order of the 
                    Commonwealth is imperative) to the Court House, though the day may be as 
                    cold, and the roads as rough as on last Monday, and for what?  To attend 
                    to the business of the County Court?  No!  for we find that swallowed up 
                    in a political meeting, where the littleest dog is the londest. And so 
                    we must ride back another day.--There were a great many men in Staunton 
                    on Monday, that would not have gone had they know that there would be no 
                    Court. It is unfair to spring a thing upon us thus.  And this is to be 
                    repeated at February Court. This is outrageous. It is imposing upon the 
                    country people a burden that they will not patiently bear much 
                    longer. There is a Town Hall most admirably adapted to the purpose, and 
                    all political meetings should be held there, and then the Court need not 
                    adjourn.  Many men have from 15 to 20 miles to go to Staunton, who only 
                    go when obliged to go, and it is no light matter for them to be 
                    disappointed. It should be a standing rule that the County Court should 
                    not adjourn on a regular monthly Court day for anything.  It is a pretty 
                    business, if several hundred active, business men, to whom "time is 
                    money," are to be disappointed by an adjournment of the County Court to 
                    allow one, two or three of the lawyers to attend the funeral of a 
                    friend.  This thing has become a nuisance, and there is a strong demand 
                    for reform.  Viewed properly, this is no trivial subject, and I know it 
                    to be a cause of great complaint.  What think you, County Court?</p>

                    commenced on Wednesday last, and concluded on Friday.  The base was then 
                    submitted to the Court without argument, and the Justices unanimously 
                    decided to discharge the accused. It is rumored that as soon as Mr. 
                    Deneale arrived in Harrisonburg on Saturday, he was arrested on another 
                    charge.  His friends, it is said, resisted the officers, and some of 
                    them were taken in custody.  Report says that the community were greatly 
                    excited, but we have received no authentic account of the
