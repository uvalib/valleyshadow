<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The fourth trial of Daniel Downey, of this place, for the killing of 
                    Wm. Mullins, was commenced in Charlottesville on Monday, the 9th inst., 
                    and terminated on Friday, the jury,after a brief consultation, returning 
                    a verdict of acquittal.  We are satisfied that the evidence justified no 
                    other result, notwithstanding we have full confidence in the integrity 
                    of former juries who have tried the case.  We learn that the verdict was 
                    applauded by the crows in the Court-House.  The prosecution was 
                    conducted by Mr. Duke, Commonwealth's Attorney for Albemarle, and the 
                    defence by Robert L. Doyle, Esq., of Staunton.</p>
                    <p>After the above was put in type, we received the following letter 
                        from a highly respectable gentleman in Charlottesville: </p>
                    <p>Charlottesville, May 16, 1859.<br>
                        Dear Sirs:--In noticing the acquittal of Dr. Downey, I think it due 
                        to both the accused and his counsel that your readers should know the 
                        impression made here; and without exaggeration, I can safely say that 
                        Mr. Doyle's defence was, without an exception, characterized by the 
                        members of our bar as one of the ablest and most effective delivered 
                        before a jury of this county for a long while.  Our people generally, 
                        previous to the trial, had impressions made upon their minds by reports, 
                        &amp;c., that Downey ought to have been punished; but a change in opinion 
                        was universally manifested as soon as the evidence for the defence had 
                        been hard, and especially after the able argument submitted by Mr. 
                        Doyle; and it was therefore not surprising that as soon as the verdict 
                        was announced the large audience exhibited its gratification by an 
                        outburst of applause.  The jury was not out over half an hour, and had 
                        no difficulty in agreeing upon a verdict of acquittal.  Our whole 
                        community is pleased with the verdict, and was taken by surprise that 
                        Mr. Doyle, of whom they had heard but little, acquitted himself with 
                        such decided ability.</p>
