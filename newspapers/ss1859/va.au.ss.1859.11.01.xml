                <transcript><p>The following narrative of Capt. H. Clay Pate, now of 
                    Petersburg, Va., will be interesting to our readers, as it gives some of 
                    the antecedents of Capt. Brown of Harper s Ferry notoriety.--It is dated 
                    Petersburg, Oct. 21, 1859: In the latter part of May, 1856, John Brown 
                    and his sons murdered five pro-slavery men on Pottawotamie creek in 
                    Kansas, in one night; they were old Mr. Doyle and two sons, Allen 
                    Wilkerson, a member of the first Legislature of Kansas, and a German 
                    named Wm. Sherman.- -These murders were done in cold blood, without any 
                    excuse, except that the victims were in favor of slavery for Kansas; and 
                    their only justification was Gerrit Smith s doctrine that "slavery must 
                    go out in blood."</p>
                    <p> I took the field with my company of 25 men and joined 
                        the U.S. Deputy Marshal, T. W. Hays, who was in search of Brown and his 
                        sons, to arrest them for their atrocious crimes, committed on 
                        Pottawotamie creek.  Search was made for him in the neighborhood of 
                        Paola; his house was found, but not himself.  In his house were arms, 
                        and evidence of lawlessness, like those found on his place near Harper's 
                        Ferry.</p>
                    <p> On discovering that Brown had left his home and haunts, the 
                        Marshal dispatched troops in various directions, in search of the 
                        murderers.</p>
                    <p> I was sent to the neighborhood of Prairie City, a point on 
                        the Santa Fe road about 45 miles from the Missouri line, and on Saturday 
                        night, the last day of May, camped at Black Jack, where there is a 
                        spring, and other conveniences for cooking, to rest over Sunday. Squads 
                        were sent out to scour the country, and find traces of Brown.  I had 
                        been assured that honest free-State men all over the Territory would 
                        assist in Brown s capture, in which I was deceived.--I am sorry to say, 
                        however, that some of my scouts transcended their orders, and under the 
                        influence of liquor, perhaps, committed some indiscretions at least.  
                        Taking advantage of these, Brown, who was concealed in the neighborhood, 
                        excited all the inhabitants against my command, enlisted them in his 
                        service, and in forty-eight hours, had banded together some hundred 
                        and odd persons to overpower it.</p>
                    <p> I was attacked at sunrise Monday 
                        morning, the 2nd of June, by a company equal in numbers to my own, under 
                        the command of Captain Shore, whom we put to flight, and who afterwards 
                        left the field and incurred the censure of Brown, who charged the 
                        Captain with cowardice, in the New York Tribune.</p>
                    <p> Five of my men were 
                        wounded and disabled in the early part of the fight, as many more 
                        deserted, and after resisting the attack for over three hours, and 
                        almost exhausting our ammunition--seeing reinforcements of the enemy 
                        arriving every hour--and knowing we were surrounded, I determined to 
                        seek an interview with the commander--not even dreaming he was Brown, or 
                        I should never have done so.  My object was two fold.  1st.  I looked 
                        for help to arrive every moment, and wished to gain time.--2nd.  I 
                        desired to apologize for and disclaim any unwarrantable conduct of my 
                        scouts, feeling that duty required my apology and disclaimer for the 
                        same--above all, I wished to be right.  I expected to die, and possibly 
                        go down with every gallant fellow who stood by me; and it would have 
                        been a consolation to know that I had done all in my power to avoid 
                        bloodshed, and if no honorable compromise could be effected, after 
                        making proper concessions, I was ready and willing to die in defense of 
                        my country, and in the maintenance of the trust it had confided to my 
                        keeping.  I never harbored the thought of surrender.  In addition to 
                        this, my men had not eaten anything since the previous afternoon, and 
                        two of the wounded, whom I supposed dying, needed attention; they 
                        begged, in touching tones, for water and help.  It was under these 
                        circumstances, and with the object just stated, that I sent out a flag 
                        of truce and asked an interview.  It was granted.  I went out under the 
                        flag, by the request of Capt. Brown, who would hear no proposition or 
                        explanation, but demanded my surrender.  I told him he must wait fifteen minutes for my answer, and moved with the intention of returning 
                        to
                        renew the defense, when he told me I was his prisoner; and at that 
                        moment his sons rose up from the grass where they were concealed, and 
                        forcibly took me, while the white flag was still floating over my head. 
                        Not content with this act of treachery, I and my gallant aid, Henry 
                        James, were put in front of a squad of men, so that my company could not 
                        fire and protect themselves without killing us, and seeing no 
                        alternative but instant death, being utterly surrounded, they threw down 
                        their arms.  I never gave the command to surrender, and never would have 
                        done it, although it was demanded of me under penalty.--I was a prisoner 
                        and did not intend to open my mouth, preferring "to die and make no 
                        sign."--I did not compliment Brown s bravery, for I could not consider 
                        him truly brave, who would take one treacherously, when he had four to 
                        one, and every imaginable advantage on his side; for we were in a 
                        settlement of free-soilers exclusively, with an exception or two, and as 
                        it turned out, thirty or forty miles from any assistance.</p>
                    <p> This is as 
                        correct a statement as I can make in brief--there being enough matter in 
                        the affair for a book, which I am in no spirit to write now, and I would 
                        not have come before the pubic at this time, but that the misstatements 
                        of Northern have been copied into Southern papers.  I expect slander and 
                        injustice from the Abolition press as long as I live, judging from the 
                        past; but when they come home to me, no one can justly impute blame to 
                        myself for defending my fair fame, which I ever intend to do "without 
                        favor or affection."</p></transcript>

                    Brown's days, until something else occurs to furnish abundant pabulum for

                <transcript><p>Every 
                    writer occasionally feels the want expressed by Lord Byron in the 
                    opening stanza of one of his celebrated poems, and breathes a sigh for a 
                    "hero."  Under the pleasure of necessity the noble bard took his 
                    "ancient friend," that graceless scamp, "Don Juan."  We, in common with 
                    the entire newspaper fraternity, are disposed to seize greedily upon the 
                    veteran leader of the Harper's Ferry insurgents, and turn a paragraph 
                    upon "Old Brown"--commonly called "Ossawotamie."  Old Brown is 
                    emphatically the celebrity of the day, and he will inevitably continue 
                    to be talked about and written about even after he drops from the 
                    gallows into the grave.  We want to get the benefit of "Old Brown" while 
                    he is going, and as he is very nearly gone we are almost compelled to 
                    use him a little this week.</p>
                    <p> We regret that there should be such eagerness to make way with the 
                        distinguished chief of the army of invasion.  We consider it bad policy 
                        for more reasons than one.  In the first place the demand for summary 
                        vengeance will give some color of pretense to the claim of martyrdom 
                        which Captain Brown is disposed to set up, and which his friends at the 
                        North will assert for him.  The moral effect at the North would be much 
                        better, if, instead of manifesting so much hot haste" to inflict merited 
                        punishment upon the culprits, the justice were meted out to them with 
                        cool and calm deliberation, allowing them a fair and impartial trial, 
                        not only all that the law would entitle them to, but much that they 
                        might desire themselves, but not deserve.  To hurry "Old Brown" to the 
                        gallows, even after his conviction, will, in our opinion, be a grave 
                        error.--It looks too much as if the great State of Virginia was in great 
                        trepidation, lest in spite of the bristling bayonets of a whole regiment 
                        of soldiers surrounding his prison, "Old Brown," battered to pieces with 
                        balls and bleeding from sabre wounds as he is, should rally his 
                        lacerated confederates, break through the iron grates of his dungeon, 
                        raise again the standard of insurrection, and fight his way to 
                        liberty.  The effect upon all who have participated in or connived at 
                        the conspiracy would be much better if the soldiers were disbanded, and 
                        Captain Brown were kept caged for a few weeks by the jailor of 
                        Jefferson, just to satisfy all concerned that the people of Virginia 
                        have not been frightened out of their wits by the crazy enterprise of a 
                        few blinded fanatics.</p>
                    <p> In the third place, we protest against the premature hanging of 
                        "Ossawotamie," because the newspapers have not yet exhausted the supply 
                        of paragraphs which he will afford daily as long as he is permitted to 
                        live.  "Old Brown" makes new developments every day, but "dead men tell 
                        no tales."  While he survives every editor feels it to be a solemn duty 
                        to prick him with his pen and slice him with his scissors, for his own 
                        amusement and the gratification of the community, but the chivalry which 
                        belongs to the profession would forbid any interference with his bones 
                        after they are consigned to mother earth  Then, bad as "Old Brown" 
                        is, no editor will relish the work of heaping obloquy upon his memory.  
                        We feel a professional interest, therefore, in the prolongations of 
                        Capt. Brown's days, until something else occurs to furnish abundant 
                        pabulum for voracious gentlemen of the press.</p>

                <transcript>"A gentleman of this county has received through the Post Office a circular
                    from the New York Tribune office setting forth the merits of that paper and
                    appealing for assistance in extending its circulation. To cap the climax of
                    assurance, several copies of the Weekly Tribune, containing an offensive article
                    on the Harper's Ferry conspiracy have been sent to the same address, as a
                    specimen of what the paper is.--'Horace Greeley &amp; Co.' will perhaps be
                    surprised to learn that the gentleman upon whose assistance they have counted,
                    is a large slaveholder and a firm believer in the blessings of our 'patriarchal

                <transcript><p>Some Northern papers which condemn Brown's conduct at Harper's Ferry, 
                    still seek to mitigate his crime by asserting that he was made desperate 
                    and almost crazy by the treatment he received in Kansas.  He was, 
                    however, no peaceful settler in that Territory, but went there for a 
                    bloody purpose, and thus brought his sufferings upon himself.  Moreover, 
                    his admirer and associate in Kansas, James Redpath, says in reference to 
                    the recent conspiracy:  "It was not a 'mad idea,' concocted at Fair in 
                    Ohio, but a mighty purpose, born of religious convictions, which he 
                    nourished in his heart for half a life time."</p></transcript>

                    <p>For some weeks past bears have been quite common in this county, as well as
                        other parts of the State. We have heard of several adventures which
                        different persons have had with them. On Wednesday night last, as Mr. Thomas
                        Marshall, one of our Constables, was riding in the country, his horse showed
                        signs of alarm, and was immediately assailed by a bear, which left the marks
                        of his claws upon the horse ship. Mr. M. dashed off at full speed, but the
                        bear kept up with him for a considerable distance.--Mr. James R. Paris, who
                        lives about two miles from town, went into his meadow Friday evening, to
                        feed some cattle, and found there a bear, which pursued him to the house.
                        Before Mr. P. could get a weapon, Bruin had turned and made off. The next
                        morning, Mr. Womelsdorf encountered the same bear, it is supposed, and with
                        his dog between his feet, stood facing the enemy for some time. Another bear
                        was seen on the farm of Mr. L. R. Waddell Friday evening, about the time of
                        Mr. Paris adventure; and on Sunday morning it was pursued by some persons on
                        the adjoining farm of Mr. Jefferson Kinney, but made his escape. The most
                        serious adventure, however, happened to a gentleman, whose name we have
                        forgotten, near Mt. Torry Furnace. He was out hunting, and discovering a
                        bear up a tree fired a pistol at him.--The bear came down, and assailing his
                        adversary threw him to the ground and scratched his face severely. For a few
                        moments the hunter thought his life in danger, but finally got hold of the
                        bear and turning him recovered his footing. The animal took to a tree again
                        and was shot by persons who came up.</p>

                <transcript><p>A number of the papers brought from the Insurgent's 
                    camp at Harper's Ferry are published in the "Constitution."  Some of 
                    them are signed John Smith, in the handwriting of one of the sons of 
                    Ossawottamie Brown, and endorsed by the latter.  The documents show that 
                    the conspiracy extended throughout portions of Ohio, New York, New 
                    England and some towns in Pennsylvania.  One letter says:--"Our hands so 
                    far are coming forward probably better than I expected, as we have 
                    called upon them."  The papers give the number of pick- axes, shovels, 
                    and articles of personal comfort, together with the bills for the same, 
                    while others ask for money, &amp;c.  F. B. S., of Concord, subscribes 
                    $55.  One letter is dated October 1st, in which the writer remarks:  "He 
                    was in Ashtabula county, and met with some success. Our old friend, J. 
                    R. G." he says,"took stock to the amount of $8."!!</p> 
                    <p>Joshua R. Gidding publishes a letter in which he says Brown never 
                        consulted him in regard to his Harper's Ferry expedition, or any other 
                        expedition or matter whatever.</p>

                    <p>A  letter from Charlestown to the Baltimore American, on the 26th says:  
                    The result of the insurrection is regarded here as proving the 
                    faithfulness of the slaves.  No fears are entertained of them, but a 
                    military guard is kept up to meet any attempt to rescue the 
                    prisoners.--Great consternation among the slaves has been caused by a 
                    fear of being seized like those of Col. Washington's were, and they 
                    firmly believe that the object of the prisoners was to carry them South 
                    and sell them.  Not a single slave has yet been implicated as even 
                    sympathising with the Insurrectionists.  Those carried off have all 
                    returned to their masters.</p>
