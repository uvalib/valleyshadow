<b>For The Spectator; December 29, 1858</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes Staunton for not having a lively intellectual life. The city is
                    especially lacking in public lectures, which would help improve the minds of
                    young men.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--In looking over the city 
                    papers I find frequent mention made of  the "Lecture Season", of the 
                    distinguished gentlemen who have thus far in the  season feasted their 
                    audiences with the humorous, the profound, and the metaphysical.  Why is 
                    it that a town, boasting so many advantages in other points of view, is 
                    totally  without any facilities for entertainment in this respect.  Can 
                    no audiences be allured  from their homes to enjoy such performances?  
                    Does the town want so much in that  thirst for intellectual 
                    gratification, which distinguishes places of less note, that it  will 
                    cherish no project of the kind?  Are there no men within our own 
                    corporation who  have the capacity to entertain an audience?  Surely 
                    none of these things are so.. Why then are we not favored with something 
                    in this line to while away the tedium of the long winter evenings?  I 
                    know there is enough appreciative talent in Staunton to value choice 
                    literary productions; and I know, too, that this talent, would be 
                    greatly developed under the influence of such efforts.  Shall we not 
                    then have lectures.</p>
                    <p>I propose, if there is a fire company in town--and I believe there is 
                        one--that  that company originate a series  of lectures.  Do you not 
                        want some new machinery,  young men?  If so, can you not secure the 
                        services of some of your lawyers, ministers of teachers, to lecture for 
                        you at twelve and a half cents per night?  I am sure an institution such 
                        as yours, which looks to the safe repose of every good citizen of the 
                        town, would meet with marked encouragement.  And then not only your 
                        company would reap an advantage from such a series of discourses, but 
                        every intelligent man and woman in the town would feel under obligations 
                        [sic] to you for the entertainment these lectures would afford.  At the 
                        Maryland Institute, Baltimore, such a course of lectures has been kept 
                        up every winter season for years past, and the people of Baltimore would 
                        hardly now know how to spend a winter without their accustomed lectures. 
                        Charles St. M. E. Church has also enjoyed similar advantages, for the 
                        purpose of raising funds for a noble purpose.  New York and 
                        Philadelphia, and, indeed, every town north, which can muster a few 
                        thousand inhabitants, fail not to improve their winter seasons in this 
                        manner.  We complain that all our school books are published North.  We 
                        get up Southern Conventions and offer strong inducements for men to 
                        write, and labor for the advancement of Southern literature; and yet we 
                        are so lazy that we will neither write, lecture, or do anything else to 
                        stimulate our people to make intellectual advancement.  Unless we pursue 
                        other methods to develope [sic] the latent talent of our people; unless 
                        we excite in them an ambition for higher enjoyments than such as are 
                        afforded by the gaming table, the bar room, the horse race, the shooting 
                        match, the political quarrel, and the thousand other worthless 
                        diversions which make up the sum total of the employments of Southern 
                        gentry--we had just as well quit holding humbug Conventions, and cease 
                        to afford the world the sorry spectacle of gaseous effervescence.  It is 
                        really humiliating to see the utter worthlessness of Southern young men. 
                        Take your position with me for half an hour upon the corner of a 
                        leading street in any of our principal towns, and I will show you in the 
                        first half dozen young men that pass that way, a type of nine-tenths of 
                        the youth of our "Sunny South."  The first who passes us by shall be a 
                        well dressed youth, with hat turned a little to one-side, and gently 
                        dropping toward the horizon; a large mustache shall adorn his superior 
                        labial; a five cent cigar shall be lodged in the corner of his mouth; a 
                        stout cane shall adorn his right hand.  He has a lofty air.  He is 
                        dressed in the latest style.   You edge a little to one side, and feel 
                        much humbled in the presence of your condescending superior.  He make 
                        you feel his greatness.  You next hear him at a political meeting 
                        talking loudly of Southern rights, and Northern oppression.  All would 
                        be very well, could you believe the man all he professes to be; but 
                        alas! these men want the elements of character to carry out in practice 
                        what they profess in public.  Such is not the material to make us richer 
                        or wiser.  We must have men at the helm of  affairs who will do more 
                        than smoke cigars, drink whiskey, and utter impotent threats, to which 
                        their energy can never give efficacy.  Let us, once for all, quit 
                        bragging.--Let  us do, do should be the watch word of every man.  But 
                        what does all this tend?--Why  simply, let us have a series of good 
                        lectures this winter to begin with.  Let our young  men be told that 
                        life is real, life is earnest, and that to mould the destinies of a 
                        nation  it wants more than the idle words of vaunting politicians--it 
                        requires energy of will  and a mind to the work.  I do believe much 
                        might be done to divert the minds of our  young men, from their vagrant 
                        habits, by setting before them, in a series of good,  sound, 
                        philosophical lectures, the ends of life.</p>

<b>Prosecution of Mr. Deneale</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Account of charges against Deneale for defrauding the Valley Bank in
                    Staunton.<br>(Names in announcement:  George Deneale,  K.A. Shands, Mr.  Taylor, Mr.  Trout, Mr.  Hoover,  Allen Bryan,  B.F. Michie,   Brock)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font><p>The investigation of the charge against Mr. George E. Deneale, was 
                    concluded on  Wednesday evening last, and resulted in his commitment for 
                    further examination  before the County Court on the fourth Monday in 
                    this month.--Mr. D. was admitted to  bail in the sum of $3,000, and has 
                    retured [sic] to his home in Rockingham.  The great  interest felt in 
                    regard to the matter induces us to present the facts of the case more  
                    at length.  In doing so we shall endeavor to state fairly what is 
                    alleged against Mr.  Deneale, and also the view taken of the 
                    transactions in question by the counsel engaged  in his defence.</p>
                    
                    <p>It seems that on the 16th day of November last, Mr. Deneale came to 
                        Staunton, in  company with Mr. E. A. Shands, for the purpose of 
                        arranging some matters of  importance with the Valley Bank.  Mr. Shands 
                        had been to Staunton on that day  attending to business of his own, and 
                        upon his way back met Mr. Deneale at Mt. Sidney,  who stated his desire 
                        to consolidate his indebtedness to the Bank and solicited Shands  to 
                        return with him to Staunton.  Mr. Shands complied with his request, and 
                        on that  night, a conference was held at Mr. Deneale's room at the 
                        Hotel, between Messrs.  Deneale and Shands, and Mr. Taylor, the Cashier, 
                        and Mr. Trout, a Director of the Bank.   Mr. Deneale stated that his 
                        object was to take up certain discounted notes and  acceptances of a man 
                        named Hoover, of Washington City, for which Mr. D. was bound.   Two of 
                        these were past due and protested, and two of them had not matured--the  
                        whole amounting to about nine thousand dollars.  Mr. Allen C. Bryan, of 
                        Harrisonburg,  was also an endorser upon some or perhaps all of these 
                        acceptances.  Both Mr. Bryan  and Mr. Shands had been the general 
                        endorsers of Mr. Deneale in the Bank of the Valley  and the Bank of 
                        Rockingham, and had implicit confidence in his integrity.  Mr. Deneale  
                        represented Hoover, who had been his cattle merchant, to be in failing 
                        circumstances,  or that his property was so covered up that the money 
                        could not be made out of him,  but thought if he had the paper in his 
                        hands and made a visit promptly to Washington,  that he might arrange 
                        the matter with Hoover and save himself--Hoover owing him,  according to 
                        his statement, about seventeen thousand dollars.  Mr. Deneale proposed 
                        to  effect his purpose by substituting his own negotiable note for nine 
                        thousand dollars,  endorsed by Allen C. Bryan and E. A. Shands, in lieu 
                        of the Hoover acceptances.  It was  suggested at the conference on the 
                        night of the 16th, that the Bank would probably go  into the arrangement 
                        if Mr. Deneale would execute a deed of trust, for the purpose of  
                        strengthening his endorsers.  This Mr. D. professed his willingness to 
                        do, making an  exhibit of his property, from which both Mr. Shands and 
                        Mr. Trout were satisfied of his  solvency.  The next day (17th of 
                        November) was the discount day at the Bank.  Mr.  Deneale's proposition 
                        for the discount of a negotiable note of nine thousand dollars,  
                        endorsed by Bryan and Shands, to enable him to lift the Hoover paper, 
                        came before the  Board, Mr. Deneale having a blank negotiable note 
                        endorsed by Mr. Bryan in his  possession.  The Board declined to make 
                        the arrangement unless an additional endorser  were given, or unless Mr. 
                        Deneale gave a deed of trust strengthening his proposed  endorsers.  The 
                        fact was communicated to him, and he expressed his readiness to  execute 
                        the deed, either for the immediate benefit of the Bank, or for the 
                        security of  Bryan and Shands.  The Bank preferred the latter 
                        arrangement, and Mr. Deneale executed  the deed to Mr. Trout, conveying 
                        to him a tract of land containing 107 acres, four  negroes, seventy head 
                        of stock cattle, eight head of horses and four mules, an amount  of 
                        property deemed abundantly ample to secure the nine thousand dollars, 
                        and  expressing his willingness to give additional indemnity whenever it 
                        was desired.  Mr.  Shands states that he did not, and did not [sic] 
                        intend to endorse the note until this  deed was executed.  The deed 
                        given, the Bank made the arrangement and the parties  returned to 
                        Harrisonburg, Mr. Trout having delivered the deed to Mr. Shands with the 
                        understanding that it was to be recorded whenever Shands and Bryan 
                        deemed that their  interest or that of the Bank required it.  Upon 
                        reaching Harrisonburg Mr. Shands learned  that the negro woman embraced 
                        in the deed had been sold.  He conferred with Mr.  Deneale in regard to 
                        the matter, who informed him that the woman did not suit Mrs.  Deneale, 
                        and that her place would be supplied by another, but that there was an  
                        abundance of property conveyed in the deed without the woman; and Mr. 
                        Shands became  satisfied in regard to the matter.  Subsequently rumors 
                        reached Mr. Shands, that Mr.  Brock, the father-in-law of Mr. Deneale, 
                        laid claim to the negroes, and to the cattle,  and that he (Deneale) had 
                        sold his home farm to Mr. Brock.  Mr. Shands became uneasy,  but Mr. 
                        Deneale promised that all should be right, stating, as Shands alleges, 
                        that the  negroes were not his but Brock's, and that he (D.) was only 
                        entitled to the profits on  the cattle over and above the purchase 
                        money.  Subsequently Mr. Deneale did execute a  second deed of trust to 
                        Mr. B. F. Michie, conveying all his property, and providing  first for 
                        the security of his endorsers, Bryan and Shands, and for the payment of  
                        the debtors due to the Bank at Staunton.  This second deed, however, did 
                        not embrace  the negroes, but 30 of the cattle and the profits on the 
                        remainder.  Mr. Shands recorded  the first deed on the 23rd of December; 
                        Mr. Michie, the second, on the same day.  The  Property embraced in the 
                        first deed is in the hands of the Sheriff of Rockingham,  claimed, by 
                        both Mr. Trout, the Trustee, and Mr. Brock. </p>
                    <p>These are the 
                            allegations against Mr. Deneale.  The counsel for the defense contend, 
                            in  the first place, that there was no false pretence; that Mr. Deneale 
                            was the legal owner  both of the negroes and the cattle, and therefore 
                            had the right to convey them in the  deed of trust.  They claim that the 
                            true facts of the case are briefly these:--That Mr.  Brock had advanced 
                            the money to buy the negroes, with the understanding that they  were to 
                            be the property of his daughter, Mrs. Deneale; and had loaned the money 
                            to buy  the cattle.  That although the legal title to both was in Mr. 
                            Deneale, he felt the force of  his obligations to Brock and his( D.'s) 
                            wife, and substituted in the second deed, for the  security of his 
                            endorsers, other property in the place of the negroes and the cattle,  
                            upon which he conceived Brock and Mrs. Deneale to have an equitable, 
                            though not a legal  claim.  In regard to the negro woman, it was claimed 
                            by the defense that she had  threatened to poison the family, and was 
                            sold during Mr. Deneale's absence, and without his knowledge; that the 
                            money for which she was sold was paid to Mr. Deneale, thus  furnishing 
                            additional evidence that she was his property.  In regard to all the 
                            negroes,  that he had always claimed them as his own, purchased them 
                            himself, had them in his  possession from the time of their purchase 
                            until they were taken by an officer, and  that his statements in regard 
                            to their belonging to Brock were made while he was  pressed by creditors 
                            upon a bed of sickness, and surrounded by circumstances going for  to 
                            extenuate whatever misrepresentation he may have made as to the 
                            ownership of the  slaves.  That the slaves being legally his own, but 
                            Brock having an equitable claim upon  them, there was not positively 
                            false representation either in asserting his own claim or that of Brock. 
                            It is contended that he did not intend to defraud anybody, much less  
                            Bryan and Shands or the Bank, whose security is largely increased by the 
                            provisions of  the second deed.  It is further claimed that he could not 
                            have designed to induce Shands  to go upon the note by consenting to 
                            execute the deed, inasmuch as he had never been  informed by Mr. Shands 
                            or anybody else that he (Shands) desired indemnity; in fact that  Mr. 
                            Shands studiously concealed any such desire from him.  The counsel took 
                            the ground  that Mr. Deneale, so far from desiring to perpetrate a 
                            fraud, had been guilty of nothing  in the whole transaction, 
                            inconsistent with the character of an honorable, upright,  honest 
                            man.</p>
                    <p>The case was argued at great length, and with great 
                            ability.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Dear Sir:--the people of this county 
                    are at a loss to understand why a change has been  made in the running 
                    of the freight trains on your road, which subjects them to great  
                    inconvenience, without any corresponding benefit, as far as they can 
                    see, to your  Company.</p>
                    <p>Why has Greenwood been made the night stand 
                        for the freight trains instead of  Waynesborough?  And why has such a 
                        schedule been adopted as to deprive the people of  Waynesborough and 
                        vicinity of all benefit from the accommodation car heretofore  connected 
                        with the freight train?</p>
                    <p>I understand there is a daily freight 
                            train to and from Greenwood, a point on your road,  on the other side of 
                            the mountain, where there is little freight to be accommodated,  whilst 
                            here we are required to put up with as bi-weekly train.  Staunton and  
                            Waynesborough are certainly more important depots of freight than 
                            Greenwood; then  why not extend your daily trains at least to one of 
                            these points?</p>
                    <p>As you are now running, the travel on the 
                                accommodation train, which heretofore paid a considerable revenue, is 
                                entirely cut off.  Why is this?  I understand your  superintendent says 
                                it would not pay.  I have been grossly misinformed if this is so.   The 
                                point, however, can be easily settled by a reference to your books, 
                                which I am told  will show that this accommodation car from 
                                Waynesborough, has paid every year, over  one thousand dollars, nearly 
                                the whole of which was clear profit.  By our present  arrangement 
                                scarcely anything is saved in the expense of running, and this whole  
                                revenue is cut off and lost.</p>
                    <p>The utter disregard of the interests 
                                    and convenience of the people west of the  mountain, evinced by your 
                                    Superintendent in making this change, has excited the  suspicion in the 
                                    minds of many persons, that he is little inclined to consult their  
                                    wants and wishes in the management of the road; and when they contrast 
                                    the facilities  afforded by his schedule to the east, with their own 
                                    grievances and inconveniences,  they cannot but deplore the fact, that 
                                    their section is powerless in the organization of  the Company.  
                                    Supposing that your board will at least investigate this matter, I call 
                                    it  to your immediate and serious attention.  Harmony in the 
                                    administration of the  Company is to be desired by every friend of the 
                                    road, but I say to you now in all candor  and earnestness, and with 
                                    perfect respect, that if we are to be thus treated as "outside 
                                    barbarians" in the conduct and management of a work of common interest 
                                    to east and  west alike, by those in power, we shall be compelled by 
                                    every consideration of interest  and self-respect to seek a redress of 
                                    grievances at the hands of a higher power than  your Superintendent, 
                                    yourself or your board, even though it should be at the expense of  
                                    harmony and good feeling.  This declaration is not made in a menacing 
                                    spirit, but is  simply intended to express our confidence that through 
                                    the aid of the impartial  representatives of the State, combined with 
                                    the Western vote in the company, we have  it in our power, whenever 
                                    driven to extremities, to secure a respectful consideration  of our 
                                    rights.  For you personally sir, I entertain the kindest feelings, and 
                                    from my  knowledge of your sense of justice, I am led to hope, that it 
                                    is only necessary thus to  call you attention to the subject to secure 
                                    for us the speedy interposition of the Board  to correct the error of a 
                                    subordinate officer.</p>
                    <p>To prove that the present is a bad 
                                        arrangement, I need only further state that freight  loaded at Jackson's 
                                        River on Monday evening, leaves there Tuesday morning, reaches  
                                        Millboro' same day and then lies over till Wednesday, and then goes on 
                                        to Greenwood,  where it lies over again till Thursday morning, and then 
                                        goes off, reaching Richmond  Thursday night, taking the best part of a 
                                        week to make the trip.</p>
                    <p>How do you suppose stock fares thus shut up 
                                            in the cars three or four days?  As this is  a public grievance I bring 
                                            it to your attention publicly.</p>
