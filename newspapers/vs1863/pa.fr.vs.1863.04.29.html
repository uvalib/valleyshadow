<b>Swan on Sumner -- Speech of Hon. W. D. Swan</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Senator W. D. Swan denounces the attempts of Senator Sumner to subsume the
                    states in the Union, and to essentially recognize the act of secession by
                    declaring the seceded states null and void. He also argues that Sumner and
                    others have essentially threatened Lincoln with imposing a dictatorship if he
                    did not issue the emancipation proclamation.<br>

<b>"We'll be Gay and Happy Still"</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors propose having a community picnic, and to invite their
                    political enemies, particularly Lieutenant Albert S. Ashmead of the Provost
                    Guard, and the editors of the Dispatch and Village Record. They could make it a
                    genuine Union picnic, and once everybody is together and having a good time, a
                    prayer could be offered that God would "turn to naught the counsels of wicked

<b>Who Shall be Governor?</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note that the Democratic party of the state will meet in a few
                    months to nominate candidates for Governor and Supreme Judge of the state. For
                    Supreme Judge, the incumbent, Hon. Walter H. Lowrie, should be nominated, the
                    editors argue, but the governor's race has no clear favorite. There are a number
                    of people whose names have been mentioned, but no one's nomination is certain.
                    The editors do not have a favorite, and mention no names, but they urge the
                    party to avoid fighting among itself, as they feel this is the only way they
                    could be defeated in the fall.<br>

<b>The Democracy in Council</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A "large and enthusiastic meeting of the Democracy" took place at the Court
                    House on Saturday night. Capt. Samuel B. McKesson was elected president, and
                    elected vice-presidents were: James Reilly and Col. John M. Gilmore of
                    Chambersburg, Samuel West of Hamilton Township, and John Wolfkill of Guilford
                    Township. William Kennedy, C. M. Duncan and W. S. Stenger, Esquires, were
                    appointed to draft resolutions, which were the same as those passed by the
                    Pennsylvania legislature and published earlier in the week, and which, when
                    passed, signified to the editors the "manifest indication of the Democracy to
                    cling to them in the fearful struggle for Constitutionally rights through which
                    the nation is now passing." J. McD. Sharpe, W. S. Stenger, and William Kennedy,
                    Esqs, all addressed the meeting. A committee for the permanent organization of a
                    Democratic club was then appointed, consisting of Hiram M. White, John M.
                    Gilmore, John S. Ludwig, B. F. Nead, and C. M. Duncan; a committee to draft the
                    bylaws was also appointed, consisting of Hiram C. Keyser, John Armstrong, and
                    George M. Stenger. The meeting was adjourned to reassemble at Montgomery's Hotel
                    on Saturday, May 9.<br>(Names in announcement: Capt. Samuel R. McKesson,  James Reilly,  Alexander H. Senseny,  John R. Orr, Col. John M.

<b>Riot and Assaults</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday night last, a difficulty occurred, at the edge of town, between
                        Mr. John P. Stouffer, of this county, and some members of the Provost
                        Guard--a portion of the first Maryland Cavalry. It seems that Mr. Stouffer
                        was on his way home, and meeting some of the guard, an altercation took
                        place, when the guard drew their pistols and inflicted several blows on
                        Stouffer's head and face, cutting him severely, and breaking his nose. What
                        the precise nature of the difficulty was, we have not yet learned; but from
                        what we have heard we can see no cause at all for the malicious assault and
                        we hope the offenders will be brought to justice, if we have any law left in
                        this community.</p>
                    <p>At a later hour the same evening, another disturbance occurred between some
                        of the guard and two or three of our german citizens, in which pistols were
                        also drawn, but, we are happy to learn, no blood was spilled.</p>
                    <p>On last Monday evening, some dispute arose betwe[e]n some of our citizens and
                        members of the Provost Guard, in which Henry A. Smith, a young man of this
                        town, was severely stabbed in the thigh by a member of the Provost Guard,
                        named Henderson. Smith ran a short distance after the wound was inflicted,
                        and then fell; he was carried home, and is now lying in a very critical
                        condition.</p>
                    <p>We know nothing whatever of the peculiar merits of either of these cases. But
                        we do know that members of the Provost Guard participated in each of these
                        disgraceful fights; and we ear[n]estly hope that Lieutenant Palmer will use
                        his influence and authority over tho [sic] men in his command to prevent any
                        similar occurrences in the future. We do not believe he had anything to do
                        with these outbreaks himself; but the community will hold him responsible
                        for the good behavior of his men.</p>
                    <p>Will "Lieutenant and Provost Marshal Ashmead" be kind enough to furnish us
                        the addres[s] of Colonel Fish! That gentleman was supplied with a copy of
                        our last issue and we desire to send him one of this week's papers also.</p>

<b>Religious</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

                    is expected to "unite with the church" next Sunday, and they praise the efforts
                    of Rev. Steck in recruiting new members.<br>(Names in announcement: Rev. Mr.  Steck)</blockquote>

                        The Sunday previous 33 persons were received into the Church by the solemn
                        rites of baptism and confirmation, most of whom were led to take this step
                        through the instrumentality of the protracted meeting held in said church.
                        We are informed that quite a number more are expected to unite with the
                        church at the next communion. The labors of the Pastor, Rev. Mr. Steck, have
                        thus been crowned with encouraging success.</p>

<b>The Militia</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A report on the reduction of the pay of the militia by the Pennsylvania
                    state Senate.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Among the bills passed by the State Legislature is one providing for the
                        payment of the militia. The House very justly granted a month's pay to the
                        men of September; but the Senate hunkishly cut this down one half, with
                        rations. As the soldiers received no clothing, and rations are not to be
                        charged, we suppose this half month's pay will be at the rate of full pay,
                        and not at the rate of thirteen dollars a month, which will bring it to
                        about the same thing for the privates.</p>
