<b>The True Conditions of American Loyalty</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints an address given by Hon. George T. Curtis to the Democratic Union
                    Association of New York City. He starts by noting the tactic of Republicans to
                    label Democrats as disloyal, and he proposes to demonstrate the true meaning of
                    loyalty, not the partisan definition. Curtis argues, among other things, that
                    loyalty also encompasses supporting the right of states to exercise the powers
                    reserved to them under the Constitution, and that a total supremacy of national
                    power is nowhere to be found in the Constitution. The abolitionists have
                    constructed a false test of loyalty to a form of national rule not envisioned by
                    the framers, he claims. He concludes by urging his listeners to act to prevent
                    the dismemberment of the country by reversing the course of the current
                    administration.<br>

<b>Negro Immigration</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors argue that Pennsylvania should prohibit the immigration of free
                    blacks, claiming that the government would do blacks an injustice by allowing
                    them to come to the state and sink into squalor. Instead, the editors assert,
                    the freed slaves should stay in the South.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A subject which is now exciting considerable discussion in the Northern
                        Border States, and which must continue to do so until it is definitely
                        settled, is the question of negro immigration. The liberated slaves are
                        finding their way into these States by thousands, and it is rapidly becoming
                        the great political and social problem of the day what to do with them.
                        Illinois has already decided that she will admit no more of them within her
                        borders, and Ohio and Indiana are about to follow her example. Should all
                        the Western Border States adopt the same policy, leaving only the one avenue
                        open to the free States, it will be high time for Pennsylvania to consider
                        what course philanthropy and self interest dictate that she should pursue.
                        Will it be for the interest either of her citizens or of these poor
                        unfortunates themselves, that they should be induced to settle in our midst?
                        Does true philanthropy dictate that the slaves should be encouraged to leave
                        their present condition, in the vain hope of finding a better; or do natural
                        instinct, the invaluable lessons of history and the bitter teachings of
                        experience tell us there is an impassible barrier, a great physical
                        difference, between the races; so great that they can never exist on terms
                        of equality, either in their political or social privileges; that the one is
                        incapable of appreciating the blessings or of applying the benefits of
                        liberty, while the other, by its superior intelligence, energy and
                        character, and the prejudice always entertained against subordinates and
                        inferiors, is driven inevitably to injustice and oppression. Said Mr.
                        Lincoln to a committee of negroes who waited upon him, in last August: "You
                        and we are difference races. We have between us a broader difference than
                        exists between any other two races. Whether it is right or wrong I need not
                        discuss, but this physical difference as [sic] a
                        great disadvantage to us both, as I think. Even when you cease to be slaves
                        you are far from being placed on an equality with the whites. On this broad
                        continent not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of
                        ours. Go where you are treated the best, and the ban is still upon you. I do
                        not propose to discuss this, but to present it as a fact with which we have to deal." What, then, is the boasted liberty
                        to which the false philanthropy of the North invites the slave? What but
                        roofless, crowded, unhealthy hovels, fireless chimney-places, and a life of
                        indolence, disease and crime? Let him who doubts the picture look at the
                        wretchedness of those that, during the last two years, have come to us to
                        find that liberty of which they have heard so much from the pulpit and the
                        press of the North. You say they have found liberty--true, but they have
                        also found starvation and rags. So great has been their destitution that,
                        during the past winter, appeal after appeal has been made, individually and
                        in our churches, to the benevolent, for their relief. Verily, freedom has
                        proved but an empty name to many of them. Liberty is an enchanting word, but
                        it won't find work for us, or buy us bread, or pay our rent, or get us
                        clothes, or build us fires wherewithal to warm our shivering limbs. No, let
                        us cast from our minds the fallacy that philanthropy and charity urge us to
                        encourage the negroes of the South to come amongst us--to come forsooth,
                        that they may be elevated! They but come to their everlasting degradation.
                        Let us discourage, and if necessary forbid, their coming. The decree may
                        sound harsh and inhuman, but it is for their good and our own; and, if
                        natural and physical developments go for any thing in this world, it is in
                        accordance with the inscrutable decree of the Almighty, who, for some wise
                        purpose of his own, has set this great, natural, physical, constitutional
                        difference between the races. The difference does exist; it must be dealt
                        with as an existing fact; and he who complains of it, simply brings the
                        charge of injustice or want of wisdom against the creator.</p>

<b>The Blood-thirsty Knight</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors reprint a portion of a letter from the Transcript's army
                    correspondent, in which the writer assails local "copperheads." The editors
                    reveal that the writer's name is William Tell Barnitz, a resident of Waynesboro

                    he has a criminal background in his native state of Texas. They also accuse

                    invaded, and the last to return, and they also impugn his bravery in his
                    subsequent military service.<br>(Names in announcement:  William Tell Barnitz)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--A Tale of the Rebellion--Chapter the First. The Transcript has an army correspondent who writes from Newberee,
                        over the signature "W.T.B." and who is quite a character in his own little
                        way. As a "specimen brick" of his elaborate productions, we give a small
                        extract from his last letter:</p>
                    <p>How are you, Copperheads? I really do hope that these few
                        lines may find you in the highly gratifying condition of a Jackass
                        turned out to die, Charitable! I guess it is charitable! You ought to be
                        strung up to the telegraph poles along the Rail Road, with a board on your
                        backs inscribed sic semper traitoribus! so that
                        the world might see that we really did intend to annihilate the hybrids
                        hatching in loyal nests. Yes, I really do wish that you were under the sod,
                        so that the carbonic acid gas, and the vast, vast
                        amount of heavy carburetted [sic] hydrogen of gas of which you are mostly
                        composed, might be reproduced in pork--I doubt whether it would make a good
                        beef--and somehow transmitted to Dixie, to feed your brethren in arms
                        against this hated Republic. But just here, I'm reminded, that like produces
                        like, and hence, the army of Jeff., having assimilated the bacon, would
                        become refractory and profoundly cowardly; yes,
                        yes its all right!--we would soon finish things then! I have found, wherever
                        I have traveled, that the lowest, meanest, dirtiest, draggle tailed, whisky
                        drinking, card-playing, horse-racing, hell-defying, in short, what might be
                        expected as denizens of the purlieus of Hell, are Copperheads. Reader,
                        examine the characters around you; how many really good, respectable
                        citizens do you find arrayed against their country, blating against
                        Abolitionists, just as the "Rebs" do--and preaching Union and peace, just as
                        hypocrit[e]s cry heaven, with hell in their bosoms!"</p>
                    <p>We deem it unnecessary to refer to style or spirit of this communication--it
                        is a sufficient answer unto itself; but it seems unfair to let this valiant
                        knight, who is for pledging his gauntlet to such great things, go down to
                        posterity "unwept, unhonored and unsung;" and we will therefore attempt a
                        brief sketch of his life and character. His full maiden name is William Tell
                        Barnitz. The place of his birth is, we learn, unknown, even to himself,
                        although it is highly probable he was present on that eventful occasion. The
                        early portion of his life was spent in Texas, which State he very
                        unceremoniously left, between two days, for reasons best known to himself.
                        He halted in his flight at Waynesboro', in this county, where he soon became
                        known as a blatant and slanderous abolitionist, and wrote dirty,
                        contemptible articles in the Village Record
                        assailing and villifying [sic] many of the oldest and most highly respected
                        inhabitants of that vicinity. Extravagant as were his professions of
                        patriotism and bravery, he was the very first in the town to "skedaddle"
                        when the rebels entered Maryland, and the very last to come back, after the
                        enemy had been driven back into Virginia. Chivalric as he always pretended
                        to be, he could never be induced to enlist in defence of his country, and
                        would not now be in the army had he not been drafted and found himself
                        unable to procure a substitute. His professions of "unconditional loyalty,"
                        as the terms are at present understood, soon secured for him a Captain's
                        shoulder straps, and he is now making good his chances for promotion, by
                        writing himself down an ass--an all-important qualification for office under
                        the present dynasty. In his graphic account of the terrific charge across
                        White Oak river into some deserted rebel entrenchments, the chivalrous
                        knight forgets one important item, which we are enabled to furnish from one
                        of our "army specials," always "on the spot." While crossing this river,
                        after the scouts had reported no enemy in sight, the Captain suddenly became
                        inspired with ecstatic valor, and, brandishing his bloodless sword in the
                        air, wanted immediately to cut several hundred rebel throats in cold blood.
                        But his pride was destined to have a fall; for, like his illustrious
                        prototype, Don Quixote, when he attacked the windmills, his sword, striking
                        the bridge, flew from his grasp, and sunk into the river, amidst the jeers
                        and the hootings of all who saw the knight's mishap. "And, there," says our
                        informant, "it is yet, and it is a matter of very little importance whether
                        he ever gets it or not; for he would be the last man to use it, even if he
                        does get into a pinch, which, in my opinion, he will take very good care not
                        to." So much for William Tell Barnitz. Our limited space forbids a more
                        extended notice. We have a few facts in reserve; and have simply intended in
                        this article to show what manner of man he is who wants all the
                        "Copperheads" "strung up to the telegraph poles along the rail road." In all
                        sincerity we suggest to the Captain to modify his views before he returns to
                        Franklin county, or during one of his valiant sallies, he may find a
                        considerable quantity of copperhead boot-leather inserted somewheres about
                        the lower end of his spinal column. We are not sufficiently classical, dear
                        Captain, to imitate your chaste style, but allow us to make a bungle of the
                        French for farewell, and say overtheriver.</p>

<b>Is This Treason?</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors ask a series of rhetorical questions about loyalty, including:
                    is it treasonous to have doubted the South's capitulation in the first three
                    months of the war? Is it treasonous to have doubted that a force of 75,000 could
                    subdue them? Is it treasonous to protest the suspension of habeas corpus? Is it
                    treasonous to denounce corruption and fraud in the government? Or to think that
                    the emancipation proclamation is unwise and unconstitutional? Or to argue that
                    the Union can be saved only by a combination of the olive branch and the sword?
                    If that is treason, they conclude, then Democrats are treasonous. However, they
                    argue, the party is not disloyal. Rather, they say, these Democratic policies
                    indicate "the only sure path to a safe and honorable peace."<br>

<b>Who Gives Aid and Comfort to the Rebellion?</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>

                    fifty dollar notes are covered on the back with the number 50. One person has
