<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Why are not some measures taken to reorganize the 126th regiment, or to get
                        up some other efficient organization, for State defense? Do the people of
                        Franklin county intend to do absolutely nothing for the protection of their
                        property and the defense of their homes? While New York and New Jersey and
                        other portions of our own State are sending men to our relief, shall
                        Franklin county have the disgrace of not furnishing a single full company
                        for the emergency? Young men of Chambersburg, you who talk so bravely and
                        boast so of your loyalty and patriotism, when no danger is nigh, does it not
                        make your cheeks tingle with very shame, when you see regiment after
                        regiment marching through your streets to protect your homes, while you
                        yourselves have not the patriotism or the courage to shoulder your muskets?
                        Let us hear no more of your braggart "rally round the flag, boys!" if you
                        fail to be equal to the demands of the present crisis. Does your valor and
                        patriotism go no farther than singing patriotic songs through the streets at
                        midnight? If so you had better let your heroic virtues remain unsung. It is
                        true, the enemy came upon us so suddenly, nothing could be done before their
                        arrival. But now nothing stands in the way, and although the worst of the
                        crisis may be past, let the young men of the county at least show their
                        willingness to respond to the call, and save their credit.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    there had been such a body to throw against Lee, they claim, he could have been
                    easily defeated. The present system of raising troops is inadequate, and
                    something new must be done to prevent further invasions.<br>

<b>The Democratic Nominees</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors discuss the two candidates nominated by the State Democratic
                    Convention. Hon. George W. Woodward was not originally a nominee for the
                    position, but his name was put in as the "unusual interest and anxiety" over the
                    nomination produced a series of deadlocked ballots. Woodward was a framer of the
                    current State Constitution, and was the first Democratic nominee for Supreme
                    Court when the office was made elective. His decisions, along with Chief Justice
                    Lowrie, who was renominated for election, are among the most cited from the
                    bench. It is fitting, say the editors, that he be nominated as a man of law to
                    help safeguard civil liberties before they are "irrevocably swept away."<br>

                    <p>Chambersburg, July 11th, 1863.</p>
                    <p>
                        Editors of Spirit and Times:
                    </p>
                    <p>Soon after the first occupation of this place by the Rebel Cavalry under
                        General Jenkins, the following appeared in the Lancaster Express:</p>
                    <p>"A gentleman from Shippensburg informs the editor of the Harrisburg Telegraph that he was present at an interview
                        between General Jenkins and some prominent Republicans at Chambersburg.
                        After discussing matters connected with the war for some time, a prominent
                        office-holder of Franklin county stepped up and introduced himself to the
                        Rebel General Jenkins said that he ought to refuse shaking him by the hand.
                        The office-holder desired to know the reason of such treatment. General
                        Jenkins asked the question, "are you the District Attorney from this
                        county?" "Yes!" was the reply. "Then you are a regular Copperhead." "That is
                        what they call me," replied the office-holder. To which the Rebel General
                        replied, "Lincoln ought to have hung you and the rest of the Copperheads
                        long ago. We would not tolerate such men in the Southern Confederacy. We
                        respect those who are against us in the North much more than the
                        Copperheads'."</p>
                    <p>I am the District Attorney of Franklin county. I have never taken part in any
                        such conversation. I have never spoken a word to General Jenkins, nor has he
                        to me. During the time he held possession of the town, I did not even see
                        him. And further, I have made diligent inquiry to discover whether or not
                        such remarks were made to any one in this place, by General Jenkins, and am
                        fully satisfied that the report is utterly without foundation in fact.</p>
                    <p>This report would be unworthy of denial were it not that the Republican
                        papers are circulating it as widely as possible for the purpose of casting
                        odium upon the Democratic party. Personally, I care nothing for these
                        falsehoods. I would rather have malignant fanatics pour out their vilest
                        contumely on my head, than damn me with their faint praise.</p>
                    <p>But allow me a few words in behalf of the Democrats of Franklin county. Some
                        of them have been subjected to the most violent and unjust abuse. Charges of
                        "welcoming the Rebels to our soil"--of "giving them all the information in
                        their power"--of "entertaining them at their homes," of hoping and
                        expressing the hope to them "that the Federal army would be destroyed" have
                        been made, but there is no proof. Only last night, one of the members of
                        General Couch's staff (I believe) stood upon the veranda[h] of the Franklin
                        Hotel, on the occasion of a serenade to his chief, and in an eloquent
                        speech, slandered a portion of the citizens of this community by a
                        repetition of such charges as the above. This gentleman was doubtless
                        misinformed as to the facts by some returned "skedaddler." I defy them all
                        to point to a single Democrat in this place, who gave to the Rebels a word
                        of welcome, of important information, or of sympathy. Bring on the proof,
                        and I will do all in my power to have such men punished. Such reports
                        originate with the life-long defamers of the Democratic party--men who,
                        Pharisee like, now attempt to monopolize all the patriotism of the country,
                        and thank their God that they are not as other men are--not even as these
                        poor "Copperheads." Let them remember that "he that exalteth himself shall
                        be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."</p>
                    <p>True to the principles of our forefathers as embodied in the Declaration of
                        Independence--true to the Constitution of the United States whose every line
                        evinces the wisdom and patriotism of its framers, and true to the Union
                        whose foundation-stone is that same Constitution, the Democracy can laugh to
                        scorn the opprobrious epithets and foul calumnies of its foes.</p>
                    <p>Yours, Truly, <br>W.S. Stenger.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As we stated last week, the rebel army commenced its retreat from Gettysburg,
                        on Friday night, the 3rd, inst. by way of Millerstown, Monterey, Waynesboro,
                        Lictersburg and Funkstown Maryland. Their line, during the greater portion
                        of last week, extended from Leitersburg, through Hagerstown to the Potomac
                        beyond Williamsport. Several severe cavalry engagements occurred, in the
                        vicinity of Funkstown and Boonsboro, between Buford and Kilipatrick, on our
                        side, and Stewart's Jenkin's rebel forces, on Wednesday and Thursday, in
                        which the rebel forces were driven back with heavy loss. On Saturday last,
                        Sedgewick attacked Longstreet near Hagerstown, and drove him several miles.
                        On Sunday the greater portion of the rebel army was massed near
                        Williamsport, no doubt with the intention of crossing the river at that
                        point. Accounts disagree as to whether there is a pontoon bridge at
                        Williamsport, but the general impression seems to be that one was
                        constructed there last week, previous to which the rebels had been sending
                        over their wounded on one or two old scows.</p>
                    <p>The army of the Potomac has been lying from Boonsboro towards Harper's Ferry.
                        A considerable force is now lying near Waynesboro while on Friday, Saturday
                        and Sunday, a large force of Pennsylvania and New York militia passed
                        through the town for the seat of war.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Couch and staff arrived on Friday, and Gen. Dana on Sunday, Gen. Couch

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are pained to record the fact that some of the militia, who so nobly came
                        to the rescue of Southern Pennsylvania, have been behaving very badly. On
                        Thursday evening last, a disgraceful riot occur[r]ed in the diamond, which
                        for a while threatened to be of a serious character. Some members of one of
                        the New York regiments, getting into a discussion with Captain Doebler, who
                        is still suffering from the wound received at Fredericksburg, called the
                        Captain "a d--d coward." The Captain replied by striking the fellow over the
                        head with his cain. The "muss" then became general, and several citizens who
                        interfered to protect the Captain in his disabled condition, were roughly
                        handled. Some of them were chased through the streets by the infuriated
                        crowd, armed with pistols, sabres, guns and bayonets, with cries of "shoot
                        them!" "hang them!" "kill them!" The disgraceful scene was brought to a
                        close by the interference of several officers; and although some blood was
                        spliled [sic], we are happy to record the fact that no one was seriously
                        injured. As we have such an institution as a provost marshal here now, we
                        hope measure will be taken to prevent any such outbreaks in the future.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The rebels left us a large inheritance of dirt and filth, on their departure
                        from this place. They had taken possession of the Court House and Franklin
                        Hall, and left dirt to the depth of one or two inches on their floors. They
                        had quartered some of their horses and troops in the streets and on our
                        pavements, and the stench they left behind was almost unbearable. Lime was
                        liberally sprinkled around, and the heavy rains of the last few days have
                        partially restored our wonted state of cleanliness. It would not be a bad
                        idea to have the streets scraped as soon as practicable.</p>
