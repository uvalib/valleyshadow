<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A notice of the Democratic State Convention, to be held in Harrisburg on
                    Wednesday, June 17, which will nominate candidates for Governor and Judge of the
                    Supreme Court. A meeting of Democratic newspaper editors will be held the same
                    day at the same place.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Transcript Against Itself</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors quote criticisms of the Buchanan administration in 1859 from
                    the Transcript, and ask the editors of that paper if at that time criticism of
                    the administration was equal to criticism of the government--which is what the
                    Transcript believes attacks on Lincoln are tantamount to.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors argue that the traditions of the Democratic party are the only
                    thing that can rescue the country from the "darkness and gloom that now veil our
                    national prosperity."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors reprint a resolution adopted by the Union League of
                    Chambersburg, inviting the "ladies of Chambersburg and vicinity" to attend their
                    meetings. The editors encourage "very young and very old ladies" to attend, as
                    they will "no doubt find congenial company among the Leaguers."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Mr. Vallandigham</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The writer argues that the expulsion of Mr. Vallandigham beyond federal
                    lines was "the funeral of civil liberty." He was guilty of no offense save that
                    of speaking his mind and was punished because of his condemnation of those in
                    power who have broken laws.<br>

                    a lieutenant in the 54th Massachusetts, "Gov. Andrew's negro regiment." Young

<b>Democratic Meeting</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A "large and enthusiastic meeting" of the Democratic Club was held in
                    Franklin Hall on last Saturday evening, and was better attended, claim the
                    editors, than any of the "Union League" meetings. Capt. Samuel R. McKesson and
                    John R. Orr, Esq., acted as President and Secretary. B. F. Nead, Esq., reported
                    that Franklin Hall had been secured as a regular meeting place for the club. H.

                    series of articles for organization which were approved. William Kennedy, Esq.,
                    introduced Congressman William H. Miller of Harrisburg, who in his speech
                    denounced the restrictions on the freedom of speech, the arrest of Vallandigham,
                    and the attempts by Republicans to equate criticism of the administration with
                    criticism of the government. Miller's speech was interrupted by hissing from
                    "several 'Union Leaguers' and a dozen boys, whom they seemed to have in charge,"
                    who were escorted out of the hall. Hon. George W. Brewer then addressed the
                    gathering.<br>(Names in announcement: Capt. Samuel R. McKesson,  John R. OrrEsq.,  B. F. NeadEsq.,  H. C. Keyser,  William KennedyEsq., Hon. William H. Miller, Hon. George W. Brewer)</blockquote>

                    Corps of the Army of the Potomac. The brigade of nine-months men in which Dr.

                    retired to private life.<br>(Names in announcement: Dr. William C. Lane)</blockquote>
<b>An Apology</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors apologize for omitting the participation of the Hope and
                    Friendship fire brigades in the parade celebrating the return of the 126th
                    Regiment. The editors then go on to praise the organization and regalia of the
                    two companies.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Nuisance</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

                    near "Wallace's corner" in Chambersburg, and ask the police to disperse them.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The attention of our borough Police is directed to the crowd of darkies who,
                        at all hours of the day and night, may be found congregated near "Wallace's
                        corner," indulging in all manner of blasphemy and obscene language. They so
                        obstruct the side walk that it is almost impassible, especially for the
                        ladies, many of whom are compelled to cross the street to avoid the dark crowd. This nuisance, instead of abating, is
                        on the increase and our borough officers should see that these darkies, like
                        poor Joe in "Bleak House," are made to "move on."</p>
