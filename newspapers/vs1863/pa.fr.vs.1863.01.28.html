<b>The Fulton County Affair</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors relay the facts in the shooting of Lieut. Ford by John Forney
                    in Fulton County. Forney, 46, had been listed as exempt from the draft since he
                    was older than 45. However, he had been put back on the draft list somehow, and
                    was subsequently put on a list to be arrested as a deserter. He was arrested by
                    the Provost Guard and, on Forney's writ of habeas corpus, was brought before a
                    judge who then dismissed the case. Lieut. Ford and two other men went to
                    Forney's house to re-arrest him after this, which is when Forney shot him.
                    Forney then turned himself in and was taken to Washington by military
                    authorities. The editors comment only that the military seems to be trying to
                    usurp civilian authority, and the removal of Forney from his home county is a
                    dangerous precedent--he should be tried by his peers where the crime was
                    committed.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Bribery and Corruption</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors draw the reader's attention to an article on the same page
                    wherein T. Jefferson Boyer, member of the state legislature from Clearfield
                    County, claims he was offered $25,000 to vote for Simon Cameron for the U.S.
                    Senate.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Contrast</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors ask the reader to contrast the "fair and impartial" treatment
                    of the Forney affair in their paper with the "vile, false, and malicious
                    statement" of the Dispatch on the matter.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Good Suggestion</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note the collection of stories from across the political
                    spectrum, all of which agree that morale in the Army of the Potomac is low,
                    though there is little agreement on why. It is clear to the editors that the
                    poor morale is due to the removal of General McClellan from command, and they
                    sarcastically suggest that he be brought in to address the men to try to make
                    them forget the incompetence and tragedy of Fredericksburg.<br>

<b>Returning Justice</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

                    the writ of habeas corpus for draft rioters, thus denying the right of the
                    President to sustain it in such cases.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Moccasin Tracks!--Attempts to Bribe a Member of the Legislature</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter from T. Jefferson Boyer, a Democratic member of the state
                    legislature, in which he alleges that representatives of Simon Cameron, and then
                    Cameron himself, offered him money to vote for Cameron for the U.S. Senate.<br>

<b>Drafted Men Discharged</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A pair of news articles describing the shooting of Lieutenant E. N. Ford of
                    the Provost Guard, who had been summoned from Chambersburg to Fulton County to
                    arrest John Forney. Ford and his two men entered Forney's house and searched the
                    lower level. As Ford approached the stairs, he saw Forney at the top; as Ford
                    turned to get his men, he was shot through the shoulder. His wound is severe and
                    it is not known if he will survive.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Last Tuesday evening a small stable situated on the premises of Mr. Nicholas
                        Uglo, on Broad Lane, was entirely destroyed by fire. The fire companies,
                        together with the Hook and Ladder company were promptly on the ground, and
                        rendered efficient service. In endeavoring to obtain some water from a
                        cistern in the neighborhood, the firemen met with an unpleasant reception
                        from the inmates of a German family, who proceeded to administer a severe
                        castigation to the men about using the water. A squable [sic] ensued, which
                        was frightful in the extreme--our German friends, however, coming out of the
                        conflict "second best"--the firemen laying several of them almost as low as
                        a tumble bug after being passed over with a vehicle. We have often
                        questioned the propriety of firemen tearing down more fences than necessary,
                        or in case of fire in a dwelling house "to throw the looking glass out of
                        the window and carry the bed clothes down stairs," but of their perfect
                        liberty to relieve a cistern of its contents of water in cases of emergency,
                        or of absolute necessity, we have never entertained a doubt.</p>

                    <p>At no previous time in our history has counterfeit money been so abundant.
                        The great scarcity of the currency, caused by the withdrawal of specie from
                        circulation, the great demand for change by soldiers and civilians, and the
                        utter recklessness of persons receiving notes without inspecting them, have
                        all combined to make the "bogus" coin appear among us. We have neither seen
                        nor heard of any of the Treasury notes imitated and put in circulation, but
                        one of our co[n]temporaries learns the astounding fact that a large order is
                        being executed in England for some rascals in the United States, but there
                        are plenty of counterfeits in the shape of paper money from five cent
