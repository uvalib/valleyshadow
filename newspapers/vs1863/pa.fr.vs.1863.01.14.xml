                    must be learned, as every science is learned, by special study and application.
                    As well might a cobbler attempt to make a steam engine, as a citizen, not
                    learned in the art of war, to command a great army or criticize its movements

                <summary>The Spirit's editors respond to an attack on their paper that appeared in
                    the Repository and Transcript. The Repository author claimed that there was no
                    difference in criticizing McClellan and criticizing the President, as the Spirit
                    often does, since both are public figures. However, the Spirit's editors claim,
                    the President is a representative of the people and thus everybody has a right
                    to critique him. On the other hand, citizens who do not understand warfare do
                    not have grounds to assess generals.</summary>

                    <p>After the battle of Antietam, when Gen. McClellan was resting and
                        reorganizing his army, on the banks of the Potomac, preparatory to a grand
                        forward movement, the whole abolition pack, from Greely &amp; Co., down
                        to the small fry politicians who deal out driblets of abolition treason on
                        street corners and in small groceries, raised one universal howl of
                        dissatisfaction. They charged Gen. McClellan with slowness, inactivity and
                        dillydallying with the enemy. They depreciated the victories gained at South
                        Mountain and Antietam, which rescued Maryland from the rebels and saved
                        Pennsylvania from invasion. They even went so far in partisan malignity and
                        bigoted prejudice as to assert that McClellan was beaten at Antietam.</p>
                    <p>"On to Richmond" was their cry and their patriotism (?) was of such an
                        intense character, that nothing would satisfy them but a direct march to
                        Richmond by the nearest rout and the capture of the rebel capital. They
                        could brook no delays. They spurned the mere mention of "strategic
                        movements." McClellan was the great barrier in the way of success, and his
                        removal was demanded by ten thousand abolition voices.</p>
                    <p>The clamor had its desired effect. A weak and vacillating President was made
                        to bend before this storm of abolition fanaticism.</p>
                    <p>One dark and stormy night, a messenger from the President of the United
                        States was sent into the camps of the Army of the Potomac with an order
                        relieving Gen. McClellan of the command and appointing Gen. Burnside in his
                        place. The announcement of the fact was greeted by this horde of Abolition
                        fanatics with an insane shout of joy. Now Richmond would be taken, we were
                        told, without further delay and we anxiously looked for a fulfil[l]ment of
                        the promise.</p>
                    <p>But how has the promise been fulfilled? Gen Burnside fought one battle on the
                        slapdash principle of the "On to Richmond" party and was terribly repulsed
                        with an immense sacrifice of human life, and for over four weeks, the grand
                        Army of the Potomac has been lying, inactive, on the north bank of the
                        Rappahannock, no nearer Richmond than it was on that fatal November night,
                        when Lincoln's messenger arrived in camp with the order for McClellan's
                        Removal. Why don't the Abolitionists howl? They seem to be as silent as the
                        grave. Is there less necessity for the capture of Richmond now than there
                        was when McClellan was in command? Or was this clamor against McClellan only
                        used by corrupt and bigoted partisans for the purpose of pulling down the
                        ablest and most accomplished soldier in America? Impartial history will
                        record the fact that General Geo. B. McClellan was removed from his command
                        through the <emph rend="italic">basest partisan motives</emph>, and the
                        battle at Fredericksburg will remain a standing monument of the fanaticism
                        and folly of Abolitionism.</p>

                <summary>The editors wonder why the abolitionists are not as quick to criticize
                    General Burnside for his failure at Fredericksburg as they were to attack
                    General McClellan. The answer, they surmise, is that the attacks on McClellan
                    were nothing more than pure partisanship.</summary>

                <summary>Argues that, while General Burnside deserves some of the blame for the
                    defeat at Fredericksburg, the larger share lies with radical abolitionists and
                    their representatives in Washington, who have been pushing for a rapid assault
                    on Richmond. Burnside replaced McClellan with the understanding that he would
                    act fast, which he did. However, the premium put on swift action underestimated
                    Southern courage and skill, a mistake that conservatives never made. The
                    radicals thus set the Union army up for defeat at Fredericksburg.</summary>

                <summary>Corporal Thomas Daily of Upton carried the colors, not only of the 126th
                    Reg't Penn. Volunteers off the battle field, but those of the 134th as well.
                    General Humphrey observed this and relieved Daily of his musket, saying "'it is
                    honor enough to carry the colors of two regiments." Thomas and his colleagues
                    "marched proudly on" afterwards.</summary>
