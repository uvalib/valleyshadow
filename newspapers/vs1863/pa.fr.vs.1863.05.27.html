<b>Freedom of Speech and of the Press</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors discuss the meaning of the freedom of speech and the freedom of
                    the press as intended by the framers of the Constitution. They then turn to
                    editorials from Republican papers in New York and in Harrisburg that encourage
                    the formation of Union Leagues to put down treason in the North. What these
                    leagues are designed to do, say the editors, is to repress Democrats, who are
                    merely exercising their guaranteed rights under the Constitution. The
                    suppression of free speech by such groups, and by military authorities, is "the
                    first step in the road which leads to despotism," conclude the editors.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report that some unnamed people had hoped that the returning
                    soldiers would commit some unspecified acts of violence. If these men had
                    actually mingled with the soldiers upon their return, they would have found
                    among the soldiers an "almost unanimous expression of conservative sentiment."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Last Saturday was a grand gala-day for Chambersburg--a day of happiness and
                        rejoicing and good cheer. Early in the week, persons from a distance came to
                        town, in the expectation that our brave boys of the 126th Regiment would
                        reach home by that time; and most of them remained until the close of the
                        week, though it was ascertained on Thursday that they would not arrive until
                        Saturday. Early on the morning of the latter day, the people from the
                        country began pouring into town from every direction. The Hotels were soon
                        filled to overflowing, and their yards and the neighboring streets lined
                        with vehicles of every description. And then the towns-people began to run
                        out their flags and close their places of business, as the Court House bell
                        announced that the train was on its way from Harrisburg, bringing home the
                        loved ones whose coming had been so anxiously awaited. It was soon manifest
                        that the people--men, women and children--fathers, mothers, wives, sisters,
                        brothers and friends--were resolved to give the returning volunteers such a
                        reception as they deserved--independent of politics and the small
                        politicians. At the third ringing of the bell, which was the signal that the
                        train had reached Shippensburg, the crowd wended its way towards the Depot,
                        w[h]ere every available space was soon filled. About half-past ten, the bell
                        on the Catholic church announced that the train had turned the curve three
                        miles from town, and then the excitement became intense. The train halted at
                        "the intersection;" and the procession, consisting of the Provost Guard, the
                        cadets of the Academy, under command of Mr. Kinney, thirty-four little girls
                        dressed in white and bearing the national colors, representing the States of
                        the Union, a carriage containing Colonel Elder, and another with Judges
                        Chambers and Nill, received the volunteers, who were under command of Lieut.
                        Col. Rowe, on Broad Street. The procession moved up Second Street to Market,
                        out East Market to "the point," in East Queen to Second, up Second to
                        Catharine, down Catharine to Main, down Main to the Diamond, out West Market
                        to New England Hill, and then countermarched to the Diamond, where the
                        address of welcome was delivered by Rev. S.J. Niccolls. Along the route the
                        pavements were thronged with spectators, and dainty little flags and cambric
                        fluttered from every window as the procession passed-beauty doing honor to
                        valor. After the address and some music by the Band and the little girls,
                        the soldiers were invited to partake of a collation in the Hall, prepared by
                        the ladies of the town. The Hall was beautifully decorated with evergreen
                        and flowers; the walls were adorned with the national colors and many such
                        inscriptions as: "Welcome to our brave defenders, "Tyler's brave boys,"
                        "Welcome 126th," "Honor to the brave," &amp;c., &amp;c. There were
                        seven long tables, running the entire length of the Hall, and these tables
                        groaned under a profusion of all the substantials and delicacies the country
                        could afford. A noted feature in the procession was the band wagon
                        containing a number of the wounded in the late battles.</p>
                    <p>After the collation, Companies B. C. E. and K. again took the cars for their
                        respective home, Greencastle, Waynesboro and Mercersburg, where similar
                        receptions awaited them.</p>
                    <p>The day passed off very peaceably and quietly. We believe we have seldom or
                        never seen such a large crowd in town, with so little drunkenness, rowdyism
                        or disdurbance [sic]. The returned soldiers, to a man, conducted themselves
                        in a manner that comported with the honorable name they have won; and
                        despite the predictions of rowdyism, indulged in by some of their professed
                        friends, they proved that under their bearded and sun burnt faces there was
                        still to be found that high sense of justice, honor and manliness, which
                        always characterizes the American citizen soldier.</p>

<b>Synopsis of the Proceedings of the Franklin County Educational Association</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

                    made by various members. Thursday morning session: Called to order by

                    C. B. Wolff, A. B. Stoler and T. M. Richards were appointed to invite the
                    teachers of the different "Literary Institutions" of the area to attend the
                    meetings. Mr. Richards gave an exercise in "Round Numbers." Orthography was
                    again taken up, and Rev. J. Agnew gave his experience of teaching orthography
                    and reading to a child "that was particularly dull" when he was a missionary
                    among the Indians. C. B. Wolff read from McGuffey's Sixth Reader. The chair
                    appointed John R. Gaff, C. B. Wolff, T. M. Richards, A. B. Stoler, H. C.

                    Illustrations on Alligation by C. B. Wolff. The committee on resolutions
                    reported a number of resolutions that were subsequently adopted, including one
                    that thanked the friends and patrons of the Common Schools for helping "the
                    dissipation of prejudice and opposition to our Common School system in the
                    district here represented;" another which pledged the association's support for
                    the restoration of the Republic; and another which blamed the present state of
                    the country on "a want of moral and religious training, and we regard it as the
                    teacher's duty to inculcate the principles of sound morality and religion; also
                    to teach the principles of free Government, and obedience to law and order."
                    Thursday evening session: Prayer by Rev. Mr. Creigh. On a motion by A. McElwain,
                    Rev. J. R. Agnew gave a demonstration of his Terraecoelian Globe, which he
                    invented, which facilitates the teaching of astronomy. A. B. Wingert then read
                    an essay on "The Responsibilities of the Teacher," and Messrs. Gaff, Wolff and
                    J. S. McElwain were appointed a committee to obtain a copy of that essay for
                    publication. J. S. McElwain explained his method for teaching Geography, which
                    was then the subject of "a spirited discussion" by the Association. Friday
