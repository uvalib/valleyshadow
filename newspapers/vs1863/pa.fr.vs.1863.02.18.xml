                <summary>A reprint of the instructions of Judge Lowrie of the Supreme Court to the
                    jury in the case of the editor of the Jeffersonian, who was seized by military
                    authorities, supposedly for treasonous activities. The judge concludes that the
                    authorities were not commanded to do so by the President, and that even in the
                    time of war, if the situation is not immediately pressing, Constitutional
                    liberties must be preserved. All public authorities operate under law, he
                    states, and none are above it, and the actions of the authorities in this case
                    appear to be in contradiction to the law. He leaves it to the jury to decide the
                    damages that should be awarded.</summary>

                <summary>The editors argue that the country is in the throes of two rebellions, one
                    Southern and one Northern. The Southern began in 1860, originating in a "lust
                    for power and kept alive by deception and fraud." The Northern rebellion, they
                    argue, began 38 years before with the organization of abolitionist societies in
                    the North and continued through the violation of fugitive slave laws and John
                    Brown's raid. The Northern rebels, they observe, control the national government
                    and are in the process of establishing an "absolute despotism."</summary>

                <summary>The editors scorn the calls of Republican papers for a united public
                    opinion, arguing that abolitionists have been the people who have caused a
                    divided sentiment to begin with. The Democratic and Republican presses of the
                    country were united before the Emancipation Proclamation, claim the editors, but
                    then the administration proved that they were not fighting a war simply for the
                    restoration of the Union. They then go on to quote an editorial from the Patriot
                    and Union recommending that Lincoln cast aside his radical advisors and replace
                    them with conservatives.</summary>

                    against Marshall Millward. The editors describe the opinion as a "noble
                    vindication of that provision which guarantees to every freeman in this
                    Commonwealth the right to be secure in his person and property against illegal

                <summary>The writer, reporting on the week's events in the state legislature, notes
                    the accusations of Republican legislators against Democrats. The Republicans
                    note that various Democratic resolutions critical of the Lincoln administration
                    do not, at the same time, condemn the Confederacy. The writer defends the
                    legislators, saying they have chosen to focus on the "ruinous policy of the
                    abolitionists" rather than wasting time condemning the Confederacy.</summary>

                    <p>A humorous, sentimental, religious, dramatic and literary entertainment was
                        given by "de colored folks" in the Wesley (African) Church, on last Thursday
                        and Friday nights. Owing to the prevalence of small-pox lately among the
                        "Sable sons and daughters," the "white folks["] were prevented from
                        attending. The performers however, entertained a large and respectable
                        audience of the kindred hue, and from all accounts the affair was one "long
                        to be remembered."</p>

                    <p>A late letter from Perry A. Rice states a few items of general interest. Our
                        men have been removed from Libby Prison to castle Lightning, a place within
                        the city but some distance from Libby Prison. Mr. Rice says nothing about
                        their having received the money sent by our council, but we infer its
                        reception from the fact of his mentioning new clothing made for them by Mr.
                        Shafer. They are well, except occasional brushes resulting from their diet
                        and way of life. They have no hope of exchange; indeed it is rumored that
                        they will be sent further south, in order to keep them with greater safety
                        and at less expense. It is painful to record such news, and our community
                        deeply sympathizes with the families and friends of these unfortunate
                            men.--<emph rend="italic">Mercersburg Journal.</emph></p>
