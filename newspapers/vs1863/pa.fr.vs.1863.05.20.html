<b>That "Simple Question" Answered</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors take up a challenge from the Transcript to explain how they can
                    oppose the administration and support the government. They first argue that the
                    creation of West Virginia from Virginia, the Confiscation bill, the suspension
                    of habeas corpus and the abridgments of freedoms of speech and the press were
                    all unconstitutional. If this is the case, they say, what does it mean to be
                    loyal--to defend the Constitution, or the administration which has violated it?<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Administration vs. The People</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors argue that, at the beginning of the war, the Northern public
                    and the army were unified behind the goal of preserving the Constitution as it
                    is and the Union as it was. However, since then both the country and the army
                    have become demoralized because the administration has politicized the war. With
                    abolition as the goal of the war, the only solution would be the extermination
                    of all the whites in the South and the annihilation of its industry. The
                    Northern public outside New England, argues the writer, has rejected the
                    administration's course, as the fall elections demonstrated.<br>

<b>Coming Home</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The 126th Reg't Penn. Volunteers has been relieved of service with the Army
                    of the Potomac in Washington, D.C. They will probably not arrive in town until
                    next week, as they will stay in Harrisburg until they are paid and mustered out.
                    However, a number have been visiting town already. The editors complain that an
                    adequate reception has not been prepared for their return.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The 126th Regiment arrived at Camp Curtin, on Thursday last, on their way
                        home, having been relieved from service in the Army of the Potomac. The time
                        of their arrival here is not positively known, but it will not probably be
                        before the last of this or the first of next week, as they will be detained
                        in Harrisburg until they are paid off and mustered out of the service. Many
                        of "the boys" have already paid us flying visits, giving their officers "the
                        slip" for a day or so; and they are all in the finest health and spirits.</p>
                    <p>It is a source of deep regret that a more general movement, on the part of
                        the citizens, has not been made for their reception. The effort to give it a
                        political complexion--which has been made by a few broken down politicians
                        in our town--we can only characterize as the very depth of partizan
                        littleness. It looks more like a movement in glorification of the "Union
                        League" than in honor of the returning braves, who come to us "fresh from
                        the fields of their glory."</p>
                    <p>But we feel confident these tricks of the little politicians will not prevent
                        the people from giving their sons, brothers and friends such a greeting as
                        they deserve. They will receive them in their own good way; and the warm
                        grasp of the hand, and the few trembling and sincere words of gratitude and
                        welcome, will tell those sons, brothers and friends far more than all the
                        noisy professions of selfish politicians. The people will be on hand by
                        thousands, without regard to politics or the politicians, and their
                        reception, although perhaps not so gaudy as that of the "Union Leagues,"
                        will have at least the merit of sincerity.</p>

<b>Broke Jail</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Two prisoners broke out of the County Jail on Tuesday night. One was the
                    "notorious" horse thief Joe Hooker, and the other was a deserter named Edwin P.
                    Byers. Under instructions from Lieut. Ashmead, Sheriff Brandt had been treating
                    the military prisoners leniently, and Byers was given the freedom of the jail.
                    On Tuesday, Byers' cell was open. He broke the lock off of Hooker's cell, and
                    the two broke through a wall and escaped. Byers was caught and brought back on
                    Friday, but Hooker remains at large.<br>(Names in announcement:  Joe Hooker,  Edwin P. Byers, Lieut.  Ashmead, Sheriff  Brandt)</blockquote>
<b>Another Military Arrest</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors note the arrest in Mercersburg of W. C. Baxter, who was
                    arrested on Thursday and taken to Chambersburg on Friday by the Provost Guard.
                    He was brought before Lieut. Ashmead, and was dismissed because there was no
                    evidence against him. The editors call for an end to such arbitrary and
                    unfounded arrests, saying they bring only ridicule upon the authorities.<br>(Names in announcement: Lieut.  Ashmead,  W. C. Baxter)</blockquote>

<b>Astounding Developments! Unmitigated Treason!</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>David Lawson of Montgomery Township was arrested for treason and "sent over
                    the lines." His arrest came out of papers found on the person of Solomon Helser.
                    When Lawson was taken to Baltimore for a hearing, it was found there was no
                    evidence against him and he was discharged. The "important note" found on Helser
                    was apparently a note in payment for a horse. Yet, "all the Pharisees" had
                    judged Lawson guilty merely because of his arrest.<br>(Names in announcement:  Solomon Helser,  David Lawson)</blockquote>
