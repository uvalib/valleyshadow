<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We give to-day a summary of the latest news from the Rappahannock, and in
                        sorrow and humiliation record the fact that our gallant army of the Potomac
                        has again been repulsed, with heavy loss. It is true some of the papers tell
                        us it is "a change of base," a "strategic movement," compelled by the
                        weather and the roads, but the painful experience of the last two years has
                        taught us that it is far better to look these stern realities in the face,
                        than to try and captivate the ears of the people with the syren [sic] songs
                        of victory and glory, when we know that defeat and disaster follow close
                        after the retiring footsteps of our national armies. The American people are
                        not babes and children that the truth should frighten them. They have met
                        every reverse of fortune in this great crisis, with a firm, conscientious,
                        christian courage, which no other nation has ever exhibited. And every new
                        disaster has but stimulated them to new zeal and firmer resolves and more
                        untiring energy. "Let us know the worst," has been the universal demand,
                        "That we may know how to meet it." These great national disasters reach us
                        all individually, and we all have the most vital personal interest in
                        repairing them. "Come, the worst, the worst," says the old Roman, in the
                        play, when his slave begins to retail the long catalogue of domestic
                        misfortunes.</p>
                    <p>Ardent admirers as we have been of the military genius of General McClellan,
                        and strangely as the history of the last six months has fulfilled some of
                        our predictions, yet we earnestly hoped for the success of General Hooker.
                        He was the Commander-in-Chief of our grand army; a victory gained by him
                        would have been a victory for the nation; his defeat is the nation's defeat;
                        his humiliation is the nation's humiliation. The men who fought and bled and
                        died under him were our friends and brothers and sons. General Hooker did
                        the best he was able do to. If he "lacked the capacity to give the requisite
                        orders," and was defeated by "the superior numbers and superior Generalship
                        of Lee," as some of the radical papers assert, and which is very probably
                        true, it was not his fault, but rather that of those who, with opportunities
                        to judge of his ability, placed him in such a responsible position, with the
                        fate of the nation hanging upon his every word and action. But warning and
                        remonstrance are of no avail, invective and abuse badly become an hour of
                        national distress; and we have therefore only our most sincere sorrow to
                        offer the President and his advisers for the terrible disasters they are
                        visiting upon the nation, and for which the people and history will hold
                        them responsible; and to express the hope that in the good Providence of God
                        they may be instrumental in bringing upon us no greater evils than we will
                        be able to survive.</p>

<b>The Reception of the 126th</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors condemn the efforts of the "loyal leaguers" to make the
                    reception of the 126th Reg't when it returns to Franklin County a "political
                    affair." Common decency, say the editors, suggests that the reception should not
                    be turned into a political squabble.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One of the meanest exhibitions of partisan feeling we have ever witnessed, is
                        the attempt of the "loyal leaguers" of this place to make the reception of
                        the 126th Regiment a political affair. Such conduct would be contemptible at
                        any time, but it is doubly so now, when this regiment, composed of men of
                        both political parties, who entered the service of their country with no
                        partisan motives, animated by the pure and holy desire to serve and save
                        their common country, have just come out of a desperate and bloody battle,
                        with a heavy loss which has carried sorrow to many a household in the
                        county. It is humiliating to see what little things politicians will resort
                        to in these degenerate times, for the sake of making a little political
                        capital. With the long list of killed, wounded and missing before us, and in
                        view of the sorrow and gloom that shroud the households of many of our
                        fellow citizens, common decency, if not humanity, dictates that, instead of
                        stirring up a political quarrel about this reception, our citizens should
                        put aside party prejudices, and unite in making provision for the relief of
                        the wounded, the burial of the dead and a proper and becoming reception to
                        the returning braves, apart from politics and the politicians.</p>

<b>Caught by the Pickets</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report Col. Alexander McClure's protest over the paper's
                    description of a speech given at a Republican gathering recently. McClure had
                    supposedly rebuked his colleagues for excessive partisanship and distanced
                    himself from the Emancipation Proclamation. McClure's protest, argue the
                    editors, is only proof that the politicians guarding the Republican camp caught
                    McClure and threatened him with "political death" if he did not tow the party
                    line.<br>(Names in announcement: Col. Alexander McClure)</blockquote>
<b>The Arrest of Vallandigham</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

                    by federal soldiers, and his subsequent court-martial. The results of the trial
                    were not known, but the editors believe the situation is yet another instance of
                    political persecution under the guise of military necessity.<br>

                        Va., May 3, 1863.</p>
                    <p>We have had some of the heaviest fighting of the war since sending my
                        despatch yesterday afternoon. Happily the Fifth corps has been blessed with
                        the good fortune of being only slight sufferers.</p>
                    <p>General Tyler's Brigade,</p>
                    <p>of General Humphrey's division, is a painful exception, however, as will be
                        seen by the account below, in the terribly sanguinary conflicts of the past
                        twenty-four hours. What may be in store for us--through what new scenes and
                        changes we must pass, and how we may come out of the series of contests so
                        fiercely began and persecuted, and with no show of speedy termination--is
                        involved in deepest darkness and doubt.</p>
                    <p>General Skirmishing.</p>
                    <p>Hardly had the messenger left with my last despatch when a general
                        skirmishing began nearly the whole length of our lines. It was kept up
                        rather desultorily, cannonading and musketry intermingling, until about five
                        o'clock when it waxed into a pretty</p>
                    <p>General Engagement.</p>
                    <p>The attack was mainly on the right, where the work was warmest. For one or
                        two hours the roar of artillery and musketry was incessant. The disastrous
                        and disgraceful giving way of General Schurz's division of General Howard's
                        corps (Sigel's old corps) completely changed the fortunes of the day. The
                        men, I am told, fled like so many sheep before a pack of wolves, and the
                        enemy rushed up, taking possession of the abandoned line along the
                        Gordonsville plank road and compelled the construction of a new line.</p>
                    <p>Shelling of the Chancellor Mansion.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the falling back of Schurz's men, the enemy were in position to
                        bring their pieces to bear on the Chancellor mansion, which they shelled and
                        burned and that notwithstanding it was filled with our wounded and had a
                        hospital flag flying in front. Our wounded, who could not be removed, met
                        death from the shells or the flames. Some of their own wounded, who were
                        being properly cared for there, met the same terrible fate. The scene
                        here--the fleeing of the female inmates and abandonment of the place by
                        General Hooker as his headquarters will be graphically described by your
                        headquarters correspondent, who remained and witnessed the entire scene,
                        which I did not.</p>
                    <p>The Results of this Afternoon's Battle</p>
                    <p>cannot be fully told for some time. Many of our killed and wounded (I refer
                        to those of other corps) had to be left on the field, and many a brave one,
                        through neglect of his wounds, must have died since.</p>
                    <p>A Midnight Attack.</p>
                    <p>About eleven o'clock last night, as the moon was obscured by a passing cloud,
                        the enemy renewed his attack of the afternoon. The attack was most
                        desperate. Our men stood firm and fought like tigers, and refused to yield
                        an inch of ground. The enemy thought to follow up the advantage gained in
                        the afternoon; but through change in the position of our line and our brave
                        resistance their attempts to advance were as frequently repulsed. When the
                        enemy made the attack they came with terrific yells followed by
                        instantaneous volleys of musketry and incessant artillery. Our men were not
                        taken as much by surprise as was expected. They rose with responsive yells,
                        and responsive musketry and artillery added to the roar of the enemy's fire.
                        The fight lasted two hours. It was part of Malvern Hill over
                        again--moonlight and mournful massacre of men. The Fifth corps lost but very
                        few, the force of the attack being directed on other parts of the line.</p>
                    <p>Fighting this Morning.</p>
                    <p>The enemy made a third attack this morning at six o'clock. It was in this
                        attack, that General Tyler's brigade, of General Humphrey's division, met
                        with their severe loss. Besides the One Hundred and Thirty-third and One
                        Hundred and Fifty fifth Pennsylvania regiments, Colonel Alabach's brigade
                        and the Sixth United States infantry, of General Sykes' division, these were
                        the only troops of the Fifth corps sustaining loss. The men fought
                        splendidly. No troops ever fought better. A determination to hold his
                        position caused Gen. Tyler to sustain the loss he did. His men made four
                        separate charges upon the enemy and drove them back each time. Our men had
                        the best of the fight in the end.</p>
                    <p>Still Another Attack.</p>
                    <p>About half-past five P. M. another attack was made upon our troops. A change
                        in our tactics meantime had been made, which the enemy were not long in
                        finding out to their sorrow. The attack was in the centre, where the
                        Chancellorsville mansion stood. They massed in the field beyond the house.
                        Our men lay in trenches, which they had dug in the interim, and not seeing
                        any men the enemy advanced right in front of several of our batteries
                        concealed in the woods. At the word our batteries opened on the [sic] them.
                        Col. Gurney, of the Ninth Massachusetts, who was looking at the enemy at the
                        time through a field glass, says the effect of our firing was terrible. It
                        was like touching off powder in a basin filled with flies. He saw one
                        officer on a white horse blown high into the air. In a moment the dead lay
                        in heaps. Our batteries had an enfilading fire on them. The enemy, those who
                        escaped, flew wildly before our murderous rain of shot and shell. Even Gen.
                        Griffin's division, which occupied the trenches fronting this attack, in
                        support of the batteries, met with very little loss. I give below a list of
                        our killed and wounded in the above attack, as far as I have been able to
                        procure the names. In the present state of activity and confusion, and
                        occupying the trenches as the corps does at this time, it is impossible to
                        get the full and accurate details. As stated above, our loss thus far has
                        been only slight.</p>
                    <p>General Tyler's Loss.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the loss sustained by General Syke's division day before
                        yesterday, Lieutenant Colonel Lock, of General Meade's staff, informs me
                        that General Tyler reports that he went into the fight before he met with
                        such severe loss with 1,800 men, and had only 600 men left at the end of the
                        action. Notwithstanding this report, the general impression is that more
                        than half the missing men will make their reappearance.</p>
                    <p>A Review of the Two Day's Operation.</p>
                    <p>Day before yesterday, about eleven o'clock, the Fifth corps advanced from
                        Chancellorsville down the old turnpike towards Fredericksburg. Six miles
                        from the city the enemy had intrenched himself, and showed an inclination to
                        dispute our further progress. The artillery opened in a few moments and a
                        severe fight was maintained for some time. General Sykes' division of
                        regulars being hotly engaged. Our advance was gradually driven back to
                        Chancellorsville, where Hampton's Pennsylvania battery of ten pounder
                        Parrott guns was planted, supported by the Seventh Ohio and Twenty-eight
                        Pennsylvania regiments. Skirmishing was kept up throughout the afternoon,
                        but the attack began simultaneously on the right and on the left below
                        Fredericksburg.</p>
                    <p>The rebels advanced against our front, cheering and fighting like demons, but
                        were repulsed. After a lull of considerable time, during which their troops
                        could be seen moving has[t]ily around further to the right, an attack was
                        made by the enemy on the plank road. Geary's division fought handsomely, and
                        after a fierce struggle drove them back. Towards night a demonstration was
                        made on our right flank from the direction of Gordonsville. The cannonading
                        was very heavy, and the roar of musketry deafening. The Eleventh corps fell
                        into disorder, and came back upon the main body of the troops badly broken
                        up, but the Twelfth corps moved rapidly out and checked the enemy's
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>Our Position on Saturday Night.</p>
                    <p>At night our front extended along the plank, and, with our right resting near
                        Wilderness and our left at Chancellorville. During the night there was some
                        cannonading and a few volleys of musketry, but nothing of importance was
                        accomplished by either side.</p>
                    <p>The Struggle on Sunday.</p>
                    <p>This morning the battle commenced in earnest. The enemy pushed up against our
                        lines steadily and with a persistance [sic] almost incredible; but our
                        batteries, supported by the Third corps, mowed them down by hundreds, and
                        finally compelled them to retire. Their batteries, however, soon opened
                        again. The large brick mansion at Chancellorsville, used as headquarters by
                        General Hooker, was shelled and set on fire. Previous to leaving the
                        building, Gen. Ho[o]ker was knocked down by a post supporting the porch,
                        which a shell had torn out, and for a short time the command devolved upon
                        General Couch. General Hooker's bruises were not serious.</p>
                    <p>Our Lines Falling Back.</p>
                    <p>Our lines gradually fell back towards the river about a mile, where another
                        stand was made behind intrenchments, which position we now hold. About
                        eleven o'clock to-day the firing ceased, and was not resumed again until
                        late this afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Capture of Guns And Colors.</p>
                    <p>A number of guns and several stands of colors have been captured from the
                        enemy together with nearly two thousand
                        prisoners. Several of our pieces have been lost. One battery was
                        taken by the enemy, but recaptured by our own men.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to form any idea of our loss. The troops are in excellent
                        spirits, and can scarcely be restrained. We have not suffered heavily,
                        however, and will doubtless be able to ascertain the entire loss tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Berry was killed, shot through the shoulder and chest, it is believed by
                        a rebel sharpshooter. Gen. Devins and Gen. Mott were wounded. Gen. Hancock
                        had a horse shot under him.</p>
                    <p>Fighting is now-six P.M.--going on quite briskly. It is reported that our
                        infantry hold Gordonsville, and that our forces have occupied Hanover Court
                        House.</p>
                    <p>The intelligence that the Sixth corps had crossed at Fredericksburg created
                        among the troops the wildest enthusiasm. It is believed that the enemy is
                        rapidly retreating; but since the engagement this morning very little has
                        been ascertained concerning his movements. From prisoners we have taken it
                        is learned that the enemy has had his entire force engaged to-day, with the
                        exception of Early's division, which was left at Fredericksburg.</p>
                    <p>The Stampede of the Eleventh.</p>
                    <p>Under cover of the darkness of Friday night the enemy commenced moving large
                        masses of troops around the front of our lines to get a position on our
                        right, with a view of flanking us there. Subsequent developments have proven
                        that the entire grand division of D.H. Hill made this movement around the
                        front of our lines during that night. At midnight the scouts and advanced
                        pickets from both the Third and Twelfth corps observed the movement and
                        communicated it to their respective commanders; but at that time it was
                        impracticable to do anything to prevent it.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sickles ordered Birney to advance and take possession of the hill on the
                        south side of the ravine running out back from the farm, and opposite to the
                        heights over which the road occupied by the rebels ran.</p>
                    <p>The Eleventh corps had been ordered to advance on the right of Birney, and
                        moved forward to take the position assigned to them on Birney's flank. One
                        brigade succeeded in getting up the hill, and reported, by its commander,
                        (whose name I have unfortunately lost), to Generals Sickles and Birney. The
                        rest of the corps met the enemy in force when about two-thirds of the
                        distance up. Here they had a short engagement, in which it does not appear
                        that they had even so large a force to contend against as that which
                        Williams, with his single division, had fought so bravely. Headed by their
                        commander, the gallant Howard, the German corps charged boldly up to the
                        rebel lines. Here they were met, as the rebels always meet their foes, with
                        shouts of defiance and derision, a determined front and a heavy fire of
                        musketry. The German regiments returned the fire for a short time with
                        spirit, manifesting a disposition to fight valiantly. But at the time when
                        all encouragement to the men was needed that could be given, then some
                        officers of the division (one at least, as I am informed) fell back to the
                        rear, leaving his men to fight alone. At the same time General Devens,
                        commanding the F[i]rst Division, was unhorsed and badly wounded in his foot
                        by a musket ball. Thus, losing at a critical moment the inspiring influence
                        of the immediate presence of their commanders, the men began to falter, then
                        to fall back, and finally broke in a complete rout. General Howard boldly
                        threw himself into the breach and attempted to rally the shattered columns;
                        but his efforts were perfectly futile. The men were panic stricken, and no
                        power on earth could rally them in the face of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>I must frankly confess that I have no ability to do justice to the scene that
                        followed. It was my lot to be in the centre of that field when the panic
                        burst upon us. May I never be a witness to another such a scene. On one hand
                        was a solid column of infantry retreating at double quick from the face of
                        the enemy, who were already crowding their rear, on the other was a dense
                        mass of beings who had lost their reasoning faculties, and were flying from
                        a thousand fancied dangers as well as from the real danger that crowded so
                        close upon them, aggravating the fearfulness of their situation by the very
                        precipitancy with which they were seeking to escape from it. On the hill
                        were ten thousand of the enemy, pouring their murderous volleys in upon us,
                        yelling and hooting, to increase the alarm and confusion;; hundreds of
                        cavalry horses, left riderless at the first discharge from the rebels, were
                        dashing frantically about in all directions; a score of batteries of
                        artillery were thrown into disorder, some properly manned, seeking to gain
                        positions for effective duty, and others flying from the field; battery
                        wagons, ambulances, horses, men, cannon, caissons, all jumbled and tumbled
                        together in an apparently inextricable mass, and that murderous fire still
                        pouring into them. To add to the terror of the occasion there was but one
                        other means of escape from the field, and that through a little narrow neck
                        or ravine washed out by Scott's creek. Towards this the confused mass
                        plunged headlong. For a moment it seemed as if no power could avert the
                        frightful calamity that threatened the entire army. That neck passed, and
                        this panic stricken[,] disordered body of men and animals, permitted to pass
                        down through the other corps of our army, our destruction was sure.</p>
                    <p>But in the midst of that wildest alarm there was a cool head. That threatened
                        calamity was averted by the determinated self-possession of Major General
                        Daniel E. Sickles. Spurring his horse forward he forced his way through the
                        tangled mass and entered this narrow neck. Across this neck there funs a
                        strong brick wall behind which the forces of General Williams and Berry had
                        already thrown themselves preparatory to meeting the enemy. On one flank of
                        the wall was the deeply sunken bed of the creek, impassible for any species
                        of vehicle, and scarcely safe for men. At the upper end of the wall was a
                        narrow gateway, the only opening to be found. To this point General Sickles
                        picked his way, and there, drawing his sword, blocked the passage with
                        himself and horse. On came the panic stricken crowd, terrified artillery
                        riders spurring and lashing their horses to the utmost; riderless horses
                        dashing along regardless of all obstacles; ambulances upsetting and being
                        dashed to pieces against trees and stumps; men flying and crying with
                        alarm--a perfect torrent of passion, apparently uncontrollable. But against
                        it all the brave General threw himself, and by his determined bravery
                        brought the first heavy mass--a cannon drawn by six horses, well mounted--to
                        a halt, and blockaded the passage. Others dashed up behind and crowded on
                        the first, their drivers cursing and swearing and calling to the foremost to
                        go on. The loose horses jumped the stone wall, and the flying men scrambled
                        over it, utterly oblivious to the fact that the opposite side was crowded
                        with men whose lives were thus doubly endangered. But by the blockade of the
                        main passage the stampede of artillery and cavalry had been principally
                        checked. Once halted, reason began to return to those who had previously
                        lost it, and much of the artillery, properly manned, was quickly brought
                        back upon the field.</p>
                    <p>Pleasanton Checks the Rebels.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, Pleasanton, in obedience to orders received from General
                        Sickles, had mustered two or three of the batteries and was busily employed
                        pouring grape and canister into the woods that were filled with the rebels.
                        Every moment his effective force of pieces was increased by cannoniers
                        recovering from their fright and returning to duty, so that by the time the
                        stampede was finally checked he had at least twenty-five pieces bearing
                        directly upon the enemy in all directions about the field, and at so close a
                        range that every discharge took effect, not upon one or two but upon dozens.
                        The slaughter here must have been beyond count. We have reason to believe
                        that nearly the whole, if not the entire body of Hill's force was in the
                        attack upon that little field, which must have filled the woods. Such an
                        incessant fire from so many pieces, and into so dense a mass, could not have
                        produced any ordinary limit of slaughter. But it being now quite dark, and
                        as we never regained entire possession of the woods, where the enemy were
                        the thickest, we have no means of knowing how great the slaughter was. It
                        was sufficient to know that the enemy was held in check, and Sickles'
                        gallant corps had an oppurtunity [sic] to rally from the disastrous effects
                        of the shameful stampede of the Eleventh corps.</p>
                    <p>End of the Panic.</p>
                    <p>Let me here finish with the Eleventh corps. They did not all fly across
                        Sickles' line. They dispersed and ran in all directions, regardless of the
                        order of their going. They all seemed possessed with an instinctive idea of
                        the shortest and most direct line from the point whence they started to the
                        United States ford, and the majority of them did not stop until they had
                        reached the ford. Many of them, on reaching the river, dashed in and swam to
                        the north side, and are supposed to be running yet.</p>
                    <p>Monday's Operations. <br>Repulse of the Sixth Corps.</p>
                    <p>New York, May 6.--The Herald has received the
                        following account of the fight of Gen. Sedgwick's corps with the enemy:</p>
                    <p>It appears that after the great slaughter of Sunday, Gen. Lee detached a
                        large body of the rebels to meet Sedgwick, and it is known that Longstreet
                        was also rapidly getting in Sedgwick's rear. At the same time, early on
                        Monday morning, large masses of rebels appeared on the heights east of
                        Frenericksburg [sic], where we had but a small force, having sent a large
                        portion to stren[g]then Sedgwick.</p>
                    <p>The position was relinquished after a short resistance, having first removed
                        all the guns.</p>
                    <p>Some fighting occurred above Fredericksburg, which is believed to have been
                        an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Longstreet from moving up.</p>
                    <p>The rebels interposed no objection to our holding Fredericksburg, which we
                        will retain.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sedgwick was holtly [sic] engaged all Monday, the rebels pressing him at
                        all points.</p>
                    <p>His men were obliged to give way before the overwhelming masses of the
                        rebels, and his discomfiture seemed certain, when a Vermont brigade made a
                        ferocious charge, repulsing them and securing the safety of that portion of
                        the army.</p>
                    <p>The slaughter of the enemy near Bank's Ford was perfectly horrible; whole
                        brigades of rebels being literally wiped out.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Sedgwick, however recrossed the river in the face of the enemy, after
                        midnight, the enemy raking our bridges with artillery, causing great loss of
                        life.</p>
                    <p>He succeeded in getting across in comparatively good order, and marched
                        immediately to United States Ford, to join Hooker's main army.</p>
                    <p>Chancellorsville, May 4--4 P.M.</p>
                    <p>General Whipple Wounded.</p>
                    <p>Evreything [sic] remains quiet along the front today, with the exception of
                        occassional [sic] shots from the sharpshooters. Gen. Whipple, while
                        examining the lines of defence this morning, was shot by a rebel rifleman,
                        and it is feared mortally wounded. One of our sharpshooters, who saw the
                        rebel fire, shot him before he had time to reload.</p>
                    <p>The Hospitals Shelled.</p>
                    <p>About sunrise this morning the enemy planted a battery near the United States
                        Ford, and shelled the hospitals and baggage trains. Considerable confusion
                        was created; but the battery was spe[e]dily silenced and quiet restored.
                        Some of the rebel prisoners were killed. One shell passed through four
                        hospital tents, and a few moments after another carried away the head of a
                        wounded man who was reading a letter just received from home.</p>
                    <p>The Supply Trains.</p>
                    <p>None of the trains are allowed to cross the river, all supplies being sent up
                        on pack mules. The enemy's line extends from the vicinity of Bank's Ford
                        around by Chancellorsville to Ealy's Ford. A renewal of the engagement is
                        momentarilly [sic] expected. Our position is strongly intrenched [sic], and
                        can be held against a vastly superior force.</p>
                    <p>Our Loss</p>
                    <p>Is yet undetermined. An unusual number of officers have fallen; but the
                        hospital arrangements are good, and everything that could be done to
                        alleviate their suffering has been performed.</p>
                    <p>General Patrick Prevents Straggling.</p>
                    <p>Very little staggling [sic] has occur[r]ed. Gen. Patrick with his staff
                        labored indefatigably in preventing the falling out and strolling to the
                        rear, and admirable order prevails throug[h]out the entire army.</p>
                    <p>Where The Attack is Expected.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that the enemy will attack us on the right. The troops are in
                        the entrenchments eager for a renewal of the engag[e]ment, and confident of
                        success.</p>
                    <p>The Supposed Rebel Losses.</p>
                    <p>From captured officers we learn that the enemy's loss has been terrible. In
                        Jackson's corps the casualities [sic] are unprecedented. Jackson is wounded
                        in the hand, D.H. Hill severely and removed from the field; Roach and Ransom
                        are killed, and Nicholls wounded.</p>
                    <p>The Rebels Fire The Woods.</p>
                    <p>Many killed have fallen into the hands of the enemy, and are still lying on
                        the field. It is feared that some of our wounded were burned to death, as,
                        after our troops fell back on Sunday, the enemy fired the woods.</p>
                    <p>Desperation of the Rebels.</p>
                    <p>It may seem strange to Northern readers and those away from the scene of
                        contest to read of the repeated attacks made by the enemy, who, it would
                        naturally be supposed, would put themselves almost wholly on the defensive.
                        The fact is they never fought with such desperation before; they feel that
                        they are being hemmed in, their all is at stake, and it is victory or death
                        with them.</p>
                    <p>The Fifth Army Corps.</p>
                    <p>At ten A.M. I returned to Gen. Meade's headquarters, and found this corps
                        occupying the same position as when I left, which position it is still
                        occupying. The change in the programme of fighting, bringing artillery more
                        into active play and leaving the infantry less exposed, is generally
                        approved and believed to be the most judicious, safest and wisest course
                        that could be adopted to ensure victory over the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Tuesday's Operations.</p>
                    <p>Chancellorsville, May 5, 1863.</p>
                    <p>All Quiet This Morning.</p>
                    <p>Last evening Gen. Sedgwick had a severe fight with Jackson's corps. Our
                        forces were hard pressed but after a gallant charge by the Vermont brigade
                        the firing ceased and the rebels retreated.</p>
                    <p>Two hundred and fifty prisoners were taken, including three colonels, two
                        majors and a large number of line officers.</p>
                    <p>A Skirmish.</p>
                    <p>About five o'clock yesterday evening the First division of the Fifth corps
                        moved out of the intrenchments and advanced down towards the Wilderness
                        road. The enemy opened immediately upon them; but our batteries quickly
                        replied, and after a sharp fight for a few moments the rebels retired.</p>
                    <p>During the night there was considerable cannonading, but without effect. This
                        morning Gen. Sedgwick's corps recrossed the river and is now near Bank's
                        Ford.</p>
                    <p>All quiet.</p>
                    <p>Return of Hooker's Army to their Camps at Falmouth.</p>
                    <p>United States Ford, May 6--8 A.M.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday morning the trains were all ordered back to camp, and by dark the
                        wagons, extra caissons, pack mules, &amp;c, were at Falmouth. The
                        wounded were hastily removed from the hospitals and sent to Washington,
                        leaving nothing on the other side except our infantry and artillery.</p>
                    <p>About five o'clock it commenced raining. The water fell in torrents for over
                        an hour, deluging the roads, tearing up the corduroys, sweeping away bridges
                        and threatening the destruction of the pontoons. The river rose with great
                        rapidity and soon overflowed the ends of the pontoons, rendering crossing
                        impracticable. The upper pontoon was taken up and need in lengthening out
                        the others, and after several hours of very hard labor the bridges were once
                        more ready.</p>
                    <p>Pine boughs were spread upon the pontoons to prevent the noise of crossing,
                        and about midnight the troops commenced falling back. The First corps was
                        the first to cross, and is now nearly all over. The Third corps remains in
                        the entrenchments to cover the retreat. It is hoped that the army will reach
                        this side before the enemy discovers the retreat; but cannonading has
                        commenced quite fiercely at the front, and a desperate battle is not an
                        improbable event.</p>
                    <p>We can doubtless retire across the river without serious loss; but if
                        discovered in our attempt the struggle will be fierce. Unmolested the troops
                        can get over by noon.</p>
                    <p>The roads are in a horrible condition--almost as bad as when General Burnside
                        foundered here last winter. Our sick are lying in the woods, but ambulances
                        are coming up to remove them.</p>
                    <p>There was no fighting yesterday of any consequence. The sharpshooters were
                        quite active, and the artillery opened occasionally; but results were
                        unimportant. The enemy has evidently massed his army on our right, with a
                        view, it is believed, of crossing above and attacking us on the flank and
                        rear. The high water, however, will frustrate that movement.</p>
                    <p>Three pontoon trains are down near Hamilton's crossing, and some fears have
                        been entertained that the rebels would make a demonstration across the river
                        below Fredericksburg.</p>
                    <p>A great number of our wounded have fallen into the hands of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Our dead on the battle field of Sunday are still unburied, and the wounded
                        are undoubtedly dying in great numbers for want of attention. Dr. Johnson,
                        Medical Inspector of the army, has volunteered to go over with a corps of
                        surgeons and take charge of our wounded. He will probably be sent across as
                        soon as practicable.</p>
                    <p>General Hooker is very much depressed. Last night he held a colsultation
                        [sic] with his commanding generals, in which it was urged that a longer stay
                        in its present position would prove unsafe for the army. A hasty return to
                        our camps is imperative.</p>
                    <p>The rain is falling heavily and the river rising with great rapidity.</p>
                    <p>The Latest Intelligence.</p>
                    <p>The latest intelligence is that Gen. Hooker has succeeded in recrossing the
                        Rappahannock by way of the United States and Bank's Fords. He has brought
                        away his artillery; but the rear guard have sustained a sharp fight in
                        getting over. All who have witnessed this finale
                        of his "onward to Richmond" movement concur in the belief that a most
                        egregious blunder was made by somebody. It is now evident that instead of
                        thirty-five, sixty or seventy thousand men, Lee had under his command from
                        one hundred and twenty thousand to one hundred and forty thousand and that
                        the whole rebel army of the East was concentrated upon the Rappahannock
                        before even the cavalry advance had crossed the river. The quiet manner of
                        the rebels in permitting the army of Gen. Hooker to advance to
                        Chancellorsville with nothing more than a skirmish is now known to be a part
                        of the programme of Gen. Lee to entrap Gen. Hooker and capture his whole
                        army. Gen. Hooker's retreat to this side of the river is absolutely a
                        victory in view of the circumstances. If Foster in North Carolina, Peck at
                        Suffolk, Keyes at Williamsburg, and Hunter at Charleston, had kept up the
                        advance movements of the Army of the Potomac across the Rappahannock, Hooker
                        would undoubtedly have succeeded. But there has been a lamentable failure of
                        co-operation. Whatever denunciations may now be heaped upon the head of an
                        unsuccessful general, who was thought by many to be unequal to the command
                        assigned to him, yet all the disasters that have occurred are mainly
                        attributible [sic] to the incompetency of those who had the direction of
                        military affairs in other departments as well as that in which this abortive
                        effort was made. Either the General in-chief or the Secretary of War should
                        have seen that it was necessary to prevent the concentration of all the
                        rebel forces in the East upon one point before directing an effort to be
                        made to carry that position. The Army of the Potomac has fought well. It has
                        sustained its old reputation. It has been led once more to the slaughter,
                        and has been sacrificed to the imbecillity [sic] of the military Secretary
                        of the administration.</p>
                    <p>The Failure of The Campaign.</p>
                    <p>Hooker's campaign is a failure, just when it was supposed to be on the very
                        eve of a brilliant success. It is understood that he was outgeneralled by
                        Lee and his army outnumbered by the rebels. Still a retreat was not looked
                        for; but Hooker himself seems to have lost confidence in success,
                        particularly as Sedgwick's corps had not joined him, and thus was induced to
                        give the order to retreat. The army retired over the United States Ford and
                        Bank's Ford. The backward movement commenced at ten o'clock last (Tuesday)
                        night, and before daylight this (Wednesday) morning the artillery and mule
                        trains have all crossed, and the infantry was still crossing, Couch's corps
                        in the advance. The enemy were not able to harass our army in its retreat
                        very materially. Their sharpshooters tried to pick off the artillery horses
                        and mounted officers, and whenever they could bring guns to bear upon us
                        they did so; but our artillery usually dislo[d]ged them before they could
                        inflict much damage. The army is now supposed to be on its way back to its
                        old camping ground. There is no apprehension that the enemy will cross the
                        river in pursuit, except, perhaps, some of its cavalry.</p>
                    <p>Our Losses.</p>
                    <p>Our entire loss in killed, wounded and missing, does not exceed ten thousand.
                        The enemy's loss must have been double of this, honorably to the army,
                        inimitably for the country, the greatest proportion of them in killed and
                        wounded.</p>
                    <p>Our loss of prisoners does not exceed seventeen hundred. We have received
                        twenty-four hundred and fifty prisoners of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>We lost eight guns and took the same number of pieces from the enemy.</p>
                    <p>General Lee's Official Despatch.</p>
                    <p>Milford, May 3, 1863.</p>
                    <p>To President Davis:</p>
                    <p>Yesterday Gen. Jackson penetrated to the rear of the enemy, and drove him
                        from all his positions from the Wilderness to within one mile of
                        Chancellorsville.</p>
                    <p>He was engaged at the same time in front by two of Longstreet's divisions.</p>
                    <p>Many prisoners were taken, and the enemy's loss in killed and wounded is
                        large.</p>
                    <p>This morning the battle was renewed.</p>
                    <p>He was dislo[d]ged from all his positions around Chancellorsville and driven
                        back towards the Rappahannock, over which he is now retreating.</p>
                    <p>We have again to thank Almighty God for a great victory.</p>
                    <p>I regret to state that Gen. Paxton was killed, Gen. Jeckson [sic] severely
                        and Gens. Heth and A.P. Hill slightly wounded.</p>
                    <p>Robert E. Lee, <br>General Commanding.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The last week was one of terrible anxiety and suspense in this
                        community--such as we have only known on one or two occasions before, and
                        such as we pray God we may not know soon again. Early in the week it was
                        rumored that a great battle had either taken place, or was impending; on the
                        banks of the Rappahannock and the Rapidan. But it was not until Wednesday
                        that we heard any definite or reliable news. And then we learned for the
                        first time, that our brave boys had participated in the bloody conflict and
                        that many of them were among the killed and wounded. The news, such as it
                        was, but added to the excitement, anxiety and suspense--names were so
                        wretchedly misspelled as to be scarcely recognizable--and numbers of
                        regiments and companies were confused and unintelligible. And then, too, but
                        few names were given, while newspapers informed us that Tyler's Brigade had
                        numbered eighteen hundred when it went into the fight, and only six hundred
                        when it came out--a loss of two thirds of its entire number. Who were the
                        loved ones who had fallen "with their backs to the earth and their feet to
                        the foe," but whose sad fate had not yet been made known? Oh, the dreadful
                        suspense was more terrible than the worst reality could be! And it was no
                        wonder anxious and careworn faces could be met with every place there was a
                        probability of getting news. It is no wonder that around many of our once
                        happy firesides, there were sighs and tears and unutterable anguish, during
                        those long evenings of painful uncertainty. War is no child's play. It is a
                        horrible, bloody reality. It has hung many a sad home, in our midst, in the
                        sable curtains of mourning, already; and there may be many more sorrows in
                        store for us. But let us bear these sorrows as heroically as our brave loved
                        ones marched up to the cannon's mouth and met death and wounds there.</p>
                    <p>However great may be our loss, of one fact the newspaper accounts assure us:
                        our 126th Regiment acted nobly, held their position for hours against
                        fearful odds, made several desperate charges, and finally withdrew in good
                        order, when the extreme right flank of the right wing--the eleventh army
                        corps--gave away in a disgraceful route, and made their former position
                        utterly untenable. "The men fought splendidly," says a reporter of the New York Herald, speaking of Tyler's Brigade; "no
                        troops ever fought better. A determination to hold his position caused
                        General Tyler to sustain the loss he did. His men made four separate charges
                        upon the enemy and drove them back each time. Our men had the best of the
                        fight in the end."</p>
                    <p>The killed and wounded of the 126th Regiment, as far a we have learned their
                        names, are as follows:</p>

<b>The "Ladies' Aid Society"</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report that the Ladies' Aid Society of Chambersburg has become
                    an auxiliary of the Philadelphia agency of the U.S. Sanitary Commission. The
                    editors commend this move and praise the Sanitary Commission generally, saying
                    that while it has been attacked by many parties, and while it has been blamed
                    for the "rascality" of dishonest doctors and hospital stewards, it has
                    nonetheless proved itself as the only "sure systematic mode yet devised for the
                    relief of the sick and wounded." Now that the North is in the aftermath of
                    another great battle, the editors urge citizens to support the efforts of the
                    Ladies' Aid even more generously.<br>

<b>New Buildings</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Those of our people who are not in the habit [of] walking around town much,
                        can have no idea of the large number of new buildings which have been
                        erected during the past year, and of those which are now in process of
                        erection. Most of these are neat, plain, substantial edifices, giving
                        evidence of taste and prosperity. Some too are fine, large, costly mansions,
                        indicating wealth, refinement and generous hospitality. The truth is,
                        Chambersburg is going ahead in the path of sure, substantial progress, which
                        speaks well for her future. It is far beyond the Chambersburg of ten years
                        ago. And yet there is still a demand for dwelling houses here, and a hundred
                        comfortable buildings would soon find occupants and pay good rents. Let our
                        Capitalists "keep the ball rolling."</p>
