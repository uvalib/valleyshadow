            instead of March and April, because many of the "inst" dates were late in the month--the
            editors prepared this section before April 1 and probably just wrote it as if it was

                <summary>The editors quote from Blackstone, Marshall, Story, and Curtis on the

                    arguments is that it is only the legislature that can decide whether or not the
                    situation warrants the suspension of habeas corpus, and thus the transferral of
                    that power to the President is unconstitutional and dangerous.</summary>

                    <p>It is so common for newspaper editors, every few months, to predict the
                        winding up of the rebellion within a few weeks, that the public have begun
                        to place very little reliance on such prophecies; and yet, despite this
                        popular impression, we will make bold to say we think we see some bright
                        spots on the political horizon--some indications which point, if not to the
                        speedy suppression of the rebellion, at least to a curtailment of its
                        extent, its influence, and its prestige with foreign powers--and others,
                        too, which show that the old Government, although in many respects
                        mismanaged and its vast energies shamefully misdirected, still commands
                        confidence at home and respect and sympathy abroad, and strikes terror, as
                        with a deadly blow, into the hearts of its enemies. Let us see what these
                        indications are.</p>
                    <p>Gold is now selling in Richmond at four dollars premium; that is, Confederate
                        Scrip has so far depreciated as to require five dollars of it to purchase
                        one dollar in gold. What is the cause of this depreciation? The Richmond
                        papers attribute it to the demand for coin by the blockade runners, for the
                        purposes of trade. But this demand must be comparatively small and unable to
                        produce such a general and extensive depreciation. The true explanation must
                        be found in the fact that the people of the South are beginning to distrust
                        their own cause, and, in the desire to save something out of the general
                        wreck, are investing in European securities, or hoarding gold in the hope of
                        "better days a-coming." The tone of their own papers seems to confirm this
                        view. This is one of the most cheering signs of the times. If gold were
                        selling at four hundred per cent premium here, we should all agree that we
                        were "going to the dogs," as fast as our legs could carry us. But look at
                        the contrast: Gold is only thirty-seven or forty per cent premium here; our
                        securities have a ready and available market, while the English capitalists
                        come forward and propose to lend us a hundred millions in gold, at par, or
                        at the regular rates of exchange. Why this equally sudden appreciation of
                        Northern securities? It finds an easy explanation in the recent uprising of
                        the conservative element over the whole country, and its declaration that
                        the war must be brought back to its legitimate purpose, and must be
                        prosecuted with vigor, for it "has never agreed, does not now agree, and has
                        no intention of agreeing in future to a dissolution of the Union." From this
                        stand point we can not fail to see, in the financial condition and prospects
                        of the two sections, a ray of hope for the future.</p>
                    <p>The rebels seem to be impressed with the idea that this will be a year of
                        defeat to their arms, and that they will be compelled to give up many of
                        their strongholds. Their tone sounds not near so defiant as it did last
                        year. The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Examiner</emph> says: "Active
                        operations of the chief Federal army, that under Hooker, are now commenced,
                        and either a decisive battle or the retreat of the army commanded by Lee
                        must be the speedy consequence." And again:</p>
                    <p>"If the Confederate General's force is not sufficiently numerous to prevent
                        the completion of the manoeuvre, it is supposed that no course remains but
                        to fall back on some point near Richmond and give the enemy battle at a
                        greater distance from his base. This is the worst that is even possible, and
                        it would be no disaster even if it should occur. Some disaster, some defeat,
                        in the enormously extended campaign now opening, will, of course, fall to
                        our lot."</p>
                    <p>There seems, too, to be stronger hope than ever of being able to starve the
                        rebels out. Scarcely a rebel newspaper finds its way North that does not
                        complain of the great scarcity of food. The Governors of all the States have
                        recommended the planting of wheat and corn instead of to bacon and cotton,
                        and the Governor of Georgia has called an extra session of the Legislature,
                        in view of "the necessity of further legislation, at an early day, to secure
                        the use of all our productive labor in the cultivation of all our lands in
                        grain and other articles necessary to sustain life. This scarcity of
                        provisions is sorely felt in their army. The Richmond <emph rend="italic"
                            >Enquirer</emph> says:</p>
                    <p>"From every quarter where our armies are massed--from Vicksburg, Tallahoma,
                        Charleston and Fredericksburg--we have the most gratifying accounts of the
                        conditions of our troops and their certain ability to cope with any force
                        that the enemy may hurl against them. The only point upon which there is
                        room for apprehension is that our forces may be forced by want of food for
                        men and horses to relinquish the strongholds from which the enemy could
                        never dislodge them, and that this is a grave and pressing danger we have
                        many reasons for believing.</p>
                    <p>It is a fact as well known to the enemy as to ourselves that all the country
                        in the vicinity of our armies has long been stripped of its provisions and
                        forage, and that these armies depend for their existence and maintenance of
                        their positions upon the railroads."</p>
                    <p>And, unfortunately for them, their railroads are all giving out, with little
                        or no prospect of their being reconstructed. The <emph rend="italic"
                            >Enquirer</emph> further says:</p>
                    <p>"The railroads of this State are on the point of giving out. They have
                        decreased their speed to ten miles an hour as a maximum rate, and are
                        carrying twenty-five to fifty per cent less tonnage than formerly. This
                        change in their rate of speed and quantity of freight has been made through
                        necessity. The woodwork of the roads has rotted, and the machinery has worn
                        out, and owing to the stringent enforcement of the conscription law as to
                        railroad employees, the companies have not been able, with all their
                        efforts, to supply either the one or the other. We are not informed of the
                        actual condition of the railroads in the more Southern States, but conceive
                        that they are little better off than our own. The Government should not be
                        content even to keep the railroads in the condition in which the war found
                        them; it should endeavor, and the effort would be successful, to improve
                        upon that condition. The better the roads, the better supplied would our
                        armies be, and consequently the more certain is the resistance to the
                        extraordinary efforts for our subjugation which the enemy proposes to make
                        during the coming campaign."</p>
                    <p>It seems as if these facts were making a deep impression upon the rebel
                        leaders. Late private advices from Richmond bring reliable information that
                        they are preparing to abandon their capital to its fate--at least they are
                        removing their public workshops, manufactories and machinery to some point
                        further into the interior. At last they are beginning to feel the coils of
                        the anaconda tighten around them. In the Gulf, at Charleston, at Savannah,
                        in North Carolina along the Blackwater, the Rappahannock and the Shenandoah,
                        at Vicksburg, Port Hudson, and Murfreesboro, and along the line in Kentucky,
                        our forces are prepared for a general advance. Soon we will "hear the
                        thunder all around the sky." It is possible and perhaps probable that in the
                        varied fortunes of war we may meet with some repulses, but victory must
                        perch upon the banners of some of our armies; and the Confederate
                        government, as it is at present situated, with a bankrupt treasury, with a
                        starving population, with scarcely any means of rapid transportation, and
                        with no hope left of foreign armed intervention, can not withstand a defeat.
                        Let us take courage, then. With a vigorous, concerted campaign, the
                        mismanagement of the last two years may yet be retrieved. We may yet snatch
                        victory from the jaws of defeat. The armed power of the rebellion may be
                        broken, and the conservative sentiment of the country, discarding alike the
                        radicalism of the Secessionists and the Abolitionists, may yet save the
                        country.</p>

                <summary>The editors note several indicators of the increasing weakness of the
                    Confederacy and the increasing strength of the Union. Confederate currency is
                    rapidly decreasing against gold, which they see as a vote of no confidence by
                    the Southern people in their own government. At the same time, greenbacks are
                    stable against gold and northern securities have a ready market abroad, which
                    the editors interpret as a sign of confidence that derives from recent
                    Democratic electoral advances. Confederate newspapers complain of food
                    shortages, and their are rumors that the Confederates plan soon to evacuate
                    Richmond. The conservative element might yet save the country, they conclude.</summary>

                        election held here on the 20th inst.</p>
                    <p>Many persons are at a loss to account for this result, while many more seem
                        to understand it perfectly. The truth is, the people have lost all
                        confidence in the party now in power; they want a change, a change from the
                        most insignificant township officer to the President of the United States,
                        and <emph rend="italic">especially</emph> so, in the <emph rend="italic"
                            >latter</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The people have become disgusted with the loud boastings of the abolitionists
                        of love for the Union, while, at the same time, they manifest an utter
                        disregard for all the rights and liberties of the people, guaranteed to them
                        by the Constitution, the very bond of our Union.</p>
                    <p>Then, again, the people still entertain the belief that the white man is
                        better than a nigger, and that if Father Abraham, under the pretext of
                        prosecuting the war for the restoration of the Union, is willing to
                        sacrifice the lives of white men to liberate slaves, he would as well not
                        look to Washington Township to furnish him soldiers, but depend alone upon
                        Greeley's nine hundred thousand to see him through. It is all folly for Mr.
                        Lincoln, under any pretext, whatever, to attempt to convert the great
                        Democratic party into an Abolition party. The thing can't be done and the
                        sooner Mr. Lincoln learns this fact, the better for all parties concerned.</p>
