                <summary>The writer accuses radical Republicans of hoping, at least rhetorically, to
                    exterminate the people of the Confederate states and to repopulate the region
                    with colonists from the North, quoting Congressman Lovejoy to that effect. Such
                    people, says the writer, give up all hope of reclaiming the people of the South
                    through negotiation, even after their military defeat. And, pointing to examples
                    throughout history, but particularly that of the English and the Irish, the
                    writer concludes that extermination has never been successful.</summary>

                <summary>Attacks radicals for engineering a series of political maneuvers, including
                    the emancipation proclamation, the removal of General McClellan, and the
                    appointment of General Hooker to replace General Burnside, which they claim have
                    united the South in opposition, demoralized the Northern army, and cast doubt
                    among loyal conservatives in the North. And now that the radicals have prolonged
                    the war, they appear to be willing to accept a peace that leaves the country
                    divided. This land was not intended by the Creator to be divided, concludes the
                    writer, and the people will take it into their own hands to make sure that does

                        Fredericksburg, Va. <lb/>January 25th, 1863.</p>
                    <p>The Grand Army of the Potomac has been again in motion, but unfortunately
                        without realizing any benefits for our cause, or adding any new achievements
                        to its own history. It started full of hope and promise of success, and
                        returned to our old camping grounds covered with mud. Briefly as I can, I
                        will relate our last weeks experiences. At various times during the ten days
                        prior to last Tuesday, orders for a movement were issued, but being almost
                        immediately followed by postponements, it was believed that they were
                        intended only for some deceptive purpose. The order issued on Monday to move
                        at 1 o'clock, P. M., Tuesday, bore evidence of earnestness and we
                        immediately commenced a compliance with its instructions relative to
                        rations, &amp; c. At 10 o'clock Tuesday morning, our whole Brigade was
                        in line. Col. Gregory of the 91st P. V. being in command, owing to the
                        severe illness of Brig. Gen. Tyler. Gen. Burnside's Address was then read to
                        each Regiment, informing us of the purpose of the movement and urging the
                        firm and united action of officers and men in accomplishing one more step
                        towards restoring peace to the country. This concluded, we moved off. The
                        weather was decidedly unfavorable. The air was raw and close, and the dull
                        black clouds betokened rain. We were to reach a certain point that evening
                        and cross the river on Pontoons early next morning. However, we were brought
                        to a halt and ordered to bivouack [sic] for the night before we had
                        accomplished two miles. All night long the wind howled and the rain poured,
                        and our condition when the morning broke, can better be imagined than
                        described. We were in mud nearly up to our necks and very considerably in
                        the fix of a certain fisherman. At 8 o'clock the bugle sounded "forward,"
                        and we waded in. That day, (Wednesday) we succeeded in getting four miles in
                        about eight hours and encamped in a woods. It was an exhausting and
                        laborious march. Rain fell all day and the mud as we progressed seemed to be
                        attaining an almost unfathomable depth. The ambulance and ammunition trains
                        were the only ones that had left the old camps. The ambulances got along
                        comparatively well, but all along the road hundreds of am[m]unition wagons
                        were tight in the mud, and all efforts to extricate them seemed impossible.
                        The artillery suffered in this respect likewise. A gun that four horses
                        could haul with comparative ease on a good road required the united strength
                        of sixteen mules to move it a short distance at a time. Mule and horse flesh
                        you may know were tortured no little and the drivers seemed to give up their
                        work in dispair [sic]. Such swearing and cursing, pulling and tugging, was
                        never heard or witnessed before. There were many ludicrous scenes, but in
                        the main we could not help pitying the distress and suffering of the poor
                        animals and their impatient and irritated drivers.</p>
                    <p>Literally stuck in the mud, and unable to move forward, it became evident
                        that the plans of our commanders for crossing the river and attacking the
                        enemy must be abandoned. It was found impossible for our supply trains to
                        come to us and arrangements were made for a return to our old camps. On
                        Thursday the whole force was taken out to corduroy the roads. This they did
                        with pine boughs and rails. It was a very unpleasant and laborious job, but
                        as Col. Gregory remarked, our getting fresh rations depended on its complete
                        execution Friday morning by order of Gen. Hooker the command received the
                        first whisky rations yet issued to them. It was done by the advice of the
                        Surgeons, and to those gentlemen was entrusted the business of distributing
                        it. Two ounces were allowed each man. Some, in mistake perhaps, got more,
                        but still managed to keep their "pins" and their propriety.</p>
                    <p>Saturday morning early we started for our old camp and owing to the improved
                        condition of the roads moved along with less exertion and somewhat faster
                        than on our outward trip. We came into camp about 2 o'clock and as I write
                        the boys are in their old quarters as contented and merry as ever. I am told
                        that the Rebel pickets for miles along the river have put up large boards
                        with charcoal representations of "Burnside and his army stuck in the
                        mud,"--a good joke for them but a very costly one to our Government, as it
                        will require thousands of dollars to replace the horses, mules, wagons,
                        &amp;c., lost by the movement.</p>
                    <p>Had we moved when the first order was issued, I believe that we would have
                        dislodged the rebels from Fredericksburg and by this time been several miles
                        nearer Richmond. The weather was pleasant then, and the roads in as good
                        condition as we could hope for at this time in the season. But it was our
                        misfortune to march at an inauspicious time when there was every appearance
                        of a long spell of bad weather, and when the roads per consequence would be
                        impassable. You may read of Virginia roads and their shocking condition in a
                        season of wet, stormy weather; but there is no pen adequate to the task of
                        doing the subject justice. You must "wade in" as we are obliged sometimes to
                        do if you desire to realize a complete knowledge of the matter.</p>
                    <p>We are anxious, all of us, to bring this war to a speedy and honorable
                        termination. Not one of us but would deplore its prolongation beyond the
                        period when we shall be mustered out of service in May next. The
                        battle-field has no charms, mud roads no attractions, nor camp life a
                        superabundance of comforts, I assure you. But we all appreciate any
                        judicious efforts of the Administration or of our Commanders to again
                        restore peace to the country, and are willing to contribute our mite by
                        enduring the labor, fatigue and suffering which must necessarily attend our
                        movements, looking to that much desired and important end.</p>
                    <p>It is quite likely that in a day or two we shall remove to a new location.
                        Our present camp has become a very filthy, and good water and wood very
                        scarce.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Tyler has been absent from us for several weeks. Soon after the battle
                        of Fredericksburg he had a severe attack of his old malady, an affection of
                        the spine, and suffered the most excruciating pains. His physicians made it
                        a matter of urgent necessity that he should leave camp for medical treatment
                        and proper nursing to avoid serious results. The General yielded reluctantly
                        and hoped a ten days leave of absence would restore him. Improving, however,
                        very slowly, his time has been extended and he still remains in Washington.
                        Gen. Tyler has the sincere respect of his command and has fairly earned it
                        by his untiring attention to their military interests and physical comforts,
                        and while his departure caused unfeigned regret, his presence again among us
                        will be hailed with gladness and joy.</p>

                    arbitrary and unjustified, claims the writer, and was made solely because
                    Bolleau was a Democrat. The violation of his rights endangers the rights of
                    everybody else, the writer claims, and the Federal government must be compelled
                    to release Bolleau. Either the Governor or the Legislature must intervene in the

                    <p>The revival of religion in the United Brethren Church is still progressing
                        with unabated interest--resulting in quite a number of conversions and
                        accessions to the Church. A series of religious meetings has also been held
                        in the English Evangelical Lutheran Church, during the past week, at which
                        considerable interest was manifested. Whether the meetings will be continued
                        or not we are unable to say at this time. A number of conversions are also
                        reported at the revival lately held by the Bethel Church, on West Queen
                        Street.</p>
