                    <p>Correspondence of the Richmond Dispatch.</p>
                    <p>Staunton, June 13, 1867.</p>
                    <p>The particular sensation this week of this active, busy, sensational little
                        city of the mountains has been produced by the closing exercises of the
                        session of the "Augusta Female Institute," a school under the direction of
                        Miss Mary J. Baldwin. This school is the largest institution of the kind in
                        the State, and is now at the full tide of its usefulness and prosperity. The
                        number of young ladies in attendance during the late session was ninety-six,
                        drawn from nearly all the southern States. The spacious Presbyterian church
                        of the town was filled last night to overflowing, to witness the
                        distribution of diplomas to the graduates and to the proficient in the
                        different branches.</p>
                    <p>After this ceremony, Rev. T. V. Moore, D. D., of your city, delivered an
                        address to the pupils. High as was his reputation in this community, as a
                        chaste and vigorous writer and thinker and most eloquent speaker, the large
                        audience were hardly prepared for the beauty and brilliancy and eloquence of
                        his address upon the occasion.</p>
                    <p>His theme--the character of the true woman, and her duties and
                        responsibilities, especially in the South in this day of the country's
                        trial, was handled in a most masterly and impressive manner. Not one, of
                        that throng of beautiful young maidens, will ever forget the lessons of
                        wisdom conveyed by the reverend gentleman in such charming style.</p>
                    <p>The audience before whom the address was delivered was certainly as
                        appreciative as any which can be assembled in this State, and the universal
                        opinion was that no production of a similar character had been heard by them
                        of a higher order of merit. It is hoped that the distinguished gentleman
                        will yield to the earnest wishes of those who heard him, and permit the
                        address to be published. It was just suited to the times, and would be
                        productive of great good.</p>
                    <p>I feel that I would do a real service to your many readers to direct their
                        attention this most admirable school. Here, I assure you the great work of
                        education is thoroughly done. The principal, Miss Baldwin, is a most
                        remarkable lady--such an one is rarely met with more than once in any State
                        during one generation. Possessing in an eminent degree the high traits of
                        character marking her distinguished relatives of the Valley of Virginia, she
                        is devoting all her energies and powerful faculties to the cause of female
                        education in such manner as that the prediction is confidently made, that
                        her school will at no distant day, take rank with the most famous schools of
                        the country. This may seem extravagant, but mark the prediction, and you
                        will certainly see it verified.</p>
                    <p>Your correspondent is somewhat a stranger here, but he has been much
                        impressed with the "go-a-head-a-tiveness" of the Scotch-Irish people of this
                        Valley. They are exhibiting an energy and a vim in recovering from the
                        effects of the war which is wonderful. When they went into the revolution
                        they went in with a rush. Mad all the time, they fought sullenly and
                        desperately, but when it was over, they threw down their arms and snatched
                        up their axes and their farming implements, and went to work to repair the
                        damage which had been done, as energetically as they had pitched into their
                        late enemies. They are an earnest people, and what they do they do with all
                        their might.</p>
                    <p>On the 24th of this month there is to be a grand outpouring of the people of
                        this county, to take steps to help your Richmond people of build the
                        Covington and Ohio railroad, which all here see is the only thing which can
                        save your beautiful city from certain death. Those people will back you in
                        this enterprise to the utmost of their ability, and all here are speaking in
                        the highest terms of praise of the sagacity and ability displayed by the
                            Dispatch upon this and similar subjects. Long
                        may you live in building up the fortunes of the State.</p>

<b>The Onward Course</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial reassures readers that much of the political excitement and
                    proposed radical policy will have little lasting effect. Only the abolition of
                    slavery marks a serious change, and even that brought some good in the form of
                    the possibility for material prosperity and industrial growth. Eventually the
                    North will leave southerners to work out their own laws and govern their own
                    race relations.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The current of human affairs flows onward, says the Richmond Dispatch,
                        whatever be the disturbances and temporary impediments in its course. Men
                        get alarmed occasionally, and fear that it is to be turned away from its
                        channel, and that it will uproot and destroy everything in its way. But in a
                        little while their fears are quieted because their apprehensions are not
                        realized, and they find that if things are not as they wish them to be, they
                        are certainly not as they might be.</p>
                    <p>Most events of these days are of the character of temporary disturbances,
                        which will have little effect on the future of this country. The one great
                        event of the abolition of slavery will be enduring in its consequences; but
                        all the partisan movements and the excitements of the day will in a short
                        time cease to have any influence and be forgotten. Abolition will have no
                        permanent bad effect upon Virginia and the adjoining States, and may not
                        have such an effect upon the Gulf States. Indeed, it will prove beneficial
                        to Virginia, and help to increase her material resources, and increase her
                        population and political power. But all the class of movements and
                        disturbances growing out of party ambition and greed for office and
                        emolument--all the tricks for the gratification of these, which are now
                        alienating the two races in the South and producing anxiety in the public
                        mind, will after a time be frustrated and brought to an end, leaving us not
                        much the worst for the achievements. The current will continue to flow on
                        and present so smooth a surface as to bear no sign that it had ever been
                        disturbed.</p>
                    <p>We must have peace. A party sustained by hostility and hatred cannot exist in
                        peace. The public mind under a condition of peace cannot be agitated to the
                        height of passion and malignity. The office-hunters and place-holders cannot
                        work up the public feeling to that point when all is quiet and order under a
                        restored equality among the States. Everybody does not want office, and
                        cannot get it. So a whole community is not going to lash itself into a rage
                        because one man wants an office. The furious office-hunters trading upon
                        sectional animosity, will find their capital gone, and their manufactured
                        stories about southern disorders, cruelties, and brutalities, of no avail
                        when the South is able to deny and disprove them--when indeed, she will have
                        power that will command respect; and it will be neither politic nor safe to
                        undertake to malign her.</p>
                    <p>Thus the war for office and power by warring on communities will break down,
                        and white and black in the South will be left, as they ought now to be, to
                        manage their own affairs without the intervention of outsiders. They will
                        divide without distinction, and express their preferences without respect to
                        the prejudices and passions engendered now under the delusive pupilage of
                        selfish and unscrupulous imported partisans.</p>
                    <p>In this way we shall pass through a period of annoyance and trouble and reach
                        smooth water in a short time. All that is necessary is calmness and
                        fortitude. A straightforward, dignified policy, while trusting in the
                        justice of an overruling Providence, will insure a triumph. Virginia has the
                        men and the material advantages to insure also a prosperity and growth in
                        physical power that will place her among the first of States in that, as she
                        has been in moral grandeur. This is a certainty; yet there is that in her
                        latitude, atmosphere, and topography, which protects her from that other
                        certainty anticipated by the Charlottesville Chronicle--viz., the being overrun by northern sentiment and
                        morality. The spirit and genius of the people will be Virginian as long as
                        she remains a State. There is every reason against despondency. No man
                        should think that the world was created at his birth, and will end at his
                        death. Our brief experiences are nothing. The river of events will flow on,
                        and all traces of the things we deem so momentous in our day will be washed
                        away.</p>

                    <p>Manassas, June 15, 1867.</p>
                    <p>The Ladies' Memorial Association of Manassas, appeal to you to aid them in
                        collecting and suitably interring the remains of the gallant men who fell
                        fighting, gloriously, for you and yours, on this ever memorable field. The
                        victories gained have sent a thrill of joy through every Southern heart and
                        home, but, still, the bones of those who gave their lives to gain them, lie
                        uncared for and unnoticed. Our immediate section of country was so
                        devastated by the war, that we are not able, unaided, to perform the work
                        before us. A site has been donated for the Manassas Cemetery, and here we
                        propose to gather together the remains of all who fell in this region. We
                        ask every one who lost a friend here, not only to render us all the aid
                        possible, but to communicate with the President of the Association, and give
                        all the information they can, about where their friends are buried, their
                        Brigades, Regiments, Companies &amp;c. We do not deem it necessary to
                        make a stirring or eloquent appeal to the friends of the brave boys whose
                        bones now whiten the "Plains of Manassas." The fact that thousands, from
                        every State and County in the South, fell here, should be enough to make
                        every one give his mite in aid of so noble a work, on so proud a field.<br>
                        For the Association,<br> Mrs. Sallie E. Fewell.,<br> President.</p>

<b>The Important Question</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Did it ever strike the negroes that the important question to them was "can
                        we live here, when skilled white labor comes in to compete with us?" It is
                        the all important, for just so sure as day follows night, the tide of white
                        immigration will follow the track made by the armies of free labor, in the
                        South. They will compete with the negro at every turn, and it will require
                        more energy and intellect than he now possesses to live with this
                        competition, harassing and pushing him to the wall. The colored people had,
                        and may still have, one chance to live here, and they should have clung to
                        it as a parasite to the oak--viz, the prejudices
                        and habits of working of the Southern people. But it seems they have
                        determined to throw this chance away and go, as a body, with the enemies of
                        their only friends. While we regret this determination on their part, we can
                        only point them the dangers ahead and bid the white people be of good cheer,
                        for this "important question" is certain to be settled in our favor, by
                        immigration, in a very short time. It is for the negro to say whether he
                        will share our great future or go to the wall. We must submit to the
                        inevitable.</p>

<b>Letter From General Longstreet</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints a letter from General James Longstreet to a New Orleans
                    paper. In it, Longstreet pledges to work for whichever policies are best for the
                    reunited country. He urges southerners to give up their defeated convictions and
                    follow the laws of the land. He characterizes Reconstruction and the military
                    bill as "peace offerings." He advocates accepting black suffrage on a
                    probationary basis and keeping it if it works, and stopping it if it does not.<br>

<b>The Reason Why</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This item from the Rockingham Register asserts that the reason Senator
                    Wilson and other Radicals are supporting Virginia's Botts-Hunicutt faction is to
                    ensure that the state's electoral votes go for the Republican candidate in the
                    election of 1868. "The people of the South have now a taste of radical rule. Are
                    they willing to continue it? If so, let them refuse to register. That is the
                    shortest and most effective way to accomplish it. Every refusal to register is a
                    vote for the radical for next Presidency, and an endorsement of the military
                    tyranny now prevailing in the South."<br>

                    <p>In Virginia, if the white men of the State are true to themselves, their

                        necessarily doom us to political helotry. Our safety and the security of
                        unborn generations can be secured only through the narrow defile of general
                        registration. Promptly, with energy, and with a ceaseless vigilance which
                        will send every white man to the polls, we must "accept the situation" in
                        Virginia. Prosperity, security to life and property, the continual dominancy
                        of the Caucasian race, all depend upon our doing quickly and thoroughly the
                        work before us. We must kick from our path the bones of old parties, old

                        can from the wreck and debris of what the civil war has left us.--Southern Opinion.</p>

<b>An Item Which Every Man Should Read</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article reminds gentlemen of the negative effect idle words and gossip
                    may have on a woman's reputation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have probably all of us met with instances, in which a word heedlessly
                        spoken against the reputation of a female has been magnified by malicious
                        minds until the cloud has been dark enough to overshadow her whole
                        existence. To those who are accustomed, not necessarily from bad motives,
                        but from thoughtlessness--to speak lightly of ladies, we recommend these
                        hints, as worthy of consideration. Never use a lady's name in an improper
                        place, at an improper time, or in mixed company. Never make assertions about
                        her that you think untrue, or allusions that you feel she herself would
                        blush to hear. When you meet with men who do not scruple to use a woman's
                        name in a reckless and unprincipled manner, shun them, for they are the
                        worst members of a community--men lost to every sense of honor, every
                        feeling of humanity. Many a good woman's character has been forever ruined
                        and heart broken by a lie manufactured by some villain, and repeated where
                        it should not have been and in the presence of those whose little judgement
                        could not deter them from circulating and bragging of the report. A slander
                        is soon propagated, and the smallest thing derogatory to a woman's character
                        will fly on the wings of the wind, and magnify as it circulates, until its
                        monstrous weight crushes the poor unconscious victim. Respect the name of
                        woman, for your mother and sisters are woman, and as you would have their
                        fair fame untarnished, and their lives unembittered by the slanderer's
                        biting tongue, heed the ill your own words may bring upon the mother, the
                        sister, or the wife of some fellow creature.</p>
