<b>Thos. J. Michie, Esq.</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Rockingham Register urges Thomas J. Michie of Augusta County to run for
                    Governor of Virginia. "While free from every personal vice, he possesses an
                    intellect of rare native powers, which has been cultivated and strengthened by a
                    course of study and an enlarged experience, surpassed by no other man in
                    Virginia. Decided in his convictions, conservative in his views of public
                    affairs, and comprehensive in learning, it would seem that he is really the man,
                    in these troubled times, who should be called to the helm of the State."<br>(Names in announcement:  Thomas J. Michie)</blockquote>

<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

                    and especially denounces those of Stevens and Orr.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Two plans are proposed for "selling out the South." We publish both. One is
                        by the Hon. Gov. Orr, of South Carolina, and the other by Mr. Thad. Stevens.
                        We see that Thaddeus has been defeated in his, and, if there is any manhood
                        left in the South, Mr. Orr's plan will be repudiated.</p>
                    <p>The people of Virginia, and the entire South, have their future in their own
                        hands, and, as far as we are concerned, we prefer Thad Stevens's bill to Mr.
                        Orr's. Mr. Stevens wishes to degrade us by force, by a power we can't resist
                        at present. Mr. Orr and his policy party, propose that we degrade ourselves.</p>
                    <p>The true policy is to reject both and work. These
                        schemes for a so-called "reconstruction," may suit timid people, on both
                        sides of the line, but the men, who "know their
                        rights" and maintained them during the war, will reject them. Let us work and elect men to every office.</p>
                    <p>If it was necessary, in speaking of the Situation, we would ask the people of
                        the Valley and the South, not to be excited over the rumors and big talk
                        that reaches them from Washington and the North. Gov. Orr and Mr. Stevens
                        may compromise, but "let the better spirits wait" and work, and our hopes
                        will be realized.</p>
                    <p>In the Va. House of Delegates, last Friday the Committee on Finance reported
                        against the propriety of submitting the question, of the abolition or
                        modification of the usury law to the people. The people ought to invite the
                        whole party to clear out and give place to men of good sense and business
                        qualifications.</p>
                    <p>A special Washington dispatch says, "a majority of the reconstruction
                        Committee have agreed upon a plan to settle all difficulties, and "the
                        leading Southern men in Washington have agreed to it." The question is who
                        are "the leading men"--Did they ever lead a charge?</p>
