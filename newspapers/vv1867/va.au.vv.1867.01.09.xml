                <summary>The paper devotes its entire front page to an obituary for Judge Joseph G.
                    Baldwin, of San Francisco, CA. Baldwin died in San Francisco on September 30,
                    1864, of lock jaw contracted after minor surgery. Baldwin grew up in Staunton,
                    and the obituary recounts his biography. It also attests to the grief shared by
                    his legal colleagues in Virginia and California.</summary>

                <summary>Staunton's Western Lunatic Asylum issued a report on its operations.
                    According to the report, half of all patients received since opening have been
                    discharged cured. The Asylum housed 307 patients at the beginning of the year;
                    177 males and 130 females. Sickness has been low, and no suicides have occurred.
                    The Board supported an annual visit of representatives from the legislature to
                    the asylum, and arrangements were made with West Virginia for payment for
                    patients from that state. The following employees were singled out for praise:
                    Dr. Stribling, director; Drs. Hamilton and Berkley; Mr. Samuel Hoshour, the
                    steward; Mrs. Tinsley, the matron; and Mr. Samuel Johnson, Superintendent of the
                    Grounds.</summary>

                <summary>The Valley Virginian endorses John B. Baldwin, Speaker of the House of
                    Delegates, for Governor of Virginia. The paper admits differing with him on some
                    political questions, but the State now needs to elect a unifier. "What we want
                    now is a man of the first order of ability, and thoroughly devoted to and
                    identified with the best interests of the State, and in full sympathy with the
                    people of his oppressed section." Voting now is more important than ever, "when
                    difficulties and dangers environ us, when the steadiest nerve shrinks from the
                    contemplation of the uncertain future." The paper also endorses Col. W. L. Owen
                    of Halifax for Lieut. Governor; and J. Randolph Tucker for Attorney General.</summary>

                    <p>Millboro Depot,<lb/> Dec. 25, 1866.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Valley Virginian:</emph>--In my letter on "Workingmen in
                        Society" I gave but a few introductory ideas, and before I enter on this
                        deeply interesting subject allow me to thank you for your approval of my
                        poor effort. I am pleased because I feel from your remarks that the question
                        of "Labors rights and its requirements" will not be allowed to rest by you
                        and others who have at heart our prosperity.</p>
                    <p>To make prosperous the country we must protect labor. To elevate labor to the
                        highest pitch of utility and power, the workingmen must be educated.
                        Halfways or halfmeans will not do. A new era is on us. The great revolution
                        is not yet over, but come what may in the future, how shall we the people be
                        prepared? In the distance we see our country happy--happier and more
                        glorious than ever.</p>
                    <p>How are we to approach this dear consummation? Is it by rude toil, or by
                        willing heart and cultivated intellect? Every thing susceptible of
                        improvement ought to be improved, and 'tis equal whatever the condition of
                        the individual is, prepared for the grand race of progress, if he does not
                        win a position, let him blame himself.</p>
                    <p>"Educate that you may be free" is an old axiom in political ethics and shall
                        we forget that "knowledge is power."</p>
                    <p>To learn Greek and Latin &amp;c., is by no means education, these I hold
                        to be mere accessions--literary accomplishments if you will. The language
                        that clothed the divine ideas of a Milton and Shakspear; that gave
                        imperishable glory to Lyrics of Burns and Moore, and tinged with hues of
                        splendor the burning thoughts of a Henry and a Grattan and flung around the
                        martyr grave of [unclear] met the undying glory of true patriotism, that
                        language will suffice for us poor "workingmen in Society." To train the
                        minds of a people to a proper adaptation to useful purposes, to teach them
                        that in the homestead a knowledge is required, the most essential perhaps of
                        all, for as the family was the first form of government it ought to be the
                        most correct, otherwise society has no true foundation and there is no
                        stability for liberty or natural prosperity. In a republican form of
                        government each individual should consider that on him alone descends the
                        strength and perpetuity of political constitutions, for though the
                        individual is forgotten in the aggregate, the aggregate can have no
                        existence without the individual.</p>
                    <p>If you want the whole people of the South to apply their great energies to
                        her regeneration and future glory, apply yourself to the base of the
                        structure and ascend by degrees.</p>
                    <p>The flash of the sabre attracts the eye of beauty, the ring of industry wins
                        liberty; liberty! she never smiled on carnage, but always sat by the board
                        of contentment, where love sweetened toil, and culled from fields made rich
                        by its sweet flowers for the pillow of man's dreams.</p>
                    <p>You, who have taken so to your heart the good of all the people and the
                        prosperity of the whole country--you will not be satisfied with ideas alone
                        in this moment for our elevation. Go practically to work, there is much to
                        be done and believe me there is very little time to be lost. Looking over
                        the papers from different places I see how industriously people apply
                        themselves to work for the amelioration of the condition of the poor, their
                        intentions are good and may God reward them. In the cities and large towns,
                        they have Lyceums, Literary, Mechanics' and other institutes. Those
                        societies have done much good in their way. In our small towns and villages
                        such establishments do not exist, or if they did, they would only exist for
                        a class. A new enterprise to be successful heretofore, should come into
                        existence under happy auspices, having one or two or more millionaires at
                        the baptismal font, and how many of them have failed. To cure the evils of
                        society--to make powerful a country, consult the heart of a toiler, and if
                        there is no responsive throb to your own desires, chasten down its roughness
                        by brotherly love and strengthen and fire it with the tender touch of gentle
                        association and practical education. You are not afraid to write your
                        sentiments, and I am mistaken if you will be afraid to act, start then at
                        once an organization for the improvement of the "workingmen in society." In
                        Staunton you will have many to assist you in the good work, for I am sure
                        those who fought in the mad fray and struggled up the steel-girt-slopes of
                        many an ensanguined field by the side of the workingman, will not now turn
                        away from any enterprise having for its object his moral, social and
                        intellectual improvement. Commence then at once, collect a few young men,
                        rent a room, let the liberal among you donate them books &amp;c., and
                        you and other gentlemen of the press in Staunton can supply them with a
                        great deal of useful reading in your exchanges. What will be cut out, they
                        will see in your papers, the remainder will be valuable. Let each man
                        subscribe twenty-five cents per month, divide your city into ward clubs and
                        have a central committee who will look to the appointment of
                        teachers--graduates of course. Establish in each ward club a debating night
                        for each week and a Lecture once a month, the subject on all occasions to
                        suit the object of the organization, and above and before all things, firmly
                        resolve that no foolish political or religious questions shall be mooted.
                        Learning the value of Unity we will know how to preserve it.</p>
                    <p>The young and old men of your town once seeing the value and utility of such
                        an organization they can take council with each other for the common good
                        and never again be made the poor cats paws of enterprising adventurers. They
                        will see the truth of the motto--'in Union there is strength.' And never was
                        that knowledge more needed. There are in our midst chartered corporations
                        who think they have a right to do as they please, and on this assumption
                        act.</p>
                    <p>An organized working community, fostered and protected, by true patriots,
                        acting on my plan would know how, and be able to govern them, or at least
                        meet them as equals for each others accommodation. The Virginia Central
                        Railroad has initiated locomotion on the [unclear] track. The board of
                        directors met, and behold the result! Fountaine with over three thousand
                        dollars per annum is condescendingly satisfied to sacrifice for the general
                        good fourteen per cent of his salary; and the poor white man who was earning
                        only one dollar per day--his wages now are ninety cents. Oh heavens! and
                        these are the men who would raise up Virginia--pshaw! Have they been
                        studying political philosophy in the school of General Howard of the
                        freedman's bureau, and brought us back for our improvement, with all the
                        audacity, but less of the modesty of Thad Stephens their new fangled
                        notions. If ever a more barefaced, villainous interference with the
                        workingmen's rights took place, I know not when or where, but as the company
                        insists on the continuance of its aristocratic existence, I respectfully
                        submit to the consideration of the Bureau this economical subject. The
                        protigees, soon to be enfranchised can on the road be accommodated with a
                        little anticipatory liberty, thirteen dollars per month and rations
                        amounting to only four dollars and seventy-five cents for the same time. It
                        would be well to make known to honest men North and South how the world wags
                        in the progressive brains of the directors of the Va. C. R. R.</p>
                    <p>But to my subject, the suggestions I have thrown out are roughly written, for
                        I too have to labor, and time is not my own. How I would like to be near you
                        on the first night of trial. Be not disheartened; try and you will succeed
                        and in the course of a few years, a man may ask the question. Where here is
                        the ignorant toiler? and you can, like one at the sepulchre of old exclaim
                        in answer, "he is not here--he's risen."</p>
                    <p>The star of our hope is not set, you see it above as the magians did of old.
                        Let us open our souls to receive its effulgent beams, that these grand,
                        useful and progressive ideas which God implanted there, may leap to action
                        at their touch. The past year was one never to be forgotten, the present is
                        dying out--so shall we all die. We are on the threshold of the new year. Let
                        us leave behind our prejudices and errors, and enter on a mission of labor
                        that will be sanctified by love and enlightened by wisdom. The spring shall
                        call forth the buds of our hopes and when the flowers blossom, we will call
                        them for the brows of the trusting living and the graves of the dear and
                        glorious dead.</p>
                    <p>Their graves we will not desert--their principles we cannot forget, and while
                        there is life.<lb/> "We will tread their path<lb/> With a spirit that
                        hath<lb/> Assurance of triumph yet."<lb/> Your's &amp;c.<lb/>
