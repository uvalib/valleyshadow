                    <p>It is an idle wish, a forlorn hope, truly says the Charlottesville Chronicle
                        that all the old pleasant and profitable relations between the North and
                        South can be restored in a few months or a few years. Equally vain is the
                        expectation that mere legislation can accomplish this result. Just as there
                        are "griefs which lie too deep for tears," so there are evils and sorrows
                        immedicable by laws. The struggle has been too long and too deadly--there
                        have been too many outrages committed on one side, and too many bitter
                        taunts and revilings uttered on the other, to allow the maxim of "Forget and
                        Forgive" to have full play as yet. Until some more potent corrective is
                        applied there is but little prospect of fraternization between two sections,
                        one of which believes that it can suffer no further loss, and the other that
                        it can attain no higher glory. The South does not see that the North can in
                        any way contribute to its happiness, and the North has forgotten in its
                        exultation that the South is so necessary to its prosperity. The South is
                        slow to believe that it has returned to "the best government the world ever
                        saw," when it is denied representation in its councils, and only knows of
                        its existence from the tax collector and the military supervisor. The North
                        is afraid to admit to power a people who have but lately shown such anxiety
                        to sever all the bonds which bound them together. The South still listens to
                        the bitter repinings of her old politicians--the North follows too readily
                        the crude propositions of her new ones. In avoiding Disintegration she has
                        become enamored of Consolidation--the equilibrium has not been regained and
                        the whole "machine" is still subject to alarming oscillations. The South is
                        so utterly exhausted that it cannot find the means of resuscitation--the
                        North is so bloated with unwholesome wealth that it scorns to assist its
                        prostrate sister. The war has ceased in the Field, but alas! we fear it
                        still rages in the Heart!</p>
                    <p>The best plan is, as when friends sometimes get too warm on politics, to
                        "talk about something else." Let us endeavor to reunite the broken fragments
                        of trade--let us invite the Northerner to take up his abode amongst us--let
                        us watch his habits of thrift and industry and "cleave to that which is
                        good"--let us always be mindful that Pride and Poverty make the worst
                        company in the world--let us teach our former adversaries that neither our
                        dignity nor refinement nor energy depend upon the possession of scores of
                        slaves--let us teach those who were once slaves that while we can be kind
                        and just, that we mean to be free ourselves also--let us light the torch of
                        Hope at the lamp of Experience and the future will no longer be darkening
                        before us. In this way the mighty interests of the country can once more be
                        blended and beautified--and North and South, divided for a time, like our
                        great Mississippi, by some thwarting island, will mingle their currents,
                        again recover their mighty music, and flow in majesty and power forever.</p>

                <summary>The Valley Virginian seconds the contention of the Charlottesville
                    Chronicle that the reunion of North and South will be neither easy nor swift.
                    The memories of war are too fresh, and the political situation too bitter. Only
                    with time and an agreement to reopen trade and commerce rather than dwell on
                    politics will reunion be achieved.</summary>

                    <p>The Georgetown Daily Union of the 24th inst., says in regard to the
                        Registration of votes: The registration of persons claiming the right to
                        vote proceeded quietly today. The number of negroes about the door exceeded
                        that of yesterday, but the number registered has not been quite so large,
                        owing to the examination being prolonged by a large number of negroes coming
                        from the Freedmen's Village in Virginia and Washington. There is not the
                        least doubt that fully one half of the negroes registered here are not
                        residents of the town, but it is impossible for the Board to decide in the
                        matter, as the only evidence they have is the applicant's word. From the
                        answers given by the colored applicant it can readily be seen that they have
                        been regularly trained and about the same instructions given to all, for
                        instance, when a negro is asked his age he almost invariably answers he was
                        twenty-one or twenty-two years old, as the case may be last March; and, out
                        of twenty five we counted, according to this statement, all were born on a
                        day between the first of February and the fourth of March. Not one out of
                        that number said he was born after the fourth of March. From present
                        indications it will take more than three days to register all the
                    voters.</p>

                    <p>Among other enterprises springing up in our County it may not be out of time
                        or place to mention the "Virginia Porcelean and Earthen Ware Works,"
                        situated on South River, 7 miles South of Waynesboro'. These works were
                        commenced in Confederate times, and with Confederate money, but little
                        progress could be made in their erection and efficiency, in consequence of
                        the Company's inability to procure machinery and articles necessary for
                        their construction, and the manufacture of ware. Since the close of the war,
                        all available means and measures have been employed to erect and place the
                        works in proper condition. Its superior advantages class it among the first
                        establishments of the kind in America, no pains or cost having been spared
                        in procuring and putting up the best and latest improved machinery and
                        fixtures. Its clay, raised immediately on the ground, is of the finest and
                        purest quality; making the finest white and granite ware, and the supply is
                        inexhaustible. We understand that this Company, under the Superintendence of
                        J. S. Lipscomb, an old soldier, will be prepared and will do a large amount
                        of work in the Spring. We have seen specimens of the ware made at these
                        works, and they can not be surpassed. A large amount of money has been
                        expended in establishing these works, and it is to such enterprises that we
                        must look for our material independence, with which, necessarily, comes
                        political power.</p>

                    <p>A remark of Coleridge, says the Richmond Whig, that the land-owning class is
                        always the stationary class in politics, is most true. This country may be
                        cited as a striking illustration of it. The land owner derives his fixed
                        notions from the circumstances by which he is surrounded. He lives day after
                        day, month after month, year after year, amid the same unchanging scenes. He
                        is on the same farm, sees the same trees, the same regular succession of
                        seasons and crops, the same neighbors. Year after year he sees the same
                        sights and hears the same sounds. Like those animals that take their color
                        from the objects on which they live, the agricultural class seem to derive
                        their character for fixity from the stable, permanent and unchanging objects
                        around them.</p>
                    <p>Much of the firm, earnest, unshifting political character of the Southern
                        people is due, doubtless, to this. The great bulk of them live in the
                        country, and cultivate their lands--lands that have, in many instances,
                        descended from father to son for several generations. This class constitutes
                        the predominant class in the Southern States. We have few large cities, and
                        townspeople are almost lost in the general aggregate of population.</p>
                    <p>It is different at the North. The country is there fast losing its rural
                        character. Cities, towns and villages are springing up in every direction.
                        Agriculture is not the main pursuit. Commerce, manufactures and all the
                        varied forms of industry are pursued. Men herd together. The events of
                        to-day obliterate those of yesterday. There is a constant whirl. Men and
                        things are ever in motion. Travel, change, variety present a never-ending
                        fluctuation. The solitary man loses his separate, atomic influence.
                        Individualism is lost, except in the case of a few prominent individuals,
                        who do for the tumultuous masses the thinking that they have not the time to
                        do for themselves. These individuals and the masses act and react upon each
                        other. While the former think for the latter, they derive from the rushing,
                        human tide most of their inspirations. It imparts to them something of its
                        own energy and rapidity of motion. It makes them think quickly and warmly.
                        They tire of stability and sameness, and live only in perpetual change.</p>
                    <p>In such a whirl of men and things reason and virtue are crowded out.
                        Expediency and a kind of quick, selfish business instinct usurp their
                        places. They control these whirling masses in their business, their
                        pleasures, and their politics. Their only religion is success, their only
                        guiding principles those expedients that will secure it. In the hot
                        contagion of motion and change, old standards are disregarded, and
                        aberrations are made respectable by numbers. Everything in this country
                        depends upon public opinion, and the unstable public opinion of the North
                        tears down old systems and builds up new ones in an inconceivably short
                        time. The man who assails the Constitution ceases to be odious and becomes a
                        patriot because the crowd follows him. They think, feel and act in unison,
                        and that makes everything they do seem right.</p>
                    <p>Is it not better to be stationary, submit to old restraints, and conform to
                        venerated standards? It is not better to be governed by reason and virtue;
                        by pride or habit even--by anything that is stable and respectable,
                        especially when bequeathed us by our fathers, than to discard them all and
                        plunge headlong into a sea of expediency, and move only as passion, pelf or
                        caprice shall direct us?</p>
                    <p>Yet, we would not have our people be too stationary. We would not have them
                        deny themselves the benefit of a wise progress. There are improvements in
                        every department of life, and discoveries in every department of science and
                        industry which they should avail themselves of. Our fathers had neither
                        railroads, steamboats nor telegraph lines. That is no reason why we should
                        deny ourselves their benefits. Nor should we refuse to introduce those
                        political and legal reforms which have, in the lapse of time and in the
                        change of circumstances, become necessary--as, for instance, the repeal of
                        usury laws. We are a part of the world and must properly fill our relation
                        to it. To refuse to move when it moves is as foolish as to attempt to move
                        when it stands still.</p>

                    <p>The only encouraging feature in the gloomy prospect before us, is the fact
                        that we are constrained to make a virtue of necessity, give up politics, and
                        devote our attention to business. Necessity, not choice, has led us to this.
                        Adversity sometimes teaches in a moment a useful lesson that years of
                        prosperity would fail to inculcate. Our eyes are now, we hope, fully open to
                        our past folly, and we will be wise if, in the future as well as at present,
                        we shall eschew politics, or at least make it subordinate to our business
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>By a singular antithesis, says the Richmond Whig, just as we, not
                        voluntarily, however, have been brought down to our duty, are giving up
                        politics and devoting ourselves to useful work, the North has lost its
                        interest in the great objects of material improvement and development, and
                        given up its whole mind and heart to politics. The North feels that it has,
                        for the first time, got the Government in its keeping, and is afraid it will
                        escape from its hands if its attention is averted for a moment. Every man,
                        woman and child at the North has become a politician, if not a statesman,
                        and they are as much tickled with that toy, the Government, as a child is
                        with a rattle. They can think and talk of nothing else but the great power
                        of the North, and their days and nights are spent in devising ways and means
                        of making the South feel the weight of that power. Let them go on playing
                        with their new pet, and let us work while they disport themselves. If we
                        faithfully perform the duties that devolve upon us, we can in ten years not
                        only repair all the ravages of war, but make long strides in the march of
                        improvement. It is for this generation of Southern men to give impress to
                        all future generations of the South, to create that impetus which shall bear
                        them onward to a greater prosperity and power than we have ever had. Leaving
                        the other Southern States to perform their part in the drama that is
                        opening, let us in Virginia throw our whole hearts and souls into it.</p>

                <summary>The paper declares that General Jubal Early identified the true traitors in
                    the preface to his book. The Southerners who sided with the Union "aided in
                    desolating and humiliating the land of their own birth, and of the graves of
                    their ancestors." Early envies them not "their dearly bought prosperity. I had
                    rather be the humblest private soldier who fought in the ranks of the
                    Confederate army and now, maimed and disabled, hobbles on his crutches from
                    house to house, to receive his daily bread from the hands of the grateful women
                    for whose homes he fought, than the highest of those renegades and traitors."
                    "An immortality of infamy awaits them."</summary>
