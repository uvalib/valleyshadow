<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Evil days are upon us; a Just God has seen fit to try our people sorely and
                        allow their enemies to harass them, almost beyond measure. But we should not
                        despair, or give way to a natural feeling of indifference, for has He not
                        blessed us most beautifully with the good things of this life and heaped our
                        garners high with the products of his foot-stool? If He has punished us
                        severely for our "manifold sins and wickedness," has He not "tempered
                        justice with mercy" in providing for all of our material wants, and does not
                        this fact bid us be of good cheer; bid us work with renewed hope and a firm
                        reliance on Him who holds the destinies of Nations, and of men, in the
                        hollow of His hand? It strikes us that this should have a wonderful
                        influence on a people professing to be christians, and that even the weak
                        and sinful should be strengthened by these manifestations of God's goodness
                        and loving kindness.</p>
                    <p>But "what are we to do;" how are we to save ourselves from the evils present
                        and to come--how can this people do right, act honestly and be relieved of
                        the terrible oppression and uncertainty of the present and future? Aching
                        hearts ask this question every moment. Every thinking and reasoning human
                        being in the South feels the dead weight of it on his life, and anxiously
                        looks about him, for the light that is to guide us out of the troublesome
                        sea of our misfortunes. As a mass, we believe no people ever thought so
                        earnestly and tried to do their duty more faithfully, than have the Southern
                        people, white and black, and no people have met with so many difficulties,
                        or overcome them so heroically. Take out a vile, low, Hell-inspired act of
                        agitators, called Radicals, and we find the great mass, honest in the desire
                        for peace and a determination to do everything, consistent with honor, to
                        obtain that great blessing--a blessing appreciated only by the war-worn and
                        weary.</p>
                    <p>This being the true feeling of the great mass of our people, it well becomes
                        them to ask "what are we to do?" Many schemes have been proposed and some
                        honest men believed, until recently, that "co-operation" with Hunnicut and
                        his "right bower," Botts, would save us. The action of the Convention
                        (so-called) in Richmond last week must convince all honest men, white and
                        black, of the fallacy of such hopes. Hunnicut, and his rule or ruin mob,
                        took charge of that Convention, and one of the truest Union men of this
                        County, Mr. Fultz, was so disgusted at the whole proceedings that he
                        returned home after the first day. We regret that we can not publish the a
                        full report of that Devil's own gathering in Richmond last week, but it is
                        sufficient to say that the most extreme Radical views were carried out, and
                        that all ideas of Conservatism were rudely trampled under foot. The Radical
                        party, led by Hunnicut, is determined to rule or ruin the State, and so
                        confident were they of success, by the assistance of the low white men and
                        by deluding the colored people, that they insultingly and defiantly repulsed
                        all efforts at "co-operation," made by some of the first men of the State.
                        While we honor the motives of the gentlemen who attempted this
                        "Co-operation" movement, we can not feel sorry at its complete failure; for
                        it will show the honest masses of the State where the Hunnicut faction
                        desires to lead them and stir the people up to act as men should, when all
                        they hold dear is at stake.</p>
                    <p>"What are we to do after all this," is still the anxious enquiry, and never
                        was a question so hard to answer:--never in the history of the world had
                        conscientious Journalists so much difficulty in directing their readers to
                        the right path, regardless of past prejudices or the temptation to indulge
                        in indifference or despair, as natural to them as to all of our oppressed
                        people. Still, to the independent press, their only voice, now that our old
                        leaders are struck dumb by the awful present, the people look for an answer
                        to this ever present question, and we should feel ourselves false to them; a
                        disgrace to the position we hold, did we not answer it, honestly and
                        frankly, to the best of our knowledge, with the lights before us.</p>
                    <p>Looking over the muddy, miry, roads left for the people of the South to
                        travel, we can see but one, that gives a hope of reaching a safe 'camping
                        ground' at its termination. It is to accept the Military Bills as a finality from the powers that be, and hold them to it. Their great aim and object is
                        to build up a Radical party South, and it should be ours to defeat them. Let
                        us look upon it "as a great business transaction," in the language of one of
                        their organs, and make clean work of it. There are enough honest men, white
                        and black, in the State to carry out those bills and defeat this infernal
                        party, if every man will work. In doing this we defeat every plan of our
                        worst enemies and aid our friends North, for if they refuse to admit us on a
                        Constitution, conforming to the Military Bills; if they repudiate their own
                        orders, then they are lost North. If they admit us, we hold the balance of
                        power and, any way, we can't be hurt by trying it. To remain inactive is to
                        give the State to Hunnicut, Botts &amp; Co., and that is ruin. To act,
                        to strike home, in conformity with the Military Bills, as a guarantee to the
                        North, saves our State from the fate of Tennessee and places our future in
                        our own hands. This is hard to do, but we must do something and every man do
                        his part. In addition, we should throw a million or so acres of land in the
                        market at low rates, invite immigration; establish a liberal system of free
                        schools; have a perfect understanding of the colored people, and we can defy
                        even the ingenuity of Radical hate to harm us. Some may say this is doing
                        what the Radicals order. So it is, but it is not what they want us to do. It is simply using the Devil's fire-wood to
                        fright him with--no other material being available at this time. Let us deal
                        fairly and honestly with the colored people and explain this matter to them,
                        and, together, we believe we can so "corduroy" this road that, if a little
                        rough, it will secure us a safe passage into the Union. We don't believe
                        Capt. Mason's "Black Brigade," of Jackson's Corps, (the same that rebuilt
                        McClellan's bridge over the Chickahominy, in two hours, while the Engineers
                        were planning it out,) could possibly make a "footpath" over any other.</p>

                    <p>Correspondence of the Daily Petersburg Express</p>
                    <p>Staunton, VA, July 26, 1867.</p>
                    <p>Dear Express: This popular Valley town is at
                        present enjoying a repose which is not at all consistent with the bustling,
                        stirring scenes, which many of your readers witnessed here during the war. I
                        do not mean to say, however, that Staunton is more dull than other towns and
                        cities in Virginia are at this time. July and August are proverbially dull
                        months everywhere.</p>
                    <p>I see that wheat and flour are beginning to arrive at the depot here in
                        considerable quantities. So abundant a yield of wheat in this section, has
                        not been known for many years, and it is feared that the carrying capacity
                        of the Central will be taxed to its utmost to accommodate the demands.</p>
                    <p>Here may be seen specimens of the finest milch cows which have come under my
                        observation since I left Petersburg. Some of them, I am told, give four
                        gallons per day. Butter, of course, is abundant.</p>
                    <p>The greater portion of this town is located in a basin, surrounded by high
                        hills. On many of the hills are beautiful residences. Those of Hon. A. H. H.
                        Stuart, Rev. Mr. Latane, Davis Kayser, Esq., and others, were pointed out to
                        me. They are handsome specimens of architectural taste, and in the summer
                        season, must be cool, pleasant and salubrious.</p>
                    <p>I notice here a Restaurant, called "The Cockade House," whose proprietor, I
                        am told is from Petersburg. There is also here, a manufacturer, whose name
                        was once familiar in your city. It is A. H. D. Moore. He has a carriage and
                        wagon manufactory. He first saw this section of Virginia during the war, and
                        then resolved, "that if he survived the dangers of the battle-field and the
                        maladies of camp, he would make this his future home." He did survive both
                        and here he is, hale, hearty and robust as a mountaineer.</p>
                    <p>I am surprised to find here three papers, viz: the Spectator, Vindicator and Valley Virginian. They are all published weekly and
                        doing well. I have met with Dr. Crockwell, the junior of the Virginian, who informs me that there are no people
                        in the old Commonwealth who extend to the press a more liberal support than
                        those of this wealthy and extensive Valley section. Dr. C.'s enterprise is
                        comparatively new--having been commenced only since the war terminated. He
                        has been compelled to enlarge his sheet recently, and now publishes one of
                        the largest, neatest and most spirited weeklies in Virginia. His associate,
                        the widely known A. M. Garber, Jr., it was not my good fortune to meet.</p>
                    <p>There are many churches here, and stores of every description. The people are
                        said to be hospitable, and all agree that there is not a more pleasant place
                        on God's footstool to reside.</p>
                    <p>The country around is fertile to a high degree, and the scenery pleasant to
                        look upon. Many, I hear, from Pennsylvania and Maryland, are turning their
                        attention to this section, with a view to making their future homes. My
                        impression is they might go much further and fare a great deal worse.<br>

<b>The Excursion To Covington</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>450 citizens of Richmond, Charlottesville and Staunton enjoyed a "pleasant
                    and successful" trip to Covington, where they were "magnificently entertained,

                    bare announcement of the fact that the veteran showman John Robinson is about to
                    visit us is enough in and of itself to insure a crowded canvas both afternoon
                    and night. The name of 'Robinson' is as familiar to our old citizens as
                    household words, and hundreds of our readers will remember with pleasure the
                    many hours that they have spent under his canvas."<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Valley Turnpike Company "is remetalling Augusta Street, for about the
                    tenth time since the war." Since the road runs to the depot, it is constantly

                    Staunton imperatively demands these improvements."<br>
