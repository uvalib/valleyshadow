                    <p>There has been a great war between the whites on
                        this Continent. They have lost, and you alone have
                            gained. But once upon a time, the Indians, over a thousand to
                        one, made war upon the whites, and where are they? There are 36,000,000
                        whites in the U. S., to 4,000,000 negroes. If you go for the Radicals our
                        people are down on you; if you go Conservative the Radicals will turn
                        against you, and both can do you immense harm. You are between the "upper
                        and nether mill-stone," and we tell you, honestly, there is but one course
                        to pursue. It is the same you pursued during the war. Work and let white people settle this question--don't vote at all. The only escape for you, from
                        the fate of the Indian, is to make yourselves the best body of laborers in
                        the world, and to avoid, by not voting, a
                        conflict with any portion of the whites at present. The "blue veins" will
                        rule, and your policy is to make enemies of no party, for, be the result as
                        it may, you are bound to suffer. Hold on to your Registration, but don't
                        vote. The fruit is very tempting, but you had better throw yourself on the
                        generosity of the whites, and wait until it is fully ripe.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Esteline Furnace is in good hands. This magnificent Iron property,
                        situated in Augusta county, 20 miles from Staunton, about 4 miles from the
                        Va. C. R. R., at Pond Gap, containing 6,110 acres, (a small portion in
                        Rockbridge county,) was sold on the 17th, to Nelson Beall, James I.
                        Hohlitzell, Horace Resley and John E. Russel, of Alleghany co., Md., for the
                        sum of $35,000--one-half of which was paid in Land, to Burke &amp;
                        Kunkle, and the balance to be paid in 9 and 18 months with interest. We
                        understand that the gentlemen who purchased this property are enterprising
                        and energetic. They will at once proceed to develope the rich purchase they
                        have made. This is but "the beginning of the end" of the development of the
                        Iron interest, of old Augusta. This interest should, with proper efforts to
                        secure foreign capital, prove as valuable to our people as the Gold Mines of
                        California, and we congratulate them on the opening made. We again invite
                        the attention of capitalists to this interest. When the Chesapeake &amp;
                        Ohio Railroad is completed we will be all right on the Iron question.</p>

<b>Good News</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The first bulk shipment of grain was made from Staunton to Baltimore

                    was so densely crowded in the afternoon, that it was found necessary to refuse
                    admittance to hundreds." By night, most everyone was able to get in. "Everybody
                    was in the best of humor; the exercises in the ring were all good, and we heard

                        well the result of such a conflict. As circumstances are now progressing, we
                        behold with a conviction which no argument can weaken, with a vividness of
                        perception which no effort of our own can soften, the certainty of an
                        impending conflict between the white and the colored population of this
                        country--the nature of which it is as easy to foresee as it is fearful to

                    <p>In reviewing the results of the elections in Kentucky, the New York
                        Freedman's Journal and Catholic Register, speaks some brave, true words. We will be more pleased when we see them
                        carried out by acts. It says:</p>
                    <p>"The fact is, it is almost laughable, if it were not so sad, to think how
                            easy it would be for the Democratic majority in these States, North and South, to
                        assert their power--if they had but organization, and the most ordinary
                        amount of courage! As it is, to our damning disgrace as a people, a Puritan minority are ruling us--and the managers of
                        this minority are, physically, abject cowards! What a position for a great
                        people, professing popular Government!</p>
                    <p>Let us resume the courage of the old time "unterrified democracy!" Let us
                        assert it for North and South alike! Let us fight
                        if need be, the corrupt plutocracy that seek to grind down the people! If we
                        will only take the trouble, as a people, to learn the issues before us, as
                        the intelligent men of Kentucky have done, we will win without a conflict.
                        We will put the cheating Bondholders under our feet. We will pay them off in their own greenbacks! We will not
                        let them reap gold for their greenbacks, while we
                        have but greenbacks in exchange for the gold we used to own. They talk of
                        "manhood suffrage!" Let them have it to the full! It shall not, however, be,
                        as in Tennessee, a farce and a fraud, manipulated by violence upon a docile
                        people. It shall be--if they so will it, a real
                        exhibition of the popular power against the monied few. If the monied few
                        persist in sowing the wind, we will give them the harvest of the whirlwind!
                        The greenback-paper currency is rotten from beginning to end. S. P. Chase,
                        formerly Secretary of the Treasury, left that position with thirty millions of debt incurred, without corresponding
                            vouchers. The Treasury Department has been, and continues, a huge
                        swindle upon the people! For every million of real debt, the people are burdened with other millions of fraudulent debts. Revolution--if necessary a
                        bloody revolution--is our only escape. The finances of the country are
                        bankrupted by official frauds, and the proofs
                        will yet be forthcoming that this is so.</p>
                    <p>Kentucky has given us the rallying point. Now let Pennsylvania, and Ohio,
                        speak, next. The issue before us is one, at the same time, of manly
                        principle, and of personal self-interest. The principle, of manhood is
                        this:--Will we let our States of the North be dominated by a Puritan
                        minority, in Congress, pretending to wield the power of the Southern States
                        against us, when, in fact, they have disfranchised the real people of the
                        South, and have substituted for them the ignorant rabble of uncivilized and
                        pagan negroes, who have stuffed the ballot-boxes with whatever tickets the
                        military power has put in their hands.</p>
                    <p>The question of self-interest results from this action. A few are to be
                        benefitted, but the masses of the people at the North, are to sink into
                        subjection to the few cunning manipulators. These few are about to bring
                        their nominal triumph in Southern States, by negro votes, to override our
                        State dispositions at the North. This is the end and aim of the Black
                        Republican party, that made war, in 1861, to change our fundamental
                        institutions.</p>
                    <p>If we yield, we are lost--for a time at least, and can never recover liberty
                        but by bloody war. Our evident duty is to meet the issue at once.</p>
                    <p>Civil war is a terrible scourge. It turns houses into mourning; it sets
                        neighbor in deadly array against neighbor; it disturbs the order of society
                        by deplorable excesses. Nevertheless, civil wars, of frequent occurrence,
                        are part of the history of the human race. We see all the conditions of war
                        gathering, here, in our Northern States. It is to be the war of the masses
                        of the people against the few who are set on
                        robbing them, and against those proletaries that the few may hire, or fool,
                        to fight the battles of a monied aristocracy against the bulk of the people!</p>
                    <p>If this battle must be fought, the sooner it comes
                        the better! Old Kentucky shows the way. Let Pennsylvania and Ohio fall into
                        line! If the elections result in restoring the people to power, against the New England usurpation, all may be
                        accomplished in peace. If not, then it is a matter more evident than most
                        political events of the future, that the strong and bloody hand of
                        counter-revolution will take vengeance on the usurpers that have oppressed
                        the people."</p>

<b>The Federal Offices</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that "some of the colored people are earnestly discussing
                    the question of how to fill the various Federal Offices and who of their color
                    shall fill them." The following are spoken of for office in Augusta: Aaron
                    Shoveler, for Postmaster; Tom Campbell, for Collector of the Revenue; Philip
                    Roselle, for Freedman's Bureau Agent. "'Dumb George' still stands for Congress,
                    Billy Peters, of Harrisonburg, next. This may be hard on some people, but, then,
                    we can't help it."<br>(Names in announcement:  Aaron Shoveler,  Tom Campbell,  Philip Roselle,  "Dumb" George ,  Billy Peters)</blockquote>

                    <p>Do we weep for the heroes who died for us?<br> Who, living, were true, and
                        tried for us.<br> And in death sleep side by side for us?<br> The martyr
                        band<br> That hallowed our land,<br> With the blood they poured in a tide
                        for us?</p>
                    <p>Ah! fearless on many a day for us,<br> They stood in front of the fray for
                        us,<br> And held the foeman at bay for us;<br> Fresh tears should
                        fall<br> Forever--o'er all<br> Who fell while wearing the gray for us.</p>
                    <p>How many a glorious name for us!<br> How many a story of fame for us<br>
                        They left! Would it not be a shame for us?<br> If their memory part<br>
                        From our land and heart--<br> And a wrong and a blame for us?</p>
                    <p>No--no--no--they were brave for us,<br> And bright were the lives they gave
                        for us<br> The land they struggled to save for us<br> Cannot forget<br>
                        Its warriors yet,<br> Who sleep in so many a grave for us.</p>
                    <p>No--no--no--they were slain for us,<br> And their blood flowed out in a rain
                        for us,<br> Red, rich and pure on the plain for us;<br> And years may
                        go,<br> But our tears may flow<br> O'er the dead who have died in vain for
                        us.</p>
                    <p>And their deeds--proud deeds--shall remain for us,<br> And their names--dear
                        names--without stain for us,<br> And the glories they won shall not wane
                        for us;<br> In legend and lay<br> Our heroes in gray,<br> Though dead,
                        shall live over again for us.<br> Moina</p>
