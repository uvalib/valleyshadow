                    <p>We have talked to numbers of the people lately and heard a portion of Gov.
                        Peirpoint's speech on Monday. All the talk was about "reconstruction," and
                        we found most people agreed with us, especially the old soldiers. Gov.
                        Peirpont made a conciliatory speech and was listened to attentively by a
                        large crowd. His views have been too often published to require a report
                        from us. We should judge him to be a good-hearted man and believe he means
                        well, when he urges reconstruction under the Military Bills. As to his
                        Biblical talk, our people have heard Bishop Johns and Mr. Munsey. As to his
                        theory upon education all agree that it is a "good thing" and that we should
                        have plenty of it--especially the "rising generation." "Nobody was hurt" by
                        Gov. Peirpont's speech and he made a "fair impression." Everybody said he
                        was the man for next Governor, in preference to Hunnicut, and we believe it.
                        We prefer him to Botts, and how would it do to elect a man like C. R. Mason,
                        the great representative <emph rend="italic">worker</emph> of the State?</p>
                    <p>It seems that some folks can't understand the Valley Virginian, because we
                        say and do just what we please. We have a few words for all. Taking an
                        honest, calm view of this reconstruction business, and looking at it in
                        every light, we still reiterate the views we have so often expressed. We see
                        but one path of safety, one road for our people to follow--and that is an
                        honest acceptance of the Military Bills, as a guarantee to the North, and
                            <emph rend="italic">as a finality</emph>. It is to us a simple
                        proposition. Shall we reconstruct in this <emph rend="italic">new</emph>
                        government, or leave the country? If we do our duty and remain, we must
                        accept the terms of the conquering idea and control it. Then, without any
                        "more foolishness," let every man determine to do his part, hard as it is;
                        let us send men to the Convention who have the nerve to form a Constitution
                        in conformity with the Military Bills, present it to Congress and come home.</p>
                    <p>This requires no party organization or "co-operation"; it is simply carrying
                        out orders. If Congress refuses us, then a "re-action" occurs North and we
                        are safe. If it accepts us we hold the balance of power, and can <emph
                            rend="italic">then</emph> decide with which party it is to our interests
                        to act. We have not space to further elaborate the views so often expressed
                        in this paper. The false and delusive idea of a "re-action North," in our
                        favor, <emph rend="italic">without a strict compliance with the Military
                            Bills</emph>, is, to us, so preposterous that we can not account for
                        Southern men indulging in it for a moment. No matter what Andrew Johnson may
                        do, no matter what the brave gentlemen North, who allowed us to fight it out
                        alone, may say and promise, we can see no "silver lining to the cloud" of
                        our misfortunes, but a speedy compliance with the requirements of the
                        Military Bills, and a united and honest effort on the part of all true men
                        to keep our people united on this question.</p>

                    White Sulphur Springs, only 13 miles from Staunton. Mr. J. A. Hefelfinger, the
                    proprietor, runs a very attractive resort. "Invalids will find there White
                    Sulphur, Alum, Chalybeate, Red Sweet and Free stone water, all within easy
                    distance of the Hotel or Cabins; while seekers of pleasure can make up a full
                    measure of enjoyment from the views of the mountains, the bracing air, the
                    bowling alleys, billiard rooms, and last, but not least, the dining room, in
                    which is daily spread the best the country can afford." A string band from
                    Petersburg also performs in the evenings.</summary>

                    that they put their trust in "the true and consistent men of the South, with
                    whom they were born and raised" instead of radical northerners and their poor
                    white followers. Still, Vance and the editors have "little hope that his advice
                    will be taken, so industrious have been the efforts to make the colored men of
                    his State think ill of those who were lately their masters, and to cause them to
                    disregard and distrust everything which they might do or say."</summary>

                    out. "We stand in the midst of confusion--and no brain can compass such vast
                    themes, and no eye penetrate the future. It is idle to worry ourselves."
                    Instead, southerners should "work with our hands and have faith in God."</summary>

                    The Augusta Fire Company, "his old companions in Arms and numbers of our
                    citizens" made up the funeral procession. "He was a brave, true-hearted boy,
                    beloved by all and mourned for by the whole community. He lost his arm at the
                    battle of Petersburg, and has been a sufferer ever since. Peace to his ashes!"</summary>

                    inspection" through Staunton's alleys and back yards in order to enforce
                    Staunton's laws regarding cleaning and use of lime. "The Street Commissioners
                    caught very bad colds, or they would have detected the thousand and one separate

                    government." "This shows that the editor, who always seeks to interpret the
                    popular will, sees that the mongrel party has had its day. We cordially go with
