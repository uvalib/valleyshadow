                    <p>The Valley Virginian, true to its name, has been devoted, by us, to "what we
                        considered the best interests of the Valley and of Virginia." We have not
                        professed to be a "prophet or the son of a prophet," nor have we talked
                        "wise things, meaning nothing." We have simply "accepted the situation" as
                        it was, from day to day, and advised our people according to the "lights
                        before us," feeling confident that the good sense of so practical, so
                        earnest a people, would decide upon the right; and never suppose that a
                        paper and an office worked by "paroled" Confederates could be any thing, but
                        devoted to Virginia.</p>
                    <p>It has not been our habit, it would not be <emph rend="italic">Valley
                            Virginian</emph>, to deal in glittering generalities," and we have
                        always, freely and fully, stated our convictions of "what was best for the
                        Valley and for Virginia." When the military bill was first passed, we
                        favored a submission, by the Legislature, to the people of the question,
                        "Convention or no Convention." When it was amended, so as to make a
                        Convention a fixed fact, we favored an acceptance of the <emph rend="italic"
                            >fact</emph>, and urged our people to vote for and control it, if
                        possible. We have no regrets for what we have done. We believed we were
                        right <emph rend="italic">then</emph>, and we believe we are right <emph
                            rend="italic">now</emph>. We did not see any way out of our troubles,
                        but by "using the devil's own firewood against him," (i. e. reconstruction
                        under these hellish measures,) <emph rend="italic">then</emph>, and we can
                        see no other <emph rend="italic">now</emph>. To yell, to throw up our hats,
                        to make a big, old political hurrah generally, over the triumph of either
                        party North, seems to us the least dignified position a Southern man could
                        occupy. They all united in conquering us; in forcing us to "swallow the
                        bitter pill;" and, like Gen. Lee, nothing to us "could be worse than
                        Appomattox." Some folks have gotten very brave of late, and are howling over
                        "Democratic victories" North; "<emph rend="italic">we</emph> have the
                        Radicals by the neck," and all that. "Bob-tailed politicians" are very
                        belligerent, and the devil is to be played generally; but we can't see it,
                        and until we do, we prefer taking a course, justified, by common sense, and
                        making the best of a "bad bargain."</p>
                    <p>The question of "Convention or no Convention," has been fully discussed, and
                        the people have made up their minds upon it. It is useless to discuss it
                        further now. That it will be held, we are confident, and we desire every man
                        to vote as his judgement may dictate. Believing it is to be held, we hoist
                        the Conservative ticket at the head of our paper. The address of the
                        committee, appointed by Saturday's Convention leaves us no word to say in
                        favor of the candidates. We endorse and will vote for it. It is of the
                        utmost importance that all the Conservative elements of the State should be
                        united, the people feel it and this ticket must be elected. Let us cease
                        discussing the question of "Convention or no Convention," and let every true
                        Virginian devote all his "mind, heart and hand" to defeating the Radicals.
                        This is the issue, in fact the only issue, and <emph rend="italic">we must
                            see to it that no side issues divide us</emph>. Other questions can be
                        discussed hereafter; let us be <emph rend="italic">prudent</emph> and send
                        good men to the Convention.</p>

                <summary>The Valley Virginian defends its long-held stand of working with the terms
                    offered under Reconstruction by accepting the Convention and moving to control
                    it. The editors see no good in relying on northern Democrats to held solve the
                    South's problems. The paper and its veteran employees, the editorial claims,
                    have always held the best interests of the Valley and of Virginia above all
                    other considerations.</summary>

                    benefits of the natural springs west of the Blue Ridge. The article calls
                    attention to Staunton as an attractive town from which daily stages and trains
                    leave for the springs. It also points to Augusta and Stribling Springs as

                <summary>Recent northern electoral triumphs for the Democrats, defeats for the
                    Radicals, and opposition to black suffrage prove "that the people of this
                    country are alarmed by the mad experiments in government and the wild abuses of
                    power, which have signalized the course of the ultraist leaders." The
                    disappointment of the populace at the failure of speedy reunion is becoming
                    clear. Still, the southern people should not "halloo before they are out of the
                    woods."</summary>

                    <p>What is occurring at the North, as illustrated in the elections, shows that
                        the reign of the extremists there is at an end. That of their imitators here
                        has never had a beginning. We do not mean to say what the ascendency of the
                        Republican party at the North is to conclude abruptly--but that the
                        leadership in that party of Wendell Phillips, Sumner, Butler, Stevens, and
                        other like ultra and violent men, is over, and that the party will now come
                        under the control of its more moderate and conservative members--men who
                        will acknowledge no fellowship with the reckless and rabid pack of Southern
                        Radicals. Conservatism in the North will allay itself with conservatism in
                        the South, and the power thereby brought into action will be the power that
                        will have the fate of the colored race in its keeping. We believe it will
                        deal with them kindly and justly, but they must remember that it is an
                        experiment that is now making of their fitness to be entrusted with the
                        exercise of political privileges, and that in proportion as they exhibit the
                        intelligence, independence and integrity that are requisite to a judicious
                        and profitable use of the franchise conferred on them will it be concluded
                        that their participation in the affairs of government should be increased or
                        diminished. If it be found that they have hid themselves away in the
                        darkness of secret and oath bound societies, and that they have sold
                        themselves to mercenary adventurers and demagogues whose bidding they do as
                        in the old time they did the bidding of overseers of another sort it cannot
                        be expected that the experiment of their enfranchisement will be considered
                        successful, and the whole effort thenceforward will be to curtail and
                        restrain rather than to enlarge their exercise of political powers. Depend
                        upon it the true interest of the colored race demands that they shall
                        commend themselves not to the crazy fanatics and Jacobins, whose day is
                        over, but to that sound, moderate and conservative body of our people whose
                        power and will are just now beginning to assert themselves, and who, when
                        once they have assumed their legitimate control of the Government, will hold
                        it for generations to come. As a true friend to that race, we advise them at
                        once to cut loose from the false guides to whom too many of them have
                        surrendered themselves; come out from the criminal and disgraceful lodges
                        and leagues into which they have been seduced, and seek to secure the
                        friendship and confidence of those whom they know to be men of character and
                            sense.--<emph rend="italic">Richmond Whig.</emph></p>

                <summary>The Richmond Whig warns African Americans that radicalism is on the wane
                    and conservatism is on the ascendent in both North and South. Black suffrage is
                    only an experiment, and the manner in which African Americans use it will have
                    much to do with its continuance under the new regime. The editorial urges them
                    to remember this, and break off all connection to radical politics and groups.</summary>

                <summary>General Tochman was in Augusta on behalf of the Polish colony in

                    bushels of wheat to help the struggling immigrants. Alexander H. H. Stuart
                    passed a resolution calling on Augusta citizens, as a matter of "sound policy as
                    well as enlightened benevolence," to donate "100 bushels of seed wheat" to the
                    colony. The following made donations: William A. Burke, two plows; A. H. H.
                    Stuart, $5; Jacob Baylor, 5 bushels of wheat. "This is a poor showing for the
                    great county of Augusta, and we hope our farmers will soon deposit the 100
                    bushels of wheat with Bumgardner and McClure. We want emigration and this is the

                    <p>In response to a call published in the Staunton papers, for a meeting to be
                        held in Staunton on the 12th of October, 1867, for the purpose of nominating
                        candidates for the Convention, a number of citizens, not large, but fairly
                        representing the people of all portions of Augusta county, assembled, and
                        unanimously selected Joseph A. Waddell and Powell Harrison to represent the
                        county, and James C. Southall, of Albemarle, to represent the District
                        composed of Augusta, Albemarle and Louisa counties. The undersigned were
                        also appointed by said meeting a committee to prepare an address to the
                        voters of Augusta.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harrison and Mr. Waddell are both too well known, and their character and
                        capacity too highly appreciated by our people, to need that the action of
                        the meeting, in choosing them, should be vindicated. As the white majority
                        in the counties of Augusta, Albemarle and Louisa is large enough to elect a
                        conservative delegate, by concentrating the entire white vote upon a single
                        candidate, it was thought most expedient to select a candidate who it was
                        believed, would command the vote of Albemarle and Louisa. Mr. James
                        Southall, the Editor of the Charlottesville Chronicle, who is efficiently
                        using his great abilities in the interests of conservatism, and who is
                        extensively and favorably known in these counties, seemed most available for
                        ensuring their vote, and at the same time acceptable to the people of
                        Augusta. It is believed that he will unite the entire conservative vote of
                        the District, and thus defeat the election of a radical. It cannot be
                        expected that each voter should have his first choice. Concert of action is
                        indispensable, and can only be secured in the way provided by the
                        meeting--the people <emph rend="italic">fairly represented</emph>. In this
                        meeting, held after <emph rend="italic">full</emph> and <emph rend="italic"
                            >fair notice</emph>, men have been nominated who are known to be <emph

                    <p>The election of good men can <emph rend="italic">now</emph> only be secured
                        by uniting upon those nominees. Then let every conservative, every <emph

                        influence in inducing others to come, and vote for the conservative
