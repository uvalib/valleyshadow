<b>Register and Vote.</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial urges white Virginians to register and vote for delegates to

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The respectable and patriotic portion of the people of Virginia, and of the
                        unrepresented States generally, are very naturally [section unclear]. We
                        shall vote for the Convention and would advise every one to do likewise,
                        because we honestly believe it is the only avenue of escape from the
                        unutterable horrors which brood over the future of our beloved country. But
                        this is a question of much perplexity, and admitting of a variety of honest
                        and intelligent differences of opinion. We do not know but that twelve
                        months may develope the fact that we are honest
                        in our convictions, and we cheerfully concede the same credit to those who
                        differ with us. But as to the question of the propriety of Registration, we
                        do not believe an intelligent man who takes the trouble to think for a
                        moment can doubt. This is a question about which there can be but one sane
                        opinion. It is a sacred duty of every citizen who
                        is qualified to register and vote for the best men in the field for the Convention. We invoke
                        our people not to forget, in the discussion of the question of Convention or
                        no Convention, the vast, the all-importance of Registration. If you are
                        opposed to a Convention then vote against it, but in Heaven's name, as you
                        value your own honor and the lives and liberties of your children, do not
                        fail to register and vote for members of the Convention.</p>
                    <p>If we fail to retain possession of the State organization now; if by a
                        supineness which is criminal at this time, or a stupid stubbornness which is
                        treason to the State, and our posterity, we allow the Red Strings to seize
                        the State government, we can never reasonably expect to
                            wrest it from them. Knaves as we know the 'loyalists' to be, they
                        would be worse than dolts and Idiots, if having once, through the stupidity
                        of the decent people of the State, obtained power, to allow it to pass back
                        into our hands. The test oaths, tyranny, and loyal militia of Tennessee and
                        West Virginia, furnish the plan, ready made to their hands, and we may rest
                        assured they will use it. Let it be understood then fully that if we lose
                        control of our State organization in the coming contest, we can never regain it. In conclusion, we beseech the
                        whites of Virginia, to Register and Vote. Let our press and public speakers
                        stop hobnobbing with the blacks. The vast majority are united we fear
                        against us--but we have a clear majority of from twenty to thirty thousand
                        in the State, and if they will but turn out, we will give these Red Strings
                        such a whaling at the polls as will do more proselyting among them, than all
                        the newspaper articles and public speeches in the world.</p>

                    planning to send secret agents into the South to create disturbances and riots

                    can give the Radicals a political edge.<br>
