                    fired the Army of Northern Virginia's final shot. That honor should go to Col.
                    Charles T. O'Ferrall's command, which had been stationed in the Valley and "had
                    a successful engagement with the enemy, after we were paroled at Appomattox. His
                    command was the last organized force in Virginia, of the A. N. Va., to
                    surrender, and if dates were at hand, we think it could be proven."</summary>

                    <p>There is one thing, says the Washington <emph rend="italic">Evening
                        Express</emph>, that Virginia more needs at this time than any other, it is
                        immigration. The revolution in labor resulting from the late war renders it
                        impracticable to attempt the prosecution of agricultural enterprise on the
                        old plan, and to depend on the present generation of freedmen for anything
                        like regular labor to rely, in too many instances, on a broken reed.
                        Consequently, the large plantations must be divided and sold to thrifty,
                        practical, and enterprising persons from the more densely populated States,
                        thousands of whom would gladly avail themselves of the opportunity to settle
                        on the prolific soil of the Old Dominion, and would bring into the State
                        that manly vigor and steady purpose which, in a few years, will develop her
                        inexhaustible resources, and bring millions to the pockets of her
                    people.</p>

                <summary>Since the war ended slavery, and the labor of the Freedmen is deemed

                    as the only way to fill the South's labor needs. Large farms will need to be
                    divided and sold to attract immigrants.</summary>

                <head>The Leadership of the South</head>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The planting interest of the South in former times controlled it, and this
                        not simply by virtue of position, but because of fitness, intelligence, and
                        independence. It is right that the intelligent class in a community should
                        rule it, and we would be sorry to see the leadership of the South pass into
                        the hands of irresponsible demagogues. But the late slave owners must do
                        their duty. They are now a meagre minority. Many of them, too, are
                        disfranchised. We regard this as unfortunate, but the deed is done, and it
                        only makes it the more imperative on those whose position, culture, and
                        experience entitle them to lead, that they should do their duty. And this
                        requires that they should so mingle with the people as to enlighten and
                        instruct them, especially in the principles of political economy, that they
                        should become familiar with their wishes and their opinions, ascertain their
                        grievances, discuss with them their purposes, and generally expose their
                        blunders. On the intelligence of a community rests the responsibility of
                        guiding it. If its educated men and accomplished women seclude themselves
                        from society they are guilty of a gross betrayal of their trust. They have
                        no moral right to give way to a selfish exclusion that would thrust their
                        obligations upon less competent shoulders. The exhibition of an earnest,
                        honest desire to ameliorate the condition of the colored people of the
                        South, on the part of the leading whites, will do more towards retaining the
                        rightful leadership of the latter than all the tricks or legislative devices
                        that may be contrived. The day of dictation is passed. The authority based
                        on forces is ended; that based on freely recognized fitness is, after all,
                        more potent. For as there is no government so strong as a republic which
                        rests on the free will of the people, so there is no leadership so secure as
                        that which rests on the genuine appresiation and honest affection of those
                            led.--<emph rend="italic">Washington Express</emph>.</p>

                <summary>This selection from the Washington Express argues that, with much of the
                    old leadership class disfranchised, it becomes even more imperative that those
                    remaining southerners of "education" and "culture" must take leadership roles.
                    They must especially move to care for the Freedmen or the Radicals will step in
                    and gain influence among them.</summary>

                <summary>The Town Council met for the October session on Saturday, Recorder Kayser
                    presiding. Only Trout, Hope, Points, Bickle and Peck were absent. The Water
                    Committee report showed water depth at the spring 20 inches above the supply
                    pipe, and the Works in good order. The Water Committee did $25.02 in work for
                    individuals, and $36.95 for the town. W. P. Johnson was refunded $1 in erroneous
                    water taxes, and Tim Honihan was refunded $2. $25 were appropriated to improve
                    the street leading to the Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institute. $75 were appropriated
                    to improve the street leading from Augusta Street between John Gregory's lot and
                    Market Street, and the public hydrant was cut off at the corner of the lot. The
                    Clerk of the Corporation was ordered to award to the lowest bidder a contract
                    for the public printing. Despite Mr. Kayser's statement that "he had always had
                    the work done at the office which would do it cheapest," the court has no record
                    of ever receiving bids, which is imperative to uphold "the interest of a heavily
                    taxed people." Mrs. B. Bolen was relieved from having to pay tax on two drays,
                    or one dray and cart, for 1868.</summary>
