<b>Members to the Convention</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gen. Schofield has ordered that the "test oath" is not required for members
                    of the convention, and the paper suggests the following candidates for Augusta:
                    J. Addison Waddell, Maj. H. M. Bell, N. K. Trout, and J. N. Hendren. "Let us
                    select our best men, and present a united front to Radicalism."<br>(Names in announcement:  J. Addison Waddell, Maj. H. M. Bell,  N. K. Trout,  J. N. Hendren)</blockquote>
<b>Reconstruction in Earnest. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad.</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Valley Virginian seconds Major J. G. Paxton's support of the Chesapeake
                    and Ohio Railroad which John B. Baldwin did much to put in place. The plan is
                    for Augusta to subscribe $300,000 in county bonds for support of the road which
                    will link the Chesapeake Bay with the Ohio River. The road would open the trade
                    of the West to Virginia. "Instead of being an impoverished territory, filled
                    with the wrecks left by four years of terrific war, and with no relief from more
                    than two years of delusive peace, she would today be, not merely the peer of any
                    state, but would, as in the early days of the Republic, be the leading State of
                    the Union."<br>(Names in announcement: Major J. G. Paxton,  John B. Baldwin,  Charles A. Stuart)</blockquote>
<b>"Comparisons are Odious."</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Dumb George," the paper's African American assistant, is outraged at
                    comparisons between blacks and poor whites.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Dumb George says it "is an insult to honest Confederate, Conservative colored
                        people and the whole race, no matter how mean a nigger may be, to compare a
                        low-down mean white man to them," and adds that "white gentlemen who write
                        for the papers ought not to make colored folks the scape-goats for all the
                        rascality of thieving white people." He is very much of the opinion that any
                        comparison between a mean white man and a negro is an insult to the latter,
                        and he is getting mad about it.</p>

<b>Our Schools</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Staunton schools have opened "with encouraging prospects." "The school
                    girls are generally good looking. We are glad we are married, and would pity
                    Southall, if he were here."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Prepared for the Winter</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper calls attention to Staunton's need for a wood inspector, a
                    position especially important to "house keepers."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Veteran Corps</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that among the Sheriff and Deputies of Augusta County,
                    there are only "two whole men." The others lost arms or legs in the war. "A more
                    efficient 'corps of veterans' from Captain Paul, Sheriff, through the whole line
                    cannot be found in the States. Good soldiers make good officers."<br>(Names in announcement: Captain  Paul)</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Valley Virginian and the Norfolk Journal share the opinion that "a
                    large majority of the white voters of Virginia have made up their minds to get
                    back into the Union by the shortest road."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Staunton Musical Association met on September 24th, and attracted many
                    interested persons. Dr. J. L. Brown will continue as conductor.<br>(Names in announcement: Dr. J. L. Brown)</blockquote>
<b>A Splendid Sight</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Augusta Fire Company and the Deaf, Dumb and Blind Fire Company turned
                    out on Thursday night, led by the Institution Band. "The best order prevailed;
                    the transparencies were appropriate, and the whole affair did great credit to
                    the two companies."<br>
