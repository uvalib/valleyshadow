                <transcript>
                    <p>A great many people have asked us "what we saw in New York City?" It would be
                        easier to tell what we didn't see, for N. Y. is a world in itself. We saw
                        some millions of men and a million or so of women on Broadway, the latter
                        dressed, and acting, as if they thought the men were ignorant of the fact
                        that women had pedal extremities and bosoms--a fact they seemed determined
                        to establish beyond the shadow of a doubt. We saw men enough to have
                        conquered the South in 90 days--but they didn't. We saw the Black Crook and
                        thought it a big thing, and several other big things, but, most horrible of
                        all, we saw a vile white, "long haired barbarian" kick a darkey out of the
                        St. Nicolas, and the people laughed. We saw a number of Confederates doing
                        well, but understood there were 35,000 doing badly. The Central Park, the
                        pride of all New Yorkers, a perfect fairy land, erected by labor and art, on
                        naturally as poor a piece of ground as can be found in the most rugged
                        portion of Virginia is certainly wonderful, but after all it does not
                        compare with thousands of natural Parks, we daily pass by unnoticed, in our
                        beautiful Valley. Central Park cost millions--nature gave us ours. And so it
                        is with the whole North and South. By emigration, labor, economy, untiring
                        energy and concentration of their resources, they make a poor land beautiful
                        and a people rich. What limit is there to the future prosperity of our
                        thrice blessed land, if we profit by the good in their example?</p>
                    <p>Looking at the wonderful material development of the North--for New York is
                        but the grand center--the Metropolis of its wonderful prosperity, we were
                        naturally led to visit the source from which sprang the vital element, that
                        continually added fresh life and vigor to its constantly weakened power
                        during the war. Castle Garden, with its thousands of emigrants from all
                        parts of the world, told us the story. Looking upon the sturdy laborers,
                        representatives of every land, collected there, we saw, in their strong arms
                        and generally intelligent faces, the true source of Northern prosperity, and
                        the secret of the wonderful development of that portion of the Union flashed
                        upon us. And we thought, and still think, that in turning the tide of labor
                        and capital South, lies the great hope of our Country. They wish to emigrate
                        to this Sunny land, but are educated against us. Will you take the proper
                        means to educate them and yourselves to it? Think about it.</p>
                    <p>And lastly we saw many things we intend to impress upon our people,
                        regardless of their past prejudices or our own. The mighty present is upon
                        us, and we must keep up in this race for material development or die, as a
                        people. Let us live.</p>

                <summary>The editors contrast New York City with the rural Valley and assert that
                    Virginians can learn lessons from Northern prosperity. Hard work, immigration,
                    and industrial development are needed to keep up in the race of life.</summary>

                    <p>Material prosperity brings political strength. Observation North taught us
                        that as soon as we are rich and prosperous, by hard labor, we will have our
                        rights--not before. The people North are attending to their own material
                        interests, which are now feeling the effects of an impoverished South, with
                        no trade, worth speaking of, to help them in the great financial crisis
                        through which they are now passing. A prosperous South, and local causes
                        North, will hurl the Radical party from power. Let us see that it is no
                        fault of ours, if this much desired consummation is postponed, or never
                        reached.</p>

                <summary>Monday was court day in Augusta, and the citizens "turned out in full
                    force." Many auctions were held, anything sold on credit going at double price.
                    The lawyers did brisk business. "The court house is a large and modern looking
                    building, and the seats reserved for members of the bar were, with scarce an
                    exception, filled."</summary>

                <summary>The May term of the County Court met, William Chapman presiding. 35 deeds
                    were entered on the minutes. John Minor was granted a license to "keep private
                    entertainment at Mountain Top," and T. D. Woodward was granted the same at
                    Willow Spout. The following were appointed surveyors of the public roads:
                    William Landis, G. C. Burner, George Cochran, W. S. Baker, Silas H. Walker, C.
                    A. Rohler, William Shiery, John C. Mowry, and Daniel Croft, Jr. Charles Langford
                    was ordered to be bound out, his mother being allowed to select his master. The
                    road on Middle River which John S. Byers had petitioned for was ordered to be
                    established, Judge John Kenney receiving $90 in land damages. In the case
                    Commonwealth vs. Pannel, for assault and battery, the jury rendered a verdict of
                    $5 in damages. Jacob H. Dull, James A. Wilson, Elijah M. Wiseman, and John M.
                    Meek were granted certificates enabling them to procure artificial limbs. The
                    road near Stribling Springs was ordered open on petition of Chesley Kenney, for
                    which Jason N. Bruffy was awarded $25 in land damages and Albert Faucett, $10.
                    Mary Virginia Pannell, aged 4 years, was ordered to be bound out. John S. Byers
                    was granted $75 to blast rock and repair roads in his precinct west of town. The
                    following road commissioners were ordered to assign hands throughout the county:
                    James M. Lilley, Thomas S. Hogshead, John Pilson, and A. S. Turk. $70 was
                    granted to R. S. Hansberger to rebuild a bridge on a public road near his mill.
                    The case of Commonwealth vs. R. T. Smith, "colored," was remanded to Circuit
                    Court. In Commonwealth vs. Martin Hill, "colored," for petit larceny, the jury
                    returned a guilty verdict, and Hill was sentenced to six days in jail. The
                    following were appointed a committee to audit county claims: R. G. Bickle, H. H.
                    Peck, W. G. Sterrett, and B. F. Points.</summary>
