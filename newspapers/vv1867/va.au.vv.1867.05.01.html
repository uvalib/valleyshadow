<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For the first time since the war our people fully realized the immense
                        political revolution that has been forced upon the country, by the Military
                        Bill, and for the first time the Freedmen of Augusta listened to the solemn
                        words of truth, eloquently spoken by one of our most distinguished
                        fellow-citizens. Early last Saturday evening the Court House began to fill
                        up, and by 8 o'clock was crowded with about 400 freedmen and two hundred
                        whites. All classes were represented, and the best order prevailed during
                        the meeting. We were struck with the earnest attention given to Gen. Echols
                        by the colored people, and the marked difference in the deportment of the
                        colored people, compared most favorably with the noisy, ranting crowds we
                        have lately seen in other places. It was most gratifying, too, not to be
                        forced to record the interference of any "mean white men" in the
                        proceedings.</p>
                    <p>But to the meeting. On motion, Philip Rosselle was unanimously elected
                        chairman and took the Judge's seat, where he presided with a dignity and
                        decorum that seemed, almost, to make the portrait of Chief Justice Marshall,
                        just above him, smile with satisfaction! On motion of Aaron Shoveler, A. M.
                        Garber, Jr., was nominated for Secretary, W. H. H. Lynn, of the Vindicator,
                        being nominated also. Mr. Garber was withdrawn and Mr. Lynn was unanimously
                        elected. The meeting was then called to order and, amid the profoundest
                        silence, Gen. Jno. Echols addressed the chair (we regret our limited space
                        confines us to a brief synopsis of this able, eloquent and telling address.)</p>
                    <p>The General returned thanks for the honor paid him by the Freedmen, in
                        eloquent terms, and spoke of the importance of a perfect understanding
                        between the whites and blacks now, in the changed duties and relations
                        caused by the legislation of the country. The history of the world gives us
                        no record of a change so monstrous and so sudden--a few years ago 4,000,000
                        colored people had no political rights--now the position is changed, the
                        result of a long, bloody and disastrous war has changed you from slave to
                        freemen. You stand under the law as free, personally and politically, as the
                        white man of every condition of society! A monstrous change! which brings
                        with it not only privileges, but responsibilities to be met and fulfilled by the
                        colored people! It is not necessary to refer to the past: "let the dead bury
                        their dead"; let old issues pass away; it has its regrets and glories,
                        bitter regrets--glorious memories--but the present is the important hour for
                        us. You all know my position. I am disfranchised and you can not, if you
                        would, give me anything, but credit for honesty in the purpose to perform my
                        part well in the changed circumstances in which we are placed. I do not
                        desire to indulge in past recollections and recriminations, but to do good
                        to the country of which you are citizens and endeavor to show you what is
                        for your good, and for the good of the whole country. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>Here the General took up the Military Bill and fully explained its
                        provisions, the rights it conferred on the Freedmen: that hereafter there
                        was to be no distinction on account of color before the law; that whatever
                        conditions may be applied to the white man, the same applied to the black,
                        and vice versa. So far as the right of suffrage goes you have the advantage
                        of many, myself for instance. They need have no fears of being cheated, for
                        the Comd'g General is compelled to see this law carried out, and there is no
                        man among us able, if he were disposed, to resist it. The explanation was
                        the most complete we ever listened to, and the Freedmen seemed much
                        gratified with it. The speaker next explained who were eligible to office
                        and who were not.</p>
                    <p>Continuing he said, Now my friends there is the act under which you are first
                        called upon to exercise the rights of freemen. I know the heart of every
                        colored man leaped with joy on being free. On knowing he was guaranteed in
                        all the rights of person and property, I came here to-night in response to
                        an invitation, and if I say these rights can not be rightly exercised by the
                        ignorant, I hope you will not become offended, for you all know there is
                        great ignorance among you. Every honest man admits it and wants to be
                        enlightened, so that good and not evil will come upon the country. (Cries of
                        yes, yes.)--Now if I can go with you in this investigation and, by anything
                        I may say, lead your hearts and thoughts into the right channel, I will be
                        truly thankful. I have nothing to make by flattery, if I had, I would not
                        flatter you. The Government, in its wisdom, has seen fit to disfranchise me
                        and others. I have taken an oath to give no aid or comfort to the enemies of
                        that government and I will keep it. Therefore if any man can speak to you
                        freely I can. Let us investigate the truth; let us see what is best for one
                        and all, for white and black, for society in general and for liberty and
                        order over the whole country. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>The colored people would vote for a Convention and ought to do so and the
                        whites too--all should stand shoulder to shoulder in this important
                        movement. The question for whom shall you vote then comes up. He urged upon
                        them to lay their hands on their hearts; to appeal to God for strength not
                        to be led astray and to vote right. To vote for none but honest men. There
                        is no stranger who comes here to register, but for his own interest,
                        therefore go to the men you trust in business--to whom you entrust your
                        money and with whom you must live. The injury that may be done, by voting
                        for the wrong man, it is certain will be mutual for our interests are the
                        same. He had no bitterness against the North, and did not, like the savage,
                        brood over wrongs and cherish revenge. He was anxious for all traces of
                        blood to be wiped out, and the country, reunited, to march on in greatness
                        and glory. The war had settled many questions, the most important that there
                        was one country and all should strive to add to its glory and grandeur by
                        encouraging mutual good feeling among all classes. (Applause.) He had heard
                        of attempts to excite bitterness among the colored people against our white
                        people. Is this right? Is it polite? Is it just to either race? You are told
                        that the North freed you and that you ought to love them and hate us. You
                        are told that you were emancipated by the North. Look at Lincoln's
                        proclamations during the war, and the action of Congress. He had no
                        complaints to make of what the North did, it was the natural drift of the
                        war and your freedom was the result, not of their intention at the
                        beginning, but of the force of circumstances. Did they ever emancipate their
                        own slaves? No, they sold them because they were not profitable North. We
                        would have done the same. In fact human nature was about the same all over
                        the world, and it is hard to give up property without price, even a broken
                        down horse. The North preferred to give up theirs by gradual emancipation,
                        so they could sell them South. A striking illustration of philanthropy and
                        securing profit at the same time. The Dutch commenced the slave trade, then
                        Mass. men became the greatest traders, but he didn't believe they would
                        engage in it now because the hearts, the minds, the feelings of men are
                        changed and everybody admits it was wrong. Some try to excite you by fears
                        of your being enslaved again. Is there a man here who fears it? (Laughter.)
                        It is an insult to any colored man of proper spirit to be talked to as a
                        child. Let them see you are not children to be scared by ghosts and bug
                        a-boos, but that you are men worthy of the rights conferred on you--with
                        brains to think and act for yourselves. (Applause.) What is your duty in
                        regard to parties. I speak as if I was a colored man politically and advise
                        you as such. Don't mingle up with any party as a body, for that will be no
                        profit to you. Don't go as a class with the radicals for that makes a gulf
                        deep and wide between you and your own people, and don't let it be said that
                        you, as a class, are arrayed against the whites as a class. Have no secret
                        meetings, I care not whether Northern or Southern. What are the results if
                        you succeed in building up a radical party in the South? You live in a
                        climate such as no country on earth can boast of--all your interests and
                        affections are centered here and you do not want to leave this home of
                        yours, poor as it now is. Now if you build up a radical party--go against
                        your white people here--they are in the majority in Virginia--make war upon
                        them, don't you see the whites must have every advantage in the contest.
                        They could have nothing to do with you socially, for you would be declared
                        enemies, and all intercourse must cease. This is a solemn matter and one
                        that behooves you to look well to before you decide which way you will go.
                        For God's sake let us have no family squabble, for we are one family. Let us
                        be calm and cool and reason understandingly. Suppose you as a race oppose
                        the Southern whites, go with the radicals, and they come here from the North
                        and Europe by thousands, to compete with you for your labor, to underbid you
                        for work and to finally exterminate you. The Speaker here related several
                        instances to show the prejudice North and in Europe against the blacks. He
                        urged the colored people to think whether they wanted to leave this country,
                        to give it up to free white labor North, and, if so to build up a radical
                        party hostile to the South.</p>
                    <p>He read them the Fable of the Belly and the Members and forcibly applied it
                        to the two classes South. He told them if all did not work together, if
                        capital and labor did not combine, that gaunt famine with her cadaverous
                        cheeks will stalk abroad through the land and the wail of distress be heard
                        on every side. He then beautifully alluded to the ties which should bind the
                        whites and blacks of the South together, in words that brought tears to many
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>Confiscation was next alluded to. It would be ruin to all, white and black.
                        And what a bill! It proposes to give 40 acres in trust for you. Does any
                        honest colored man want it? (A very weak "yes" from a back corner, whereupon
                        a respectable colored man informed the house he was happy to say that man
                        didn't belong to his community.) You are to be treated like wooden men, it
                        is to be put in trust for you and will you have it? Cries of no. Then "let
                        every tub stand on its own bottom" for "by the sweat of your brow shall you
                        live," is written by One who is [unclear] men and Governments. This
                        Confiscation would bring ruin to white and black; it would encourage
                        robbery, murder and break up the very foundations of society. So judge for
                        yourselves and when a man comes before you for office with this cry, let him
                        see you are free and honest men and that you'd resist the snare so
                        temptingly laid for you.</p>
                    <p>The speaker here devoted a large portion of his speech to plain, practical,
                        earnest advice to the colored people in regard to their social duties;
                        holding up the great cardinal virtues, that were the same now as in the days
                        of Revelation, urging upon them the importance of honesty, sobriety and
                        purity of life. He urged them to encourage their preachers, to educate their
                        children and above everything to work, to save enough to get little homes of
                        their own. To aid this he suggested the formation of a Savings Bank of their
                        own. There was no Southern man and no Radical who would work these things
                        out for you. You must do it for yourselves. He here repeated the beautiful
                        allegory of Abou Ben Adhem, which teaches that "he is the most blessed who
                        loves his fellow man."</p>
                    <p>In conclusion the General said: Take the course I have pointed out and you
                        have it in your power to give an illustration of the regeneration of a race,
                        such as the world never saw, and prosperity, and the highest position may be
                        yours. Follow any other, allow yourselves to be led astray; give way to
                        feelings of bitterness and hatred and I can see but one fate for
                        you--DESTRUCTION. (Applause.)</p>
                    <p>Dennis Harris moved that the thanks of the meeting be unanimously tendered to
                        General Echols, for the good advice he has given the colored people, and for
                        his kindness of manner in giving it. Carried.</p>
                    <p>Loud calls were made for Lawson, Maupin, Davenport, Roselle and others. The
                        Rev. Mr. Lawson, (colored) asked to be excused as he was not a politician.
                        Henry Davenport being repeatedly called, said:</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen: I confess I hardly know what to say, my
                        feelings overpower me. I am requested to thank Gen. Echols for his kind
                        speech and advice, and speaking is teaching. I am glad the day is come, when
                        the white man and the black can meet at the County seat, on such conditions,
                        when we are called up to the mountain top and see; to come and meet the
                        white man, and thanking him (Gen. E.) for the instructions he has given us,
                        both white and black, and I say here is my heart and hand, and God bless us,
                        too, as he advised, to love one another. With that respect to man, let us
                        live together in peace, harmony and quietude. My brethren; my friends of
                        color, my so sojourners to the bar of God; let us return a hearty, a
                        brother-like, a respectful answer to Gen. Echols. Let us live in peace and
                        this is to say here is my heart and hand, hoping God may lead us to live
                        together in peace. Applause.</p>
                    <p>SCOTT.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Jim Scott, (colored local preacher) spoke next. He acknowledged he never
                        felt so. Gen. Echols was a gentleman and had given good advice and related
                        pretty fables. He Scott would like to relate one too, that he had learned
                        when a boy. It was about the "boys and the frogs"--the idea being that the
                        negroes were the frogs for many years. (Loud Applause) General Echols had
                        talked about parties and how we should vote. He (Scott) had always heard it
                        was right to "praise the bridge that carried you over safely" i.e. the Radicals. (Great Applause and Laughter.)
                        What is your interests? To look back and rehearse and see--even a dog knew
                        his friends: (laughter) He recollected when Gov. Wise and Flournoy ran for
                        Governor, there were to great parties among the whites and why not two now?
                        He was for going with his friends. (Great Applause.) Gen. Echols contends
                        that all men North were our enemies. He knew some and they were called
                        "Copper-heads"--they were not colored men's friends. Actions speak louder
                        than words, &amp;c., and the Republicans had acted as our friends. Scott
                        went on to say he had no hard feelings against the whites--he had been
                        raised up kindly and treated as one of the family, but he was for his
                        rights--his friends politically.</p>
                    <p>DOWNEY.</p>
                    <p>The Rev. James Downey, (colored) said: He felt independently happy, also
                        feels better satisfied to speak for what had been said to-night. He desired
                        to give satisfaction to both parties, desired to return his best thanks to
                        Gen. Echols, believed he understood him and he justified him (Gen. E) on his
                        ground, so far as it was possible. He gave the best advice and most
                        beautiful figures. Nevertheless we are men, as he says, and we must look at
                        which is best. Some people look at one side of the picture and like it, then
                        at the other and like it--then not satisfied, they want to break it open and
                        see inside. Again returned his best thanks to General Echols, and thinks it
                        is not the design of the blacks to make war on the whites of the South. He
                        had no envy, hatred or malice in his heart. Knows the colored people but
                        didn't know the whites, after living with and working for them 61 years;
                        they never talked politics before him or tried to teach him, more than
                        enough for their own profit. Look at the picture, look at it and do the best
                        for ourselves. He had no prejudice against our white people. Some are kind,
                        some not. The Radicals whether they set us free or the Southern people makes
                        little difference. He wonders why either never thought of freeing us before?
                        The Radical party has made great sacrifices for us, to give us knowledge of
                        the living God; by coming from comfortable homes North, to teach us,
                        &amp;c. Southern gentlemen and ladies never said or offered to teach a
                        letter or a word. Again compliments Gen. Echols on his good advice, but
                        regrets he didn't begin to give it a little sooner, that they might have
                        been better able to appreciate his advices. If the Southern white people,
                        during the war, left their families to be protected, supported and cared for
                        by the blacks, as it was the blacks' duty, was it not the duty, of the
                        whites when they came back to do something for this faithful race; to at
                        least help to educate them? But they didn't. They said the nigger didn't
                        know anything--let him go--the Yankees freed him, let them feed him
                        &amp;c. But let the past go. There had been enough said, more than he
                        could take in at once, and he didn't believe many white men could either.
                        Let all think over what they had heard and pray God to give them consciences
                        to act right, in friendship and love to all.</p>
                    <p>Wright Bolling asked to be excused, he agreeing fully with Downey, Philip
                        Roselle, chairman, being loudly called for said: He had tried to be more
                        respectful than ever since the war. Before he belonged to people who knew he
                        would not let him be imposed on, by white or black, and that made him feel
                        himself. Now new duties made him try to be more respectful and he had no
                        complaints to make. A heap of folks talk about who set us free, and some of
                        his own color almost quarreled over it; one said the yankees did it because
                        they whipped the South, the other the South did it, for if they hadn't "fit"
                        there would have been no war and no freedom. He believed it was accidently
                        done anyway, didn't think either party intended it, and he was for making
                        the best of it. Now the yankees didn't intend to do it, and Maj. Garber
                        there, I belonged to his folks once, didn't intend to do it either, for if
                        he'd have known I'd be free--he'd never "fit" no any body else. Hoped we
                        will all live in peace and had no fears from gentlemen. Men who never owned
                        a "nigger," who would not have owned one had slavery lasted 100 years,
                        cursed them on the streets--gentlemen never did. The way was to treat every
                        one right and not to mind people who had no respect for themselves. Said he
                        had heard about "confiscation," and threats to knock him on the head for
                        going to the Richmond Convention, but he reckons they were only fooling, as
                        nobody had hit him yet. He didn't approve of confiscation and didn't believe
                        honest people did. Didn't want any of General Echols' land, wouldn't have
                        it--and there were thousands in the Confederate Army who never owned a
                        negro, and he wants none of theirs. If they (G &amp; H) would give him a
                        small piece of Mr. Garber's or Harman's he wouldn't object to it, as he had
                        worked for them. (Interrupted. Don't go back on yourself Phil?)--(Shut up,
                        you're too smart.) Rosselle continued that wages were too low, not more than
                        from $8 to $10 per month. How can a colored man, getting ten dollars per
                        month, make both ends meet, when a house or room to live in costs $12, and
                        he has to spend the balance for vituals and clothes? He thought that cut the
                        $10 right close. White people and colored, owning property, should unite
                        together and do better, and talk of confiscation would cease. Advised all
                        not to waste time talking about who you are to vote for, but to strive to
                        improve and do right--to live honestly and be good. Applause.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of Rosselle's remarks the meeting adjourned, amid cheers
                        and much laughter, but a general appearance of good feeling.</p>

                    <p>'Tis the last of three that have gone to the
                        war,<br> That have joined in the bloody strife;<br> That sprang to arms at
                        the bugle call,<br> To strike for land and life.</p>
                    <p>I called them 'round me when first it came<br> And told them of days gone
                        by;<br> When my father marched thro' shot and flame,<br> And saw the
                        Brittons fly.</p>
                    <p>I showed them the musket all rusty and red,<br> That he held in his noble
                        hand,<br> And he marched on the foe with exultant tread,<br> Then fell in
                        the bloody sand.</p>
                    <p>I said our cause was the same as then<br> That the sire must go in the
                        son,<br> And burst on the Northmen from mountain and glen,<br> 'Till our

                    <p>They went! Two fell on the battle field,<br> As
                        the sun went down in the west,<br> My name was their watchword, my love in
                        their heart,<br> As they laid them there to rest.</p>
                    <p>The third was brought home at early morn<br> With
                        a fretful light in his eye;<br> And I knew from his step, that he was weary
                        and worn,<br> That they brought him home to die.</p>
                    <p>As he drooped and pined and wasted away,<br> Till the sun of his day was
                        set--<br> His voice was in prayer as he passed away,<br> And its music
                        lingers yet.</p>
                    <p>I have yet another, my youngest boy,<br> He said he was young he knew,<br>
                        But with tears in his eyes he asked to go,<br> And be a soldier too.</p>
                    <p>My noble boy, you shall ask no more,<br> For vengeance calls you forth,<br>
                        And the battle cry and the cannons roar,<br> Still come from the Tyrant

                        slain,<br> And the green leaves fall from the forest trees,<br> Cut down

                    <p>When the Northmen come with thundering tread,<br> To pollute our sacred
                        earth,<br> To trample the graves of the loved and lost,<br> And the homes
                        that gave them birth;--</p>
                    <p>Then strike in the name of our country's God,<br> And strike for the gallant
                        dead,<br> For the sake of those who have gone to rest,<br> And those for
                        whom they've bled.</p>
                    <p>And think of me as I sit alone,<br> In the cot on the mountain side,<br>
                        Giving a prayer for my warrior boy,<br> And a tear for those who died.</p>

<b>Registration.</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The procedures for voter registration have been set. General Schofield will
                    appoint a committee consisting of an army officer and two civilians to oversee
                    registration for each county. Registers will then be appointed to each district
                    who will record names of all registered voters. Eligibility is granted after the
                    applicant takes an oath. "We bespeak for such officers of the army as are
                    detailed for this duty, and whose demeanor entitles them to the epithet of
                    'gentlemen,' a friendly consideration at the hands of the people. They will be
                    engaged in a duty which they have not sought, and in the enforcement of a law
                    for which they are in no sense responsible. We are of course aware that no
                    obstruction will be placed in the way of their office."<br>
