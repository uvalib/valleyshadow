<b>Folly</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

                    <p>Can it be possible that the 3,000,000 black people in the U. S., whose
                        ancestors were captured, as savages, by the ancestors of the 36,000,000
                        whites now living here, are such fools as to suppose the said 36,000,000 are
                        going to be bothered much longer with them? The common sense of the white
                        people says: "no, we have made fools of ourselves
                        over this matter long enough and it must be settled." We pity the colored
                        people but we can't help them, unless they help themselves, by working and
                        letting politics alone.</p>

                    political disagreements since, show that the Republic, as organized now, is a
                    failure.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The white people of the United States formed a
                        Constitution. The best talent of all sections was employed, and it has been
                        pronounced a "master piece" by the world. But, even under it, the
                        deversified interests, the local prejudices, and the evil nature of man
                        created the most terrible war of recorded time. That war has been over three
                        years and still there is no settlement of our difficulties. Is there no
                        solution, are the people of this country to be forever wrangling and
                        quarrelling? The great mass want peace and quiet, and, if there is no other
                        way to get it, they prefer a military despotism at once. The Southern white
                        people accept the fact, that this is to be one Government, but they ask a
                        fair chance in it.</p>
                    <p>We do not allude to the past, to minor issues, to slavery, the war and its
                        bloody record, or any thing that small politicians may say or do to retain
                        power and place. The great fact stares the American people in the face; that
                        their much boasted Republic is a failure; that a parcel of negroes have
                        caused trouble enough, and that it is to the interest of
                            all to settle every question, that now divides the white people, at once and forever.</p>
                    <p>How to do it is the trouble. The framers of the Constitution made provision
                        for a Convention of all the States, upon the application of two thirds. It
                        was a wise provision, the prescient of great
                        minds, and it should be used by the white people of America now. The war,
                        the present Congress, the President and all, have tried to settle the
                        questions, which divide the people of what was the United States. All have failed. Now let the people of all the
                        States, forgetting the past, call a Convention of the States and send to it
                        their best men. Let them divest themselves of all prejudice, and send to it
                        their wisest and most experienced men. If they can not settle upon a form of
                        Government, that will do justice to all, and suit this age and people, then
                        Liberty and free Government are lost. Can't we try it?</p>
                    <p>Is there honesty, is there common sense enough among the white people on this
                        continent to throw aside small politicians; to forget the past and face the
                        great issues of the day, as a mighty, free people should? We hope so but
                        fear not. We fear that the day when the Lion and the Lamb shall lie down
                        together, when the conqueror and the conquered, shall dwell together in
                        unity and peace, is far distant but, then, these
                            questions must be settled.</p>

<b>The Virginia Elections</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article calls Reconstruction a "black carnival of license, ushered in
                    by fraud, violence and meditated murder," which is transforming "heretofore
                    orderly and peaceful laborers" into "savages athirst for blood and rapine."
                    Early election results foreshadow a black majority at the Convention secured
                    allegedly by fraud and violence against conservative black voters.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the date of this writing, says the National Intelligencer, the returns of
                        the election just held in Virginia are insufficient to show with any
                        certainty how that State has voted; but we imagine a majority will be to
                        have voted for a convention, and we apprehend also a negro majority secured
                        in that body. This result was intended from the beginning; the frauds in
                        registration and appointment all show that it was a foregone conclusion. The
                        negroes appear to have generally voted as a body, and the two races were
                        pitted one against the other. The few negroes in Richmond and Lynchburg who
                        attempted to vote the Conservative ticket were at once set upon by the
                        infuriated blacks, and barely escaped with their lives, by the desperate
                        exertions of the police, aided by the Federal military. The mob of
                        blood-thirsty negro savages, whom the Radicals propose to invest with the
                        political power of this noble old Commonwealth, yielded slowly before the
                        evident determination of the military to enforce order. These latter acted
                        with much greater forbearance, we imagine, than they would have done if
                        white men had thus defied their authority, and interrupted the peaceful
                        progress of the election.</p>
                    <p>Such is "reconstruction" in Virginia--a black carnival of license, ushered in
                        by fraud, violence, and meditated murder, until things have now come to such
                        a pass, that in the capital of the State which gave us Washington,
                        Jefferson, and Madison, the cry of these demoralized blacks is not merely
                        for the property of the whites, and the blood of their own race who vote
                        independently, but for that, also, of the Northern resident who refuses to
                        endorse their Jacobin projects. Against these last Hunnicutt gives the sign,
                        and the faithful pack echo the cry, "Kill the d--n Yankee; kill him, shoot
                        him!" and the words were at once followed by an effort of the mob to
                        accomplish their murderous purpose.</p>
                    <p>Here we behold the first fruits of the "Congressional policy" of
                        reconstruction. No State has been, so far, restored to the Union; but a
                        class of, heretofore orderly and peaceful laborers, have been transformed
                        into savages athirst for blood and rapine. White men of America, how long
                        will you stand it?</p>

                    Conservative citizens must fight against the intrenched power of "the enemy"

<b>The Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Enterprise--What a Great Virginia Mind Thinks

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Clinton" writes a letter to the editors of the Valley Virginian urging
                    Augusta voters to support the county's proposal to buy $300,000 in bonds in the
                    proposed Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. The Railroad will link Covington,
                    Alleghany County, with the Ohio river, ensuring that the trade of the West will
                    pass through Augusta. With this accomplishment, Virginia can become one of the
                    greatest and most prosperous carrying states in the Union.<br>

<b>The Convention</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors urge that conservatives elected to the convention "go and do
                    the best they can. It is a hard task but that makes it all the more honorable."
                    Meanwhile, "the white people at home" should "organize thoroughly and prepare to
