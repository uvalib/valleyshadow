                <summary>This article from the Charlottesville Chronicle urges Southerners to accept
                    and make the best of Reconstruction. World history is marked by progress, and
                    not even the most committed conservatives can turn back the clock. Those who
                    respond to black suffrage by retreating from politics and placing "all things
                    into their hands" only place "the white race in irremediable ruin."</summary>

                    <p>It strikes us that the dictates of party as well as of principle, should make
                        the Southern people avoid parties at present, especially those, whose
                        mission accomplished, are certain to pass away. The old Democratic and Whig
                        parties went down, in the South, during the war; and the Republican or
                        Radical, having nearly run its race of rule and ruin, is rapidly travelling
                        the same road in the North. This is shown by every indication which reaches
                        us, as well as by the eagerness with which they seek support, for their
                        waning power, among the hated "rebels" South. The Southern people, white and
                        black, are now anxiously looked to by the dead and dying political
                        organizations North, as the "cats" whose "paws" shall draw out a few
                        "chestnuts" from the public toasting house for them. Have the hard lessons
                        of the past been learned to so little purpose, and was the scorching our
                        fingers received, at this little game, so pleasant, that we should again
                        gratify the insatiable appetites of these political "monkies" at so great a
                        cost?</p>
                    <p>Parties in the South, with the exception of a minority in favor of the
                        enforced Union, too small to effect the result or exert any influence, good
                        or bad, died during the war. Whig and Democrat, original Union men and
                        Secessionists, union men and fighters in the Union, stood shoulder to
                        shoulder in defense of their rights and buried all political differences
                        forever in the graves of their comrades. The surrender found all true
                        Southern men, especially the soldiery, standing together, with saddened and
                        almost broken hearts, but hopeful of the future regeneration of their
                        country, by hard labor. Who were their friends; who their enemies, what
                        party deserved credit for the deep damnation of our taking off, they never
                        asked, for they had made prisoners of soldiers belonging to every party
                        North, and had found all united in fighting for our overthrow. With this
                        knowledge, gained by no "royal" or "loyal" road, they went to work, relying
                        principally on their paroles and the honor of the soldiers of the U. S. Army
                        to protect them. And nobly have they stuck to it, regardless of parties or
                        politicians of promises, threats or bribes. What has been done is only an
                        earnest of the future material prosperity of the South, when her people,
                        prosperous and happy as in the halcyon days of past, will bless the hands
                        that worked and the heads and hearts that avoided parties and politics.</p>
                    <p>And what have these parties done that we should aid either? President Johnson
                        tried his hand at "reconstructing" us, beginning by ordering the Southern
                        people to do certain things. Old politicians looked cheerful, visions of the
                        good old days of fat offices and nothing to do, enspired them to emulate the
                        fulsome eloquence of other days, in heralding his "magnanimity." He was the
                        "great reconstructor"--the "second Washington"--"our noble friend, Andy of
                        Tennessee" and all that. What if he did ask us to do 'rough things'--it was
                        all for the best--Andrew '<emph rend="italic">Jackson</emph>' Johnson would
                        surely "win." The South accepted his plan, as a matter of course, nearly
                        everybody being busy working and desiring peace. And it didn't take us long
                        to fix matters up accordingly. We had Congressmen, Senators, Governors and
                        Legislators, but "where are they?" Mr. Johnson, with the best intentions, no
                        doubt, failed to carry the North for his policy and alas! Congress succeeds
                        to come in with a "Constitutional Amendment," asking the South to unite in
                        her own degradation. It was rejected, as it should have been by an honest
                        people. Then Congress concluded to force matters, and hence the military
                        bill of abominations, we are now forced to act under. It leaves us, as a
                        people, no option--but it leaves us our honor and a hope of saving our local
                        governments, all that is left. With devilish ingenuity it is contrived so as
                        to make it appear that a powerless people <emph rend="italic">approve</emph>
                        of its measures, and to aid in forcing a Radical party into existence in our
                        midst. The Democrats, or Conservatives, or whatever you call them, North
                        headed by Johnson, are powerless to help us, if they would--they are looking
                        to us for help. He is enforcing this very law--the "second Washington"
                        places a military Governor over the mother and children of the "Father of
                        his Country." In short one party North can't help us and the other <emph
                            rend="italic">won't</emph>, while both wish to use us in the next
                        Presidential election. Between their experiments we have had a hard time,
                        recovering from the wreck and ruin, inflicted by both, and we can see but
                        one path to follow.</p>
                    <p>The Richmond Riot; the natural result of recent incendiary appeals to the
                        negroes, should teach us a useful lesson. This riot may be but 'the
                        beginning of the end' of a war of races, which should find every white man,
                        no matter what his former politics may have been, standing up squarely for
                        his race. It should tell us the only road to follow--the only path of
                        safety. It is to submit to the Congressional plan as we did to Johnson's,
                        but have no party organizations dividing true men in the South. We have no
                        friends, with honorable exceptions, North, except from interest, and we
                        should tie our faith and hopes to no party or set of men. We are powerful as
                        long as we stick together and, in spite of everything, will yet be the
                        balance of power in the United States. We are nothing, hardly a decent
                        "cat's paw" when we divide into parties. This present strife and trouble
                        must pass away, and the South will again become rich and powerful by the
                        energy, endurance and devotion of her children, even if emigration does not
                        rapidly fill our land with skilled labor and capital. Such a race inhabiting
                        the most productive country in the world can not be long kept down, when
                        their whole energies are devoted to its material development. It behooves
                        us, then, while taking proper action to protect ourselves, under the
                        Military Bill, to see that we are deceived into no "entangling alliances"
                        and have no old parties or politicians weighing us down in the new race for
                        life we have just entered upon. There are grand problems to be worked out;
                        mighty issues soon to come before the people of this Continent--issues that
                        will overwhelm all parties and powers now existing. Let us work--let us
                        watch--let us <emph rend="italic">act</emph> so that we may be prepared to
                        play our part well in the grand future that is before us.</p>

                    <p>In spite of the dismal croaking of the overwise, the Ladies' Memorial
                        Association persisted in carrying out their intention of "paying a fitting
                        tribute to the memory of Stonewall Jackson and his fallen braves," and right
                        noble did the people of our grand old County second their efforts.
                        Preparations were commenced on Thursday, by appointing Col. J. B. Baldwin,
                        Chief Marshall; Col. B. Christian, Major, Hall and Garber, Captains,
                        Balthis, Waters, Bumgardner, Harrison, Berkeley and Hanger, Assistants. The
                        ladies from the County, contributed evergreens and flowers, and from the
                        mountains came a car load by the evening train. Thursday night the young
                        ladies and gentlemen of the town met at the Town Hall, and prepared wreaths,
                        crosses, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Friday morning was cloudy, but nothing daunted, the people commenced pouring
                        in. By 11 o'clock the Methodist Church was crowded, to listen to Colonel
                        O'Ferrall's address, which we regret our inability to publish this week. It
                        was a grand effort, worthy of the man and the occasion and added to the
                        already high reputation of the Speaker. His beautiful tributes to the
                        gallant dead of our town brought tears to many eyes. The speaker was loudly
                        applauded throughout, and hundreds who could not get in the Church went away
                        disappointed. The meeting was opened with prayer by Rev. Mr. Baker. Col.
                        Christian delivered a short address introducing Col. O'Ferrall.</p>
                    <p>The Procession was formed at 12 o'clock by Chief Marshall Baldwin, assisted
                        by his Aids, in the following order:<lb/> The Stonewall Band<lb/> The D. D.
                        &amp; B. Institution Band<lb/> The Clergy<lb/> The Press<lb/>
                        Confederate Soldiers<lb/> The Fire Companies--The Augusta and the D. D.
                        &amp; Blind<lb/> The Female Schools<lb/> Male Schools<lb/> Ladies<lb/>
                        Citizens Generally<lb/> Carriages and Mounted Men.</p>
                    <p>In this order, to the solemn music of the Stonewall Band, the procession 1
                        1/2 miles long, moved to the Cemetery. The appearance of the procession,
                        winding up the circular walks of Thornrose Cemetery, and extending as far
                        back as the eye could reach, was grandly beautiful. The bright uniforms of
                        the Fire Companies, the ladies enveloped in flowers, the children and the
                        numerous colored people on each side formed a picture worthy of the "sacred
                        day" that caused the gathering. At the Cemetery, the procession was marched
                        under an arch having the following beautiful inscription:--<lb/> "How sleep
                        the brave who sink to rest,<lb/> By all their country's wishes blest"--<lb/>
                        and around the various walks, until all were filled. Then the Bands at the
                        same time playing a solemn dirge, the graves of our loved and honored dead
                        were strewn with flowers and watered with the tears of the fair women for
                        whom they died. An hour was spent in this holy work. The procession then
                        moved back to town; the Fire Companies were escorted to their engine house
                        and--the sad, mournfully pleasant duties of the day were ended.</p>
                    <p>Nothing occurred to mar the harmony and good order of the occasion. At eleven
                        o'clock all business was suspended in the town, the stores and work shops
                        were closed and numbers of the colored people ceased their labor to follow
                        the procession. At least 2,000 persons were in the procession and hundreds
                        were kept from attending by the threatening appearance of the weather. It is
                        a singular coincidence that it was just such a day as the 10th of '66. The
                        Heavens seem to be draped in mourning, until the sacred services were over,
                        when the sun broke forth with unusual splendor, as if Providence smiled upon
                        the work that was just finished.</p>

                    Institute auditorium. The concert "convinced even the most skeptical that

                    to "raise the standard of musical taste in the Valley." The editors assert that

                    modesty; that the gentlemen were rather bashful at first but, encouraged by the
