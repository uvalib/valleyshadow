<b>The Conquerors and the Conquered</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial argues that the Radical Republicans are using their control
                    of Congress and the military to impose a military despotism upon the country.
                    Since they cannot hold power legitimately, they will use the powers and rights
                    surrendered to them during the war to perpetuate their rule.<br>

                    <p>The Earl of Chatham proclaimed in the British Parliament, very near a century
                        ago, "that three million Anglo-Saxon Americans, fighting for their
                        independence and rights, as free born men, once over-powered and conquered
                        and held down by military force, would be sufficient, when wielded by
                        despotic power, to crush the liberties of the rest of the British empire."</p>
                    <p>His profound observation is likely to be soon confirmed in the history of the
                        American Republic. The stronger section of the Union, wielding the whole
                        power of the common government, succeeded in crushing, by arms, the
                        aspirations of the weaker section for independence and self-government. In
                        order to carry out their arduous undertaking, the Northern people(for the
                        time only, as they fondly supposed,) consented to surrender their liberties
                        into the keeping of the government at Washington.</p>
                    <p>The war has closed--the North has conquered, the South lies prostrate and
                        helpless at the feet of the government. The Radical party, which assumes to
                        be the government, is fast drawing full power of the State and people toward
                        the Central Despotism, which despotism it is determined at all hazards to
                        control in its own interests. This despotic action became restive and
                        alarmed the shadow of the despotism which held the South in subjection to
                        the North; the signs of the times indicates only that a huge majority of the
                        citizens of the Northern States will be [unclear] approaching general
                        election [unclear] the party in power. But the people of the original free
                        States will bestow the officials of the Electoral College and in the hall of
                        Congress, with the overwhelming powers which they have confided to the
                        Central Despotism, for the purpose of crushing the liberties of the South.
                        The vote of fourteen Southern States; for Kentucky and Maryland will
                        inevitably meet the fate of their Southern Sisters, which they hoped to
                        avoid by "loyalty" to "the old flag," together with the minority vote of the
                        North, which will likely be cast for the Radicals, will give that
                        unscrupulous party another four years leave of power, and less time than
                        that will suffice for their reckless boldness and energy to complete their
                        scheme of despotism for the whole country.</p>
                    <p>We may be considered visionary in these prognostications, but no careful and
                        candid observer of the times can doubt that this is the programme. By
                        disfranchisement of the whites and enfranchisement of the negroes, the
                        Radicals expect to use the whole influence of the South to consolidate and
                        perpetuate the power of their party, in spite of the protests of the North;
                        or in other words to use the conquered to subdue the conquerors.</p>
                    <p>In an able article, that sterling journal the National Intelligencer, well
                        and truly says: "The programme is plainly developed. There is not space in a
                        single article to comment on it; but it is but simply this; The Radical
                        party managers, foreseeing their loss of political power in the Northern
                        States, are preparing to make up their losses by the means of a military
                        despotism in the South. Fearing the influence of the Border States, they
                        have determined to reduce Kentucky and Maryland, to begin with, to the same
                        status as the ten Southern States hitherto subjected to Radical military
                        control. Having by fraud and violence, by the outrageous disfranchisement of
                        white voters, and the fraudulent manipulation of the negro vote, secured to
                        themselves the political power of the twelve, and with Tennessee, thirteen
                        States, they would be ready to deal [section unclear]. [Section unclear]from
                        New York and Pennsylvania and Indiana, and other Northern States will be
                        subjected to precisely the same process as that already applied to Kentucky,
                        and soon to be applied to Maryland.</p>
                    <p>Thus military despotism, with all its attendant frauds and outrages, will be
                        extended over State after State throughout the whole Union. This is what is
                        in store for the deluded and betrayed people of the loyal Northern and
                        Western States. Their loyalty and their rights under the Constitution are to
                        be measured only by their allegiance to the Radical revolutionary
                    cabal."</p>

                    <p>We have before us a private letter post marked Spring Hill, June 29th, from
                        an officer, distinguished and trusted by our people during the war, now
                        devoting himself to practical "reconstruction" on his farm in Tennessee. It
                        furnishes, in his peculiar way, points of so great interest that we feel it
                        our duty to take the liberty of giving them to the public. he says: "The
                        darkeys here are doing remarkably well, in spite of the most persistent
                        efforts on the part of fanatics and Radicals to make them troublesome. They
                        are getting up 'Loyal Leagues,' and all sorts of abominations, to place them
                        in opposition to their old owners, but so far, without success. The blacks
                        join the processions and seem much flattered by the speeches &amp;c.;
                        sing patriotic songs, and roar at the jokes but have been industrious and
                        obedient thus far. I have tried to catch a cunning old horse, who would eat
                        the ear of corn, but, on sight of the bridle, would suddenly recollect some
                        good grass in another part of the field." This is decidedly the best
                        illustration of the "negro question" we have seen, and the Radicals will
                        appreciate it, when they "show the bridle."</p>

<b>Who are to Blame?</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Examiner puts the blame for the people's want of interest in registering,
                        in the right places. But then the people should find new leaders, and
                        recollect that the great revolution left their old ones five hundred miles
                        behind the age. It says:</p>
                    <p>"But the general and deplorable apathy which prevails in this State is due,
                        we are ashamed to say, to the unpardonable interests of those leaders to
                        whom the masses have heretofore looked for instruction. Eloquent men, where
                        voices have again and again aroused the people upon ordinary political
                        occasions, have been silent at this crisis in the fate of the white race in
                        Virginia, and yet, if the State is wrested from us by this trick of
                        registration, these gentlemen will be the heaviest sufferers from the very
                        calamity which they might have averted.</p>
                    <p>There is no section of the State where the people would not turn out en masse if they were properly aroused. In a county
                        near this city, where the blacks greatly outnumbered the whites, a talented
                        and eloquent gentleman delivered an address to the people in one of the
                        magisterial districts, where it was believed the blacks would have
                        outnumbered the whites in registration, two or three to one. In that
                        district the registration has since taken place, and, to the surprise of
                        all, the white has equalled the black population. And this is in a district
                        where there were many more blacks than whites!</p>
                    <p>We mean in this to show, that by the lightest effort of the thirty or forty
                        thousand majority which we have in the State might readily be induced to
                        register and vote. A single speech in each magisterial district will do the
                        work, and if there are not workers enough in the State to do it, we deserve
                        to be defeated."</p>

                        A press, licentious and subsidized on the one hand, and gagged and
                        suppressed on the other. A country, once governed by a Constitution and
                        laws, now given over to the reckless and despotic will of the mob which
                        happens to be in power. A Union declared by its founder to be "perpetual,"

                        pauperism. A military supremacy, which rivals and puts to shame the
                        "tottering and effete Despotisms" of the old world. A national debt, in

                        its accumulation, all other national debts sink to insignificance. A

                        The "old familiar voice" of the Stonewall Band welcomed the crowd and gave
                        promise of the enjoyment before us. The Committee of Arrangements, headed by
                        the indefatigable and indispensable, John M. Harly, had made ample
                        preparations for the accommodation of all, and the train was soon speeding
                        its way westward, the cheers of the "boys," at everything and everybody on
                        the road, enlivening the way and making one think of the troop trains of
                        other days. At Swoope's Depot a slight accident occurred, which was soon
                        remedied by our pleasant Conductor, Capt. B. G. Warthen. The thirty minutes
                        stay there gave several lazy, nosyly married men, who got up too late for
                        breakfast in Staunton, an opportunity to enjoy a good breakfast at the
                        hospitable table of Mrs. Jacob Dull, over which streak of luck they bragged
                        all day. At nine the train arrived at Goshen, where the party was welcomed
                        by Mr. H. A. Goodloe, Proprietor, and soon every one was made comfortable
                        and felt at home. Some went fishing, others rolled ten-pins, while the
                        majority tripped the "light fantastic toe" to the music of Coleman's String
                        Band. A number of ladies and gentlemen, from the neighborhood, joined the
                        party, and showed it every attention. In the evening, after repeated calls,
                        Y. Howe Peyton, Esq., delivered a spirited and telling address. He was
                        followed by other gentlemen, after which the party took the cars and
                        returned to Staunton, by 8 o'clock, P. M.</p>
                    <p>Taking it, all in all, this excursion was successful beyond the anticipations
                        of the most sanguine. Nothing occurred to disturb the enjoyment of any one
                        present and the best order was observed by all. The party are under many
                        obligations to Mr. Goodloe for his untiring exertions to render the day
                        pleasant. His house was open, his table supplied with everything desirable
                        and his servants all attention. To fully appreciate an excursion of this
                        kind, where every one feels at home and everybody is agreeable, a person
                        must be a part of it. No detailed account can give anything like an idea of
                        it. Staunton may well be proud of her Fire Companies, her Stonewall Band,
                        and the representative ladies who honored the excursionists with their
                        presence. May an hundred more glorious Fourths find that joyous party
                        assembled at "Goshen on the [unclear]."</p>
