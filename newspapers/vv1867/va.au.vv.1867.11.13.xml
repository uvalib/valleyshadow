                    <p>The tremendous reaction in the North, against the whole policy of the Radical
                        party, has astounded even the most sanguine. It dumfounds the Radicals and
                        they are searching about for reasons, like blind men in strange countries.
                        Our extracts, from the leading Northern papers are so full, that it leaves
                        us little space for comment on "what it means?" But we believe the cause of
                        the reaction North may be summed up in a few words: It means that the mass
                        of the Northern people have decided that this is a "White Man's Government;"
                        that 4,050,000 negroes have caused trouble enough in this country, and that
                        they must accept their position, as laborers, protected in all their rights,
                        or leave the country, as the Indians did. It means that the masses North,
                        who gave their lives, and blood and money, for the privilege of settling
                        this fair Southern land, are not to be baulked by the negroes and mean
                        whites in that desire. It means that the passions of the war are dying out,
                        and that Northern <emph rend="italic">white men</emph> will not allow
                        Southern <emph rend="italic">white men</emph> to be ground down by an
                        inferior race. In the words of the Charlottesville Chronicle, it means
                        "Nationality, Re-union, Reconciliation, <emph rend="italic">Negro
                            Subordination</emph>."</p>
                    <p>While we bid our people be of good cheer, and rejoice with them over the
                        changed face of affairs, we must still caution prudence and, above all,
                            <emph rend="italic">united action</emph>. The great necessity is the
                        unity of all the Conservative elements of the State and a perfect
                        organization. That we hope the Convention to meet, December 11th, in
                        Richmond, will give us. Each and every true man must lay aside all
                        prejudice, and work for the one great object; the defeat of "Hunnicut and
                        his set,"--the honor and welfare of Old Virginia.</p>
                    <p>A Convention of the people of Augusta is called for the next County Court,
                        Nov. 25th. Let the solid men of the County turn out and let us send our
                        ablest men to the State Conservative Convention. It is no time to talk; to
                        wrangle over the past. We are all in the same ship, freighted with the
                        hopes, the treasures, the interests of unborn millions of <emph
                            rend="italic">white</emph> Virginians. The "black flag" has been
                        defiantly thrown out, and Virginia expects every true son to do his
                    duty.</p>

                <summary>This editorial asserts that recent defeats for the Republicans in northern
                    elections prove that most northerners are in favor of a "white man's
                    government." Blacks must accept subordination and their role as laborers while
                    northern and southern whites reconcile.</summary>

                    Republican program, the legalization of black suffrage in all the states, has
                    not yet passed. The editors predict difficulty in achieving that goal.</summary>

                    The question was decided in the affirmative. The next meeting will discuss
                    whether or not Noah's flood was "universal," with Hotchkiss and Peyton arguing
                    in the affirmative and Taylor and Harrison in the negative.</summary>
