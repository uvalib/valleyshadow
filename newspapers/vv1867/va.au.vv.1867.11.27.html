<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Last Monday the people of Augusta were called upon to assemble in mass
                        meeting, to organize the Conservative element of this county, and appoint
                        delegates to the Conservative State Convention to meet Dec. 11th in the city
                        of Richmond. Right nobly did they respond to the call. We have never seen a
                        larger or more respectable body of the representative men of Augusta
                        together, and they manifested a lively appreciation of the important duties
                        before them. An interest that gave an earnest of thorough work at the next
                        election. The old leaders of the people came out and their presence and
                        speeches convinced the most skeptical that every thing depended on thorough
                        organization, and a united front against the demon of Radicalism.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Col. Bolivar Christian, Wm. M. Tate, Esq., was offered the
                        Chair. On motion of Major Marshall Hanger, the editors of the Staunton
                        papers were appointed Secretaries.</p>
                    <p>Col. Christian explained the object of the meeting, and moved that the
                        Chairman, and four others to be appointed by the chair, constitute a
                        committee to select twenty delegates and the same number of alternates to
                        represent this district in the Conservative Convention to assemble in
                        Richmond on the 11th of December. This motion was adopted, whereupon the
                        Chair appointed Col. Bolivar Christian, Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, Col. John B.
                        Baldwin and Richard Mausy to constitute the committee.</p>
                    <p>Capt. James Bumgardner forcibly referred to the necessity of organization by
                        the Conservatives of the State to bring out a full vote. He proposed the
                        appointment of a Central Committee of 25 for the county, with Committees in
                        each Magisterial District.</p>
                    <p>Col. George Baylor said he had changed his mind on the affairs of the
                        country, and dwelt at length on his attempts to register. He was refused,
                        not because he was a member of the Secession Convention but because he had
                        been a Corporation Magistrate. He took an appeal and he had never heard from
                        it since. He could not vote; was not free. He wanted yet to be free; he
                        wanted to be re-instated--he wanted his rights under the law, even as it was
                        under the Congressional plan. We ought to be ready, every one of us, to
                        defeat the Constitution to be formed by the Radicals. Every man in Augusta
                        should register and be prepared to vote it down. Can we expect to live under
                        such things, when 600,000 negroes are enfranchised, and whites are
                        disfranchised? It can't last. Such a state of things can't last, if every
                        man will do his duty, in a county like this.</p>
                    <p>Judge Kenney here presented a resolution to add the members of the Committee
                        to the list of delegates to the Convention. He expressed his hearty approval
                        of the proceedings, and urged prompt action.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Bumgardner's motion came up. Col. John B. Baldwin objected to the
                        number (25) and suggested 40, one Superintendent for the whole county, and
                        one for each magisterial district. He elaborated upon the benefits of the
                        policy of organizing in squads of ten, and most forcibly urged its adoption
                        all over the State. Capt. Bumgardner accepted Col. B's amendment and it was
                        adopted.</p>
                    <p>[unclear] the Hon. A. H. H. Stuart said: It had not been his purpose to utter
                        a word in reference to the matter now before the meeting, but as the
                        gentlemen who had spoken had confined themselves exclusively to the specific
                        propositions which had been submitted, he felt impelled to say a few words
                        on the general subject now under consideration. He was afraid that the
                        people had not been sufficiently awakened to the magnitude of the issues now
                        before the country, and their deep personal interest in them. This was
                        manifest from the fact--the shameful fact--that more than two thousand of
                        the intelligent registered voters of Augusta had failed to attend the polls.
                        The effect of this apathy had been to endanger the success of the
                        conservative candidates. Heretofore when political events had taken place in
                        Virginia, they were in regard to the choice of men who were to administer
                        the government under the Constitution, and in reference to mere questions of
                        administrative policy. But now far more important issues demanded the notice
                        of the people. The question now presented for decision of the people
                        affected not merely the policy of administration, but the very existence and
                        peace of civil society. A wicked attempt is now made by an unscrupulous
                        party in violation of the Constitution and of every obligation held sacred
                        among men, to subvert the whole structure of our institutions, and to invert
                        the position of the elements of which it is composed. It has always been
                        received as an axiom in politics, that the virtue and intelligence of the
                        constituent body were the only safe foundation on which free government
                        could rest. The stability of all representative republican governments
                        depends on the amount of those qualities professed by those entrusted with
                        the election franchise. The effort now is to disregard this cardinal
                        principle, and to sink the virtue and intelligence of the country and bring
                        its ignorance and vice to the surface, as the controlling power of the
                        government. He need not describe the consequences of such a process. All
                        must see that the results would be the utter overthrow of all securities for
                        life, liberty, and property. [unclear] knowledge of these facts the dominant
                        party in Congress, not having the fear of God before their eyes, but
                        produced by the instigation of the Devil--in violation of the obligations of
                        the Constitution--of the sanctity of official oaths--and of their duty to
                        their fellow men were persistently seeking to fasten upon us degradation and
                        ruin.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart then dwelt ably on the duty of every one to use every effort in
                        his power to avert from [unclear] and fearful [unclear]. [unclear] was
                        allowed to register, owed to himself, to his family, to his friends and to
                        his country, to register. [unclear] failed to do so was false to his
                        country--false to his race--false to the principle of freedom and to every
                        obligation of position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart said he had never been the advocate of universal suffrage even
                        when suffrage was confined to white men. He thought George Mason stated the
                        true principle in the Virginia Bill of Rights, when he limited it to those
                        who had a permanent interest in and common attachment to the community. But
                        if such limitations were proper, then how much more so are they now, when a
                        new element, so potent for mischief, and so ignorant of the practical
                        bearings of all political questions, was introduced into our political
                        community.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart said that slavery was forever dead in
                        the United States, and he doubted if there was a single man in the sound of
                        his voice, who would be willing to have it re-established. All are ready to
                        treat it as a thing of the past, and he believed that all were disposed to
                        treat the negro race fairly and kindly. For himself, he entertained and
                        always had cherished, the kindest feelings for them. He had sought to do his
                        duty by those who had been his slaves, and he believed they cherished for
                        him the kindest sentiments. Since their emancipation they had not hesitated
                        to apply to him for such favors as they needed, and he was happy to accord
                        them. He believed that if the negroes had been let alone they would have got
                        on in harmony with the whites. But mischievous and designing men had been
                        sent among them, to deceive and mislead them. The recent elections showed
                        that they had been successful. It was natural that those ignorant and
                        confiding people should be misled. He was not disposed to deal harshly with
                        them for this error. It was not their fault, but that of the knaves who
                        deceived and betrayed them. But the time was now at hand when the colored
                        people must decide, with their eyes open, what their future course would be.
                        If they persisted in arraying themselves against the southern whites, they
                        must take the consequences of their folly. They certainly were intelligent
                        enough to know who were their best friends. They could decide who fed and
                        clothed and sustained them. They knew they got all their employment from the
                        people of the South, and not of the North. If they would go North, they
                        would find how they are treated there, and how they would be excluded from
                        factories and from most all the profitable avocations of life. In this
                        connection are referred to the attempts of the son in law of Fred. Douglas
                        to run a hack in Rochester, when his hack was broken up and his personal
                        safety endangered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart then referred to the falsehood of the allegation that the people
                        of the North were willing to confer the elective franchise, and other
                        political rights on the negroes. In refutation of this he referred to the
                        50,000 majorities in Ohio and New York against the proposition and
                        proportionate majorities in other States.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart said he had always been satisfied that Abolitionism was not the
                        offspring of any kind feeling to the negro. He believed it had its birth in
                        hostility to the whites of the South, in part, but in a larger degree to the
                        cupidity of the North. The population of the North was overcrowded. Access
                        to the great West was now difficult. They wanted an outlet in the South;
                        they wanted the profits of the employments now pursued by the negroes; they
                        wanted to get rid of the negroes, that they might get their places. In a
                        word, the Northern hive is ready to swarm, and they wish to occupy and
                        possess our goodly heritage. He had long believed that this was the true
                        philosophy of Abolitionism, but it was only lately that it had been openly
                        avowed. Heretofore there had been a flimsy veil of humanity thrown over it,
                        but recently all disguise had been thrown off, and it is acknowledged that
                        Abolitionism was founded in hostility to the negro. In proof of this, Mr.
                        Stuart referred to the celebrated Helper Book--The Impending Crisis--which
                        contained the most elaborated and vigorous assault on slavery that had ever
                        been published. This book was considered so important that it was endorsed
                        and commended to public favor by a large majority of northern members of
                        Congress, and by a larger portion of the northern press.</p>
                    <p>That work has done its office. Slavery has been abolished. That was the first
                        act in the drama and now the curtain rises on the second. Helper, the
                        accredited organ of the Abolition party is now out with a second book,
                        called by the fantastic title of "Nojeque." The very first sentence in this
                        second book is substantially as follows--"If I were to say that my object in
                        writing this book is not merely to write the negro out of the United States,
                        but out of existence, would be simple God's truth." And, in a recent
                        publication by Helper in the National Intelligencer, he says his great
                        object is to drive the negro out of the country by colonization or
                        extermination. He says, in substance, that as long as the negroes were cared
                        for and protected by intelligent and influential masters, it was impossible
                        to displace or remove them. But now that they are deprived of that
                        protection, the work is of easy accomplishment.</p>
                    <p>Here, said Mr. Stuart, is a frank avowal of the truth. Here is the whole
                        story. The object was to get the negro out of the country. To effect this
                        the protection of the master must be withdrawn. The attack could not be made
                        successfully in front where the masters were defended by the Constitution,
                        and the negroes shielded by the master. Abolitionism was a flank movement on
                        the negro. It was intended to cut the cord which bound him to his master,
                        and secured for him the protection of the master. It was intended to cut
                        turn him loose on the community, friendless and helpless, where he would
                        readily fall a victim to the knavish designs of his pretended friends. This
                        has been done, and now the cry for colonization comes from Helper and his
                        associates. Drive the negro out to make room for the hungry hordes of the
                        North. The people of the South have not yet responded to this appeal. The
                        next step is to array the negroes against the whites of the South and thus
                        provoke a collision of races. If they are finally successful in this, then
                        the negroes will be without friends, South or North, and there will be one
                        general, simultaneous movement of the whites North and South, to get rid of
                        the whole race, and removal or extermination must close the drama. The
                        colored people should be made to understand the true condition of things,
                        and if they then choose to rush madly on their fate, they must bear the
                        consequences of their own folly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart urged activity and organization for the coming struggle. He held
                        that it was important that every man should regard it his duty to see active
                        means to have every registered voter at the polls. The issues were almost as
                        important as those of life or death. Those who failed to do their duty now,
                        deserved the penalty inflicted on deserters in the face of an enemy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart said that after the war there was a general and prudent desire on
                        the part of property holders to avail themselves of amenities and pardon so
                        as to avoid confiscation. He was one of those who never feared there would
                        be a general confiscation by Congress. But he did believe there was serious
                        danger of what was substantially confiscation, by enormous taxation under
                        State authority now. Those who owned no property would wield the power. They
                        would bear no share of the burden of taxation, but would reap all the
                        profits, and they would levy taxes with a heavy hand, until people would be
                        obliged to sell their lands to [unclear] on them for [unclear] on the system
                        of taxation [section unclear].</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart touched on other topics which we [section unclear] not appeal to
                        every man present not only to ponder all that he had said, but to bear his
                        admonitions along to every neighborhood and to [unclear] at one last
                        earnest, [unclear] and patriotic effort to ensure our beloved state from the
                        degradation and ruin with which she is threatened.</p>
                    <p>Col. Baldwin, being called upon, amusingly alluded to his being
                        disfranchised. He had almost begun to feel himself "out of the ring," but
                        would try and show them how things looked to a "man up a tree." He concurred
                        in Mr. Stuart's remarks. He believed the ultimate, and intended, result
                        would be a war of races, unless we could unite
                        and vote the Constitution to be made, down. Every white man owed it to his
                        race and color, to come forward now, register and vote it down. He had the
                        kindest feelings for the negro. He spoke as a friend of "Cuffee"--he liked
                        him in his place, and he wished it distinctly understood that he looked
                        forward to a war of races with no pleasure. He urged, as a friend of the
                        negro, that we should vote down the Constitution to be framed, keep the
                        negro in his proper place and save his throat from being cut. In a struggle
                        between the races, this is the inevitable result. All of his former slaves
                        still lived with him as their best friend. He illustrated the difference
                        between the issue now and in 1861. Then, if such an issue had been placed
                        before us there would have been no division among our people, and there
                        would never have been a surrender. He fitly chastised "mean whites" who are
                        leading the poor negro to destruction, and urged the kindest treatment of
                        the latter by our people. A man who wouldn't register and vote now should be
                        looked upon as worse than a "deserter" during the war--with scorn by every
                        decent member of society, but language failed in attempting to describe the
                        white fellows who voted with negroes against his race. He told the people of
                        the danger of not voting--of giving away to apathy, and concluded, that if
                        the white people rally as they should, in Virginia, the State is safe.</p>
                    <p>Col. Jas. H. Skinner being loudly called for fully endorsed Messrs. Stuart
                        and Baldwin's views. He urged the kindest treatment to the negroes. He did
                        not blame the negro for anything he had done, so far. It was the work of
                        designing white men, &amp;c.</p>
