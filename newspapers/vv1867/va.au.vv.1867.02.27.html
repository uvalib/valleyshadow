<b>A Few Plain Facts</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial argues that the North, not the South, has violated the terms
                    of the surrender at Appomattox by passing the Military Reconstruction Bill. The
                    South is in the right, and has thus far lived up to its pledge, as well as all
                    the other requirements imposed by Congress. The only way to resist radical
                    reconstruction and regain political rights lies in a unified effort at restoring
                    material prosperity to the South.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Truth never dies and, disguise them as you please, facts will make themselves known in spite of everything, so long as
                        the press is free. Our people are now exercising themselves over the last
                        bills of Congress and never look at the past. Some are even so unthinking as
                        to blame the Southern press for all the ills and oppressions showered on us
                        by the Radicals. They say "the papers did it" and never recollect that the
                        press stood up for their rights when every other channel of thought was
                        closed; they forget that the much abused "newspaper" is merely an expression
                        of their sentiments; of the thoughts and feelings of the great mass of the
                        Southern people; the defender of their rights and the recorder of their past
                        heroism. It stands in the front from day to day and fearlessly gives
                        expression to the sentiments of a people. There may be evils in the press,
                        still, the good overbalances them.</p>
                    <p>But to the facts, the truth of history which timid people should not forget
                        and the brave ponder over. The Military bill, which we publish to-day, may
                        be enforced and an odious tyranny forced upon a disarmed people. At present
                        we cannot resist it, but it is consoling to know and feel we are in the
                            right; that nothing we, as a people, have
                        done since the surrender at Appomatox Court-House, gives the mob at
                        Washington the slightest shadow of an excuse for the cowardly blows they
                        strike us. On the 9th of April, 1865, General Lee surrendered. The terms of
                        that surrender were simple: The soldiers were given a written parole, which
                        said they, in consideration of their pledge, not to take up arms, were
                        "permitted to return to their homes and remain unmolested and undisturbed."
                        The faith of the U. S. Government; the honor of its armies was pledged to
                        keep this compact inviolate. This Military bill violates that pledge, for it
                        "molests and disturbs us." Next, Andrew Johnson, President of the United
                        States, offered Amnesty and restoration to all rights, on condition of
                        taking a prescribed oath. It was taken and has been kept in good faith. Then
                        we were asked to elect members to Congress; to reorganize our States, by
                        legally abolishing slavery; to repudiate just debts, &amp;c. Those
                        things were done, bitter as the pills were to swallow. The laws have been
                        obeyed; the Freedmen protected; our part of the contract faithfully carried
                        out, and we see the result of our faithful obedience to the laws of the
                        United States, in the bill which has just passed Congress.</p>
                    <p>These are plain facts, patent to every one and they can not be too often
                        repeated; for in the "hurly-burly" of such times as these, men are apt to
                        give even the right away for expediency. Never did the Southern people need
                        all their native manhood; all their pride of character so much as now. And
                        their course is simple. We must endure the evils inflicted on us by a base
                        and cowardly foe, and work out of our troubles.
                        Material prosperity will bring political independence. We are poor and
                        abused now, but we have a climate; a soil and resources such as no people
                        ever had, and we must hold to them. Our position
                        is strong for it is right, and the right must
                        prevail in the end. We have faced too many horrors and endured too much, to
                        despond or give back now. Look up! labor with head and hands; be charitable
                        to one another, press no man; all work together and for one grand object,
                        the practical independence of the South, and the day is not far distant when
                        we can bid defiance to the most accursed tyranny ever endured by a brave but
                        unfortunate people.</p>

<b>The Military Bill</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This excerpt from the Richmond Times points out that under the new Military
                    Bill, Virginia cannot "avoid almost immediate negro equality at the ballot-box."
                    The article urges lawyers to challenge the bill in the Supreme Court, the only
                    "refuge" for the white South.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Richmond Times truly says: "If this bill becomes a law, at the Virginia
                        elections, in May next, for Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Attorney General
                        and members of the General Assembly, every male negro in
                            Virginia above the age of twenty-one will be entitled to vote. Nor are
                            we permitted to allow this election to go by default, for the Alexandria
                            Constitution provides that these elections shall take place in May
                        next. We are denied the privilege of seeking refuge in a purely
                        military despotism by the abolition of this provisional government, for it
                        rests with the Federal Government, and not with ourselves, to determine
                        whether this State government shall be continued or abolished.</p>
                    <p>Whether, therefore, we adopt the "constitutional amendment," with negro
                        suffrage, and Constitutional representation "annexed," or prefer to continue
                        as we are, we cannot, if SHERMAN's bill becomes a law, avoid almost
                        immediate negro equality at the ballot-box.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandria Constitution says we shall have
                        certain elections in the spring, and the SHERMAN bill says that, at those
                        elections, all male negroes twenty-one years of age shall be allowed to
                        vote.</p>
                    <p>We lose no time in pointing out to our readers the horns of the dilemma upon
                        which this bill impales us. It allows no refuge from negro suffrage, and
                        there is no escape except through the agency of the Supreme Court.</p>
                    <p>The monstrous features of this bill should at once receive the attention of
                        the ablest lawyers of the General Assembly, and steps should be taken to
                        have it brought under the fire of the Supreme Court where it will be
                        thoroughly demolished."</p>

                        but meet the "situation" and overcome it by WORK. "The darkest hour is just
                        before dawn!"--And while we are not in favor of making any concessions, we
                        must meet "the situation," negro suffrage and all, if
                            forced upon us, and we are convinced that the best plan is for
                        the Legislature to call a Convention under the Military Act, (if it becomes
                        law, 'so called,') and take every advantage of it we can. If true men do
                        not, rascals will.</p>
