<b>Mohammedan Slavery.</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A detailed description of the laws and requirements regarding slavery in
                    Islam--including manumission.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>unknown</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An article discussing the words of Mr. Stephens; he argues that the Union's
                    constitution is based on the premise that blacks and whites are equal and that
                    slavery is wrong--and that these premises are incorrect, that just the opposite
                    is true. The South's move to secession is simply a re-organization of the
                    country.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>What Are The Facts?</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A discussion of the suggestion that the Secessionists are the minority in
                    the South--that the supposed majority who still favor the Union have not spoken
                    out, and that this acquiesence can be interpreted as approval. This majority's
                    submission to the minority proves that these states cannot govern themselves,
                    and will have correct the problems causing this ability if they are to ever
                    re-join the Union.<br>

<b>The New Pennsylvania Staple--The Oil Trade.</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A list of the number of barrels of oil transported by the Sunbury and Erie
                    railroad to Erie during 1860 and the month of Jan. 1861. Jan. 1860 had 63
                    barrels, by July--1,423 barrels, in Dec.--6,431 barrels and in Jan. 186l--14,500
                    barrels. The total was 31,619 barrels.<br>

<b>Rule Or Ruin</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A complaint that Southerners have had the favoritism of the Federal
                    Government since it was established. The Republicans did not threaten secession
                    when the Democrats won the Presidence in 1856 through fraud and corruption, but
                    the South is willing to destroy a country when it doesn't get its way every
                    time.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>All For Slavery</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A reminder that Southerners protested when it was suggested that British
                    ships be allowed to inspect suspicious U. S. vessels for carrying slaves--that
                    it violated the sacredness of the country's flag flown on the American ship. But
                    now these same people are prepared to stomp on the flag and what it
                    represents--they prefer slavery to freedom.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Protesting</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Note of many Southern newspapersdemanding that the Confederate constitution
                    be submitted to a vote by the people, whereas the vote for secession was
                    determined by a convention.<br>

<b>From South Carolina</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The question is being raised as to whether Maj. Anderson will leave for
                    Sumter or not. Mention that the Tariff arangement is clogging trade. Banks are
                    in suspension and there is no money to pay the duties. The Jefferson Davis
                    Tariff does not offer a remedy; the North will end up paying the duty required
                    of the South in the Border States; merchants will see the benefit of avoiding
                    the tariff by doing direct shipping to the Southern states.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An excerpt from a Mercury article that argues that the South will have an
                    advantage in "direct trade" over the North, since the North has a tariff of 30%
                    and the South only 10%. Mention that Gen. Beauregard and Gov. Pickens would like
                    to force Maj. Anderson out of Fort Sumter, and some people in Washington are
                    encouraging that the Fort be opened.<br>
</blockquote>

<b>Important From Paris</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article mentions that the French, the English and the Spanish are
                    sending war steamers and ships to the coasts of the U. S. to take advantage of
                    any situation that offers itself. Also mention of a Confederate representative
                    securing a skeleton treaty with France--the writer of the article reminds the
                    Confederate that the conditions of the Louisiana purchase have been violated
                    with the secession, and according to the terms, the land goes back to France.<br>

<b>Secession From Secession</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mention of movement within the Southern states of people who support the
                    Union, and especially of a meeting in Alabama that passed resolves against their
                    state's secession. The article expresses the belief that these loyal Unionists
                    are the majority in the Southern states, and that they will eventually win out
                    over the secessionists.<br>

                    war, that a sloop from New Orleans delivering provisions for the Union gov't
                    fleet was captured--and that this is equivalent to a declaration of war. The
                    fear is that the Southerners will start the war while they are more prepared
