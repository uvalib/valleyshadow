                <summary>Relates that the picket of the 29th Pennsylvania recovered a scow the
                    previous Sunday that is suspected to be the main boat used in transporting
                    Colonel Baker's soldiers from Harrison's Island to the Virginia shore. That boat
                    had sunk when it was carrying the dead and wounded from the battle of Ball's
                    Bluff on it. A theory is that the bodies rose to the surface upon decaying, thus
                    lightening the load of the boat and allowing it too to rise to the surface.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>This number of the <emph rend="italic">Semi-Weekly Dispatch</emph> completes
                        the first six months of its publication, and in that time we have given to
                        its patrons as many numbers as a weekly paper issues in a whole year. Our
                        enterprise, so far, has met with but moderate success; but if the period at
                        which it was started is taken into consideration, as well as the peculiarly
                        deranged affairs of the country, since its commencement, growing out of the
                        unhappy civil strife that is now deluging the land with blood, and which
                        naturally unsettles the business of the country--we repeat, when these very
                        unfavorable circumstances for commencing the publication of a newspaper, are
                        remembered, then the success that has, thus far, attended the <emph
                            rend="italic">Semi-Weekly Dispatch</emph> is very flattering indeed, and
                        we are by no means discouraged. When making our arrangements for the issuing
                        of the paper, the country was at peace, and, with others, we had fondly
                        hoped that that peace would not be disturbed; indeed, as a general thing,
                        there was but few that anticipated such an event; but the very first number
                        of the <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph> issued, contained the startling
                        news of the siege and fall of Fort Sumter--and from that period to the
                        present, war has been desolating our fair land, bringing nothing but ruin
                        and disaster to the best business prospects that ever smiled upon our
                        people.</p>
                    <p>This state of affairs, of course, has interfered much with our prospects and
                        anticipations, and but for which, this hour, even in the face of the great
                        competition in Newspaper publication in the county with which the <emph
                            rend="italic">Dispatch</emph> necessarily had to contend, our enterprise
                        would have attained a position far beyond our most sanguine expectations. As
                        it is, we are gaining in strength, more slowly, however, than we would have
                        done under ordinary circumstances, but, perhaps, more surely. We are
                        occasionally adding to our list of subscribers the names of some of the best
                        men in the county, while our Jobbing patronage, we feel assured, is as good
                        as any of our cotemporaries [sic].</p>
                    <p>As we grow older we expect to grow larger, although our two issues a week,
                        with our present size, contains nearly or quite as much reading matter as
                        any other paper in the county, and we know that we give earlier news than
                        any of them, frequently anticipating their publications, in this particular,
                        as much as two or three days. This is the day of Railroads and Telegraphs;
                        San Francisco, on the Pacific, is now in hourly communication with New York,
                        on the Atlantic, a distance between them, perhaps, of 5000 miles, and while
                        the whole world is astir with movements of the most momentous importance to
                        mankind, all are desirous of obtaining a knowledge of the latest events that
                        are transpiring at the very earliest moment. TO those who are not in receipt
                        of a City Daily, a better source for early news cannot be obtained than the
                            <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph>, as it is the only Semi-Weekly paper
                        published in the county, being issued every Tuesday and Friday of each week.</p>
                    <p>We expect to be able to enlarge the <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph> at
                        the end of the first volume, and to enable us to do so, we solicite [sic] a
                        helping hand from our friends. Give us your Jobbing and Advertising
                        patronage, and induce your neighbors to subscribe for the <emph
                            rend="italic">Dispatch</emph>. As it is the first attempt to establish a
                        Semi-Weekly paper in the county, and as a Newspaper is the best index of the
                        business character of the community in which it is published, the business
                        men of the county should not fail to give our enterprise their warmest
                        approval.</p>

                    Suggests that the paper might have "gained in strength" more quickly during
                    peace times, but that it was surely, if slowly, becoming a strong competitor
                    with the other newspapers of the county.</summary>

                    <p>Captain A. J. Brand's Company of Volunteers, in process of formation in these
                        place for several weeks past, and which is now nearly full, will leave on
                        Monday next for Kentucky. Capt. Brand will attach his company to Col.
                        Stumbaugh's (77th) Regiment, which is part of the Negley Brigade, now in
                        that State, who have gone thither to assist that gallant and loyal people to
                        drive the unprincipled, purjured [sic] rebel crew from her soil. What more
                        glorious sight could be witnessed than Pennsylvania fleeing to the rescue of
                        Kentucky; the sons of the old Keystone State offering up their lives and
                        shedding their blood in defence of the homes and firesides of the people of
                        that patriotic Western State. Pennsylvania thrusts herself forward to
                        receive the assassin blow aimed at her weaker sister, and shields her from
                        intended harm. Glorious and beautiful sight! Pennsylvania locks arms with
                        Kentucky, and defies her enemies.</p>
                    <p>Captain Brand desires a few more able-bodied men to complete his company. A
                        better opportunity for the exhibition of patriotic devotion to our common
                        country cannot be obtained by those who design volunteer in this great
                        cause.</p>
