                    <p>Just six months ago to-day, Fort Sumter fell into the hands of the rebels,
                        and the North became a perfect Green Monster of Jealousy for he safety of
                        the honor of our great Republic.</p>
                    <p>What has been done since that time?</p>
                    <p>The largest army that the country had ever seen previously has been called
                        out, organized, equipped, served three months, and been disbanded. Three
                        months later, an army of over three hundred thousand men has been raised,
                        organized, equipped, transported, and drilled ready for action.</p>
                    <p>Thirty little battles have been fought, and about two thousand men have been
                        killed, and twice as many has [sic] been wounded.</p>
                    <p>A fleet that was spread over the waters of the entire globe, has been called
                        home, repaired and is in active service. The Navy has been weeded of
                        traitors--a great work in itself.</p>
                    <p>Seven new sloops-of-war has [sic] been built and are now afloat, and thirty
                        powerful new gun-boats will soon be ready for service.--Besides this,
                        seventeen steamers have been altered into gun-boats, and five schooners have
                        been likewise altered.</p>
                    <p>Two forts, seven hundred prisoners, two hundred and three prizes have been
                        captured by the fleet.</p>
                    <p>This is but a tithe of what has been done whilst our army was in a state of
                        disorganization, and our government affairs in chaotic confusion.</p>
                    <p>What can be done in the next three months with perfect order, great power,
                        great leaders, and a great cause?</p>
                    <p>Shall not the anniversary of the fall of Fort Sumpter [sic] show us the fall
                        of the so-called Southern Confederacy?--<emph rend="italic">Evening Journal
                            of last Thursday</emph>.</p>
