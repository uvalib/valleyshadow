                    know that if the Union can be saved by emancipating the slaves, then slavery

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The first ice of the season, in this locality, was formed on the night of the
                        25th inst. Winter, with all its rigors, is at the door, and although our
                        country is blessed with an abundance of breadstuffs, who can tell the amount
                        of hunger and suffering that will be indured [sic] by the poor before the
                        ear is again saluted by the song of the Spring birds! Owing to the disturbed
                        condition of our national affairs, and the scarcety [sic] of employment
                        resulting therefrom, the approaching winter, doubtless, wears a more
                        terrible appearance to thousands of the children of want than many others
                        did, that are past. Let all, therefore, be as liberal to the deserving poor
                        as their means will permit, and thus prevent want from pressing too
                    heavily.</p>
