                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Pursuant to notice, published in the several Democratic journals of the town,
                        convening the Democratic party of the county in County meeting on the
                        evening of the 13th inst., in the Court House, we, in common with others,
                        attended, in expectation of hearing an exposition of the views of the
                        Democracy of Franklin, through it self-constituted leaders, of the present
                        momentous and unparelleled [sic] position of our distressing National
                        affairs. It has been the custom of all parties, heretofore, in county
                        meetings immediately preceeding [sic] the formation of County Tickets, to
                        adopt resolutions expressive of their views of State and National policy,
                        embracing such questions as a Tariff, for instance; internal improvements,
                        the License System, or some other more or less important question--we say,
                        this has been the uniform practice of all parties heretofore, and none came
                        forward in this respect more boastfully and ostentatiously than the leaders
                        of the Democratic party. They were not afraid--not they!--of proclaiming
                        their principles, and emblazoning them upon their banners, so that even they
                        that run might read.</p>
                    <p>We are now in the midst of a Civil War, the most terrible evil that can
                        afflict any people--the Country is convulsed from centre to
                        circumference--every interest of our people is paralized [sic] and stricken
                        down--the very existence [sic] of our Government and Union is
                        threatened--Treason and Rebellion is rampant in one-half of the
                        Republic--fortifications, and ships, and treasure have been stolen--battles
                        have been fought, the National Flag has been dishonored, perjury has been
                        committed, pirates are jubilant, and in the midst of such a state of
                        National affairs--we almost hesitate to tell the world--the Democracy of
                        Franklin county held a county meeting, organized, passed a resolution
                        calling for an election of delegates to attend a nominating convention, and
                        adjourned without even noticing in any manner, by resolution or otherwise,
                        the terrible condition which our Government is now occupying.</p>
                    <p>What!--the bold, the fearless, the unterrified Democracy, assemble in County
                        meeting, almost within the hearing of the thunder of the rebel
                        artillery--when the Capitol of the Republic is not only threatened, but
                        almost invested by Treason's troops, and yet adjourned without adopting an
                        expression, by resolution or speech, of assent or dissent, approval or
                        disapproval, of satisfaction or condemnation of the present terrible state
                        of affairs in which our Country is now involved! The thing is without a
                        parallel in the history of politics, or of men pretending to be leaders of
                        parties or of public affairs.</p>
                    <p>Why was this? Was it a dodge, a political maneouver, from which some
                        political aggrandizement may grow? Is our Union so little worth, that the
                        leaders in this meeting could not find a word of sympathy for it in its
                        present terrible agonies?--not a word of regret for the scores of their
                        heroic fellow-democrats who have already shed their blood and laid down
                        their lives in its defence, and not a word of encouragement for the
                        thousands of others who are now in the tented field ready to offer up their
                        lives also for the Republic?</p>
                    <p>We are pleased to say here, that we believe fully three-fourths, if not more,
                        of the men who belong to the Democratic party of Franklin, are
                        unconditional, uncompromising Union men--favorable to the enforcement of the
                        Constitution and Laws of the country, and who are opposed to a Peace
                        procurred [sic] upon any other terms than a full, complete and unconditional
                        surrender of those in arms against the Government. While we are free and
                        proud to say so, we feel grieved to be compelled to remark, what we believe
                        to be the truth, and what we believe this meeting plainly indicated, that
                        there are men in Franklin county who would now compromise with Traitors--who
                        are more partizen [sic] than patriotic, and, therefore, prefer Party to
                        Country! O! land of Washington, have you given birth to such children!</p>

                    <p>The enemies of the Union in the North, (there are many of them, and not
                        confined to the Abolitionists either) who, for the purpose of crippling the
                        Administration, and strengthening the hands of Southern Treason, are crying
                        Peace! Peace! We are for Peace too, but not a Peace secured at the sacrifice
                        of the integrity of the Union; it must be a Peace brought about by the
                        complete submission of those in arms against the Government--an
                        unconditional surrender of the rebels to the authority of the Constitution
                        and Laws, and a recognition of the Union in all its length, breadth, depth
                        and heighth [sic]. A Peace obtained upon any other terms would be more
                        injurious than war, and the men or the party that counsel such a Peace, are
                        masked enemies of the Union, more to be dreaded than all the open and more
                        manly enemies in the South. We adopt the language of an influential
                        cotemporary [sic], who remarks:</p>
                    <p>"A Peace Party in the North is nothing more than the reserve forces of Jeff.
                        Davis. Both are animated by the same purpose. Mr. Davis wishes the North
                        humiliated; so does the Peace party. Mr. Davis wants Northern bacon and
                        Northern arms; the Peace party have both to dispose of at reasonable terms.
                        Mr. Davis wishes to ruin the Administration; the Peace party is laboring to
                        the same end. The only difference seems to be that Davis has armed his
                        Virginia "Peace party," and stationed it at Manassas, under command of
                        Beauregard and Johnson, two very distinguished members, while his "Peace
                        party" in the North is commanded by Breckinridge, Bayard, Vallandigham, and
                        Wood. The whole six of them are very faithful officers, and Mr. Davis is as
                        efficiently represented by his Northern servants as he is by his
                    Southern."</p>

                    Pittsburgh. However, a warrant is currently out for Graham's arrest for
                    swindling, because he took the money and then also drew his pay.</summary>

                <summary>Reports the arrival in town of Mr. Charles Arter, former resident of
                    Chambersburg. Mr. Arter's mother and his uncle, Captain George Jarrett, continue
                    to reside in Chambersburg, but Mr. Arter himself moved west around 1840 and now
                    lives in Cairo, Illinois. His land there became occupied by the government, who
                    tore down the buildings of his distillery. Mr. Arter is on his way to Washington
                    to request compensation and to ask permission for a cavalry that has been formed
                    at Cairo to join Union forces.</summary>
