<b>Inaugural Address of Mr. Pierpont, the New Governor of Loyal Virginia</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints the speech of the governor elected in western Virginia. The
                    governor notes that those who have previously governed Virginia have believed
                    the propertied, educated classes should make the decisions in the state. It is
                    these leaders, the "usurpers of the South," who have driven Virginia to secede.
                    Now, Pierpont asserts, loyal Virginians are reclaiming the power of all the
                    people to make the law.<br>

<b>Gen. Scott's Plan</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Excerpts the opinion of the Washington correspondent for the New York
                    Tribune, who believes that General Scott has no long-range plan for winning the
                    war. Presently, the correspondent argues, the troops around Washington are there
                    simply to defend the capital. But he thinks the present plans will be modified
                    before the fall.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Various news briefs concerning the war, including information that Hugh
                    Brenan, a private in company F of the 24th Pennsylvania regiment, was arrested
                    and "will probably be shot" for attempting to shoot the day officer, Captain

<b>Peace Propositions</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints two dispatches from Washington. The first reports that the
                    "Rebels" have advanced a proposition for peace that requires recognition of the
                    Southern Confederacy by the federal government, along with a treaty of commerce
                    and friendship. The second denies that the South has offered any such
                    proposition and that "the traitors intend to push the war to the bitter end."<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York Tribune</blockquote>
<b>The McClellan-McMagoffin Treaty</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints the agreement made between General McClellan and General Buckner
                    of Kentucky, whereby Kentucky will enforce the laws of the United States on its
                    soil. By the agreement, Kentucky will be compelled to remove Southern troops
                    from the state if they manage to occupy it. If Kentucky is unable to accomplish
                    the removal of Southern forces, they must call on the United States government
                    to do so. The Dispatch is in accord with President Lincoln's decision to
                    repudiate this agreement, because the Dispatch believes that the government
                    should not be required to ask permission to enter a state. In addition, the
                    editor states Governor Magoffin of Kentucky is attempting to fool the government
                    with this stance of neutrality. The editor fears that, once Magoffin has
                    gathered troops, he may well declare that "Kentucky has changed her mind" and
                    has decided to join the Confederacy.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Proclamation of Gen. McClellan</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints orders by General McClellan to his troops that they should bring
                    into battle the "highest and noblest qualities of soldiers' discipline--courage
                    and mercy." The soldiers under his command should remember that they have the
                    upper hand morally over those they will fight, and, therefore, they should show
                    mercy to their disarmed foe.<br>

<b>Contrabands to Go to Hayti</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Speculates that Congress will give the president the means to send to Haiti
                    any African Americans of the North who wish to go.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Washington Republican</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is probably that Congress, at its approaching session, will place means in
                        the hands of the President for the colonization in Hayti, and elsewhere, of
                        such of our colored people as may desire to emigrate. Such a measure seems
                        to be demanded by the new exigencies. As it would only contemplate the
                        aiding of voluntary emigration, it would quiet any sensitiveness in relation
                        to a too sudden and great increase of our free negro population. No question
                        of constitutionality can be raised, as the war power covers the case.</p>
                    <p>Of course, large discretion must be left to the President as to the place or
                        places, to be colonized. Available places are numerous and not remote. Hayti
                        alone would perhaps be able to receive all the colonists who would offer
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>The expense would'nt [sic] be formidable. From military "lines" established
                        near Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, New Orleans, &amp;c., into which the
                        contraband negroes would flock, they might be "sluiced off" to St. Domingo
                        or Central America, with great rapidity and economy.</p>
                    <p>This is upon the supposition that it becomes necessary to carry this war to
                        the Gulf, as must be the case if the traitors continue obstinate. But even
                        if the war terminates with the pacification of Virginia, the number of
                        negroes desiring to be colonized must be large enough to require national
                            interposition.--Washington Republican.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A volunteer from Pittsburgh, a member of the 3d Regiment, died on last
                        Tuesday evening, of Typhoid fever, at the house of Mr. F. Deatrich of this
                        place. The deceased was a German, 19 years old, named Charles Sitzler. His
                        mother arrived on last Saturday and remained with him untill [sic] his
                        death. Being very poor the railroad companies granted her a free pass both
                        ways, and on Tuesday morning she left for her home taking with her the
                        remains of her son. The funeral arrangements were attended to be Mr. J.
                        Hoke. The poor woman, upon leaving, could not express in words her gratitude
                        to him, and as the car was starting, she, with tears in her eyes, signaled
                        to him and pointed upward. The sight was affecting, and the meaning not to
                        be misunderstood.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A man from this place, who had been impressed in the Southern army, and who
                        was in the retreat from Harper's Ferry, has made his escape, bringing his
                        Southern uniform and the sight off his rifle, as trophies. His account of
                        the retreat we give in his own peculiar style. He says:</p>
                    <p>"When the news came that a large force was coming against us, we were all in
                        confusion, and then you ought to have seen the boys gitting. While on the retreat word was brought that the enemy
                        was not following us and had gone back again; then, said he, we all came
                        back to the Ferry again. Word was again brought us that they were coming
                        again in still larger numbers than before. You should have seen them git then!" </p>
                    <p>It would appear from this statement, that the peace policy of Jeff. Davis was
                        rather involuntary on his part.</p>
