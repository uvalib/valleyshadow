<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since the war has broke [sic] out the freight cars of the different railroads
                        have been used freely upon one another's roads. The result is that none of
                        them know where their cars are. It is no unusual thing to see cars of the
                        New Jersey Central, or Williamsport and Elmira and Pennsylvania Railroad
                        standing about the sidings at Washington. The Balt. and Ohio Railroad have
                        lost over forty that they cannot find, and have, accordingly, sent out men
                        all over the country wherever a railroad runs to hunt them up and get them
                        home. The freight coming into Washington every morning would make one
                        continuous string for two and a half to three miles long. To-day, a train
                        nearly half a mile long, loaded with wood, came in. Before the war, wood
                        along the road was poor sale, little or none being sent over the road; now
                        the trade is immense, and prices have again gone up for woodland to almost
                        fabulous rates.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We take the following extract from a letter written by a lady in Charleston,
                        S. C., to the Philadelphia Inquirer. It speaks
                        for itself:</p>
                    <p>"Disguise the truth as we may, all thinking men here feel their position
                        peculiarly unsafe; and those who are surrounded by female relatives, have
                        their anxiety increased a thousand fold. We do not fear for the clash of
                        contending armies, though that is sufficiently terrible to excite much
                        apprehension; but even amid the carnage of war, the veriest boor within the
                        armies would respect women; though traitors try to teach us that the
                        Northern war cry is "Beauty and Booty;" but we do dread lest at midnight the
                        fearful sounds of servile insurrection shall salute our ears. You know the
                        negroes are far superior in number to the whites, and now that there are so
                        many absent in the army their majority is greatly increased. If they rise we are in their power! Do you know
                        what that means? Remember the history of all servile insurrections, and
                        recall the horrors enacted by the race whom oppression has helped to
                        brutalize. Of course the masters would fight desperately; but how could the
                        small number of male whites defend their helpless wives and daughters
                        against a tenfold force of maddened slaves, whose strength and ferocity are
                        well known."</p>
