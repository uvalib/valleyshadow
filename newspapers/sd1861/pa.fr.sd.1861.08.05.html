<b>Why Straggling Was Permitted</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Explains that "stragglers"--men who have wandered away from their
                    regiment--are not forced back into camp and into rigid discipline after a battle
                    because it allows them to recover and to resume the duties of a soldier with
                    greater enthusiasm than they would have otherwise.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Many civilians have been very much surprised that the military authorities
                        should have permitted the straglers [sic] of the demoralized regiments to go
                        around Washington and Alexandria, without any apparent effort to sift them
                        apart, and gather them up by companies and regiments. General Scott explains
                        that by letting volunteers ran loose as it were after such a disaster, they
                        much more rapidly recover their spirits and get over the fatigues of the
                        fight and the retreat--that being habituated to reading and hearing news,
                        they would become discontented and morose if they were at once returned to
                        rigid discipline and the seclusion of a camp. By letting them mix together
                        and talk it over, they soon hear all there is to be said--to realize the
                        extent of the disaster--to revive their hopes and inflame their desire for
                        revenging the death of friends, and reversing the tide of the battle. For
                        these reasons, no more notice was taken of the members of the disorganized
                        regiments than to guard against any acts of violence. After three or four
                        days of idleness, the men went almost of their own accord back to camp, and
                        resumed with apparent relish camp duty and camp fare.--N. Y. Times.</p>
