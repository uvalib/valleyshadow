                    home after their enlistment expired. The editor remarks that South Carolinians,

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We see it stated that two South Carolina Regiments, who were in Virginia,
                        have returned to their homes, their term of enlistment having expired. If
                        the rebel soldiers from any of the seceding States ought to see the fight
                        through with, it is those from S. Carolina. After striving for 30 years to
                        produce a collision between the Northern and Southern sections of our
                        country, and when at last they have succeeded, they should at least have
                        manliness enough not to desert their friends, whom they have dragged into
                        the conflict, right in the midst of their difficulties. We should be glad to
                        hear form them when they re-inlist [sic] for of all others of the rebel
                        troops those of South Carolina we desire most to see thoroughly thrashed. If
                        they are half as chivalorous [sic] and brave as they would have the world
                        believe them, let them return to the field and seek earnestly to meet the
                        Northern "mud sills" as they have contemptuously
                        styled our working men, and whose courage they have so persistently
                        impugned, or for ever after hide their faces. As the Valley Spirit has been the peculiar defender of South Carolina,
                        we hope it will institute an inquiry as to this mean, dastardly conduct of
                        its friends, and report.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The preponderance of the slaveholding interest of Missouri is decidedly for
                        the Union. The large slaveholders seem to realize a great truth which Col.
                        Frank Blair recently announced to one of them. He was in his quarters at the
                        Arsenal, when a gentleman from Lexington came in, and was introduced to him.
                        "I am a Union man," remarked the visitor, "but I'm pro-slavery; I own
                        niggers." "Well, Sir," replied Col. Blair, with a faint suggestion of a
                        smile upon his grim face, "You have a right to be. If a man likes negroes,
                        we don't object to that; but if you gentlemen who own negroes attempt to
                        take the State of Missouri out of the Union, in about six month you will be
                        the most 'niggerless' set of individuals that you ever heard of!"</p>
