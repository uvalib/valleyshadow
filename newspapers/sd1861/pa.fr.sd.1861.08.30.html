<b>The "Hagerstown Mail" Office Closed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Dispatch applauds the closure of the Hagerstown Mail newspaper by the
                    government. The Dispatch offers its full support for the government's policy of
                    shutting down newspapers that continue to publish treasonous sentiments.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have what we consider reliable information from Hagerstown, to the effect,
                        that the Office of the "Hagerstown Mail" was
                        closed on Wednesday morning last, by authority of the Government, and its
                        publisher, Mr. Daniel Dechert, put under arrest.</p>
                    <p>The "Mail" has been among the most unscrupulous
                        and unprincipled papers published in Maryland, in its opposition to the War
                        policy of the Administration. </p>
                    <p>The time has come when, if the Government is to be maintained, a licentious
                        press must not be permitted to disseminate its poisonous venom. A man would
                        not be allowed to preach treasonable sentiments on board of our national
                        ships or in our fortifications--no more should the press be allowed to do
                        the same thing, thus producing discord, disaffection, discontent and
                        disloyalty among the people, ultimating in the destruction of the very
                        government itself. Freedom must be regulated by law, otherwise Freedom will
                        resolve itself into anarchy and confusion. The freedom of speech as well as
                        the freedom of the press has been most grossly abused in this country, and
                        at no period of our history more so than since the commencement of the
                        present most causeless and unnatural rebellion.</p>
                    <p>A number of printing offices in various parts of the country have been mobbed
                        ad destroyed by the outraged, indignant and loyal communities in which they
                        have been located, owing to the treasonable sentiments they had
                        disseminated, and we are pleased to see that the Government itself is taking
                        the matter in hand.</p>
                    <p>A man who would persist in poisoning a fountain of water, thus endangering
                        the lives of a community, would be disposed of without mercy. No more should
                        the public press be permitted to poison the fountain of Freedom, and thus
                        contribute to the downfall of the Republic. We would be the last to curb
                        either the liberty of speech or of the press, but when bad men will take
                        advantage of the wide freedom extended by our Constitution and Laws, and use
                        it to destroy the Government that secures these great privileges, then it
                        becomes dangerous to the general weal, and should be checked.</p>
                    <p>There must be a limit somewhere, and we prefer that the properly constituted
                        authorities should be the judges when that limit is transgressed, than that
                        an excited mob should take the matter in hand.</p>
                    <p>The proprietor of the "Mail" is an old citizen of
                        this place, formerly one of the proprietors of the Valley Spirit. He is, emphatically, "a Northern man with
                        Southern principals," and like many others, in their obedience to the
                        behests of the Slave power, if it were possible out-Souths the South in
                        their abject devotion. </p>
                    <p>We are in the midst of Revolution and Rebellion, and it will not do to meet
                        them with ordinary measures, if they are to be overcome. Let treason be
                        crushed out, found it whatever guise it may.</p>
                    <p>The people and the Government must become terribly in earnest if our
                        Constitution, our Union, and our Liberties are to be perpetuated. No
                        half-way measures will overcome the enemies that are warring against them,
                        and the loyal citizens of the Free North will sustain the Government in
                        every effort it may put forth to maintain the honor and dignity of the
                        nation and the perpetuity of the Union.</p>

<b>The Government in Earnest</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports the discovery of a number of female spies for the South. While the
                    government has arrested some of them, and others suspected of espionage are
                    under close observation, the Dispatch points out that the government continues
                    to employ at least two hundred disloyal clerks in Washington. The Dispatch urges
                    that the government "shake off these traitors."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Press in the North, so energetic and untiring, through its numerous
                        correspondents have heretofore indulged most freely in laying before its
                        readers every movement of the Federal troops--their arrivals, departures,
                        destination, &amp;c. The most valuable information was thus given to the
                        enemy, which enabled him to counteract the most important movement of the
                        Government, and to such an extent did this prevail that it became necessary
                        for Gen. McClellan to call the attention of newspaper publishers to the
                        injury they were inflicting upon the cause. As a general thing the leading
                        journals of the country came to an understanding upon the subject, and since
                        that time but little information of the kind referred to has been made
                        public.</p>
                    <p>The Government, however, notwithstanding its vigilance in this and in many
                        other respects, has still been foiled. It appears that the enemy has been
                        kept pretty well informed of al movements taking place, by a number of
                        female residents of Washington, the wives and daughters of prominent
                        Southern ex-members of Congress, and others. The most indubitable evidence
                        of the guilt of several in this respect having been received, some half a
                        dozen or more of whom have been put under arrest, while others are under the
                        most strict surveillance.</p>
                    <p>This is right, and the country will applaud it. Her sex should not screen
                        woman from the most condign punishment when detected in aiding the common
                        enemy. Females have often been found the most dangerous foes of a
                        Government. Many of them have proven to be the most shrewd, scheming,
                        desperate intriguers, and, if detected, have relied for protection upon the
                        respect and consideration usually accorded their sex.</p>
                    <p>But while these scheming, prying daughters of Eve are claiming the attention
                        of the Government, we see it stated the House Committee of Investigation, of
                        which Mr. Potter is chairman, reports that over two hundred disloyal Clerks are still employed in the several
                        Departments of the Government in Washington! Can we say that the
                        Administration is in earnest in its efforts to save the ship of state so
                        long as these barnacles are permitted to adhere to its keel. Their position
                        affords the superior opportunities for obtaining information, and if they do
                        not impart it to the Rebel Chiefs directly, they have made use of these
                        female spies as channels through which to convey it. As an evidence of this,
                        in the possession of Mrs. Meigs, who was arrested a day or two ago in
                        Washington, was discovered a drawing of the defencive [sic] works around the
                        Capital, furnished by one of these Clerks!</p>
                    <p>Let the Administration shake off these traitors who, while drawing a
                        subsistance [sic] from its treasury, are indefatigable in their efforts to
                        promote the overthrow of the Government. Until this is done, there is no use
                        in cautioning the Press or arresting female spies.</p>

<b>Country Before Party</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
