<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Several days ago a colored man called at the Grocery of Mr. John Schofield,
                        and inquired if he had any Hams on hand, remarking that he was sent by a
                        certain Hotel-keeper whom he named, to get a couple. Several being shown, he
                        picked two and left, remarking that the landlord, just being out of change,
                        would call in the evening and pay for them. The time having passed at which
                        payment was to be made, suspicion was aroused that all was not right, and
                        inquiry was made of the landlord, who said he had sent no one to his Store
                        for Hams. Mr. Schofield by that time commenced "smelling a large mice." He
                        was confident of being minus two Hames, for which he had received no pay,
                        and on looking around for the colored man who had got them, discovered that
                        he had left in the next Train.</p>
