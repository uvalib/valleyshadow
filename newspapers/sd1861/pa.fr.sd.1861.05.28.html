<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The following, which has appeared in several widely circulating and
                        influential newspapers, is part of a telegram purporting to have been sent
                        from Chambersburg on the 24th inst.:</p>
                    <p>"Great apprehension prevails in Cumberland valley of an invasion from
                        Virginia. Ten thousand head of cattle and five thousand horses along the
                        Valley could be seized by a sudden irruption [sic] of an expeditionary corps
                        holding the Valley for five days, even if driven back into Virginia.</p>
                    <p>Forward movements of the Virginia troops may be expected immediately.</p>
                    <p>Campbell's Flying Artillery of six pieces has positively been ordered back
                        from York to Chambersburg. Two additional infantry regiments must be moved
                        to this point and a battalion of cavalry added, or devastation will overtake
                        the whole Valley. We want at least three batteries of six and twelve
                        pounders."</p>
                    <p>Appended to the above appeared the following:</p>
                    <p>"The officers, who recently made a reconnoisance as far as Harper's Ferry,
                        report that they learned there that a sentinel had been captured by means of
                        a lariat, about a week before from the camp here, and was carried to
                        Harper's Ferry. There he had been hung up twice to force him to impart
                        information to the rebels, with what success was not known."</p>
                    <p>Having serious doubts respecting the truth of these statements, we went with
                        them to head-quarters to ascertain the facts. Gen. Williams declared them
                        both fabrications, and said they were never sent over the telegraph wires
                        from this place. The General was highly indignant, both at the author of
                        such falsehoods, and also at the Associated Press for the employment of such
                        reckless or at least gullible agents.</p>
                    <p>The following dispatch has been sent by Gen. Williams to the Associated
                        Press:</p>
                    <p>CHAMBERSBURG, May 25th.--We desire neither of artillery, dragoons, nor
                        infantry, as mentioned in the dispatch published in this morning's papers,
                        but are prepared to repel any invasion of the soil of Pennsylvania,
                        promptly.</p>

<b>Soldiers' Rations</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There has been much said about what constitutes the daily rations of the
                        soldier and the cost of the same, and yet the mass of the people know very
                        little on the subject. We therefore gather some interesting items in
                        relation to army subsistence from the official Regulations of the Army of
                        the United States, and publish them, that the men may know what they are
                        entitled to, in case grasping contractors should attempt to practice
                        impositions:</p>
                    <p>One hundred complete rations consist of-- <br> 32 rations fresh beef is 40
                        lbs, or 1 1/4 lbs per man. <br> 68 " pork, is 51 lbs, " 3/4 lb " <br> 100
                        " flour, is 11 lbs, " 18 oz. " <br> 100 " beans, is 8 qts. <br> Or, <br>
                        100 " rice, is 10 lbs. <br> 100 " coffee, is 6 lbs. <br> 100 " sugar, is
                        12 lbs. <br> 100 " vinegar, is 4 qts. <br> 100 "candles, is 1 1/2 lbs.
                        <br> 100 " soap, is 4 lbs. <br> 100 "salt, is 2 qts. </p>
                    <p>When the officers of the Medical Department find anti-scorbutics necessary
                        for the health of the troops, the commanding officer may order issues of
                        fresh vegetables, pickled onions, sour krout, or mollasses [sic], with an
                        extra quantity of rice and vinegar. (Potatoes are usually issued at the rate
                        of one pound per ration, and onions at the rate of three bushels in lieu of
                        one of beans.) Occasional issues (extra) of molasses are made--two quarts of
                        one hundred rations--and of dried apples of from one to one and a half
                        bushels to one hundred rations."</p>
