<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Washington correspondent of the New York Herald says:</p>
                    <p>The members of Congress who are here are also discussing the propriety of
                        wiping out the distinction between the regulars and volunteers, by declaring
                        the volunteers to compose the army of the United States. Unless something is
                        done to legally obliterate the distinction now maintained, and to do away
                        with the tyrannical rule of the regular department, the volunteer system
                        will be utterly destroyed.--As it is now, no officer, however capable or
                        meritorious, can obtain any position or consideration with the heads of the
                        army bureaus, and nothing is conceded to the volunteers that can possibly be
                        withheld. For their arms, clothing, equipments, transportation, &amp;c.,
                        the volunteers must dance attendance, day after day, upon men who openly
                        deride and malign them, and who never treat them with decency, and never
                        speak of them except with contempt. It is astonishing the extent to which
                        this feeling is carried.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A man by the name of James Klink, a merchant of Newville, Cumberland County,
                        arrived in this place on Saturday last, accompanied by a young lady whom he
                        represented as his wife, and put up at one of our Hotels for several
                        days.--Klink has a wife and several children in Newville; was an elder in
                        the Church, and occupied a respectable position in that community. The girl,
                        whose ruin he has accomplished, was from a rural district, and became
                        acquainted with Klink by dealing at his store. The elopement was not
                        immediately discovered; but when the face became developed, they were
                        tracked to this place, and on Tuesday last the brother-in-law of the girl,
                        accompanied by Klink's wife, arrived here in pursuit of the guilty pair. By
                        that time, however, the respected merchant had left for parts unknown,
                        having sent the foolish and disgraced girl back--from whence he decoyed
                    her.</p>
