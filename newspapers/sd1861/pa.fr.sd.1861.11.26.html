<b>Gen. Jim Lane on Slavery</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints a speech given by General Jim Lane at Camp Springfield, Missouri,
                    stating that the war is a war to defeat the rebellion, not to defeat slavery. If
                    slavery can survive the war, Lane points out, then "let it live," but if it
                    cannot, then "it is not for me to gather up the dust again."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In a speech made at Camp Springfield, Missouri, Gen. Jim Lane, than whom no
                        man is more feared and hated by Border Ruffians and Rebels, declared in
                        reference to Slavery--the Pandora box from which has issued most of our
                        national troubles--as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Mr creed is, Let Slavery take care of itself. If
                        it can survive the shock of war, let it live, but if between an upper and
                        nether millstone it be ground to powder, and the winds drive it way, it is
                        not for me to gather up the dust again. I do not propose to make war upon
                        slavery, but upon Rebels, and in the meantime to let slaves and slavery take
                        care of themselves. An oligarchy more cruel and proscriptive than ever
                        scourged and cursed a nation, ancient or modern, has brought on this war for
                        slavery; and if we are required to protect, or in any way help Slavery, then
                        we are required to co-operate with the enemy, to help him, to defend him,
                        and work for the same end. Can we place ourselves thus in an alliance with
                        our deadly and barbarous foes, and at the same time conquer them, subdue
                        them, crush them? When lesser contradictions are reconciled, we will think
                        of harmonizing this." </p>
                    <p>Comment is unnecessary. The Federal army marches to crush out rebellion and
                        treason, and let slavery take care of itself.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We take great pleasure, says the Louisville Journal, in laying before our readers the following letter from Gen.
                        Negley, of the Pennsylvania Brigade, to Gen. Lovell H. Rousseau. It speaks
                        the language of patriotic devotion to our country, of profound admiration
                        for our State, and sympathy with her imperilled condition, and a generous
                        appreciation of our distinguished and chivalrous fellow-citizens. When he
                        shall have received from Pennsylvania, as the representative of Kentucky,
                        the stand of regimental colors which it is the intention of General Negley's
                        Brigade to present, the noble sons of the Keystone State may be assured that
                        their gift will never be dishonored, but that it will always be found flying
                        in the van and the thickest of the fight whenever it is upreared in the
                        defence of our country from foreign foes or domestic traitors:--</p>
                    <p>Head-Quarters, Negley's Brigade, <br> Camp Nevin, Nov. 14, 1861.</p>
                    <p>General Lovell H. Rousseau--Dear Sir.--Allow me the honor to inform you that
                        it is the intention of my brigade to present through you to your brave
                        command a stand of regimental colors. It is also desired that George D.
                        Prentice, Esq., should present them. You will please intimate the time the
                        most convenient for the ceremonies. I assure you this gift is not intended
                        as an idle compliment, but is expressive of the sympathy and national
                        interest Pennsylvania feels for her sister State. She has witnessed with
                        painful solicitude the cloud which has hung over your land like the mist
                        over Niagara, hiding from the thoughtless and unweary an abyss of
                        destruction.</p>
                    <p>She has seen Kentucky, the cradle of science and the birth-place of heroes
                        and statesmen, arrested in her flighs [sic] of ambition, the hands of
                        progress turned back on the dial plate of time, all the grand conceptions of
                        a rich and happy people blighted by the schemes of Judas patriots and
                        heartless traitors, her wisest citizens hugging the phantom of peace until
                        they were bound like slaves and compelled at the point of the bayonet to
                        swallow the deadliest draughts which could be distilled from the Upas of
                        rebellion. She has wondered whether the sons of Kentucky had degenerated
                        from the spirit of her forefathers and had lost the sensibility of honor and
                        chastity of feeling which nourish many sentiment. Many prayers have been
                        offered for the success of those whose devotion to their country shows them
                        worthy of being free, who consider no sacrifice too great when liberty is
                        the reward.</p>
                    <p>It is with such emotions Pennsylvania sends you aid, and offers her sons a
                        willing sacrifice for your defence. Those who come have left tearful eyes
                        and aching heart behind. No long service has turned their hearts into
                        marble--no dissolute camp has changed their manly feelings. Their valor
                        springs not from reckless habits of indifference to life, but from the stern
                        resolve that Kentucky shall be free. They care not that the enemy have
                        frowning tiers of stolen artillery, steep rocks and everlasting hills for
                        their castles, tangled brushwood for their palisades, deep rivers and
                        nature's wildest forms for their ally; they will conquer or perish in the
                        attempt. The flag which we tender to you is surrounded with hallowed
                        memories, its blazoned folds shall be a rainbow of hope and promise to the
                        oppressed, and a soldier's pledge that we will stand by you in preserving
                        the Union unsevered.</p>
                    <p>Remember that our national greatness, our social and political happiness are
                        enshrined in its silken folds and bright stars. The pleasure of prosperity
                        has been ours--'tis ours to have adversity. Let us meet it like men who know
                        their duty and who prize their constitutional freedom. If we fail, we will
                        fall in the same trenches and on the same fields where many of the heroes of
                        the Revolution perished in defence of the same rights.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, dear General, permit us to express our admiration of your
                        personal valor, generous honor, and inflexible perseverance in the path of
                        duty.</p>
                    <p>I have the honor to remain your friend and very obedient servant,</p>
                    <p>James Negley.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday last a week, in Tomstown, Quincy township, a case of stabbing
                        occurred, resulting in death, the particulars of which, as far as we have
                        been able to learn, are as follows: A father and son, named McFerren, met
                        two brothers named Welsh, at a store in the village. A quarrel ensued,
                        commenced by the Welshes, growing out of an old feud that appears to have
                        existed between the parties. The McFerrens manifested a disposition to evade
                        a quarrel, but threatened to hurt the parties if they made the attack. At a
                        favorable moment one of the Welshes jumped upon the back of the younger
                        McFerren, seizing him by the throat, when McFerren plunged a knife into
                        Welsh's side, which perforated his lung, from the effect of which he died on
                        Friday morning, last. Young McFerren came to this place on that day and
                        delivered himself up to the officers of the law, and is not in our county
                        prison.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A woman from the country, while in Eyster &amp; Bro's Store a few days
                        ago, was observed taking a piece of Calico, secreting it under her shawl and
                        leaving the Store. She was followed and the goods taken from her. The women,
                        doubtless, was prompted to the act more from her needy circumstances than
                        from inate dishonesty. In our opinion, she is more to be pitied than
                        censured. Want, doubtless, was pressing, and being destitute of the means to
                        supply her necessities, she was prompted to the act. Those who are in
                        affluant [sic] circumstances, without a single wish or want ungratified,
                        know not of the sufferings of the poor, whose children, from sheer
                        necessity, are illy clad and poorly fed, and who, in the chilly hours of
                        night occupy but squalled and cheerless beds. Under such circumstances,
                        then, how strong must be the temptation to appropriate to their use that
                        which belongs to another. We all should pray--"Keep us from being led into
                        temptation"--or that other prayer, "Give me neither riches or poverty;
                        least, if I am rich, I should deny Thee, or if poor, should steal."</p>
