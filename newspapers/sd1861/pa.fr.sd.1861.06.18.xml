                    <p>From the Edinburgh Review.</p>
                    <p>The free States of the country, notwithstanding their disadvantages of soil
                        and climate, were prospering, while the slave States were not advancing in a
                        corresponding degree. The North was absorbing all the vigorous voluntary
                        labor of emigration; it was rich; it was covered with profitable railroads;
                        it was full of schools and general intelligence, while the South was poor,
                        and frequently obliged to pledge its coming crop frequently obliged to
                        pledge its coming crop for the necessaries of the present year. Certain
                        disagreeable facts became increasingly prominent. In 1791 the population of
                        the slave States was larger than that of the free by 66,007 persons. In 1860
                        the number of square miles possessed by the South largely exceeded that of
                        the North, but Northern population was ahead of Southern by 5,443,870
                        persons. The rate at which population (owing, of course, in great measure,
                        to immigration) increased in the free States, in the last ten years, was
                        forty-one per cent.; in the slave States, twenty-nine per cent. The only
                        decrease in city population, which the last census recorded was of 3,000
                        souls in Charleston. Virginia, which in 1790 had the first place in
                        population, had sunk to the fifth in 1860. Of eight States which contained
                        over a million of inhabitants, only two were slave States; and of twenty-one
                        cities containing over 40,000 inhabitants, only five were Southern cities.</p>
                    <p>The imports into the States south of Maryland, in 1859, amounted to
                        $13,000,000 or one-twentieth only of the whole importation of the country. A
                        revenue was derived from the post offices in the free States, while in the
                        slave States the expenditure exceeded the receipts annually by $3,500,000.
                        The total agricultural and manufactured products of the North were sixty per
                        cent, in value above those of the South.</p>
                    <p>The North contributed five-sixths of the Federal revenue; even including
                        cotton, the exports of the South were $22,000,000 below those of the North,
                        and the imports of the free States exceeded those of the slave States by
                        $216,000,000. The improved lands of the South were only as ten per cent,
                        against fifteen per cent in the North, and land thus occupied was worth six
                        dollars per acre in the slave States, and nineteen dollars in the free
                        States.</p>
                    <p>When we add to these considerations that the proportional representation
                        gives the free States 150 Representatives and the slave States only 84, and
                        that the economic exigencies of slavery require new territory to replace the
                        overrun and exhausted lands of its reckless and nomadic cotton cultivation,
                        we can understand how the South, groaning under these disabilities and
                        wilfully blind to their cause, adopted the idea that the North was the fatal
                        incubus which pressed it to the ground.</p>
                    <p>In the list of grievances put forward the Seceders have not been honest with
                        themselves or the country. They raise false issues and conceal the true
                        ones. They go out to gratify the mad ambition of their party leaders, who,
                        because they have lost the control of the Union, seek its destruction, that
                        they may rule a fragment of it--the avarice of their commercial men, who
                        gloat over the riches to be poured into their coffer by free trade--and the
                        craving demands of their planters for new territory and fertile soil. They
                        go out to rid themselves of the moral coercion of Northern sentiment, to
                        pursue that brilliant ignus fatuus of a tropical destiny which forever
                        floats before the eyes of their politicians, and to found an empire of which
                        slavery shall be the distinctive characteristic and controlling
                    interest."</p>

                <summary>Reprint of a proclamation issued by Claiborne F. Jackson, the governor of
                    Missouri, reminding the residents of that state that their first allegiance is
                    to their state and that they have no obligation to "obey the unconstitutional
                    edicts of the military despotism which has inaugurated itself at Washington."
                    The Dispatch comments that the speech demonstrates the underhanded methods that
                    Jackson has used in attempting to bring about Missouri's secession.</summary>

                    <p>There is one great consolation, with regard to the abundant pilferings and
                        preparations of the rebels. Thirty years ago they began to prepare for the
                        contest in which they are now engaged. With the President, Cabinet and other
                        high officials fixed to suit them, in the last Presidential epoch, they have
                        succeeded in stealing all the guns they had men to carry; a quantity of
                        cannon any young nation might be proud of--if honestly obtained--and a large
                        proportion of the forts embraced within the Slave States. With nothing
                        especially lacking, that they would be likely to have on hand, if they had
                        still postponed the attempt several years, they have a fair chance to show
                        what they can do. If they fail now, with every advantage on their side that
                        they could ever expect to have, they will be apt to relinquish the attempt
                        forever. If Fremont or Lincoln had been elected President when Buchanan was,
                        and they had only been able to steal a moiety of what they now hold, and
                        yet, in desperation, had ventured on the insurrection and been speedily
                        quelled, neither party would have been satisfied. The Disunionists would
                        have been ever looking forward to a time when they should have a fair chance
                        to show their ability, and the Unionists would have been ever fearing such
                        an occurrence, and suspicious that, in such a case the rebel cause might
                        prosper. It is apparent now, that the Southern gentlemen who have been
                        complaining so long, according to Mr. Russell, that the Yankees will not
                        give them dueling satisfaction, are, at last, certain to get very decided
                        satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>This view of the case should reconcile us to the loss of millions upon
                        millions of property stolen, and even to the loss of life that most
                        certainly ensue before the great guns are all made to "sing small." The
                        cannon seizing in Norfolk is the source of much regret, but, in this view,
                        every one of them may be regarded as a maker of permanent peace, though the
                        retaking of them from Americans may be found a very different thing from
                        capturing Mexican batteries.</p>

                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Valley Spirit</emph> of the 15th, under the above
                        head, speaks of the Merryman case, characterizing it as "the attempt to
                        trample on the Constitution, by destroying the great writ of <emph
                            rend="italic">Habeas Corpus</emph>." This is but another attempt on the
                        part of this sympathiser with traitors, to cast a stigma upon the
                        Administration of Mr. Lincoln, create a distrust of the same, and throw a
                        damper upon the ardor of our people in their patriotic efforts to maintain
                        our Constitutional liberties by overthrowing the traitors sworn to destroy
                        them, and who are in the closest bond of alliance with the people who
                        say--"If we only had one of the Royal family of England to rule over us, we
                        should be content."</p>
                    <p>The right to set aside the <emph rend="italic">Habeas Corpus</emph> is
                        distinctly stated in our Constitution. It has been done in the history of
                        our own country in several instances, as shown by the able article in the
                            <emph rend="italic">National Intelligencer</emph>, to which we referred
                        in our issue of the 7th, and we should not have referred to it again was it
                        not that the manifest injustice of the <emph rend="italic">Spirit's</emph>
                        article, and its tone--so similar to that of the Baltimore <emph
                            rend="italic">Exchange</emph>, a rank secession paper--compels us to do
                        so. The facts are: </p>
                    <p>This Merryman is a rabid secessionist, and was in open communication with the
                        enemy in time of war. He had committed overt acts of treason, of which there
                        is the strongest proof. Gen. Cadwallader, then commandant of that Military
                        District, ordered his arrest, as he had a perfect right to do, as a prisoner
                        of war, and the only error committed, if any, was the wording of Gen.
                        Cadwallader's return to Judge Taney.</p>

                        place; that when the said J. M. came into the custody of this defendant, and
                        from thence hitherto, this defendant was a Brigadier-General in one of the
                        said hostile armies, to wit: in the Army of the United States, and in the
                        actual command of a portion of said army, and of the Military Department of
                        -------, as created and defined by the President of the United States
                        through the department of War; that the within named J. M. has not been
                        arrested or detained under any civil process, or pretence of civil process,
                        or for the purpose of committal into the hands of the civil tribunals for
                        trial; but that being friendly to and connected with the hostile army, he
                        was engaged in assisting their operations against the Army of the United
                        States, and for that reason was captured in said Department under my
                        command, by troops under my command, as a prisoner of war: and he is now
                        held and detained by me in my capacity of Brigadier-General as a prisoner of
                        war of the Army of the United States."</p>
                    <p>In suggesting the above form of return, Gov. R. sustains it with indisputable
                        argument, from which we take the following:</p>
                    <p>A return substantially of this tenor, (while it would not at all prevent
                        handing Mr. J. M. over to the Courts for trial for treason, or any other
                        offence, when the Government was ready to do so), would, it seems to me, at
                        once paralyze the Judge for further action on the habeas corpus, and put an
                        end to the controversy. The opinion of the Chief Justice, which, with much
                        plausibility, attacks the summary action of a military commander in
                        arresting and detaining a citizen without process for the commission of an
                        offence indictable in the Courts, would become so inapplicable that he would
                        be ashamed to use if, for the point presented to his decision would be
                        entirely changed. No Judge could gainsay or controvert the force of such a
                        return, as it seems to me, except upon absurd and untenable ground. He would
                        be compelled to thrust his judicial authority into the camp of a fighting
                        army, and dispute with the commander the right to decide who are and who are
                        not proper prisoners of war; and, having usurped the power to judge of that
                        question, he must then, upon evidence given before him, decide that J. M.
                        had not committed any act to justify his being captured and detained as a
                        prisoner of war. All this he must do before he could escape the force of the
                        facts stated in the return; and he would be wrong at every step.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Harrisburg <emph rend="italic">Telegraph</emph>, in advocating stricter
                        discipline among our soldiers, refers sneeringly to the complaints about the
                        clothing furnished, saying that we do not want "critics on the art of making
                        shoes and breeches"--that "whether complaints be well or ill founded, if
                        they tend to detract from the discipline or effectiveness of army they
                        should be treated as insubordination, and punished as such." We assent to
                        the demand for strict discipline, but we protest against any attempt to
                        close the mouths of our gallant soldiers when thieving or dishonest
                        officials attempt to impose upon them. Our volunteers are American citizens,
                        many of them having left pleasant homes and lucrative employment to go to
                        their country's defence. They are the peers of any man in the nation. The
                        men must not, therefore, be gagged; but if they are wronged, theirs is the
                        right to state their grievances, and we shall ever sustain them in that
                        right. It would be a very pleasant thing for those who would plunder the
                        soldiers, to have the right to require silence of them, on the ground that
                        complaints affect discipline, but the country will never justify such
                        protection to villainy. We feel that there are plenty of scoundrels watching
                        like hyenas to prey on the soldiers or the country wherever opportunity may
                        offer, and we require the fullest and freest liberty of expression to guard
                        against them or to expose and punish them. We war on the plunderers of the
                        North, in whatever shape they take, with as bitter a hostility as we can
                        bring against secession. We can, therefore, give no countenance to any plan
                        for covering up their sins.</p>
                    <p>The above is from the <emph rend="italic">Lebanon Courier</emph> of the 13th
                        inst. It is simply just, and ought to elicit the assent of every man in
                        Pennsylvania. Reducing soldiers to mere machines will, perhaps, do well
                        enough in the armies of the despotic governments of Europe, but in our "free
                        and equal" acknowledging country, where thousands in the ranks are in every
                        way equal (and in numerous instances far superior) to the officers who
                        command them, it cannot and must not be done. If mind is superior to matter,
                        then let all the mind possible be brought into action. Let our soldiers feel
                        that, in entering our army, they never threw off their manhood. Then
                        insubordination will not be complained of; subordination will not be forced,
                        and the men will fight and obey in the same manner and spirit in which they
                        enrolled their names as volunteers in the Army of Liberty.</p>
