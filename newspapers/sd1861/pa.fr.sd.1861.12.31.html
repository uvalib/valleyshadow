<b>The Contraband Question</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Relates a proposal being considered in Congress for solving the question of
                    what to do with slaves in the custody of the federal government.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Prominent members of Congress are considering a new proposition for the
                        solution of the "Contraband" question, in order to avoid the expense of
                        supporting crowds of slaves in idleness, and to furnish the American mills
                        with cotton. They take the ground that the Indian territory west of
                        Louisiana and Arkansas was ceded to the United States by treaty, and on
                        certain conditions. Without provocation they have violated the treaties and
                        "levied war" on the United States, thus rendering the treaties null and
                        void.--The countries thus reverting to the Government embraces the valleys
                        of the Red, Arkansas and other rivers, and contain about twenty millions of
                        acres of cotton land, of unsurpassed fertility, capable of producing about
                        fifteen millions of bales of cotton per annum.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed to apply the principle of Benton's "Florida Armed Occupation
                        Act," and send all "contrabands" to this Territory, and apprentice them to
                        the settlers upon these cotton lands, leaving the question of their final
                        disposition to be settled by Congress at the close of the war. All
                        contrabands, as fast as they come into camp, to be promptly forwarded
                        thither.</p>
                    <p>The country is approached from St. Louis through Springfield, a distance of
                        three hundred miles. The remainder of the railroad from Rolla, through
                        Springfield to Fort Smith can be completed in twelve months. It is said that
                        the plantations of the Choctaws and Chickassaws alone could fully supply the
                        American mills, even in the first year of the experiment.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The day was observed by a general suspension of business by our people.</p>
                    <p>Gen. O. Seilhamer, Esq., delivered his original, humorous and descriptive
                        Poem, entitled "The Times," to a respectable audience, in Franklin Hall. It
                        is a creditable composition, and during its recitation was frequently
                        applauded. The same Poem delivered by "Doesticks," Saxe, Benjamin, or some
                        other noted lecturer, would be pronounced by many a first-rate production.</p>
                    <p>On Christmas eve, the Lutheran Sabbath School, under the care of its
                        excellent Superintendent, G. R. Messersmith, Esq., held a Musical Festival
                        in the Church, which was largely attended. A number of pieces were played
                        and sung in fine style, alternately, by an orchestra, and some twenty of the
                        Sabbath School children. The children, who were dressed in white, occupied a
                        platform in front of the pulpit, made a very interesting and imposing
                        appearance. The decorations of the Church were very neat and attractive--a
                        large star, formed of jets of burning gas, above the platform, adding such
                        to the beauty and harmony of the whole.</p>

                    <p>Hayti is naturally attracting the attention of the intelligent colored men of
                        this country, and within the last two years several large companies have
                        left different ports in our country for that genial clime. A few months ago
                        some twenty-six colored persons from Bellfonte and Lewistown, Pa., left New
                        York for Hayti, and highly favorable accounts have been received from the
                        emigrants.</p>
                    <p>The following is the invitation of President Geffrard to the colored people
                        of the world to emigrate to Hayti:</p>
                    <p>"Invitation.--Hayti will soon regain her ancient splendor. This marvellous
                        [sic] soil that our fathers, blessed by God, conquered for us, will soon
                        yield to us the wealth now hidden in its bosom. Let our black and yellow
                        brethren, scattered through the Antilles, and North and South America,
                        hasten to co-operate with us in restoring the glory of the Republic. Hayti
                        is the common country of the black race. Our ancestors, in taking posession
                        [sic] of it, were careful to announce in the Constitution that they
                        published that all the descendants of Africans, and of the inhabitants of
                        the West Indies, belong by right to the Haytian family. The idea was grand
                        and generous.</p>
                    <p>"Listen, then, all ye negroes and mulattoes who, in the vast continent of
                        America, suffer from the prejudices of caste. The Republic calls you; she
                        invites you to bring to her your arms and your minds. The regenerating work
                        that she undertakes interests all colored people and their descendants, no
                        matter what their origin or where their place of birth.</p>
                    <p>"Hayti, regaining her former position, retaking her ancient sceptre as Queen
                        of the Antilles, will be a formal denial, most eloquent and peremptory,
                        against those detractors of our race who contest our desire and ability to
                        attain a high degree of civilization.</p>
                    <p>GEFFRARD."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are indebted to the kindness of Mr. David Piper, of this place, for the
                        following letter, taken from the body of a Rebel soldier, of the 10th
                        Alabama regiment, who was among the killed at Dranesville. It confirms the
                        statements we have frequently published of the great destitution prevailing
                        at the South in the articles of food and clothing. We publish it almost
                        entire, although we have endeavored to make it somewhat more readable than
                        the original:</p>
                    <p>Talladega, Ala., Nov. 5, 1861.</p>
                    <p>Dear Son:--I seat myself to write you a few lines
                        to let you know how we all are in the possession of good health, hoping
                        these lines may find you enjoying the same blessing. I have neglected
                        writing to you, and will now endeavor to make atonement by writing you a
                        long, interesting letter. There is nothing here but hard times and distress
                        for every mother that has a son in the army; but we try to make the best of
                        it we can, and you boys must do the same. You ought to prepare your immortal
                        souls for eternity, for none of you know the moment when you will be called
                        hence. Don't put off the day of preparation, and think it won't be you that
                        will be called, for it may as likely be you as any other. Don't forget the
                        endearments of home--father, mother, brothers and sisters--yet don't grieve
                        about home. I can't help but think that the day will come when we shall
                        welcome you and all the boys home once more. We mourn the dead, and feel
                        anxious for any of you that are sick. Mrs. Dickerson is greatly grieved
                        about her son, Tip, and I am sorry for her.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing talked about here, but something to eat--that is, meat and
                        coffee. Almost half of the families in this part of the country are drinking
                        rye coffee, for there is no coffee to get for love or money, nor won't be
                        until Lincoln's blockade is torn up. They have bursted [sic] them up at
                        Charleston and New Orleans, and such a cry for wool to make clothes for the
                        soldiers I never heard. The ladies here are still hard at work for the
                        soldiers. I sewed last week for Captain Ed. Turner's company, and could
                        hardly save enough wool to make clothes for the little children. All the
                        ladies in this country wear homespun--the rich as well as the poor. There is
                        nothing in the stores here, and it is nothing uncommon to see a lady at
                        church with a homespun dress on.</p>
                    <p>Tell James Lewis his pa and ma stayed here last night, and they are all well.
                        Your uncle and aunt Abner stayed with us a few nights back, and they were
                        all well. Pa says to tell you he is gathering his corn, and it is very good.
                        He says he will make four times as much as he did last year. He says, "burst
                        up them Yankees and come home," for he has got three good fire-places in the
                        house now, and he will have you a big fire on, so you can take a good
                        warming. You said in your letter you sent me a lock of your hair, but it
                        never came. You must send it yet. Don't have your hair trimmed no more this
                        winter, for it will make you take cold. I have got more clothes for you, and
                        you must write for them long before you need them, so as to give me a chance
                        to send them by some one. I have woven you a blanket and some woolen
                        drawers, and I wish you now had them. Your pa says he has tried all over
                        town to get you a hat, and he can't find one that is worth carrying home. He
                        says if he can't do any better, he will have to send you your old one. He
                        says it is no use to talk about boots, for we can hardly get enough leather
                        to make shoes, as the speculators have been round, and bought up all the
                        leather, and make the people pay just such prices as they please. We can't
                        get any kind of shoes for less than $2,50 or $3,00, and there will be many a
                        one will have to go barefooted here this winter, for there is no money to
                        buy with.</p>
                    <p>"Your sister and Tom were married the first Sunday of October. They were
                        married at our house at nine o'clock in the morning, and went to church at
                        Concord. Be sure, my son, to write by every chance, for it was five weeks
                        that I got no letter from you, and I was sure you were sick. Tell Tip Sis
                        got his letter, and tell him to take good care of himself, and try to get
                        well. When any of the boys write, just ask them to say you are well, for we
                        do dread sickness for you so much. I do not know who are in your mess, but
                        try and be agreeable, for if you don't, it will come here and cause talk.</p>
                    <p>We hear almost everything that is done at your encampment. Be certain to let
                        me know if you want your blanket, for I wish to send it to you. I have sent
                        your envelopes, and also scraps of jeans to patch you pants with, in Tip's
                        and Aleck's clothes, and have marked them to you. Write to me whether your
                        butter and ham spoilt or not, for I was in hope they would reach you safely,
