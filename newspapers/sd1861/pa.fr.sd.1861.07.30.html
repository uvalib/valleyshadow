<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Sunday evening, the Chambers Artillery, Companies A &amp; B, returned
                        safe to gladden the hearts of their families and friends. It is said that
                        they have not lost a single man, although there are several in ill health at
                        present. They have been detained for about a week in Harrisburg, awaiting
                        their pay, having drawn "nary red" in the three months of their service. We
                        are glad to hail the safe return of these men, who in the hour of emergency,
                        threw themselves into the breach for the preservation of their country, and
                        whether one of them re-enlists or not they all deserve a soldier's welcome
                        and a soldier's honors.</p>
                    <p>Although many of the three months men have not been in actual battle, they
                        have experienced all the hardships of the soldier's life, prevented the
                        ravages o the enemy upon our soil, and stood ready to meet the threatened
                        invasion with proper spirit and energy. Let all who desire to cavil at the
                        return of our men, just remember their own anxiety when these men first
                        enlisted for their defence. Their own hearts will then answer their own
                        questions.</p>
