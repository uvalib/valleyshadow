<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Every intelligent voter will understand the importance of sending true Union
                        men to the Legislature. If the Breckinridge Democracy should succeed in
                        deceiving the honest voters of Pennsylvania and thereby securing a majority
                        of their kind of patriots in that body,
                        Pennsylvania will be dishonored by having her Senators in Congress
                        instructed to vote for Peace and Compromise with the Rebels, and it must not
                        be forgotten that Compromise with the Rebels upon any other terms than an
                        unconditional surrender to the authority of the Government is Treason to the
                        Constitution and the Union, and a virtual surrender of every principle that
                        makes us proud of our Country and her institutions.</p>
                    <p>See to it, then, by ever honorable effort that you can exert, that John Rowe
                        and W. W. Sellers is [sic] triumphantly elected. The larger their majority,
                        the greater will be the rebuke you will administer to the enemies of the
                        Union. Lag not in your efforts this day while the polls are open and there
                        is a vote to be cast. Exert yourselves to secure that vote for Rowe and
                        Sellers--for the whole Union Ticket--and for Freedom. One vote, this day,
                        may be of the most momentous importance, and might decide the political
                        complexion [sic] of the next Legislature, and upon the action of the
                        Legislature may hang the fate of the Union! Who can tell? For our country's
                        sake, then--for the sake of humanity, and for Freedom here as well as for
                        the oppressed, struggling masses of the Old World, who are gazing with
                        trembling anxiety as to the result of the struggle in which Freedom and
                        Slavery are now engaged in our midst--for these reasons and for every other
                        consideration that should be cherished by Freemen, we conjure you to a
                        faithful, unwearied, unflagging discharge of your duty.</p>
                    <p>The despots and enemies of Freedom throughout the world are rejoiced at the
                        wicked rebellion which is now so severely testing the strength of the Union,
                        and which they fondly expect will ultimate in the destruction of the
                        Republic. Let no vote of yours, then, either contribute to their
                        gratification of the more inexcusable and detestable enemies in our midst. A
                        political victory may result in more beneficial consequences with regard to
                        the perpetuity of our Union than the most sanguinary battle-field; then let
                        to-day's sun set upon a triumph of the entire Union Ticket.</p>
