<b>The Union Ticket</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges that at this time of crisis, people of all parties must support the
                    Union ticket.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Every patriot, every local citizen and every lover of good Government, should
                        support the Union ticket. The situation in which our country was placed
                        imperatively demanded that party strife should cease until the storm which
                        threatened the very existence of our Government, had passed and we were
                        assured that we had a Government to be transmitted to our children. It was
                        an act of magnanimity on the part of Republicans, so far as the spoils of
                        office were concerned, to propose and adopt the Union policy. Yet any other
                        action on their part, at such a time, would have been utterly unworthy the
                        character of a patriotic people. They rose above all selfish feelings and
                        with them, a noble band of their fellow-citizens of the Democratic party and
                        formed a ticket of the very best material: a ticket on which the Democratic
                        party was fully and fairly represented. Democrats in other days were proud
                        to vote for such men as James Nill, John Rowe and D. K. Wunderilch. These
                        men have all been nominated and supported by their party for important
                        offices at different times, and have but recently discharged the duty of
                        their respective offices to the entire satisfaction of their party. But what
                        gave them a peculiar fitness for the position assigned them on the Union
                        ticket was their energetic support of the Union cause, both in word and
                        action. We hold, then, that a ticket so formed, at a time so critical,
                        should have been supported by men of all parties. This Union policy should
                        have superceded [sic] the necesity [sic] of any party ticket. What, if some
                        of the Democratic nominees had never been nominated? Is it so important to
                        the community or the country that the loyalty of such men as Augustus
                        Duncan, Christian D. Lesher or Dr. Wm. H. Boyle should be endorsed, on a
                        ticket which of course will be defeated, by a party action? We hope good and
                        loyal Democrats will join us in supporting and electing men whose loyalty
                        "is seen and read of all men."</p>
