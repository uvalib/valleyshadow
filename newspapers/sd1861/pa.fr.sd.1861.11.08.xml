                    command one of the Kentucky Brigades, primarily because he is from an old
                    Kentucky family, and thus Birney's selection should please the people of that

                <summary>The Dispatch protests the removal of General Fremont from the command of
                    the Western Department, or Army of the Mississippi. Predicts that Fremont's
                    removal at a time when a battle seems eminent will do harm to the army, since
                    the men trusted and respected Fremont.</summary>
