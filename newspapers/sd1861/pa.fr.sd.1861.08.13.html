<b>N. Y. Herald's Proposition</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Suggests that slaves should be taken from the "300,000 rebel aristocrats
                    who now own them" and sold for $25 a piece to the "750,000 poor whites" of the
                    South. This scheme would turn the poor whites into Union men, and the government
                    would receive $750 million, "or rather more than enough to pay the whole cost of
                    the war."<br>

                    "makes it quite clear" that the army was not ready for the advance on Bull Run.
                    However, the action could not be delayed, because the term of service of most of

                    day's provisions for an army of that size. With baggage and ammunition, an army

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday afternoon last, Constable Gross arrested a man for fast riding
                        through our streets, which is in violation of a Borough Ordinance. He was
                        taken before L. S. Clarke, Esq., Burges, when he paid the fine imposed. It
                        would be a very fine thing if more were arrested and fined for the same
                        offence, as there is a deal of risk of life and limb incurred by children
                        particularly, owing to fast riding and driving on our thoroughfares.</p>

<b>Forced to Leave</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports the departure of Mr. Jno. W. Shinefield and his family from
                    Ravenswood in Jackson County, Virginia, where they had lived for the past five
                    years, and their arrival in Chambersburg. The Shinefields left Virginia because
                    of their Union sentiments and because Governor Wise's forces were approaching
                    the town. The Dispatch criticizes the eight tavern owners in Harrisburg who
                    refused the Shinefields hospitality.<br>(Names in announcement: Mr. Jno. W. Shinefield)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Jno. W. Shinefield, son of Mr. Shinefield, late Steward of our Alms
                        House, with his wife and four children, arrived in our midst on last Friday,
                        under very distressing circumstances. For five or more years past, Mr. S.
                        has been a resident of Ravenswood, Jackson County, Va., where he carried on
                        the merchant tailoring. The people of the town in which he resided, owing to
                        their Union sentiments, and for fear of being forced into the rebel ranks by
                        Gov. Wise, who was approaching the place with his rebel forces,
                        precipitately crossed the river into Ohio, with whatever of their property
                        they could hastily gather up. Mr. S. succeeded in taking but a small
                        quantity of his goods, leaving behind nearly all that he was worth, which of
                        course, fell into the hands of the enemy. With his family he then endeavored
                        to make his way to this County, his former residence, with what difficulty
                        any person may well imagine, as he had but a small amount of money when he
                        left Virginia. He succeeded, however, thro' much trouble, in reaching
                        Harrisburg, where he supposed he had escaped the ferocity of the rebels and
                        reached a humane and civilized community, but judge of his surprise when, on
                        application to obtain lodgings and something to eat for his family, he was
                        denied entertainment by the proprietors of eight different Public Houses! He
                        was refused this after a statement of his situation and after offering
                        everything he possessed in pledge for payment. Mr. Shinefield would have had
                        to lodge his little ones in the Market-house but for the kindness of a
                        police officer, we believe, who took them to his home. Mr. S. and family are
                        of genteel appearance, and why such cold-blooded inhumanity should be
                        exhibited towards him, we are at a loss to say. One thing is certain, the
                        names of these hotel proprietors should be made known, and their houses
                        shunned by all decent people.</p>
