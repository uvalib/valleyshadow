                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>"A journal, calling itself the <emph rend="italic">Day-Book</emph>, has been
                        published in New York city, and has not only made itself infamous by its
                        traitorous attacks upon the Government, but has rendered it necessary for
                        the Administration to suppress it, as a measure of self-preservation."</p>
                    <p>The above statement we clip from the last number of <emph rend="italic">The
                            Times</emph>, a paper published in this place, whose editor is now
                        engaged in the <emph rend="italic">interesting</emph> exercise of trying to
                        ride two horses at the same time--the Union and the Rebel. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">The Times</emph> admits that the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Day-Book</emph> was not only "infamous," but that it became "necessary
                        for the Administration to suppress it, as a measure of self-preservation."
                        Many Breckinridge Democrats of this County were patrons of the <emph
                            rend="italic">Day-Book</emph>, and if we are not misinformed, Mr. Orr,
                        the President of the Democratic County Convention, was one of them. One
                        thing is true, that during the day that the Convention was in session in our
                        town, the Book Store of Messrs. Shyock &amp; Smith, where newspapers and
                        periodicals are sold, was literally beseiged [sic] by Democratic delegates
                        to obtain copies of the <emph rend="italic">Day-Book</emph>, <emph
                            rend="italic">N. Y. News</emph>, and other similar "infamous" sheets.
                        Another thing is true--that these same Democratic patrons of the "infamous"
                            <emph rend="italic">Day-Book</emph> have been most earnest and bitter in
                        their denunciation of the Administration for having stopped its publication,
                        which, <emph rend="italic">The Times</emph> admits, was "owing to its
                        traitorous attacks upon the Government" and which was rendered necessary "as
                        a measure of self-preservation."</p>
                    <p>In characterizing these friends of <emph rend="italic">The Times</emph> and
                        former patrons of the "infamous" <emph rend="italic">Day-Book</emph>, as
                        "Day-Book Democrats," thus intimating that all such were no better friends
                        of the Union than they ought to be, our professed Union friend of <emph
                            rend="italic">The Times</emph> charges us with being a "calumniator."</p>
                    <p>A man who gives "aid and comfort" to the enemy is a <emph rend="italic"
                            >traitor</emph> who patronizes and promotes the circulation of a paper
                        which <emph rend="italic">The Times</emph> has denounced as "infamous,"
                        owing to "its traitorous attacks upon the Government," and which, "as a
                        measure of self-preservation," the Administration was compelled to suppress?
                        Is not the support of such a paper as the "infamous" <emph rend="italic">Day
                            Book</emph>, giving "aid and comfort" to the enemy? If it is, are not
                        the <emph rend="italic">Day Book</emph> Democrats, over whom <emph
                            rend="italic">The Times</emph> is now spreading its wings, guilty of
                        treason? If so, are they not <emph rend="italic">traitors</emph>? We pause
                        for a reply. </p>
