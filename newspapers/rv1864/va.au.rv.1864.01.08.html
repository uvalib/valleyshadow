<b>Augusta Raid Guards</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor notes an article from the Rockingham Register that discusses the
                    arrival and quick departure of Northern troops at Harrisonburg, but that fails
                    to mention the involvement of the Augusta Raid Guard in the operations there.
                    The Augusta Guard had "just undergone such severe and unaccustomed hardships at
                    North and Shenandoah Mountains" but assembled and went to Rockingham County
                    anyway. The Vindicator's editor assumes that the Register's editor must not have
                    been able to distinguish the Augusta Guard from the regular soldiers, a
                    situation highly complimentary to the home guard. The editor praises the men of
                    the county who participated even though they were not members of the home guard
                    and hopes that everyone eligible will participate or else risk public censure.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Augusta Raid Guards.</p>
                    <p>We read the interesting article of our co[n]temporary of the "Rockingham
                        Register" descriptive of the arrival of the Yankees at Harrisonburg, their
                        doings while there and their hasty exit, and although disappointed in seeing
                        the mention made of those men of Augusta, who had but just undergone such
                        severe and unaccustomed hardships at North and Shenandoah Mountains, and who
                        again assembled and with commendable alacrity started to meet the enemy then
                        threatening the neighboring county of Rockingham, and perhaps through it to
                        our own beloved Augusta, yet gratified to think that our neighbor of the
                        "Register," with all his discrimination, was unable to distinguish the
                        "Augusta Raid Guards" from regular soldiers. This must have been the case,
                        and is very complimentary to the Guards, for we are satisfied that our
                        neighbor's kindly feelings for Augusta and her citizens would not have
                        permitted him knowingly to have omitted to notice the men of Augusta, who
                        had hurriedly, unhesitatingly, willingly gone forth to assist in defending
                        the homes of Rockingham.</p>
                    <p>It is needless to mention the services of those who were connected with the
                        Guards, for that is well known, but it may not be known that there were
                        others not connected with any organization who accompanied them. This is
                        greatly to their praise, some of them having no pecuniary interest here. The
                        few that remained who were able to go have no twitchings of conscience
                        perhaps but must bear the censure of all for time to come.</p>

<b>To Our Patrons</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor responds to numerous inquiries as to why the Vindicator has not
                    been published for the three preceding weeks. During the first week, much of the
                    office staff went with the Augusta Raid Guards to North Mountain and returned on
                    Thursday, the day before the paper should have been issued. During the second
                    week, they were involved with the Guard in Harrisonburg and returned home on
                    Friday, the day the paper should have been issued. During the third week the
                    editor gave his employees time off for Christmas. The editor hopes that no
                    further impediments lie in the way of continuous publication in the future.<br>

                    <p>To Our Patrons.</p>
                    <p>Many of our patrons have called to enquire the reasons of the failure to
                        receive their papers for the last three weeks and as it is not generally
                        known we take this occasion of informing all, and earnestly hope the reason
                        may be as satisfactory to others as to those we have seen. We have not
                        published it. And why? Every one connected with the office who could go went
                        with the "Augusta Raid Guards" to North Mountain to assist, if possible, in
                        meeting the threatening raid of Averill from that direction, and returning
                        thence on Thursday the 17th December, consequently too late to issue it. On
                        the following Sunday they went down the Valley with the Guards again to meet
                        the enemy, who came as far as Harrisonburg, and only returned, after the
                        enemy were driven below New Market on the Next Friday, the day it should
                        have been issued and again too late when Christmas week intervened, and on
                        account of their incessant labors for the year and their late, cold,
                        disagreeable and arduous campaigns, we thought it but just that they, weary
                        and nearly broken down, should rest. We sincerely hope that there may be no
                        impediments in the way of issuing the "Vindicator" continuously hereafter,
                        and as far as in us lies will endeavor that it shall reach all
                    regularly.</p>

<b>Treason</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A treatise entitled "An appeal to the honest and reasoning-minded people of
                    the Northern and Southern States of America" supposedly was published in
                    Petersburg, but the editor suspects it is the product of the traitorous Raleigh
                    (North Carolina) Standard. The treatise advocates buying and freeing slaves and
                    reuniting with the North at the end of Lincoln's administration. The editor
                    hopes that the people of Petersburg will trace the authorship of the treatise
                    and "relieve that noble city of the stigma of having issued such a treasonable
                    production."<br>

                    has never had reason to question the source of that information. The editor has

                        from the County of Augusta alone, and as we had no data to go upon we
                        supposed those who asserted it knew best and of course did not refute the
