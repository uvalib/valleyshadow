                        theft was confessed but the evidence adduced not being sufficient to
                        establish the burglary, they were sentenced to receive thirty-nine lashes
                        and their respective owners bound in the sum of $10,000 each for their good

                <summary>According to the census of 1860, the population of the former entire United
                    States had 730,000 more males than females, with males outnumbering females in
                    every state except New York and Massachusetts. In polygamous Utah, the ratio was
                    nearly equal. The diminution of the male population because of the war,
                    therefore, will not be as disastrous to the future population of the country as
                    might be supposed. Had these 730,000 unattached men been "properly mated," they
                    would never have found the time to arouse the disunion in politics that resulted
                    in the war. The more balanced population that will follow the war should provide
                    the insurance for peace in the future. This article does not seem to be from the
                    editor of the Vindicator but is not attributed.</summary>

                    <p>If it be true, as stated, that fifty per cent, of the army is absent from the
                        field, it is manifest that the efficiency of the service and the general
                        interests of the country will be better secured by the adoption of such
                        measures as will remedy this evil, than by legislating for the enrollment of
                        other classes of citizens. There is a serious defect somewhere, either in
                        the organization of discipline of the army. There has not a single reverse
                        occurred to our arms since the [war] began, which would not most probably
                        have been avoided, had one-half of the absentees been present to fill our
                        exhausted ranks. Is this evil remediless? If it is not, the first duty of
                        the Government is to correct it. If the forces which we have already
                        enrolled are not sufficient to repel the invaders, then the Congress cannot
                        too soon provide for an additional enrollment; but, if by arresting the evil
                        of straggling, unauthorized absences and desertions, the armies in the field
                        can be rendered equal to the emergencies of the service, then there ought to
                        be no additional enrollment, because the social and industrial interests of
                        the country require that every man whose presence in the army is not needed
                        there, should be permitted to remain at home.--<emph rend="italic">Columbus
