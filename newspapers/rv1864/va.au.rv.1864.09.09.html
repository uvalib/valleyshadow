<b>From the United States</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Nothing of interest appears in the recently received Northern newspapers
                    except the proceedings of the Democratic convention in Chicago. The Democratic
                    platform included resolutions noting the failure of the war and calling for
                    peace; condemning the interference of the military in recent elections in
                    Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, and Delaware; stating the purpose of the
                    Democratic party to be to procure peace and protect states' rights; and
                    condemning the current administration's policy towards prisoners of war.<br>

<b>Bad Eggs and Things</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Rather than complain about the lack of steak or about poor crop output,
                    people in the South can turn to other food sources that are readily available.
                    This article notes the availability of mushrooms, rats, frogs, and snails, items
                    that are commonly consumed in other parts of the world and that would alleviate
                    the danger of people going hungry in the South.<br>

                    <p>Bad Eggs and Things.</p>
                    <p>A great many people are unhappy if they can't have beefsteak for dinner, or
                        lament the failure of the vegetables this season. We pity the helplessness
                        of such poor creatures. The earth, the air, the waters abound in materials
                        for food. Almost anything that you can crack is good to eat. Since the
                        refreshing rains, with an ingenious friend of ours, we have been gathering
                        mushrooms. He is a person of exceedingly active appetite, and is ever ready
                        to lend us his experience in the preparation of a breakfast. With prejudices
                        against what we had vulgally [sic] associated with the agaric muscarius, or
                        devil's snuff box, and which we ascertained from our friend was a fungus
                        putting up from decayed vegetables, or decomposing animal matter--we have
                        found the champignon a most delightful article of food--a rare and notable
                        delicacy. Care only must be taken in the selection, the rules for which may
                        be found in Miss Leslie's familiar Cookery Book. The Agaric Campestri, or
                        common mushroom, is found out on the commons, in grassy lanes, in meadows,
                        &amp;c. It is cooked with milk, butter and crackers--seasoned with salt
                        and pepper. Care is to be taken in the distinguishing between the good and
                        the bad, as we have remarked, as the calling of the toad stool has the
                        effect of killing you.</p>
                    <p>Among the most difficult articles of food to procure now are bread and salt;
                        that these are not absolutely necessary, is proven by the fact that the
                        Laplanders never taste either; they substitute animal oil and exercise.</p>
                    <p>Rats are another well known, but neglected source
                        of commissary supplies. The Chinese have them in their markets, just as we
                        have hares and partridges.</p>
                    <p>Frogs are said to be of exquisite flavor, and are numerous, almost any
                        evening on Main street. An excellent article, akin to this, is fried snails. They are greatly relished in l'aria.
                        Almost any well is full of them." (not fried.)</p>
                    <p>The young rook is eaten in England, and as we know of no difference between
                        the rook, and the crow, we do not see why young crows may not be eaten, or,
                        indeed, in war times, old crows.</p>
                    <p>For consumptive people, snakes are excellent: the receipt for making
                        viper-broth may be found in the pharmacopoea.</p>
                    <p>This month of August is the season for locusts, and numbers may be gathered
                        in any yard. Locusts and wild honey it may be remembered, were the food of a
                        celebrated character, whose example we recall to our Baptist friends.</p>
                    <p>In China, the common earth worm is always in good dinners. They are, we
                        believe, eaten either cooked or raw. Birds' nests would probably answer,
                        though, of course, less delicate. The head of the ass is also greatly
                        fancied by the chinese, as well as cats and dogs, (the latter already known
                        to be numerous here from statistics already published.</p>
                    <p>The old Romans stuffed their pheasants with assafoetida, but this, we take
                        it, is hard to get now. In his feast, in the manner of the ancients, Dr.
                        Smollett speaks of a very pleasant dessert, which was a sort of jelly
                        composed of a mixture of vinegar, pickle and honey, boiled to a proper
                        consistence, and candied assafortida, called among the ancients the laser Syriucum, and esteemed so precious as to be
                        sold to the weight of a silver penny.</p>
                    <p>The article commonly known as "bad eggs" is eaten with avidity in Cochin
                        China, but we have as unconquerable aversion to it.</p>
                    <p>"A word to the wise is sufficient," we merely throw out these hints. Talk
                        about starving the South.--Charlottesville

<b>Chicago Nominees</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor reports the slate of candidates nominated at the recent
                    Democratic convention held in Chicago and waits anxiously to see their letters
                    of acceptance in order to determine their true sentiments towards working for
                    peace. The candidates are General George B. McClellan for President and George
                    H. Pendleton for Vice President. McClellan is thought not to have been fully
                    behind the Northern cause even while in command of the Union army, and
                    Pendleton, Southern born, is said by the Northern press to be among the most
                    extreme of the Copperheads.<br>

                    <p>Chicago Nominees.</p>
                    <p>The Chicago Convention met on the 29th ult., and on the 31st ult., selected
                        Gen. Geo. B. McClellan and Geo. H. Pendleton as its candidates for the
                        Presidency and Vice Presidency, respectively.</p>
                    <p>General McClellan was allied with the war party in the effort to subjugate
                        the Confederate States, but, although some hard things were charged against
                        him, it was always considered as undoubted, while in command of the Union
                        army, that his heart was not wholly in the cause to which he had attached
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>George H. Pendleton is a man of Southern birth and feelings, and is classed
                        by the Northern press among the Copperheads of the "yellowest hue," meaning
                        by that term that he favors the immediate cessation of hostilities, and the
                        acknowledgment of Southern independence.</p>
                    <p>This ticket is thought by some to be the strongest one that could be
                        presented to the Northern people, and was the best, perhaps, that the
                        Convention could make, composed of many elements as it was. it seems to us
                        that out-and-out peace men, on a purely peace platform, was the surest way
                        to defeat Lincoln and secure peace and prosperity to the United States.</p>
                    <p>If the candidate for the Presidency, who once lent his ability to Southern
                        subjugation, "is of the same opinion still," and consequently for coercion
                        if "other peaceable means" fail to restore peace "on the basis of the
                        Federal Union," we cannot see how the change from Lincoln to McClellan can
                        be desired by, or be of advantage to the people of either the United States
                        or the Confederacy; but if he assumes as true, the acknowledgment of the
                        Convention, that "the war to restore the Union, after a four years' trial,
                        is a failure," and believes that, with a cessation of hostilities, the war
                        between the United States and the Confederate States should end, on account
                        of its failure to accomplish the purpose intended--the restoration of the
                        Federal Union--whether peaceable means would accomplish it or not, then
                        would accomplish it or not, then would his election be preferable to that of
                        Lincoln, as the result would be alike beneficial to both republics. His
                        letter of acceptance may give an insight into his present views, and we
                        therefore await with some anxiety its publication.</p>

<b>Democratic Platform</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor joins some of his contemporaries in concluding that the platform
                    adopted at the recent Democratic convention in Chicago is open-ended, awaiting
                    outcome of war developments in the months ahead. If war developments favor the
                    North, then the platform will be able to be interpreted as pro-war and the
                    candidates will support the platform as such. If developments favor the South,
                    however, then the platform will be interpreted as favoring peace. The editor
                    hopes Confederate forces will dominate so that Northerners will be forced to
                    support a peace platform.<br>

                    <p>Democratic Platform.</p>
                    <p>The platform put forth by the Democratic-opposition Convention at Chicago,
                        which we publish in this issue, is the most singular compound of the sort we
                        remember to have seen.</p>
                    <p>If we read it, discarding the second resolution, we are compelled to consider
                        the Democratic-opposition party of the United States as committed to the
                        preservation of the Union at all hazards, even at the risk of national ruin
                        by the continuance of wasting, desolating war, whereas if we discard the
                        first and fourth resolutions, its tone is evidently for a peaceable solution
                        of the difficulties, whether it results in union or separation.</p>
                    <p>We are led to conclude with one or two of our co[n]temporaries, that it was
                        framed to meet coming circumstances. If the result of the campaign of the
                        next two months be favorable to the Union armies, it is a war platform, but
                        if favorable to the Confederate forces, then will the advocates of McClellan
                        and Pendleton herald and proclaim it as the platform of a party whose
                        expressed desire is for peace.</p>
                    <p>Our armies must continue, as they will, to hold their own for a brief time,
                        and the peace party in the North will be a fixed fact. The Northern people
                        will then be demonstrative for peace, and we will speedily, as we must
                        ultimately, wring from them the acknowledgment of our independence.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Provides war news from Atlanta, Petersburg, and the Valley. The article
                    includes details of the fall of Atlanta.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>The wires and the press a few days since gave us the unexpected intelligence
                        that Atlanta, after a gallant and heroic defence of nearly seven weeks, had
                        fallen.</p>
                    <p>After the occupation of the Atlanta and West Point Railroad by the enemy, the
                        close proximity of the Atlanta and Macon Read rendered the holding of
                        Atlanta only a question of a very few days. As General Hood was unable to
                        dislodge the enemy from these railroads, Atlanta was no longer of any use to
                        him, and he therefore vacated it. In the language of one of our
                        co[n]temporaries, "neither General Johnson nor General Hood was able to
                        defeat the enemy, and the place has fallen because there was not men enough
                        to properly defend it."</p>
                    <p>The following is Gen. Hood's official dispatch to the War Department:</p>
                    <p>Headquarters, Sept. 3.</p>
                    <p>On the evening of the 30th August the enemy made a lodgement across Flint
                        river, near Jonesboro. We attacked them there on the evening of the 31st,
                        with two corps, but failed to dislodge them. This made it necessary to
                        abandon Atlanta, which was on the night of the 1st September.</p>
                    <p>Our loss on the evening of the 31st was small.</p>
                    <p>On the evening of the 1st September, Gen Hardee's corps in position at
                        Jonesboro, was assaulted by a superior force of the enemy, and, being
                        outflanked, was compelled to withdrew during the night, with the loss of
                        eight guns.</p>
                    <p>The enemy's prisoners report their loss very severe.</p>
                    <p>J.B. Hood, Gen'l.</p>
                    <p>The evacuation of Atlanta took place on Thursday night, 1st inst. and the
                        enemy occupied the city on Friday. Gen. Hood blew up his ordnance supplies,
                        destroyed his commissary stores, and fell back on the Macon road to
                        Lovejoy's Station, distant 20 miles from Atlanta. At this place he formed a
                        junction with Gen. Hardee, where the whole army is now concentrated.</p>
                    <p>Whilst the fall of Atlanta is regretted, the army and the people are not
                        discouraged. The following is the latest despatch from Gen. Hood:</p>
                    <p>Lovejoy's, Sept. 5, 1864.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Bragg: The enemy withdrew from my front in
                        the direction of Jonesboro' last night.</p>
                    <p>(Signed) J.B. Hood, Gen'l.</p>
                    <p>From Petersburg we learn that every thing is quiet since the terrific
                        artillery duel on Sunday night. The Express says it lasted for several
                        hours, and was tremendous, but did no other damage than to arouse the
                        unoffending women and children of the city.</p>
                    <p>On Monday evening the enemy demonstrated on our right with infantry and
                        artillery, but the movement resulted in nothing. An impression prevails in
                        Petersburg, and the Express seems to concur in it, that Grant intends to
                        make an effort to gain possession of the South Side Railroad. This was the
                        opinion several days ago of an intelligent correspondent of the press now
                        sojourning with the army of Northern Virginia.</p>
                    <p>From the lower Valley we have received nothing of interest during the past
                        week. The Northern papers seem to have changed their tune within a very
                        short time, a few days since they stated that Early was retreating up the
                        valley, and Sheridan in close pursuit. They now say:</p>
                    <p>"In the first place Early has not left, and has no intention of leaving the
                        Valley. His headquarters are at Bunker Hill, half way between Martinsburg
                        and Winchester.</p>
                    <p>"He is busily engaged in repairing and putting up the telegraph wires, and
                        already has telegraphic communication with Richmond from this side of
                        Woodstock.</p>
                    <p>"Early is receiving reinforcements, and Fitzhugh Lee is known to have
                        received 500 fresh horses for his cavalry, who are said to number 7,000.</p>
                    <p>"There is a regular stage from Winchester to Staunton, which runs every day,
                        and several officers and soldiers are receiving short furloughs to go home
                        and return to Winchester, which does not look as though they intended
                        leaving the Valley.</p>

                    <p>Field Infirmary, Augusta Co.,</p>
                    <p>August 21st, 1864.</p>
                    <p>
                        To the Ladies of New Hope and its Vicinity:
                    </p>
                    <p>In behalf of the wounded soldiers who were left at this Infirmary, I return
                        you my sincere thanks for your kind attentions and invaluable services.
                        While in a state of extreme destitution, without food and many without
                        clothing and with no means of communication with our authorities, you came
                        to their relief and administered to their wants with an energy and
                        liberality that have at all times characterized our southern women. Most of
                        the recipients of your kindness have been sent to their homes and will there
                        relate to grateful relatives the history of your benevolence and
                        hospitality. Some have been returned to their commands and will often
                        enliven their camp fires with glowing descriptions of their treatment while
                        in old Augusta. Some of them now fill the patriots grave and in their last
                        moments blessed the hands that soothed them. To all this you have added the
                        sublime sacrifices of christianity. Like the good Samaritan of old you have
                        "bound up your enemies wounds" and "poured in the oil and the wine." In
                        hospitable acts, charitable deeds and christian devotion you have no
                        superiors. Long may you live and enjoy the fruit of your labors!</p>
                    <p>I would notice particularly the names of the following who were indefatigable
                        in their attentions, viz: Mrs. Col. Crawford, Mrs. Thomas Walker, Mrs.
                        Sallie Johnston, Mrs. Sallie Stout, Mrs. Livie Marshall, Misses Martha
                        Walker, Lucy Stout, Cornelia Stout, Matha Rankin and Sallie Crawford.</p>
                    <p>Chas. H. Harris,</p>
                    <p>Asst. Surgeon in Charge.</p>
