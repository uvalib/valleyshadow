                    <p>Why Chambersburg Was Burned.</p>
                    <p>This act is thus explained in a letter from Maryland to the New York Herald:</p>
                    <p>"Just before leaving Williamsport, General Early made some public remarks in
                        regard to the burning of Chambersburg which are of interest. He said that he
                        ordered one hundred thousand dollars in gold to be demanded of the town; and
                        that if the demand was not complied with in three hours the town was to be
                        burned; that the sum of money demanded was to reimburse Andrew Hunter,
                        William Lucas, E. J. Lee and Hon. Alexander R. Boteler for their losses,
                        caused in the destruction of their property by order of General Hunter, and
                        that he felt perfectly justified in the course he had pursued. He explained
                        how General Hunter had burned the house of his (Hunter's) cousin, in
                        Jefferson county, Virginia, and taken that cousin (Andrew Hunter) off as a
                        prisoner, and said that the act was a brutal one, because the inmates of the
                        house were not allowed time to save even a portion of their clothing. In
                        concluding, he said it would be the future policy of the rebel Government to
                        retaliate in the severest manner for all barbarities practiced against them.
                        He delivered these remarks in a calm, firm manner. In a private
                        conversation, he said that no man more than himself deprecated the necessity
                        of such an act as the one committed at Chambersburg, but that he sanctioned
                        it, believing he was only doing his duty to those people who had suffered by
                        General Hunter's orders; and again, because he believed that by retaliation
                        such barbarous practices would be sooner discontinued than in any other way.
                        He was particularly severe on General Hunter, and said that should he fall a
                        prisoner into their hands, his lot would be a hard one."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>Nothing of importance has occurred in front of Petersburg since the battle of
                        Sunday last. There have been three short, but sharp, contests on the line of
                        the Weldon railroad since the enemy advanced their lines in that direction
                        on Thursday last. In the fight on Friday, in which we attacked the enemy and
                        compelled them to retire upon their inner and strongest line of works, we
                        captured 2700 prisoners and a large number placed hors de combat.</p>
                    <p>In Sunday's fight we also made the attack and drove them from their several
                        inner lines of works to their main entrenchments and here for the third time
                        the work was stopped.</p>
                    <p>Further movements in front on the immediate line of the railroad were
                        dependent upon the success or failure of the flanking column, and as the
                        movement resulted unfavorably, offensive operations were ceased. In this
                        day's fight we lost a number of prisoners, and many killed and wounded. We
                        captured nearly four hundred prisoners, and inflicted heavy loss upon the
                        enemy.</p>
                    <p>In these three battles the enemy's loss, including prisoners, could not have
                        been less than eight thousand, probably more. Our loss has not yet been
                        stated, but does not reach nearly so high a figure.</p>
                    <p>Since which time everything has remained quiet all around the lines, with the
                        exception of the usual shelling and picket firing. The enemy still maintain
                        their entire lines on and across the railroad, and no further attempt has
                        been made to dislodge them. They are still engaged in fortifying and
                        strengthening, and show no disposition to depart. They are rather
                        endeavoring to advance and get as near the city as possible.</p>
                    <p>The occupation of the Southern road is certainly an event much to be
                        lamented, not only on account of the inconvenience to which government, but
                        also to which the citizens are subjected. An abiding confidence is felt in
                        our Generals, however, and it is believed matters will shortly assume a
                        better aspect.</p>
                    <p>From Atlanta we have dates to the 22d inst., which inform us that no general
                        engagement had taken place up to that time. On the morning of the 18th the
                        enemy, in front of the city, opened a heavy fire, which exceeded anything
                        yet witnessed. A forty two pounder Sawyer shell exploded in a house, killing
                        Captain Jarson, of the 14th Texas cavalry. Two children and several ladies
                        were wounded. No further damage was done.</p>
                    <p>The [illegible] composed of 2500 men commanded by Kilpatrick, attack the
                        Macon road at Lovejoy's, and moved towards Jonesboro'. On the next day they
                        were surrounded between these two points by a portion of our forces, and a
                        sharp engagement ensued, in which the raiders were completely routed, and
                        closely pursued by two Georgia regiments of cavalry. Only one mile of the
                        Macon road was destroyed, which has been repaired.</p>
                    <p>There are reports from the enemy's rear to the effect that Wheeler had burned
                        the bridges at Etowah, Resaca and Dalton, between the up tunnel. [The enemy,
                        then, is undoubtedly on half rations.]</p>
                    <p>From the lower valley we learn that the Yankee General has at last been
                        successful in finding the whereabouts of Gen. Early, which appears to have
                        been in the neighborhood of Winchester; and the arrival of between four and
                        five hundred prisoners in our town on Wednesday last, gives at least an
                        inkling of the result of that interview so much sought after by the Yankee
                        commander.</p>
                    <p>The meeting between the parties is said to have been of short duration, the
                        Yankees leaving, quickly satisfied that Gen. Early was not exactly the
                        person they wished to see, and thinking discretion the better part of valor,
                        abruptly broke up the interview and hurried off at full speed, burning barns
                        and grain, and carrying off stock, closely pursued by a portion of Early's
                        forces.</p>
                    <p>The next meeting may probably be sought by Gen. Early, and the place selected
                        be on Yankee soil.</p>

<b>Convention of all the States</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor contends that a proposed meetings of delegates from all former

                    fruitless and that any such meeting, to have any effect, would have to convene
                    within the Confederacy.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Convention of all the States.</p>
                    <p>An idea is again entertained in the North, that, in some way or other, a
                        convention of delegates from all the States of the old Union can settle the
                        existing difficulties. We confess our inability to see how it would be
                        capable of accomplishing any thing of the kind.</p>
                    <p>Laying aside the fact that the States of the Confederacy, by sending
                        delegates to such a convention, would thereby acknowledge that we were of
                        the same government, and merely acting in concert with sister sovereignties
                        of that government for the general good, which we have successfully
                        contended against, in arms, for four years, such a convention would, however
                        desirous it might be of restoring peace to a disturbed country, be powerless
                        for good. If it should convene within the limits of the Confederacy, its
                        sitting would be undisturbed and its proceedings untrammeled, but its
                        determinations would have but little weight in the United States, while, if
                        attempted to be held there, it would be prevented, if possible, by Lincoln
                        and his coadjutors, as the action of such an assemblage could have no other
                        effect than to loosen the hold of Lincoln upon the people, and weaken his
                        power as President, which his grasping ambition could but illy brook. Its
                        action would express only the sentiments of the people, which is already
                        known to be fore peace, and would in no degree effect the present condition
                        of affairs, being totally unauthorized to act for the cessation of
                        hostilities, or the restoration of peace.</p>
                    <p>We are not perfectly sure that the convening of the Chicago C[o]nvention on
                        the 29th inst. will be undisturbed by the minion of Abraham I. Perhaps he
                        may understand that, by disturbing its sitting, he will raise a cry
                        throughout his country, (which the disturbance of a general convention would
                        not,) that will forever ruin his and the prospects of the party he
                        represents, and may, in consequence, leave it to adopt a platform and
                        nominate candidates at its pleasure. Whether he prevents its convening or
                        leaves it undisturbed is yet to be seen; but neither course will redound to
                        his advantage. If they be free to act they have but to unfurl the banner of
                        peace, coupled with the acknowlegement [sic] of the rights of the States, to
                        hurl one from and prevent the acquisition of power by the other of the two
                        war parties who have already placed their favorites in nomination.</p>
                    <p>Such action may be anticipated from the late speeches of Mr. Vallandingham,
                        at Dayton Ohio, and Syracuse New York would receive more encouragement from
                        the people of the Confederate States than could possibly be given by
                        delegates to a general convention. It is not treason here to say that we are
                        all--officials, soldiers and citizens--anxious for, yes, would hail, with
                        joyful acclamations, the return of peace! peace, leaving the States
                        untrammeled and sovereign, as they are recognized to be under the
                        Constitution, from which the power of the General Government of the United
                        States, as the agent of those sovereign States, was derived.</p>
                    <p>Our proposition is before the world, has been from the beginning of the
                        contest, and has lately gone forth again from our able President, (if a
                        Yankee statement can be relied upon) which sufficiently indicates that we
                        are ready to co-operate with the peace party at the North to bring about a
                        cessation of hostilities upon those terms which are alone just and
                        equitable. It needs no general convention--our delegates, to which could
                        only say what has been proclaimed to Northern ears a thousand times, but let
                        peace candidates be nominated and elected, and we are ready to make peace
                        upon the very terms so strongly and ably set forth by the head and front of
                        the peace party, Hon. Alexander Long, of Ohio, viz: the recognition of the
                        sovereignty and independence of the States composing this Confederacy.</p>
