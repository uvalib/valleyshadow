                <summary>Notes that President Lincoln has laid down the ultimatum that one of the
                    terms for peace is the abolition of slavery. The article questions where in the
                    Constitution the President found the authority for issuing such an ultimatum.
                    The Herald contends that the people of the North want restoration of the Union,
                    not emancipation of slaves.</summary>

                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>No general engagement has taken place in either department of our armies
                        during the past week. The situation of our armies, as far as we can learn,
                        presents a very active appearance, and we have no doubt, ere many days
                        elapse, to have the pleasure of recording a glorious victory in more than
                        one department.</p>
                    <p>The same stillness prevails in front of Petersburg that has marked the
                        progress of the campaign for some days past. Grant is making another
                        demonstration on the north side of the James, by sending over a large body
                        of troops. This may only be a repetition of his strategy, previous to his
                        springing the mine, on the 30th July, with the object in view to draw off
                        our forces from his front, and then strike a blow for the reduction of
                        Petersburg. A few days will develoope [sic] his plans, and, whatever they
                        may be, he will find Gen. Lee, as ever, ready to foil him at every point.</p>
                    <p>From Atlanta we learn, by telegraph, that, with the exception of some heavy
                        skirmishing and occasional shells thrown into the city, nothing has
                        transpired at that point during the past week. Some of the shells thrown
                        into the city had scriptural quotations in Hebrew pasted on them.</p>
                    <p>The news received by late telegrams, and through the Mobile papers, is not
                        calculated to exonerate from blame, (if not from disgrace) the conduct of
                        Col. Anderson, commanding the garrison at fort Gaines, and Col. Williams, at
                        Fort Powell. The Mobile Register pronounces the capitulation of Fort Gaines,
                        and the evacuation of Fort Powell, as humiliating to our people, and
                        disgraceful to the officers in command.</p>
                    <p>The cause of the Confederacy will never be upheld, nor our cities saved from
                        destruction, by giving up strong works of defence without a struggle.
                        Officers must be placed in command of such defences who know their duty, and
                        thus knowing it, will endeavor to perform it at all and every hazard.</p>
                    <p>Had Cols. Anderson and Williams tried the mettle of their respective
                        garrisons, and the power of their guns against the Yankee fleet, and were
                        then compelled, either by the force of superior numbers, or the overpowering
                        weight of metal brought to bear against them, to give up their works, then,
                        in that case, they would have received the plaudits of a grateful people,
                        and their names written, in living characters, on the pages of their
                        country's history.</p>
                    <p>But as it is, the belief and opinions at prese[n]t entertained by our people
                        in regard to their conduct and actions, without being removed, will brand
                        them as traitors to our common country, and their names ever held in the
                        most profound contempt.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding this defection on the part of these officers, Mobile still
                        stands, proudly defiant as ever; her citizens were arming to aid the regular
                        troops in its defence, and the willingness and alacrity with which the
                        people of all classes have rushed to the defences of the city, must be
                        gratifying to the pride of every Confederate and every Mobilian.</p>
                    <p>The entire line of works is manned, and if we get none of the reinforcements
                        that are on the way to the city, it can be held against all the available
                        forces the enemy can bring against it. Mobile is, in fact and deed stripped
                        for the fight, and the public composure tells unerringly of the public
                        determination:</p>
                    <p>From the Valley we have various rumors, (at this writing) without any thing
                        strictly authentic. Gen. Early, from the most reliable information, is at or
                        near Strasburg, awaiting the approach of the enemy. Some skirmishing is said
                        to be going on between the armies, and a great battle is said to be
                        imminent. Joe Hooker is, according to the reports of prisoners, in command
                        of the Yankee army.</p>
                    <p>A few days ago Mosby attacked one of the enemy's wagon trains at Berryville,
                        in Clarke county, destroyed it, and captured a quartermaster's wagon, with a
                        large amount in greenbacks. He also took some two hundred or three hundred
                        prisoners, who were at Gordonsville yesterday on their way South. Good for
                        Mosby.</p>
                    <p>Later from Richmond.</p>
                    <p>An official dispatch, received last night states that the enemy, yesterday,
                        made a determined attack on our line between the Darbytown and Charles City
                        road, and at one time broke through, but he was repulsed and our original
