                    cultivating "a healthy literary taste in the Confederacy." The endorsement

                    their sacrifices and assured them that the enemy's upcoming campaign "must, from
                    the exhaustion of his resources born in men and money, be far less formidable
                    than those of the last two years, when unimpared means were used with boundless
                    prodigality."<br>
</blockquote>
