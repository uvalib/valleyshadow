<b>Retaliation</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor comments on Lincoln's address at the opening of the Sanitary
                    Fair in Baltimore, in which the President called for a person-for-person
                    retaliation of the massacre at Fort Pillow, if investigations reveal that a
                    massacre is indeed what occurred there. In rebuttal, the editor contends that
                    General Forrest killed the African-American and Union soldiers who resisted
                    capture, an appropriate procedure in war. If the President truly wants
                    retaliation, the editor warns, then let him be advised that the approach is
                    two-sided and should not end until he has met his "retributive share," thereby
                    ridding the African Americans of their worst enemy (Lincoln).<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Retaliation.</p>
                    <p>At the opening of the Sanitary Fair, at Baltimore, Abraham Lincoln delivered
                        an address in which he adverts to the horrible (?) massacre of his black and
                        white soldiery, at Fort Pillow, expressing his determination to retaliate
                        man for man, if investigations making shall prove it a massacre. The
                        "atrocity" (?) of such wholesale slaughter of men, who refused to surrender
                        when surrounded by Forrest and the demand was made, thus signifying their
                        intention to fight to the death, and who were killed in the contest over the
                        possession of the fort, and not after their capture, appalls him, who, safe
                        under his guards at the White House, could without a compunction of
                        conscience, sees Butler rule with worse than heathenish brutality over an
                        oppressed city or deliberately send forth his fit representatives, Dahlgreen
                        and his cut-throats, to assassinate our President and Cabinet, sack our
                        Capital, and let loose a hireling soldiery to commit whatever of crime their
                        impious desires or devilish ingenuity might suggest.</p>
                    <p>If Forrest had put to the sword the captive negroes and their officers, he
                        would not have conflicted at all with the enforcement of the laws of those
                        Sovereignties which helped to delegate authority to the Government over
                        which Mr. Lincoln presides, but which for the past three years have
                        maintained an independent Government. These laws make the penalty--death,
                        not only to those negroes who array themselves in open hostility to their
                        masters but also to those white men who aid or abet them, as for the
                        instance old John Brown. The evidence of this hostility could not have been
                        stronger than when Forrest entered Fort Pillow and found them accoutred with
                        their warlike implements and dealing death and destruction to their masters
                        under him. He did not capture them and then kill them, but killed all who
                        resisted. If this be a subject for retaliation let Mr. Lincoln begin. It is
                        a two-handed game at which both parties can play and which we opine he will
                        be loth to commence, as will prove to him "too serious a mistake" indeed. If
                        retaliation is commenced we trust it may not end until the Grand
                        Commander-in-Chief of the Sable armies of the Union, Old Abe, himself shall
                        have met that retributive share which shall rid the earth of a tyrannical
                        homicide and the African of his worst enemy.</p>

<b>Meeting</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    of organizing a local association to raise money for supplying limbs to maimed
                    Confederate soldiers. The association will work in cooperation with similar ones

                    lower Valley, will speak, as will the Honorable A. H. H. Stuart. Staunton and
                    Augusta citizens have embraced worthy undertakings before and surely will set an
                    example to other associations in their contributions to this cause. The editor
