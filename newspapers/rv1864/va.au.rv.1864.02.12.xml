                <summary>The editor has learned of a new publication called The Age. He believes
                    that its appearance marks another step in the Confederacy becoming free of
                    Yankee tyranny. The editor wishes it and similar publications much success in
                    cultivating "a healthy literary taste in the Confederacy." The endorsement
                    includes a list of contents of the first issue.</summary>

                <summary>The text of an address by President Davis to the Confederate Army is
                    included here. In his speech, Davis lauded the soldiers of the Confederacy for
                    their sacrifices and assured them that the enemy's upcoming campaign "must, from
                    the exhaustion of his resources born in men and money, be far less formidable
                    than those of the last two years, when unimpared means were used with boundless
                    prodigality."</summary>
