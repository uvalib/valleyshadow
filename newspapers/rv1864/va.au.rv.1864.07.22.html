<b>The Ohio "Copperheads"</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints a synopsis of resolutions passed recently at a Democratic
                    convention in Hamilton, Ohio. These resolutions state that the present American
                    government is corrupt and unworthy of the confidence of the American people. The
                    delegates argued that restoring the Union by force is contrary to the principles
                    of the Constitution. They called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in
                    order to take measures to restore peace.<br>

                    <p>The Burning of Gov. Letcher's Residence.</p>
                    <p>We print below a document destined to become historic. The calm,
                        dispassionate and truthful recital it gives of one of the most wanton and
                        barbaric acts of the war needs no comment to awaken the indignation of every
                        manly bosom. Our soldiers in Maryland, who are reported to have had in ashes
                        the residence of the Yankee governor of that State, by way of retaliation,
                        have given practical expression to the feeling of our people, and
                        anticipated the judgment of mankind and the verdict of history. It is due to
                        Gov. Letcher to say that this letter was written with no view to
                        publication, and in response to a private communication addressed him by the
                        Mayor of this city. The passages omitted relate to personal matters--Whig:</p>
                    <p>Lexington, Va., July 5th, 1864.</p>
                    <p>Finding the Yankees would take the town on Saturday (11th) I left home near
                        midnight Friday night and went to Big Island, in Bedford, where I remained
                        until Wednesday morning following, when, hearing the vandals had left, I
                        returned I had previously heard that my house had burned, with all its
                        contents. The threats made by the Yankees against me, for the past two
                        years, satisfied me that they would destroy my house when they came to
                        Lexington; but I always supposed they would allow the furniture and my
                        family's clothing to be removed. In this, however, I was disappointed.</p>
                    <p>When the Yankees took possession of the town, Dr. Patton, medical director
                        for Hunter's army, and who hails from Marion county, Va., went to my house,
                        told my wife he was unwell, and said he must have a room in the house. He
                        took the room, supped and breakfasted, and, when breakfast was nearly over,
                        remarked, in a manner half-jocular, half-earnest, is Lizzie, that it was the
                        last meal she would take in the house. Shortly after, he left, without
                        taking leave of any of the family, nor was he again seen by any of them.</p>
                    <p>The threats made by soldiers on Saturday evening, induced my wife to fear the
                        house would be burned, and she expressed her fears in the hearing of Dr.
                        Patton and Capt. Towns of New York. Capt Towns very promptly said, that I,
                        being a private citizen and the house being private property, burning it
                        would be an inexcusable outrage, and proposed at once to go to Hunter's
                        headquarters and ascertain. He went, and was directed by Hunter to assure my
                        wife that the house would not be distur[b]ed--The sequel shows that the sole
                        object of this assurance, was to quiet her apprehensions, and thus prevent
                        anything from being removed. About half-past 8 o'clock A.M. (Sunday) Capt
                        Berry and his Provost Guard rode up, and the officer called for my wife. She
                        came to the door, when Berry informed her that he was ordered by Hunter to
                        fire the house. She replied there must be some mistake, and asked for the
                        order. He said it was a verbal order. She then said to him, "Can it not be
                        delayed until I can see General Hunter?" The order is peremptory, he
                        replied, and you have five minutes in which to leave the house. She then
                        asked leave to remove her mother's, sister's, her own and her children's
                        clothing, which was insolently refused. Immediately thereafter camphene was
                        poured on the parlor floor and ignited it with a match. In the meantime, my
                        daughter had gathered up an armful of clothing, and was going out when he
                        discovered her, ran forward and fired the clothing in her arms. He then
                        poured camphene in the wardrobes, bureau drawers, and ignited the
                        clothing--taking out my clothing, which he said he intended to take North.</p>
                    <p>Every house on my lot was burned save a small grannery over my ice house. Not
                        a particle of flour, meat, or anything edible was left, all having been
                        carried off on Saturday.</p>
                    <p>My mother, now in her 78th year, lives on the lot adjoining my own having
                        with her one of her grandchildren and a servant. After my property had been
                        fired, the fiends fired her stable, located about forty feet from her house,
                        with no other view than to burn her out also. The house caught twice, and
                        would have been consumed but for the untiring effeorts [sic] of Captain
                        Towns, who made his men carry water and extinguish the flames. This Captain
                        behaved like a gentleman towards my own and my mother's family.</p>
                    <p>Generals Averill, Crook; Sullivan and Duffee denounced the whole proceeding
                        as an outrage, in violation of all the principles of civilized warfare, and
                        stated that Hunter alone was respo[n]sible for these atrocities.</p>
                    <p>I feel grateful to you and other kind friends in Richmond for their generous
                        sympathy and kind tender of a home--There are no people on the earth who
                        have been more uniformly kind than the good people of your city, and I
                        assure you I appreciate their kindness, as does also my family. Accept our
                        thanks for it. So soon as I can visit Richmond I will do so perhaps this
                        month.</p>
                    <p>I am truly and in haste, your friend,</p>
                    <p>John Letcher</p>
                    <p>Joseph Mayo, Esq. Richmond, Va.</p>

                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>The interest that has occupied the public mind for some days past, in regard
                        to our army invading Maryland and Pennsylvania, has entirely subsided with
                        the announcement that it had recrossed the river and is now on Virginia
                        soil. What will be the future programme of this army, we do not know but
                        feel perfectly satisfied, that Gen. Early will not remain inactive, but
                        will, (after securing the booty obtained, and resting his troops for a short
                        time) be on the march, in pursuit of the Yanks, ready and anxious to meet
                        them where ever found.</p>
                    <p>From the army Gen. Lee in front of Petersburg, we learn all has been quiet
                        for the past week with the exception of the enemy employing their pastime in
                        throwing shells into City. The shelling thus far, has only resulted in the
                        disfigurement of a few houses, and the annoyance of non-combatants. The
                        Federal force sent by Grant direct to Washington is believed to be Hancock's
                        second and Wright's sixth corps, together with Rickets 4th army corps, from
                        Louisiana intended for Grant. The whole together according to Yankee
                        accounts numbers between 30 and 40 thousand.</p>
                    <p>Whether they will remain in Washington, to guard the sacred personage of
                        Abram Lincoln or return to Grant's army, time alone will determine.</p>
                    <p>The Atlanta papers of the 11th, state that our army crossed the river on the
                        night of the 9th, and their lines are now about 4 miles north of Atlanta,
                        extending to the right and left [illegible] the City, in order to protect
                        it. The enemy were also engaged in crossing at two points on our right and
                        left, and a battle was thought to be imminent, as it was supposed Gen.
                        Johnson would attack Sherman before he could entrench on this side of the
                        river. It is not expected that Atlanta will be given up without a fight. The
                        impo[r]tance of the place as a base of operations and a depot for supplies,
                        together, with the large amount of machinery located at that point, fully
                        w[a]rrants this conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Since the above was in type, we learn that a part of the 6th and 19th corps
                        with a portion of Hunter's force, pursuing Early, were allowed to cross the
                        Shenandoah at Castleman's Ferry, when Gen. Early fell upon them driving them
                        into and across the river. We lost about 300, the enemy lost about three
                        times that number.</p>

<b>Schedule of Prices</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The recently published schedule of prices as established by the Board of

                    lists.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Schedule of Prices.</p>
                    <p>The schedule of prices established by the Board of Commissioners for Virginia
                        for the months of July and August, just published, gives great
                        dissatisfaction to every class in the community. This dissatisfaction arises
                        not from a reduction in the established prices but from a most extraordinary
                        and ex[h]orbitant increase.</p>
                    <p>Just at the time, when money was more scarce than it had been for many
                        months, owing partly to taxation and partly to the change in the currency,
                        and a greater confidence was felt in the ability to reduce the volume and
                        bring its value nearer to the gold standard, when the prices of produce were
                        on a visible decline, not only here but throughout the Confederacy, and
                        consequently every thing else was tending downward in price, the
                        Commissioners, without even a plausible excuse, increase the prices, on some
                        articles, 500 per cent.</p>
                    <p>It was presumed that the farming plans would have been delighted at the
                        increase in the prices of their produce and that only non-producers would
                        complain, but we have heard the greatest complaints from the farmers
                        themselves. This increase, as the pretext is, was simply to stimulate the
                        farmer to an early delivery of his grain, which is needed, and is only
                        intended for the months of July and August and can be changed even for these
                        months. We undertake to say that not 10,000 bushels of grain will be
                        delivered over and above what would have been at the old schedule rates,
                        since it could not generally have been thrashed before the middle of August,
                        and large quantities of wheat had already been sold to the Government at
                        from one fourth to one third the increased rates, deliverable when thrashed.
                        This inducement so far from acting as a stimulus to speedy delivery will we
                        fear have a contrary effect, (we hear of several who will not deliver their
                        crops at the present rates,) for the farmers know that altho' the schedule
                        may be altered after the expiration of August, yet prices once fixed, no
                        matter for what purpose, are very ha[r]d to reduce, and the rise in the
                        price of provisions is but the signal for the rise in other things. With the
                        prices to continue six times as great as they were, the indebtedness of the
                        Government will become six times as great also, and a more than
                        proportionate tax must be levied to pay this increased indebtedness. They
                        feel satisfied that this tax must be levied on the real and personal
                        property, since the tax on businessmen now almost amounts to a prohibition,
                        and a future tax on them will not only close their doors, but also deprive
                        the Confederacy of the revenue accruing from this source, which is enormous,
                        and throw the whole burden of taxation upon the producing lass, which
                        increase in taxation they would not be able to meet with the advance
                        received upon their produce.</p>
                    <p>The commissioners should assemble at once and remodel their schedule. It is
                        an imperative duty they owe to the Confederacy and the farmers to do so.
                        Both will be greatly gainers thereby.</p>

                        not a little regret is felt by some on account of the failure to capture the
                        city. The prey was surely in the grasp of Gen. Early, had he desired to
                        seize it; but we presume, from his course, that he did not intend it.</p>
                    <p>It can not be doubted that, when the enemy were menacing our capital, and
                        believed that all our available forces were defending it, and a column of
                        thousands were rapidly thrown into Maryland, so quietly as to completely
                        deceive their vaunted Grant, and threaten seriously the capital of our
                        enemies, if it had been captured it would have redowned greatly to our
                        credit abroad, but was not this credit gained by the movement made and the
                        acknowle[dg]ment of the enemy that Washington could have been taken?
                        However, would not the seizure Washington have enabled Lincoln to raise the
                        vast number of men called for by an appeal to the people to rescue their
                        capital?</p>
                    <p>As it is, our forces having withdrawn to this side of the Potomac, at leisure
                        and of their own accord, the enemy being routed in the only instance in
                        which they made a positive resistance, bringing off large supplies of grain,
                        many horses, cattle and several hundred prisoners, &amp;c., &amp;c,
                        without even a repulse, makes it one of the most successful raids of the
                        war, and in the character of a raid fails to give that rallying cry for
                        raising troops for Lincoln, which doubtlessly their authorities would have
                        much desired.</p>
                    <p>We have amply paid them for Hunter's raid in the Valley and at a time when
                        they had not forgotten the former. Our movement has made the enemy tremble
                        throughout their dominions. It has given them an idea of what they may
                        expect at any and every point. The secrecy with which it was conducted is
                        commendable and should characterize any and all others.</p>
                    <p>The movement was a glorious one, may its consequent results be equally
                    so!</p>
