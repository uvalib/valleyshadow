<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In surveying the news on the various war fronts for the previous week, the
                    editor reports that General Grant replaced white troops near Fort Harrison with
                    African-American troops and reports that General Rosser made a surprise attack
                    in the Valley and captured Fort Kelly at New Creek.<br>

                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>The activity manifested in the enemy's camps below Richmond for several days
                        past seem to indicate an early advance on the part of the Yankee General.
                        Nothing positive however is known of their movements, except that it was
                        discovered on Monday morning that the white troops had been withdrawn from
                        our front near Fort Harrison and their places supplied with negroes.</p>
                    <p>The Yankee papers gave us the information some days ago, that all the negroes
                        in Grant's army were to be put into the Eighteenth corps, under Gen.
                        Weitzel. The transfer of that portion of them at Bermuda Hundred and in
                        front of Petersburg to this side would go far to confirm that statement.</p>
                    <p>From our lines below Petersburg nothing of interest has taken place since the
                        attack of the enemy on Stony Creek Depot on the 1st inst., the result of
                        which will be found in the following despatch from Gen. Lee.</p>
                    <p>Headq'rs Army Northern Va.,</p>
                    <p>December 2.</p>
                    <p>Hon Jas. A. Seddon:</p>
                    <p>The enemy attacked Stony Creek Depot yesterday, and burned most of the
                        buildings, consuming some stores and corn, but most of the latter was saved.
                        The railroad is unharmed.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Lee coming up as the enemy was retiring, attacked and drove him rapidly
                        eight miles, capturing some prisoners, but could not bring him to an
                        engagement.</p>
                    <p>The depot was occupied by about 150 men under Captain Waldham, about one
                        hundred and twenty-five of whom are said to have been captured--among them,
                        I regret to state, Major Fitzhugh, Quartermaster.</p>
                    <p>The enemy left some dead at the depot and along the route of his retreat.</p>
                    <p>R.E. Lee.</p>
                    <p>From the Richmond papers we learn that official intelligence has been
                        received that Sherman is at last moving towards the Atlantic coast in
                        earnest. His point of destination is believed to have been at length
                        discovered; but it is deemed imprudent at present to mention it. The general
                        impression seems to be, that there will be a battle within the next few days
                        which will decide the question, whether Sherman is to reach the coast in
                        safety.</p>
                    <p>The Georgia papers inform us that important movements are on foot to meet
                        Sherman wherever he may go, but these will be developed at the proper time.
                        Gen. Wheeler has thus [illegible] managed Kilpatrick with all ease, and with
                        less force, has whipped and driven him in every engagement.</p>
                    <p>The Lynchburg "Republican" states that official information has been received
                        at Richmond that a fight had taken place between Wheeler's Cavalry and a
                        portion of Sherman's army, embracing one corps of infantry and Kilpatrick's
                        cavalry. The enemy attacked Wheeler's position and made several charges all
                        of which were repulsed. The enemy's loss was very heavy. Kilpatrick reported
                        wounded. Wheelers officers and men behaved most gallantly.</p>
                    <p>From the army of Gen. Hood we have no news, except what we gather from Yankee
                        papers, which must be taken with many grains of allowance. They report that
                        Gen. Hood has been repulsed at Franklin Tennessee with severe loss,
                        amounting to 5 or 6000 men, 1000 prisoners captured including one Brigadier
                        General. There loss only 1200 or 1500. They further state that the battle
                        commenced at 4 o'clock P.M. and lasted till dark, an interval of only one
                        hour and a half elapsed, during which time this wholesale destruction in the
                        Confederate ranks was effected. We adopt the remarks of a co[n]temporary on
                        this splendid achievement of Yankee skill that either some of the best and
                        severest shooting on record was done on that occasion or some huge lying was
                        found necessary to embellish the circumstances of the retreat to Nashville.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding that splendid victory of which they so much boast, they
                        acknowledge in a subsequent dispatch, that on the night after the engagement
                        they fell back from Franklin and took a position within 3 miles of
                        Nashville, where they formed a line of battle. If Hood was as badly whipped
                        as the Yankees say he was, what was the necessity of their army falling back
                        within the suburbs of Nashville? Hood according to their own account was
                        able to follow them up, and skirmishing was going on all day about five
                        miles South of Nashville. Heavy cannonading could be heard in the city.
                        Taking the enemy's own account of this affair we feel perfectly satisfied,
                        that Gen. Hood, instead of sustaining a defeat, has obtained a splendid
                        victory, and in its train will follow the reduction of Nashville and the
                        recovery of the whole of Tennessee to the Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>We have nothing of interest from the lower Valley, since the expedition of
                        Gen. Rosser on the Baltimore and Ohio R. Road. The following dispatch from
                        Gen. Lee tells the tale.</p>
                    <p>Headq'rs Army Northern Va.,</p>
                    <p>December 2,</p>
                    <p>
                        Hon. Jas. A. Seddon
                    </p>
                    <p>Gen. Early reports that Gen. Rosser, with Payne's and his own brigade,
                        encountered, on the 27th ult., near Moorefield, a small party of the enemy
                        and captured forty prisoners and one piece of artillery.</p>
                    <p>On the 28th he surprised and captured Fort Kelly, at New Creek, with four
                        field pieces, four siege guns, between seven and eight hundred prisoners, a
                        large number of horses and mules, and eight stand of colors; and destroyed
                        two hundred wagons and a quantity of commissary and ordnance stores.</p>
                    <p>He brought off the field pieces and some wagons, spiked the siege guns and
                        destroyed the carriages.</p>
                    <p>He also captured Piedmont, destroyed the Government buildings, containing a
                        number of engines, burnt several b[r]idges, did considerable damage to the
                        railroad, and collected several hundred head of cattle.</p>
                    <p>The boldness and energy exhibited by Gen. Rosser and the conduct of his men
                        deserve much praise.</p>
                    <p>R.E. Lee.</p>
                    <p>That so much should have been accomplished with the loss of only two killed
                        and three wounded on the Confederate side is very remarkable, and can only
                        be accounted for upon the principle that the plans of Gen. Rosser were well
                        matured and admirably executed.</p>
                    <p>Another circumstance, attending this expedition scarcely less remarkable, is
                        related by a correspondent of one of the Richmond papers who states that the
                        5th and 6th Yankee "Virginia" Regiments of Cavalry were captured by the 5th
                        and 6th Virginia Confederate Regiments.</p>
                    <p>The splendid success of Gen. Rosser and his gallant command in this
                        expedition, will command the admiration of the whole country, and their
                        chivalrous conduct on this, as well as many other occasions of a similar
                        character will in after years form one of the brightest pages in our
                        country's history.</p>
