                    <p>The Peace Democracy Dissatisfied with McClellan.</p>
                    <p>The Peace party of the North seem determined to bolt McClellan's nomination.
                        The New York News, the organ of the party, states that "preliminary steps
                        are being taken by the friends of peace to call a national convention of the
                        Democracy, to place in nomination candidates for President and Vice
                        President. Speaking on the subject, it says:</p>
                    <p>The peace party believes the idea of a Union brought about by force to be,
                        intrinsically, a profligate absurdity. They believe that war can never
                        rebuild the blessed fabric raised for us by our fathers, which the bloody
                        hands of fanaticism and violence have already shattered into ruins. They
                        believe that we cannot fight free men into loving us--that we cannot
                        slaughter and trample them into brotherhood with us; and that, even if we
                        could, we should be immeasurably more infamous than they. The Peace
                        democracy believe further, that the armed coercion of States is a
                        constitutional heresy, and that it cannot be consummated without striking a
                        vital blow at the first principles of the Federal compact, and consolidating
                        a despotism at Washington.</p>
                    <p>Reviewing McClellan's letter of acceptance, the News well says:</p>
                    <p>Genera McClellan's words and purposes cannot be mistaken or misunderstood.
                        After seeming to "exhaust the resources of statesmanship" to re-establish
                        the Union, he says:</p>
                    <p>"If a frank, earnest and persistent effort to obtain these objects should
                        fail, the responsibility for ulterior consequences will fall upon those who
                        remain in arms against the Union. but the Union must be preserved at all
                        hazards."</p>
                    <p>To what "ulterior consequences" does he allude, and what "hazards?" He means
                        war, and no honest man will pretend that he means anything else. If he had
                        been frank, he would have used the word. He means that if he cannot
                        reconstruct the Union by negotiation--nay, more, to use his own language in
                        another part of the letter, if the people of the South are not "ready for
                        peace on the basis of the Union" as a condition precedent to
                        negotiation--the consequences will be on their own heads, and he will make
                        war on them until they yield. They may have solemnly declared by State
                        conventions or otherwise, that they will not re-enter into a common
                        Government with us; the people may be as fixed and unanimous as their
                        leaders; they may have resolved to have independence or death, as Mr. Davis
                        has recently declared, still General McClellan is pledged to overthrow their
                        resolves by fire and sword.</p>
                    <p>To a policy so wicked, so inhumanly absurd, we cannot, nor can any peace
                        Democrat, subscribe without renegading from every conviction and from every
                        instinct of self respect.</p>

                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing new from Georgia. The front is quiet under the flag of truce
                        agreed upon between Generals Hood and Sherman. The truce expired on
                        yesterday morning, from which time hostilities are to be resumed.</p>
                    <p>Nothing of interest has occurred in front of Petersburg since the bold and
                        daring raid of Gen. Hampton, passing below Ream's Station on the Weldon
                        road, and immediately in the rear of Grant's army. The result of this daring
                        adventure was the capture of 300 Yankees, and what was much more valuable,
                        2,500 head of fine fat cattle. On his return he was attacked by Gen. Gregg's
                        cavalry, whom he defeated, bringing off in safety all his captures. The line
                        traveled by Hampton was twelve miles long. The following is the official
                        dispatch of Gen. Lee:</p>
                    <p>"Hd'qrs Army of Northern Virginia,</p>
                    <p>September 1, 1864.</p>
                    <p>"Hon. Jas A. Seddon, Secretary of War:</p>
                    <p>At daylight yesterday the enemy's skirmish line west of the Jerusalem
                        plankroad was driven lack upon his entrenchments along their whole extent.
                        Ninety prisoners were taken by us in the operation. "At the same hour,
                        General Hampton attacked the enemy's position north of the Norfolk railroad,
                        near Sycamore Church, and captured about three hundred prisoners, some arms
                        and wagons, a large number of horses, and twenty-five hundred cattle.</p>
                    <p>General Gregg attacked General Hampton on his return in the afternoon at
                        Belcher's Mill, on the Jerusalem plankroad, but was repulsed and driven
                        back. Everything was brought off safely.</p>
                    <p>Our entire loss does not exceed fifty men.</p>
                    <p>"R.E. Lee."</p>
                    <p>"A raiding party of the enemy's cavalry, numbering about five hundred, passed
                        through Culpeper on Monday to the railroad bridge over the Rapidan, which
                        they attempted to destroy, but it having been constructed recently of green
                        pine timber, was not seriously damaged. They crossed the Rapidan and burned
                        Holliday's mills, which contained a quantity of wheat belonging to the
                        Orange and Alexandria railroad company."</p>
                    <p>"They then started in the direction of Orange Court-House, when they were
                        ambushed by some of our infantry, thirty captured, fifteen killed, a number
                        wounded, and the remainder scattered, and fleeing in every direction."</p>
                    <p>"They are believed to be the same body that Mosby has been skirmishing with,
                        and that they came from the neighborhood of Alexandria."</p>
                    <p>"In their flight a number of mules were recaptured from them, besides the
                        cavalry taken."</p>
                    <p>After burning the bridge, and mill and committing sundry other depredations,
                        they were arroused [sic] by a sound of a locomotive whistle in the rear. It
                        being evident they had cut off a train, they immediately started back to
                        capture it.</p>
                    <p>"The train came nearly up to the bridge, and was shrieking away in the most
                        frantic and distressed manner imaginable. The raiders were sure of having a
                        good thing of it, and hastened towards the scene of distress. As they came
                        in sight, the train commenced backing slowly, as if almost out of steam.
                        Nothing could have been more excessively rich to the raiders, and they
                        followed, full of fun. But the train kept on backing, keeping just out of
                        range, until suddenly the raiders received a volley of musketry, several
                        hundred of Confederate soldiers sprung upon them, and a fierce fight ensued.
                        A large number of horses that had been captured by the enemy were
                        recaptured, many of them were killed and wounded, and with the exception of
                        some taken prisoners, the rest were dispersed, and it is supposed, made
                        their escape."</p>
                    <p>From the Valley.</p>
                    <p>We learn the following particulars from the Valley. On Monday morning last,
                        Gen. Early's forces were attacked by the enemy about three miles below
                        Winchester, and the engagement lasted till after mid-day. Rodes occupied the
                        centre, Gordon, supported by Fitz Lee's cavalry, the right wing, and
                        Wharton, supported by Vaughn's, Imboden's, Jackson's and McCausland's
                        cavalry, the left.</p>
                    <p>On our right the enemy were defeated, but on the left, Vaughan's and
                        McCausland's men gave way, exposing Imboden's and Jackson's commands (who
                        are said to have fought splendidly,) to attack on both flanks, as well as in
                        front, and thus compelling them to fall back, in turn exposing Wharton to a
                        flank attack, which resulted in his withdrawal, when our whole force was
                        ordered to fall back. Except on the extreme left, the most perfect order in
                        the retreat was observed. Gordon's command particularly distinguished itself
                        in its unwavering order in falling back.</p>
                    <p>When the left was somewhat pressed, and some little confusion was being
                        created there, Fitz Lee threw his command from his position on the right to
                        the left, and charging the advancing enemy furiously, enabled the left to be
                        brought on in comparatively good order.</p>
                    <p>Every foot of the ground from the White House, below Winchester, to Newtown,
                        was contested by Gen Early, where night coming on, he withdrew his forces to
                        Fishers Hill, two miles this side of Strasburg. The enemy were skirmishing
                        heavily with our forces there, on Wednesday morning, when our informants
                        left, and it was supposed they would bring on a general engagement.</p>
                    <p>In the fight below Winchester, Gen. Rodes and Gen. Godwin were killed, and
                        Fitz Lee wounded. Col. Funk, of the 5th Va. infantry, was killed, and Maj.
                        Newton of the same regiment, wounded Capt. James Bumgardner and Lieut Wm.
                        Galt, of the 52d regiment were missing at last accounts.</p>
                    <p>Our loss was heavy, though not so heavy as at first reported, while the enemy
                        is said to have suffered more severely than we did.</p>

<b>Can We Be Conquered?</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor notes that the enemy is exultant over the capture of Atlanta and
                    the surrender of forts below Mobile. However, he argues, overrunning a country
                    is not the same as defeating it. He cites the example of the Valley of Virginia
                    and how often it has been invaded but never captured. The editor contends that
                    the Confederacy will never be defeated because of its resources and the spirit

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Can We Be Conquered?</p>
                    <p>There will be no time perhaps when we can propound the above question to
                        ourselves more appropriately for candid consideration than the present, when
                        our enemies are exultant over the occupation of Atlanta, and the surrender
                        of the forts below Mobile.</p>
                    <p>There are a few who think, with the Yankees, that overrunning a country
                        conquers it, but we would call to their mind the oft repeated times our own
                        beloved Valley of Virginia has been overrun by the overwhelming numbers of
                        the enemy, and, since Com[m]issary Banks first moved over the greater
                        portion of it, how many men it has furnished to aid in achieving Southern
                        independence. So far from conquering those parts of our country held in
                        their possession, it has been the means of increasing the ardor of these
                        true to our cause, and converting even the lukewarm into patriots.</p>
                    <p>The fall of Atlanta and the possession of the Mobile forts have not been
                        without their moral effect in the North, but Donnelson, New Orleans and
                        Vicksburg each had as much effect there, and each caused us to put forth
                        renewed exertion, which insured the discomfiture of the enemy at every point
                        of their advance. That likewise those causes, which may create in the minds
                        of some temporary despondency now, will in the end avail us much, we do not
                        doubt. While the spirit of resistance to Northern oppression burns as
                        intensely in the breast of the united people of the Confederacy, as at
                        present, we may be overwhelmed at a few points, or driven to the wall, but
                        cannot be conquered--no, never!</p>
                    <p>What remains for us to do is to nerve ourselves for a more desperate contest.
                        The clear spot of peace which gave evidence of bursting forth in the North
                        Western horizon, has been rudely darkened by the land which was expected to
                        dispel the clouds of war from the Northern sky, and spread the banner of
                        peace over a blood-stained land. The cry for war alone has its
                        representatives there, due to the late successes of our enemies, but the
                        spirit of peace, which is overshadowed at present by adverse circumstances,
                        will beam forth again with renewed brilliancy when we shall have proven to
                        the enemy, and the world, the fact that defeat at any point but adds renewed
                        vigor to Southern arms, and renders us more invincible than ever.</p>
                    <p>We have all along felt that we must wring peace from our enemies, and we
                        will, for, with the resources of our Confederacy, the spirit of our armies
                        and people, and with the help of God, we can never be conquered, but must in
                        the end triumph over those who would oppress our people, and make our land
                        desolate. Then let us put forth renewed exertions for the conflict, and
                        trust in God for a glorious result.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor calls the attention of readers to the notice published elsewhere
                    ordering the registration of all persons between the ages of 17 and 50 not
                    currently serving with the Confederacy or in the reserves. The editor assumes
                    this process is to review all exemptions and detail assignments. He calls for
                    "speedy compliance" and requests that the registration office be open at all
                    hours so that farmers, during this particular season, will not have to leave
                    their fields for long.<br>

                    <p>We publish in to-day's issue an order for the registration of all persons
                        between the ages of 17 and 50, not serving with the Confederate armies in
                        the field, or with the Reserves, whether exempt or detailed. This is not
                        intended to be a levy en masse, we presume, but to obtain information not
                        otherwise so speedily to be obtained, as well as to review all exemptions
                        and details. We call the attention of all interested to a speedy compliance
                        with the order of Col. Peyton, and would also request of him to arrange that
                        some one shall be on band at all hours to register parties reporting, as the
                        present is too important a season for the farmer to be compelled to come day
                        after day for several days on account of the inadequate number of clerks for
                        registering, or arriving after special office hours.</p>

                    June 5, 1864, in the battle at Piedmont. Greenway has been in the service since
                    August 12, 1861, and has had his father to die and his brother to be killed in
                    the battle of Atlanta since the war's beginning. The care he received in New
                    Hope, therefore, was of especial comfort to him.<br>
