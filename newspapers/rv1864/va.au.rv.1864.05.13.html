<b>Office Recorder of Va. Forces</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Joseph Jackson, Jr., Recorder for the Virginia Forces, writes the people of
                    Virginia to inform them that the state legislature intends to gather the names
                    and accompanying information of all Virginians who have served, are serving, or
                    will serve in the armed forces. This goal is complicated by the fact that no
                    such information has been assembled systematically in the three years of the
                    war. Jackson calls upon the people to form societies devoted to the gathering of
                    such information.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A large number of soldiers wounded in recent battles are in the hospital at
                    Staunton and have been well supplied by the women of the area with "little
                    delicacies prepared for them." The editor calls on readers to do what they can
                    to ameliorate the soldiers' conditions and especially asks persons living in
                    rural areas to do their "patriotic and humane duty."<br>

                    <p>Our Wounded.</p>
                    <p>For for the past few days large numbers of those wounded in the late fights
                        have arrived at Staunton. They were met at the trains by many of the Ladies
                        of this place, who supplied them with various little delicacies prepared for
                        them. Our hospital is full of these gallant unfortunates, who have been
                        wounded in defending our homes and firesides from the ruthless invader, and
                        while we can not heal their wounds by a simple wish, we can ameliorate their
                        condition much by sending many little things not generally needed for family
                        use, which will be thankfully received by them.</p>
                    <p>The attention of the Country people is especially directed to this patriotic
                        and humane duty. Send to the wounded anything you can spare and send at
                        once.</p>
