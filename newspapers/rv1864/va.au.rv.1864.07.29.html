<b>Hunter's Disastrous Retreat</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor quotes from an article in the Columbus (Ohio) Statesman and

                    <p>Hunter's Disastrous Retreat.</p>
                    <p>It really seems as if the justice of Heaven followed the retreat of Hunter's
                        vandals. Taking from women and children the last morsel of food they
                        possessed--in fact, wantonly destroying what they could not use-in the long
                        retreat over the mountains the inhuman villains themselves suffered from
                        hunger, and numbers died of starvation on the wayside. We published
                        yesterday a paragraph from an Ohio paper, stating that Hunter had lost 8,000
                        men in his advance and retreat. The facts relative to Hunter's losses, and
                        the just punishment that befell his followers, are making their appearance
                        in the papers of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The following extracts are taken from the Columbus Statesman. After giving an
                        account of their march through the Valley, the writer, a member of the 12th
                        Ohio regiment, proceeds as follows:</p>
                    <p>On the morning of the 18th nothing occurred but skirmishing, except a
                        demonstration of the enemy eleven lines deep made on our centre. Averill at
                        the same time made an unsuccessful effort to burn the bridge in the vicinity
                        of the city. On the evening of the 18th the army was ordered to retreat, and
                        the line of march was taken up for the Kanawha Valley. Whether or not it was
                        a retreat the narrator was not advised. The army marched about one hundred
                        and fifty-eight miles to Gauley bridge, meeting a supply train some few
                        miles before reaching the latter place. On the evening of the 17th, the
                        army, while before Lynchburg, received its last rations.</p>
                    <p>During the retreat the soldiers received nothing except once each a handful
                        of shelled corn. The report was current that twenty-seven men died from
                        hunger on the march, three dying after receiving supplies, but from
                        exhaustion unable to eat. The men marched the first night after leaving
                        Lynchburg twenty-five miles, and continued to march night and day until
                        reaching Gauley Bridge. A large number of men, unable to bear the fatigue,
                        dropped down exhausted by hunger, hard marching and went to sleep. The
                        number the writer could not ascertain, but it was very large. Nothing was
                        found on the road to eat. Fruit was not ripe, not even whortle berries. The
                        corn, if any in the country, could not be found. The cavalry horses had
                        nothing but grass to subsist upon, and, as a consequence, a very large
                        number of them fell down on the march exhausted. It was understood to be the
                        order of Gen. Averill to shoot all exhausted horses, preventing them thus
                        from falling into the hands of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>The army burned the Military Institute at Lexington, after rifling it of its
                        library which was found to be very fine. He had in his possession one of the
                        books. The railroad in the vicinity of Lynchburg was destroyed to a
                        considerable distance, though the important bridge aimed at to be burned was
                        too well guarded.</p>
                    <p>[This is the bridge across James river at Robinson's Mill. It was guarded by
                        a section of the Lynchburg artillery and battalion of infantry. Two
                        different movements were made against it--Ed. Virgn]</p>
                    <p>The Soldiers thought if General Hunter's intention was to take Lynchburg, he
                        failed. If it was to destroy a portion of railroad and burn the Military
                        Institute, he succeeded. The loss of men from all causes was very large. The
                        loss of horses felt not short of four thousand.</p>
                    <p>While marching from Lynchburg, some two thousand or more of the soldiers
                        became barefooted, and had to wrap up their feet with pieces of blanket. A
                        number of negroes were taken on the route. A very large proportion of the
                        negroes were furnished with horses, or were carried in wagons or ambulances.
                        A soldier, whose feet were wrapped with pieces of blanket and exhausted from
                        the march, halted a negro on a horse and took posses[s]ion of the animal.
                        Gen. Hunter hearing of the fact, rode up to the soldier, ordered him to
                        dismount, and horse-whipped him, placing the negro again upon the horse.</p>
                    <p>The retreat from Lynchburg was not in any order, General Crook told the men
                        to make their way back as best they could. The whole army straggled, rather
                        than marched, all the way from Lynchburg to Gauley.</p>
                    <p>The time of service of the 12th regiment expired while at Lynchburg. A
                        portion of the regiment re-enlisted last winter. The larger portion have
                        retur[n]ed home to be mustered out of service.</p>
                    <p>The Washington Repu[b]lican says:</p>
                    <p>An officer who accompanied Gen. Hunter in his recent raid in the direction of
                        Lynchburg, informs us that the sufferings and adventures of the soldiers are
                        scarcely paralleled in the history of warfare. On the return march hardly a
                        blade of grass was seen for three days. The soldiers fed their horses with
                        corn out of their hands, and ate only the grass that dropped to the ground.
                        One informant saw men eating common tallow candles with a most extraordinary
                        relish. Others dug up roots out of the ground and plucked buds from the
                        trees for food.</p>

<b>Lincoln's Late Call</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor comments on Lincoln's latest call for a half million more
                    soldiers to enlist in Northern armies within fifty days or else face the draft.
                    The editor states that such tactics no longer scare the South, in light of the
                    fact that the North initially supposed that a few of its soldiers would
                    subjugate the South in a matter of days. The war has lasted long enough by this
                    point to demonstrate that the South will not easily be subjugated and long
                    enough so that even Massachusetts, where war support has been strong, is having
                    to look to Southern African Americans to fill its quota in this latest call of
                    Lincoln. The editor believes that the South will stand strong in the face of the
                    North's increased forces.<br>

                    <p>Lincoln's Late Call.</p>
                    <p>The calls of Lincoln for more men with which to strengthen his power in the
                        North by subjugating, if possible, the people of the Confederate States have
                        long since ceased to cause even a thrill of alarm in the Southern breast. We
                        receive and repeat it as any other news from the North which is of but small
                        moment to us, of which the Northern papers present a superabundance. The
                        fact nevertheless exists. Lincoln has called for half a million more men. If
                        these men are not forthcoming in fifty days a draft will be resorted to. But
                        will they be forthcoming in the fifty days? It can scarcely be supposed that
                        they will. The ardor of the North has been chilled by stern facts. According
                        to their own showing, over two and a half millions of men have been raised
                        to subdue the South, and now three millions, at least, ate acknowledged to
                        be necessary to accomplish the work which was to have been completed by
                        75,000 in 90 days. It is and can be viewed in no other way by them than as a
                        grand slaughter pen into which they will have entered, from which there is
                        little hope to escape save by torturing disease or who death-dealing
                        Southern rifle. The Governor of Massachusetts knows that from his state the
                        men will not be forthcoming (and when Massachusetts, strongest for the war,
                        will not furnish the men, what state will?) and has already ordered, in
                        pursuance of an act of Congress of July 4th, 1864, that agents be sent to
                        the States in rebellion to "find" and recruit negroes to be credited to that
                        state. This would be a very humiliating confession for a Southern Governor
                        to make by such an act, but it may save the lives of some of the people of
                        Massachusetts and that is all he cares for Pride like honor has fled from
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Lincoln himself has no idea of succeeding but consoles himself by saying that
                        "if he fails he, at least, will have the satisfaction of going down with the
                        colors flying."</p>
                    <p>We hope ere the fifty days expire such may be our success that the enemy may
                        be perfectly willing to retire from the contest and leave us in undisturbed
                        peace--but should they then attempt to drag forth the number of men called
                        for, we have an abiding faith in the strength and valor of our noble armies
                        and believe they will hurl back, discomfited and dismayed, all the vile
                        hordes who may be driven at the point of the bayonet against them.</p>

                    <p>War News.</p>
                    <p>The same quiet for some days past, continues on the lines in front of
                        Petersburg. Occasional shells thrown at the City, to gather with some picket
                        firing constitute the total of recent hostilities in that direction. The
                        report is current and is believed that the enemy has crossed a portion of
                        one corps to the north side of James River near City Point for the purpose
                        of preventing our artillery, firing upon their transports. It seems now to
                        be a well ascertained fact. [illegible] resting upon the [illegible] road.
                        This, like all former attempts of Ulysses, to take the [illegible] will
                        prove a failure, and will only demonstrate more fully his utter incompetency
                        to cope with Gen. Lee.</p>
                    <p>The news from Georgia as far as received is cheering. Gen Hood, scarcely
                        installed as Commander in Chief, made a discovery not thought of heretofore
                        by a commander of that army, that the enemy have flanks and a rear as well
                        as himself. He very promptly took advantage of this discovery and the result
                        proves, the driving them from two lines of their entrenchments, the capture
                        of 2000 prisoners, 13 pieces of artillery and 18 stands of colours. Very
                        good for a beginning, and augurs well for the future success of that gallant
                        army. The Yankees commenced shelling the City without any notice being given
                        to remove the women and children to places of safety. This barbarous
                        violation of civilized warfare enabled him to murder only a few
                        noncombatants.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Hood issued the following order to his troops.</p>
                    <p>Headquarters Army Tennessee,</p>
                    <p>In the Field, July 25.</p>
                    <p>Soldiers--Experience has proved to you that safety in time of battle consists
                        in getting into close quarters with the enemy. Guns and colors are the only
                        unerring indications of victory. The valor of troops is easily estimated,
                        too, by the number of those received. If your enemy be allowed to continue
                        the operation of flanking you out of position, our cause is in peril. Your
                        recent brilliant success proves your ability to prevent it. You have but to
                        will it and God will grant us the victory which your commander and your
                        country so confidently expect.</p>
                    <p>(Signed) J.B. Hood,</p>
                    <p>General.</p>
                    <p>(On the 20th inst., Gen. Ramseur whilst on the move to attack the enemy
                        beyond Winchester, his men at the time resting, was surprised by a large
                        force of the enemy about 4 miles beyond that place, and compelled to fall
                        back with the loss of four pieces of artillery and between 200 and 300
                        prisoners. Gen. Lilly of this place was wounded and fell into the enemy's
                        hands.)</p>
                    <p>After Ramseur's unfortunate affair our army fell back this side of
                        Winchester. On Sunday the 24th inst., General Early fought the enemy
                        numbering 15,000, commanded by Gen. Crook, on the old Kernstown battle
                        ground, in which he completely routed them, driving them through Winchester
                        and five miles beyond. The streets of Winchester were again the scene of
                        severe fighting. We learned that the enemy burned all their wagons, about
                        400, to prevent their falling into our hands and that we killed a great many
                        and captured a large number, estimated by persons just from Winchester, as
                        high as 2000.</p>
                    <p>The Yankee Gen. Mulligan, was mortally wounded and fell into our hands. Gen.
                        Lilly, together with the other officers and men captured by the enemy on the
                        20th inst., was recaptured.</p>

                    <p>Schedule of Prices.</p>
                    <p>Such has been the opposition to the recent schedule of prices established by
                        the Commissioners for Va. throughout the State, that the Commissioners feel
                        constrained to meet at an early day to revise the schedule by a reduction of
                        prices. We trust that they may this time consult common sense, as well as
                        persons from various portions of the State, who may or may not be
                        interested, and give us a schedule which will be just and fair to all
                        parties and will not destroy the effect of Congressional legislation by
                        lowering the standard of Confederate Currency, but will rather aid it by
                        appreciating the value of our money. We append the letter of the
                        Commissioners:</p>
                    <p>July 22, 1864.</p>
                    <p>"The Board of Commissioners for Virginia will meet at an early day to revise
                        their schedule of prices in regard to grain, flour, meal &amp;c., with
                        the intention of reducing prices. At our last meeting it was almost
                        impossible to obtain reliable data upon which to found prices. In advising
                        with gentleman from various portions of the State, we defer to the general
                        opinions expressed by those we consult; nor do we derive our information
                        alone from one class of our fellow-citizens, however respectable."</p>
                    <p>In this connection we call attention to the resolutions passed at a meeting
                        of farmers and citizens held at the Court House, on Monday last, court day,
                        published in another column.</p>

                    benefit a few large proprietors but will hurt other people and will depreciate
                    Confederate money, thereby causing all Southerners to suffer.<br>(Names in announcement:  J. Marshall McCuePresident,  Hugh W. SheffeySecretary,  Alexander H. H. StuartEsquire,  William A. BurnettClerk)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Public Meeting.</p>
                    <p>A number of the Farmers and Citizens of Augusta County, having assembled at
                        their Court House to take into consideration the schedule of prices recently
                        established by the Commissioners for the State of Virginia, do hereby
                        declare their earnest and unqualified disapproval of the notion of these
                        commissioners. If that schedule be adhered to, it will lead to the
                        Bankruptcy of the Confederate Government, or the repudiation of the debt for
                        which its faith is solemnly pledged. Whilst the schedule is ostensibly, for
                        the benefit of the fairness its advantages are altogether illusory. The
                        extravagant prices in a depreciated currency, which are allowed for the
                        present crops must be followed at an early day, (if the debt is over paid)
                        by a system of taxation, which will, in the end, prove ruinous to the
                        agricultural interest.</p>
                    <p>The publication of the schedule has already been fruitful of injurious
                        consequences. Gold has risen, or in other words, Confederate money has been
                        depreciated, fully 25 per cent and the feeling of distrust and insecurity
                        has been greatly increased. As a necessary consequence, the prices of all
                        provisions, and domestic supplies, have been enhanced, and in some parts of
                        the state, farmers and others, refuse to receive the notes of the government
                        on any terms. This single set of the Commissioners, has more than
                        counterbalanced all the patriotic efforts of Congress and the Executive, to
                        ameliorate the currency, and revive the credit of the government.</p>
                    <p>Its operation on the families of soldiers, and on all persons of fixed or
                        moderate incomes, will be in a high degree, oppressive. Whilst Congress, by
                        a recent law, sought to advance the interests of the soldiers, by increasing
                        their pay about fifty per cent, the Commissioners have frustrated the
                        beneficent purposes of Congress, by increasing the price of corn, flour and
                        other necessaries of life, five hundred per cent!</p>
                    <p>An adherence to this schedule, must, soon swell the Confederate debt to an
                        amount beyond the capacity of the people to pay. The debt of the government,
                        is the debt of the people, and must be paid (if paid at all) by the people.
                        But how can the people expect to discharge the debt, if more is paid for a
                        single crop, than fee-simple value of the land which produced it. Examples
                        can be found, in this county, in which the crops of the present year, will
                        bring, at schedule prices, more than six times the original cost of the land
                        on which they were raised!</p>
                    <p>Such a condition of things is well calculated to inspire, and has inspired,
                        distrust and alarm, in the public mind, and no reverse that has yet befallen
                        our arms, has caused as much despondency, or proved so injurious to the
                        public credit, as this unwise and short-sighted act of the Commissioners.</p>
                    <p>The schedule may swell the nominal profits of a few large landed proprietors,
                        but its effects on the non producers, and middle classes, will be sad
                        indeed. The necessaries of life will be placed beyond their reach, and
                        starvation and misery must be their lot, unless timely relief is afforded by
                        its repeal.</p>
                    <p>The farmers, and other citizens of Augusta, do therefore, most earnestly
                        protest against this extravagant, and ill advised schedule of prices. They
                        believe that it would be better for the farmers to accept one third or one
                        fourth of the schedule prices for their productions in the currency as it
                        was before the schedule was adopted, than the full amount, in Treasury notes
                        depreciated as they have been by than unfortunate measure, because they
                        would then feel some assurance that the money would ultimately be of value.</p>
                    <p>What the farmers need, is not ex[h]orbitant prices, but a sound
                        currency--exemption from unnecessary interference with their
                        labour--protection from the lawless conduct of petty officers and a proper
                        regulation of the rail roads so as to afford them ready access to market
                        with their crops. If these are afforded--they hazard nothing in saying that
                        the Valley counties can furnish all the breadstuffs, and a large portion of
                        the other provisions and forage for the supply of the army of Northern
                        Virginia.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion they earnestly invoke the President of the Confederate States
                        to cause the commissioners, to be called together as promptly as possible,
                        to set aside their extravagant schedule.</p>

                    <p>Office Recorder Virginia Forces,</p>
                    <p>Richmond July 15, 1864.</p>
                    <p>The Worshipful Justices of the County Court of Augusta.</p>
                    <p>Gentleman: The accompanying circular will explain the prominent object for
                        which this office was established. Another duty has been committed in it,
                        and to that I ask your attention.</p>
                    <p>For some time past the newspapers of the county have been filled with
                        accounts from every part of the Confederacy penetrated by the invader, and
                        especially from the different sections of the State of Virginia, charging
                        that the enemy's soldiery, and particularly, their raiding parties, are
                        making war upon the unarmed and defenceless of this community, ravaging the
                        country, and inflicting upon the people every species of insult and injury.
                        Among the offences thus charged are, so devastating the country as to render
                        it unfit for the habitation or sustenance of its resident population,
                        abducting our negro slaves, and arming them against us; burning dwellings,
                        mills, factories, records, seminaries, printing offices, libraries and works
                        of art; breaking up fences, roads and bridges; desecrating churches; taking
                        such private property as can be carried off and destroying what cannot be;
                        stripping families of the necessaries of life; imprisoning and inflicting
                        personal injury upon unarmed citizens--and worse than all, offering insult,
                        outrage and violence to defenceless women.</p>
                    <p>These accounts have recently become so numerous, come from so many different
                        quarters and the offences charged are so flagrant, that the Governor of
                        Virginia, considering it necessary to have them fully investigated, has
                        instructed this office to carefully ascertain what wrongs and injuries,
                        contrary to the rules of war, have been committed upon the people of
                        Virginia, prepare a properly verified narrative thereof, and preserve it
                        among the records of this office.</p>
                    <p>This is a work which can be properly performed only by the people who are
                        injured, and each country should make up and sent to this office a record of
                        the wrongs committed within its limits, preparing its narrative carefully,
                        sustaining each item by proper and sufficient evidence, and putting it into
                        such shafe [sic] that it can be readily referred to. The county authorities
                        should see that this record is promptly and properly made, and the people
                        generally should ascertain all the facts and obtain all the evidence within
                        their reach.</p>
                    <p>The county court is the custodian of the business interest and welfare of the
                        county--the assertor of its rights, and the vindicator of the wrongs done to
                        its people. Its members, usually the best business men of the county, come
                        from its every section--are familiarly acquainted with all the people, are
                        the friends and advisers of most of them in matters of business and periods
                        of trouble and distress, and aggregate a greater influence and more general
                        knowledge of all, whether of good or evil, which concerns the county people,
                        than any other equal number of its citizens. The county court, then, is
                        clearly the source from which this action should spring.</p>
                    <p>These views and the plan herein after set out, are approved by His Excellency
                        Gov. Smith, and under his instructions I lay them before you, with the
                        request that you will make such orders and take such action as will instruct
                        the prompt preparation of such a record in your county.</p>
                    <p>Should no better plan occur to you, permit me to suggest the following: By
                        the proper order of court assign to the magistrates of each district the
                        duty of preparing the record, and taking the evidence of all outrages
                        committed by the enemy within that district. Let them notify the people of
                        the district when and where to come before them what is to be perpetuated,
                        and by what testimony, so that before the time appointed facts may be
                        collected, citizens can write out what they know and can prove and what is
                        known to and can be proved by their neighbors. At each term of the court let
                        each district send in what has been prepared, and directly after each term
                        let all so sent in be so copied as to admit of being made into a book here,
                        be certified by the clerk under the seal of the court, and forwarded to this
                        office. If you will pursue this course, the work can rapidly and surely done
                        with little labor for any one person, and all that relates to your county
                        will be made into a separate book and preserved here, while the originals
                        will remain among your county records.</p>
                    <p>Within your limits are many refugees from counties now in possession of the
                        enemy and likely to remain so for a considerable time. Many of these are
                        said to be the victims of wrong, and to know of many other cases. Let me
                        request that those [illegible] and their evidence be also taken and
                        certified by you and the originals forwarded to this office.</p>
                    <p>As reclamation may hereafter be made for property taken or destroyed by the
                        enemy, it will be for the interest of the owner that the taking or
                        destruction should when possible, be also proven by other persons that the
                        owner.</p>
                    <p>In making up these statements, wherever it can be done, please state the
                        company, regiment or force by which these wrongs have been committed, and
                        the officer commanding the force, so that they may be fixed upon their
                        immediate perpetrators.</p>
                    <p>In some cases the enemy has been guided, aided or encouraged by persons who
                        then or previously resided in the state. In such cases please set out all
                        the facts distinctly, with such description of the person as will thoroughly
                        identify him.</p>
                    <p>In meeting these acts of the enemy many evidences of heroism, devotion and
                        courage have been exhibited, especially by disabled soldiers, clergymen, old
                        men, women and children--and many such have in various ways, during this
                        war, often at great personal hardship and peril, rendered signal service to
                        their country, and entitled themselves to a high niche in the temple of
                        fame. These are jewels in the coronal [sic] of Virginia's honor too bright
                        to be lost, and I beg that you will carefully ascertain and faithfully
                        record all the details of these noble acts. Please send them to me separate
                        from the history before desired, for such a bright record should not be
                        bound in the same book with any thing disgraceful or unworthy.</p>
                    <p>I shall be pleased to hear from you that this work has been commenced, and
                        will be happy to see any one interested in the subject at the Record Office,
                        and furnish all the aid in the matter which it can render.</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully,</p>
                    <p>Your most ob'dt serv't,</p>
                    <p>Jos. Jackson, Jr.</p>
                    <p>Recorder Va. Forces.</p>
                    <p>Virginia: At a court held for the county of Augusta, at the Court-house on
                        Monday, the 25th of July 1864.</p>
                    <p>The court having had read to it a communication from Jos. Jackson, Jr.
                        Recorder of the Virginia Forces in respect to the perpetuation of
                        testimonies proving outrages committed by the public enemy and other
                        matters, it is ordered, that said communication be published in the
                        newspapers printed in Staunton for the information of the justices; and the
                        court approving the suggestions contained in said communication it is
                        further ordered, that each justice be requested to take the testimony and
                        statements indicated in said communication and to report the same as
                        promptly as practicable to the Clerk of this court who is hereby directed,
                        in such form as may be suggested by said Recorder, to copy or have copied
                        the evidence, statements and matters so reported to him; and the said clerk
                        is authorized to purchase the paper necessary for the purposes aforesaid on
                        account of the county; and the court will hereafter appropriate the money
                        necessary to pay the Clerk a reasonable compensation for his labor and
                        expenses in executing this order.</p>
                    <p>A Copy, Teste,</p>
                    <p>William A. Burnett, Clerk.</p>
                    <p>July 29--2m.</p>
