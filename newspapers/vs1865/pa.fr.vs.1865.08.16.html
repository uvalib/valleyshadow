<b>The Poor Negro</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The black population of Washington City has surged to 25,000, reports the
                    article, the vast majority of them homeless, living from day to day, hand to
                    hand. The group is chiefly composed of former southern slaves who followed the
                    advancing Union armies to escape their bondage and establish new lives. In fact,
                    the article recounts, quite the opposite has come true. The black refugees have
                    grown so disillusioned by their situation that many of them would gladly return
                    to their masters. Should the winter come without any sort of change in the
                    freedmen's circumstances, "spring will find them largely diminished in numbers
                    and thousands will be broken and shattered."<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are twenty-five thousand negroes huddled in Washington City and its
                        suburbs. They occupy every nook and corner of the city, and those that are
                        able to pay from two to four dollars per month enjoy the luxury of a ten by
                        twelve feet section of a row of shanties of rough boards covered with felt
                        and tar. They are employed at every conceivable menial employment, from that
                        of porters and cooks down to boot blacking and scavengering. One broken
                        stove frequently serves for several families; the fuel is gathered off the
                        streets, from camp debris and in ash heaps by the children, and mgeh of the
                        clothing used is gathered from among the cast off habiliments of the
                        soldiers. The lot of thousands of these poor creatures is hard, indeed. Few
                        of them live in comfort, while very many go hungry and almost naked. Some
                        even starve. Perhaps no other city can furnish a more striking contrast of
                        extremes--wealth luxury and magnificence, and poverty, wretchedness and
                        squalor--than the Federal Capital.</p>
                    <p>The most of these poor creatures are from the South, having followed the
                        soldiers to the land of promise in the North, inspired with vague dreams of
                        ease, comfort and freedom. From the eyes of all the scales have already
                        fallen. The delusion under which they labored, and which was too often
                        fostered by their false white friends, has brought them only suffering and
                        loss. --Gladly would the majority of them go back to their old masters, even
                        accepting the alternative of slavery. It is to be hoped that the time may
                        soon arrive when all can go back to the old plantations--not, however, as
                        slaves; but as free men and women--where, in peace and surrounded by old
                        familiar scenes, they may enjoy to the full extent what they prize above all
                        things, a plentiful supply of the earth's fruits and fatness. If compelled
                        to undergo another winter's rigors and privations, spring will find them
                        largely diminished in numbers and thousands will be broken and shattered.</p>
                    <p>The cruelty which slavery undoubtedly perpetrated upon this race for
                        generations has perhaps been greatly exceeded in violence and extent during
                        the past few years by that of the pretended friends of the negro. Four years
                        of theoretical philanthropy, combined with selfish and practical neglect and
                        inhumanity, has probably swept away more of the blacks than a quarter of a
                        century of involuntary servitude.</p>

<b>Reconstruction of Southern Industry</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Since the end of the war, the Spirit avers, southerners have been far too
                    busy trying to get their lives together to worry about politics. To help speed
                    the process, the article urges the federal government to take a hands-off
                    approach. With slavery finished, the introduction of the new labor regime has
                    fueled the break up of the large plantations that had dominated the antebellum
                    landscape. These smaller units, the piece assures readers, will provide large
                    numbers of landless whites and yeomen with a chance to improve their station,
                    and will lead to a more varied distribution of wealth. Rather than interfere,
                    the North should let the experiment continue.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Authentic information from all parts of the South represents the people as
                        more intent on the rehabilitation of their private affairs than on the
                        success of any political measure. They feel that that they have been ruined
                        by too great an interest in politics, and they would gladly take a long
                        season of repose before embarking again on that stormy sea. We, at the
                        North, are too much given to look at the South with reference merely to the
                        part it is hereafter to play in our government system; a bad habit caught
                        from the politician, who consider these questions only in their bearing on
                        the presidential elections.</p>
                    <p> The best service the federal government can render to southern prosperity is
                        to forbear interference, and allow the energies of the South free play. The
                        people are already beginning to take a wise and sagacious view of the
                        situation. A thoughtful and judicious article which we find in a recent
                        number of the Houston Telegraph contains advice
                        so excellent that if the general current of southern sentiment runs in the
                        same direction, the prosperity of the South will in a few years, be greater
                        than it ever was under the old system. It is gratifying to find such views
                        originating, self-prompted, and in the most distant of the Southern States.
                        The article in the Telegraph is so manly and
                        considerate that we insert a long extract, in the hope that it will make
                        more impression upon our southern readers than any advice obtruded upon them
                        from a northern source. </p>
                    <p>The writer retracts nothing which he previously held in respect to the
                        advantages of the slave system. Like every system, it had its weak as well
                        as its good points; and now that it is irreversibly overthrown, the writer
                        maintains that there is no want of consistency in bringing its weak points
                        into the foreground and contrasting them with the favorable aspects of the
                        new future. It would be foolish to retain the disadvantages of the system
                        that is gone and reject the advantages of the system which must take its
                        place. The southern editor contrasts the two sysstems as follows:</p>
                    <p>One of the features of our old system was the large and growing landed
                        estates in the lower and richer planting regions, which had their
                        disadvantages, but which compensated therfor, in our eyes, by the great
                        wealth they brought to the country, and by the support they gave the system
                        of which they were a part, and from which they were inseparable, unless
                        checked by legal constraints. The motive for sustaining these disadvantages
                        has now passed away, and they may be abated, without the violation of any
                        interest, by the legitimate operation of the new system of labor we find it
                        necessary to adopt.</p>
                    <p>We have shown that while it may be impossible under the free labor system to
                        conduct large planations as profitably as under the old system, the same
                        lands may be better and more profitably cultivated when divided into small
                        farms than ever before. We illustrated the case by showing that a man worth
                        no capital whatever, could rent fifty acres of good planting land, hire the
                        necessary help, make a good living, make about a thousand dollars clear, and
                        pay a rent which would be a good interest on the money invested in the land.
                        --It may be objected that in this country, where land is abundant and cheap,
                        men who are industrious and energetic enough to make the money to pay these
                        rents will buy instead of renting. Then let the large landowners sell
                        alternative sections, or otherwise, as may be suitable, on time if
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>One of the evils of the large landed estates was that they gradually
                        swallowed up all the smaller plantations and farms, until at length, in some
                        regions, a very few proprietors would come to be the sole possessons of vast
                        tracts of country, embracing nearly whole parishes and counties. This
                        destroyed society, and introduced a system of absenteeism; the planters,
                        with their families, spending most of their time at homes in other parts of
                        the country, in the villages or cities, or, as was sometimes the case, in
                        New York or Paris; leaving the whole region to be inhabited by a few
                        overseers and thousands upon thousands of negroes. Of course, in such a
                        state of things, rich and highly favored as the region of country may be,
                        there is no possibility of general improvement, no encouragement to any
                        other branch of industry besides planting, no inspiration to any of the
                        arts, no possibility of society, or social development, culture, and
                        enjoyment. There is no symmetry in the development and industry of a region
                        of country under such a system. It is really a perversion of the purposes of
                        nature and of Providence. All interest of the proprietors in the country is
                        limited to the amount of land and negroes they possess, the amount of sugar,
                        and rice they can produce, and the amount of money they can realize. Public
                        spirit is utterly dead, and no improvements can be accomplished, except
                        those of the planters for the benefit of their negroes.</p>
                    <p>It is true that this picture only represents those regions of low, alluvial,
                        and most universally rich lands, where the whole country, almost, is capable
                        of being covered with plantations. But the tendency was the same in all the
                        rich planting regions. --Under this system, also, large tracts of the best
                        land in the world were permitted to lie wild and waste, and could not be
                        brought into cultivation. The planters cultivated only what could be managed
                        by their own force, and would neither sell nor rent, leaving the untilled
                        lands for the day when they should, by continual buying, have negroes enough
                        to cultivate them, or as a safe investment for their children.</p>
                    <p>Under the system of smaller farms and plantations which free labor will
                        introduce all this will be changed, and changed much for the better; and we
                        shall realize some compensation for the enforced emancipation fo the
                        negroes, by the removal of the evils above described, and by the
                        introduction of their corresponding advantages. The country will be peopled
                        by a white population, and society will be organized and established. And it
                        will be a thrifty and prosperous population, for people are always
                        prosperous when cultivating fertile lands. Poor men who rent will gradually
                        improve until they can buy, and the proprietors who rent lands to them will
                        receive a handsome interest on their landed investments. Men of small means
                        who are able to purchase the lands they cultivate will gradually rise into
                        prosperous farmers. Small landed estates, with independent white families
                        upon them, will cover the country, in place of the few immense plantations,
                        with only overseers and negro quarters for population and society. And a
                        prosperous people will always become an intelligent and refined people.
                        There will still be large proprietors, probably, but in connection with them
                        will rise up that strength and glory of a country--a prosperous,
                        strong-charactered, intelligent, and refined middle class--a population that
                        can vote as well as labor; and intelligently and healthfully represent the
                        wealth of the country in its legislative councils. The land will be filled
                        with tasteful and pleasant homes industrious yeomen women, and refined
                        gentlemen and ladies. All branches of industry will spring up and flourish,
                        and all the arts find inspiration and patronage. Under the large plantation
                        system, everything went to decay and dilapidation, except the cultivation of
                        the soil, because dependent upon the careless, rude, and destructive negro.
                        Under the new system, good houses will be built, and tastefully surrounded
                        and decorated. --Roads, which were only fit for the mule and negro and their
                        plantation wagons to travel upon, will become pleasant highways fit for the
                        travel of a refined people. --Fences, gates, bridges; ferries, and
                        everything of a similar character will assume a new aspect. Instead of old
                        barns, called churches, reached, with great difficulty, through mud and
                        miserable roads, at great distances from each other, where people
                        occasionally, though lamely, celebrated the lost worship of God, churches of
                        elegant and appropriate architecture will be reared at convenient distances,
                        all over the land, in regard to which the children and yound people will be
                        able to say, "I was glad when they said unto me, let us go up into the house
                        of the Lord." And similar improvement will be seen, also, in the
                        schoolhouses, schools, and education of the country. Thus we see that, much
                        as we regret giving up our old system, we may find some comfort in
                        contemplating the advantages of the new one.</p>
                    <p>When we see views so sensible and sagacious springing up spontaneously in the
                        South, immediately after the total subversion of a system of industry which
                        the people had brought themselves to consider the best in the world, we
                        ought to be convinced that they are fully competent to solve the great
                        problem force upon them. If we are discreet, we shall abstain from officious
                        intermeddling. Our chief interst in the South is that it shall become
                        prosperous; but the Southern people have a greater interest in this result
                        than we have, and we may safely take it for granted that they are better
                        judges of their own business on the spot than we can be at this distance.</p>
                    <p>The South, when industry revives under the new system, will not only lighten
                        our taxes by its increased ability to share them, but will open to our
                        productions a great market even more valuable than the West itself, which,
                        in its intercourse with the East, is perpetually giving and receiving
                        riches. Consider how our cities have been built up by the western trade,
                        within the last twenty years; and then consider that the South, instead of
                        beginning with nothing, as the West did, will start anew as a well settled
                        country free from the necessity of devoting half the labor of the year to
                        providing shelter, fuel, and subsistence during a cold winter. Instead of a
                        few very wealthy proprietors, expending their incomes on foreign luxuries or
                        in foreign residence, the mass of the people will, like the people of the
                        West, become large consumers of articles the bulk of which will be of
                        American productions.</p>
                    <p>Instead of pestering and irritating the people by thrusting upon them our
                        notions as to how they ought to manage their affairs, let us exercise a
                        generous confidence in their ability to make the best of the situation.
                        Meddlesome interference can only do harm. The large plantations will fall to
                        pieces by the operation of necessary economical causes; and when the land is
                        cultivated by small proprietors, there will arise in the South a thrifty,
                        intelligent middle class, which is the best basis for Republican
                        institutions. Let us not commit the folly of arresting the natural tendency
                        of Southern society in this direction, and prejudice a good cause by
                        exciting disgust against intrusive and impertinent advice. Southern society
                        can never be successfully reorganized from without, but only from
                    within.</p>

<b>"The Bedford Homicide"</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Offers a rejoinder to the Repository's account of Jacob Crouse's death. In
                    contrast to its Republican rival, which places blame for the crime on the
                    assailant, the Spirit argues that the "moral responsibility" for the shooting
                    rests with the Republicans who have created a climate of intolerance over the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> Under the above caption the Repository of last
                        week contains a very lengthy editorial article in relation to the recent
                        lamentatable affair in Bedford. It would seem to those acquainted with the
                        facts that the article could have been intended for no other purpose than to
                        place the Messrs. Reed in a false position before the public, and to
                        prejudice their case before the jury which is to try them. The
                        representations of the connection of Mengel Reed with the rebel army and the
                        expatriation of John P. Reed, Jr., to avoid the Draft, as contained in the
                        article referred to, are so much at variance with the truth as scarcely to
                        bear even a semblance to it. It is not however our purpose at this time to
                        correct the misrepresentations of the Repository
                        in these particulars as the truth will be fully developed before a court and
                        jury in a very short period, but simply to make a few comments on the
                        following extract. The Repository says: </p>
                    <p>"Whatever may be the determination of the law as to this fearful homicide,
                        can any dispassionate and conscientious citizen doubt where rests the moral
                        responsibility for the murder of Mr. Crouse?"</p>
                    <p>We confess we can see no room for doubt, as to where rests the "moral
                        responsibility" for this unfortunate affair. To even a careless observer of
                        events, during the past four years, there can scarcely be a doubt about it.
                        The spirit of lawlessness which impelled Jacob Crouse to pursue young Reed
                        through the streets of Bedford with jeers and insults, is the same which the
                        Republican Press and Republican leaders have been instilling into the minds
                        of their followers ever since the commencement of the war. Under the
                        teaching and example of these men, many were induced to think that to abuse,
                        vilify and insult a fellow citizen of a different political faith, was a
                        meritorious act, and a strong evidence of patriotism and "loyalty." To the
                        teachings of this same press was owing the spirit, so rife in the Northern
                        States since 1861, which delighted in mobs the destruction of property and
                        life, and the incarceration of men guiltless of offence, in bastiles, to
                        gratify the malignant hate of men who arrogated to themselves all the
                        "loyalty" of the country. It was a spirit evoked by the press and leaders of
                        the Republican party, which impelled Jacob Crouse to follow up Reed, goad
                        and insult him, until driven to the wall, his life in imminent danger, he
                        fired the fatal shot which terminated the existence of Mr. Crouse. Where
                        then rests the "moral responsibility" of this homicide? Surely, upon the men
                        who give sentiment to the party from which poor Crouse drew his inspiration
                        and learned that, to insult, bully and beat a fellow man were meritorious
                        actions. The "moral responsiblity" rests upon these false and wicked
                        teachers and the blood of Jacob Crouse stains, indelibly, their
                    garments.</p>

                    <p> The Abolition Convention of Franklin county met in the public school
                        building, in this place, on Tuesday the 8th inst., and went through the motions of nominating a ticket to be voted for
                        by the "loyal" people at the election this fall. The whole thing had been
                        fixed up in Greencastle the day previous, by a clique of renegade Democrats
                        who have succeeded in obtaining the entire control and management of the
                        delectable party of negro-suffrageites in this county. --After the
                        organization of the Convention, the Greencastle ticket was brought in by a
                        portion of the Antrim delegation, under the personal direction and
                        supervision of an old fox--who became "loyal" when Democracy ceased to put
                        money in his purse and heap honors upon him--and presented to that body,
                        which looked upon it, saw that it was lovely, and dutifully adopted the
                        bantling as its own progeny. The following is the ticket, which as a whole,
                        is one of the weakest ever presented to the people for their suffrages: </p>

<b>Negro Suffrage in the Elections</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In the upcoming election, the Radicals are sure to make black suffrage a
                    key issue. To bolster their cause, the article contends, Republicans will try to
                    ease the voting restrictions already in place in the North to avoid any

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The certainty that negro suffrage will be a prominent issue in the state
                        elections, renders it proper that Democrats should consider in what manner
                        that issue ought to be met. The subject will come up not only as a question
                        of federal, but also as a question of State politics. In most of the
                        Northern States negroes are either not allowed to vote all, or they vote
                        under disabilities and restrictions to which white citizens are not subject.
                        As a necessary step toward forcing negro suffrage on the South, the
                        Republicans will attempt to make it universal in the North. It would be a
                        piece of indiscribable effrontery if the Northern States used the federal
                        government as an engine for compelling the South to adobt a policy which the
                        Northern States repudiate themselves.</p>
                    <p> True indeed it is, that if every Northern State should admit its negroes to
                        the ballot-box and abolish all political distinctions founded on color, such
                        a change would not in the least impair the constitutional right of each Southern State to regulate the
                        suffrage for itself. What is done or delayed, by separate State action in
                        the North, may be done or delayed, by precisely the same right in every
                        State in the South. But although this right is impregnable in law, the
                        Republican party do not intend to recognize it in fact. The obstacle which
                        makes the greatest figure in their minds is not that erected by the
                        Constitution, but that presented by the impudent inconsistency of attempting
                        to force down the throats of the South a measure too nauseous to be
                        swallowed by the North. They are conscious that they cannot stand up against
                        the scorn which would be poured upon them for such pharisaic hypocrisy. </p>
                    <p> It being, then, a necessary part of the Republican programme to clothe the
                        Northern negroes with the elective franchise, the question fairly arises as
                        to the duty of the Democratic party in the premises. On this subject we have
                        no doubt; it is the duty of the Democratic party to oppose negro suffrage, root and branch. True, as a purely
                        domestic question of State politics, it would be divested of the most
                        objectionable features which it wears as a federal question. If any State
                        chooses to admit negroes to the suffrage, no other State has a right to
                        object. This is a matter in regard to which the States are independent,
                        alike of each other and of the Federal Government. But in point of fact, the
                        domestic and the federal questions are at present so interwoven that they
                        cannot be separated. The domestic question is to be made an issue in the
                        State elections, only as a necessary step in forcing it into federal
                        politics. Whatever, therefore, might be thought of the propriety of
                        admitting negroes to the ballot-box if the questions could be separated, the
                        fact that they cannot be separated, makes it our duty to oppose the whole
                        thing. </p>
                    <p> What ground it may be proper to take on this subject five or ten years hence
                        is quite another matter. When all the States are restored to their federal
                        relations, so that the action of some cannot be used as an engine of
                        coercion against others, each State may adopt, on this subject any policy
                        which it deems wise or expedient. It is notorious that it is not now to be
                        brought up as a domestic question, but as a mere preliminary to federal
                        coercion. Why is it, all of a sudden, to be put in the foreground now as the main issue in the politics of New York?
                        What is there in the domestic condition of the State that renders the
                        question more important, or more urgent, that it was four or five years ago,
                        when negro suffrage was rejected by an almost unanimous vote of the people?
                        Nothing. It is to be thrust into State politics this fall for no other
                        reason in the world than because the Republican party is resolved in force
                        negro suffrage upon the South, and feel how exposed they are to the charge
                        of brazen hypocrisy in making this attempt while black suffrage is not
                        tolerated in the States which re-elected Mr. Lincoln. </p>
                    <p>Federal coercion of the States on this subject being wrong, it is the duty of
                        the Democratic party to oppose all the means and agencies by which such
                        coercion is attempted. The issue is one on which the Republican party can be
                        routed and disorganized. Besides the great advantage we have over them on
                        the merits of the question a powerful cross-wind of particular circumstances
                        blows across their course. --First and chief of these is the position of
                        President Johnson. We can fight the battle under his banner, and put the
                        Republicans in the position of acting in hostility to a chief magistrate
                        elected by their own votes. Nothing could so surely divide and disintegrate
                        the party as the attitude toward the President, which it will be compelled
                        to assume in making the negro-suffrage issue. --Another disintegrating fact
                        is the bold position taken by the Republican candidate for Governor of Ohio.
                        The vituperation which the Republicans were preparing against the Democratic
                        party becomes a two-edged sword, which they cannot handle without wounding
                        persons whom policy requires them to spare. They must either fire blank
                        cartridges, or begin the canvass by conceding to us the President and the
                        great State of Ohio, as belonging to our party. --Another obstacle to the
                        success of the negro-suffrage party will be found in the sentiments of the
                        returned soldiers, whose opportunities of observing the negro character in
                        the South, have led them to regard negro equality as a great absurdity.
                        Moreover, the Republicans will have to encounter a feeling which goes far
                        deeper than any conviction on the constitutional question, and is broader in
                        its scope than the accidental circumstances of the canvas; --the feeling of
                        repugnance to the negro founded on pride of race; a feeling which is
                        constantly breaking out in acts of outrage in various parts of the country,
                        and will gather depth and intensity in proportion as the idea is brought
                        home to the white masses that are regarded by the Republicans as being no
                        better than so many niggers. --This is a social and political rank which the
                        white masses will never voluntarily accept; and the attempt to force them
                        into it will rouse their disgust and resentment against the Republican
                        party.</p>

                    <p>For thirty years the radicals have been practising their spells and
                        incantations to raise the demon of negro equality in this country. All this
                        time the good people of the land, the pure patriots, the true Christians,
                        the real philanthropists, the well wishers of the human race without regard
                        to color, have prayed, and expostulated, and entreated that this "cup might
                        pass from us." They have pointed to the doings of this demon in other lands,
                        where, his footsteps have been marked with blood, his course lighted by the
                        flames of burning homes, his path bordered by the remains of butchered women
                        and children. But all this was of no avail. Like the German student the
                        radicals were deaf to all facts, all prayers, all entreaties. They raised
                        the demon from amidst the smoke, fury, bloodshed, carnage and butchery of
                        the battlefields, where brother shed the life-blood of brother in unnatural
                        strife, and we now behold his machinations in the assassination plots of
                        which that at Aquia Creek is an instance.</p>
                    <p>The facts in this case seem to be, that in order to put that portion of the
                        railroad from Aquia Creek to Richmond lying between the Potomac river and
                        Fredericksburg in order, a number of workmen, whites and colored, have been
                        collected in that vicinity. The negroes had exhibited bitter and vindictive
                        feelings toward the whites, and dropped expressions which caused the whites
                        to be on their guard; but nothing occurring they were led to suppose that
                        their fears of an attack were unfounded. But on the evening of the 1st of
                        this month one of the black men confessed that they had formed a compact to
                        murder all the whites at the place, and had collected arms and made all
                        preparations for consummating their bloody and devilish purpose. The attack
                        was to be made in the night, and all were to be butchered. Upon the receipt
                        of this intelligence, military force was used, and after a desperate fight,
                        in which one negro was killed and several wounded, the ringleaders were
                        secured and the assassination plot broken up.</p>
                    <p>This is the demon conjured up by the teachings of the radicals turning upon
                        the race of the magician who invoked it. This is a realization of the truths
                        which have been spread before the country by those who have steadily and
                        honestly opposed the doctrine of negro equality. The radicals were pointed
                        to St. Domingo as an example; but they heeded not the warning. They were
                        told that the sudden elevation of millions of rude, uneducated and
                        undisciplined negroes to a full equality with white men, would lead to plots
                        and compacts for revenge, murder and destruction among the mass of the
                        negroes. But this was denied in some cases; in others we were coldly told
                        that it must be expected. It was a consequence of the system just broken up
                        by the throes through which the nation had passed. The radicals were
                        determined to put their plan of raising the negro to an equality with the
                        white man into practical operation. To do this they were willing to trample
                        upon the Constitution, to imperil if not destroy our form of government, to
                        load the nation with debt, to wreck its business, prostrate its commerce and
                        impoverish its people. They succeeded in their designs; behold the first
                        fruit of their success.</p>
                    <p>In the face of these facts, so startling and fearful at present, so full of
                        dark and gloomy forebodings for the future, will the people of this State
                        aid in perpetuating the power of the Republican party? To be sure all the
                        members of that organization do not wish or mean to go to the extent the
                        radicals desire; but this wing has so far dominated the party, and in the
                        end has succeeded in dictating its policy, and forcing it opinions and
                        doctrines upon the entire body. This fact was apparent throughout the whole
                        of Mr. Lincoln's administration. The radicals dictated. The mass of the
                        so-called conservatives, while they dissented and objected and hung back for
                        a time, in the end surrendered and helped the radicals to carry out their
                        plans. While they remain in the organization of the Republican party, this
                        must and will continue to be. The radicals are bold, reckless, presuming and
                        aggressive. They are so deep in the conspiracy against the liberties of the
                        white people of the nation, that they dare not look back. --They have raised
                        the demon, and he, not they, now rides the storm. The negro plot discovered
                        at Aquia Creek is the first startling exhibition of the bad effects of the
                        doctrine of negro equality that has been developed in an associated form.
                        What will the Republican State Convention, which meets at Harrisburg on the
                        17th, say about this phase of their doctrine? Will they cry long live the
                        demon of radicalism, and thus sanction and endorse the negro assassination
                        plot against the whites at Aquia Creek? If they honestly believe in the
                        doctrines which they have preached in all parts of the country, they must do
                        so; for negro equality has been made the foundation stone of the Republican
                        party, and its policy has all tended to favor that radical idea. It has come
                        heralded and accompanied by negro plots to butcher white men; and we ask the
                        people of the old Keystone State how they like the demon born of radical
                        action upon the question of negro equality.</p>

                    <p>The Colored Population in the Central Three States</p>
                    <p>The issue of forcing negro suffrage upon the South at the point of Federal
                        bayonets has been made by the Republicans of Massachusetts, Connecticut,
                        Vermont, Iowa, and other States, and Chief Justice Chase is perambulating
                        the country in advocacy of the new doctrine. In imitation of the minor
                        apostles of this new faith, he intrudes this question upon assemblages at
                        college commencements, and in dinner table speeches. In view of the issue
                        that has been made by the agitators, let us look at the effect negro
                        suffrage at the South will have upon the character of the represntation in
                        Congress and the United States Senate.</p>
                    <p>Taking the census of 1860 as a basis, it will be found that in twelve of the
                        slave States, embracing eight hundred and eighty six counties there is in
                        two hundred and forty-four of them an excess of negro population!</p>
                    <p>Alabama contains fifty-two counties, in twenty of which there is an excess of
                        negro population.</p>
                    <p>Arkansas has fifty-five counties, with an excess of negro population in six.</p>
                    <p>Florida has twenty-one counties, with an excess of negro population in six.</p>
                    <p>Georgia has one hundred and thirty-two counties, with an excess of negro
                        population in forty-three.</p>
                    <p>Louisiana has forty-eight counties, with an excess of negro population in
                        thiyty-three.</p>
                    <p>Maryland has twenty-two counties, with an excess of negro population in five.</p>
                    <p>Mississippi has sixty counties, with an excess of negro population in
                        thrity-one.</p>
                    <p>North Carolina has eighty-seven counties, with an excess of negro population
                        in twenty.</p>
                    <p>Tennessee has seventy-five counties, with an an excess of negro population in
                        three.</p>
                    <p>Texas has one hundred and fifty-one counties, with an excess of negro
                        population in thirteen.</p>
                    <p>Virginia has one hundred and forty-eight counties, with an excess of negro
                        population in forty-four.</p>
                    <p>This would give the negroes a majority in the States of Louisiana.
                        Mississippi and South Carolina. In these three States they could elect
                        negroes enough to control the legislatures and elect six negroes to the
                        United States Senate, and three or four times that number of Representatives
                        to Congress. In all the Southern States they could sent negroes to the State
                        Legislatures and in two hundred and forty-four counties control the local
                        offices. These figures present the universal negro suffrage question in a
                        social aspect. Carry out the scheme of the agitators, and what can preevent
                        the sending of colored representatives to the halls of Congress? These are
                        deductions from the figures of the census of 1860, and the probability is
                        that excess of black population is greater at the present time than it was
                        five years ago. The war has doubtless swept off a larger number of whites
                        than blacks. Besides, it must be remebered that, to start with, the negroes
                        will have decided advantage, from the fact that a large class of whites are
                        excluded from the right of suffrage by the exceptions in President Johnson's
                        amnesty proclamation, while the negroes there are no exceptions whatever.</p>
                    <p>New England has led off in favor of universal negro suffrage, and Chief
                        Justice Chase is stumping the country in its advocacy. It has now become one
                        of the cardinal doctrines of the party and we expect to see the Republican
                        State convention of New York toe the mark, and give it an unqualified
                        indorsement.</p>

                        securities says the Lancaster Intelligencer, is
                        becoming a question of great importance to the masses upon whom the burthens
                        of the Government are beginning to fall with crushing effect. The State of
                        New Hampshire has already led the way by placing a tax of twenty-five per
                        cent upon the income drived from Federal bonds, and it will not be long
                        until the necessities of the people will force the Legislature of every
                        other State in the Union to adopt a similar policy. Unless this is done, it
                        will not be many months or years, if the present state of things continue,
                        until it will be next to impossible for either corporations or individuals
                        to borrow a dollar, except at ruinous rates of interest; and in addition,
                        the whole burthen of the local governments will devolve upon the middling
                        and working classes who are least able to pay, while the wealthy and
                        aristocratic bond-holders of the General Government, who are reveling in all
                        the comforts and luxuries of life at the expense of their industrious
                        neighbors, go scot free. There is gross and flagrant injustice in all this.
                        A hard-working mechanic may own a homestead valued at one thousand dollars,
                        for which he has to pay State, County, City, Borough and School taxes,
                        amounting in the aggregate to a considerable rent, whilst his rich neighbor,
                        with one hundred thousand dollars of Uncle Sam's bonds and no real estate,
                        is not required to pay a solitary cent! Such inequality and unfair
                        discrimination in favor of the rich and at the expense of the poor man, is
                        monstrous in a Republican government, and was never contemplated by the
                        framers of our Constitution. It should open the eyes of the masses to the
                        forlorn and helpless condition in which they will very soon be placed, if
                        they are not already bound hand and foot to this new and dangerous
                        despotism, unless they remedy the evil at the ballot-boxes. </p>
                    <p>Other reasons might be adduced in favor of taxing Government securities, but
                        the above will suffice for the present. We may recur to this all improtant
                        subject again; but in the meantime, we caution the taxpayers to consider
                        well whither they are drifting, and apply the proper remedy before it is too
                        late.</p>

                    <p>The butchery of friendly Indians by Col. Chivington, which was so atrocious
                        and heartless that the Committee on the conduct of the War, after
                        investigating the circumstances, concluded its report by calling upon
                        Congress to "punish as their crimes deserve those who have been guilty of
                        these brutal and cowardly acts." is defended by six Methodist clergymen of
                        Denver City, in a letter addressed to "ministers and members of the
                        Methodist Episcopal Church in the States." They commend Colonel Chivington
                        as "truly loyal to our Church, and unflagingly devoted to her interests. The
                        arduous duty of military life has not abated his seal. Always ready and able
                        to aid in council, and more willing to assist in action, it is to him more
                        than any other man that Methodism, under God, owes its present prosperous
                        establishment in the territory. His church and ministerial relations are
                        untarnished, and we regard him as a model for large-liberality and Christian
                        energy." Of the massacre itself, the address says:</p>
                    <p>"We believe our only hope for safety as a territory lies in the repetition of
                        like battles with the same results. In the destruction of these Indians, the
                        murdering and scalping of white men, women and children, was by such
                        avenged. We are fully persuaded that the laws of war in this action were
                        fully respected, and only fear that similar occurrences are likely to be too
                        unfrequent for an immediate and complete subjugation of the treacherous,
                        blood-thirsty red men."</p>
                    <p> The Chicago Tribune, (Republican,) which is noted
                        for its fine sensibilities in cases where "loyalty" is offered as a defence
                        to charges of brutality, remarks as follows upon Chivington and his acts: </p>
                    <p>"The 'Sand Creek Affair' was simply an act of hidious cruelty, garnished with
                        all the accessories of fraud, lying, treachery, bestiality. These Indians
                        had signalized their friendship to us by purchasing a number of white
                        captives from hostile bands, and delivering them up without ransom to the
                        military authorities. The most searching investigation failed to show that
                        they had committed, or proposed to commit, any act of hostility to the
                        whites. All the evidence went to show that they were sincerely and honorably
                        peaceful and friendly. --They were our allies. They had rendered us
                        important service. They were quietly and in good faith obeying our orders.
                        With touching confidence in the faith of our government they raised an
                        American flag over their lodges when they saw their murderers approaching.</p>
                    <p>"They were butchered in cold blood, without provocation, and in spite of
                        everything that should have made their persons sacred in our eyes. So
                        monstrous a crime should not go unpunished. Col. Chivington ought to be
                        tried by court-martial and shot shot like a wolf. He has shown himself to be
                        the common enemy of mankind, and he should be dealt with accordingly. If
                        there is a public sentiment in Colorado Territory which justifies such a
                        transaction (we cannot believe there is) it is time for the people of the
                        United States to teach such persons a lesson in the rudiments of
                        christianity and public law, by making an example of such an unparalleled
                        ruffian as this Chivington."</p>
