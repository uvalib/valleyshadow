<b>The State Election</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With the results of the election now in, the Spirit acknowledges that the
                    Democrats were soundly defeated. The Spirit explains that the Democrats'
                    expectations of success were overblown because the conflict between the
                    Republicans and the President was inaccurately believed to be "sufficiently
                    developed to affect this election." Additionally, it reports, the Republican
                    victory was fueled by the pervasive "apathy and indifference" among the
                    residents of heavily Democratic counties.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The result of the late election in this State was a surprise to both parties,
                        the disappointment of the Republicans being fully as great as that of the
                        Democrats. The Democrats were confident of success from the fact that the
                        Republican leaders were divided in sentiment on the question of
                        reconstruction, and the Republicans were despondent for the same reason.
                        What then could have been the cause of a result differing so widely from
                        general expectation?</p>
                    <p>We confess this question is more easily asked than answered, but still, by a
                        little careful thought bestowed upon the political situation previous to the
                        election, we think the philosophy of the result will appear obvious. The
                        division of sentiment among the leaders of the Republican party and their
                        hostility to the reconstruction policy of the President from which so much
                        was expected, was a false foundation upon which to build hopes of success
                        for the reason that the issue between them and the President was not
                        sufficiently developed to affect this election. Instead of meeting the issue
                        boldly and manfully like honest men they shirked it like cowards, and
                        carefully concealed it from the masses by feigning a support of the
                        President which they did not feel. The consequence was they preserved the
                        unity of their party which marched to the polls on Tuesday a week and voted
                        as solidly as it did a year ago. This was precisely the result the leaders
                        intended to produce by their feigned endorsement of Johnson, and was the
                        principal cause of the want of success on the party of the Democracy.</p>
                    <p>Another reason for the defeat of the Democracy is to be found in the apathy
                        and indifference which seemed to exist in the heavy Democratic counties. In
                        these counties there was nothing in the local contests to bring the voters
                        to the polls, the majorities being so large as to insure the success of the
                        Democratic local tickets without an effort, and the election of two
                        unimportant State officers was not considered of sufficient importance to
                        justify the masses of laboring men, of whom the Democratic party is mainly
                        composed, to leave their work to attend the election. Whilst the Democracy
                        was careless and inactive, making no special effort to get out the vote of
                        the party, our enemies as usual were indefatigable in their efforts, by
                        means of their secret leagues and the corrupting influences of money, to
                        pull their full vote.</p>
                    <p>But, notwithstanding we are defeated, there is no cause for despondency. The
                        noble old Democratic party still lives and is destined, eventually, to
                        triumph over all its enemies, and to deliver the country from the perils
                        into which it has been plunged by the misrule and corruption of the
                        fanatical leaders who control the Republican party. They have simply
                        postponed the day of their utter defeat and discomfiture by artfully dodging
                        an issue with the President and the Democratic party which they must meet during the next session of Congress.
                        Had Congress met three months ago so that the impending issue between the
                        radicals and the President could have been fully developed and intelligibly
                        understood by the masses previous to the election, the result undoubtedly
                        would have been quite different. </p>
                    <p>The election itself was of no political importance apart from the influence
                        which some supposed it might have on President Johnson adverse to the
                        working out of his wise and statesman like policy for the speedy restoration
                        of the Southern States to their Constitutional relations to the Government.
                        But as he has had the firmness and patriotism to inaugurate the policy in
                        spite of the clamors of the radical crew led by Sumner, Stevens &amp;
                        Co., and in the very teeth of their declarations of war against his
                        administration, we may confidently hope that he will have decision enough,
                        in the consciousness of the right, to adhere to it.</p>
                    <p>The radical leaders imagine that they have gained a point on the President
                        and can now compel him to recede from the high and noble ground he has
                        assumed towards the southern people, but we opine the sequel will show that
                        they have mistaken their man. If we have read the character of President
                        Johnson aright, he is not the man to be coerced or intimidated from a wise
                        and patriotic purpose by a set of mad zealots and fanatical revolutionists.
                        He can retort upon them by saying: "My policy of restoration was not on
                        trial in your late elections, or if it was, it was unanimously endorsed by
                        the people. Your party endorsed it in your State Conventions, the Democratic
                        party endorsed it in theirs, and why should I now recede from a policy which
                        has thus been unanimously endorsed by the representatives of the people of
                        all parties?" Thus it will be seen that the radicals will at once be estopped in their efforts to influence the
                        President on this score by their own dishonesty and duplicity during the
                        late canvass. </p>
                    <p>To the Democrats of Franklin county we would say, buckle on your armor to
                        renew the contest. Never tire in well doing.-Though you have again been
                        defeated, there is no cause for discouragement. Preserve your organizasation intact. Labor in season and out of
                        season for the dissemination, among your neighbors of the sound
                        constitutional principles of the noble, tried and time-honored old party to
                        which you belong. The Democracy has survived many disasters and it will
                        survive this one. It is founded on the immutable principles of truth, and </p>
                    <p>"Truth crushed to earth will rise again."</p>
                    <p>Those who imagine that the Democratic party is dead are hugging a delusive
                        phantom to their bosoms. It is as imperishable as the everlasting hills. Its
                        principles are the principles of the Constitution, and it can never die
                        while there is a free government to save. Already the seeds of dissolution
                        in the Republican ranks are plainly visible. All the Democracy have to do is
                        to stand firm and the hour of our triumph will surely come. Let the
                        sentiment of the party everywhere be: "Defeated but not dismayed."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Under instructions from President Johnson, General Grant yesterday issued
                        orders to muster out of the federal service all that remain of the colored
                        troops. By the time Congress meets there will be a solitary negro under arms
                        in the country.</p>
                    <p>This should be considered good news, North and South, as it marks an
                        important epoch in the history of the pacification of the country. Apart
                        from the unnecessary drain upon the Federal treasury for their maintenance,
                        these negro troops were a source of special social disturbance at the South.
                        Their presence galled and irritated the whites, while they fostered
                        insolence and idleness among the freed negroes. The disbandment of these
                        troops will do more to pacify the South than any other single act of
                        President Johnson.</p>
                    <p>After the negroes are got rid of there will yet remain seventy-five thousand
                        white troops in service. It is the intention of the President to reduce this
                        number to fifty thousand as soon as it is practicable.</p>
                    <p>The disbanding of the immense armies of the North and South within the space
                        of five months will be justly regarded hereafter as one of the marvels of
                        history. In no other country than the United States would it have been
                        possible. Not a little of the credit for this miracle justly attaches to the
                        wise and conciliatory policy of President Johnson.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> The numerous statements which purport to prove the moral and intellectual
                        aptitude of the emancipated slaves may be dismissed as simply incredible.
                        Philanthropists ought to understand that, if a liberated southern slave were
                        readily to share in the government of the republic, he would furnish an
                        unanswerable apology not only for the system in which he was trained, but
                        for the slave trade on which the institution was originally founded.-Mr.
                        Wendell Phillips himself would scarcely propose to admit a heathen African
                        savage to the electoral booth; and experience has shown that neither
                        missionaries nor traders can make a perceptible impression on indigenous
                        barbarism. The distance by which the freedmen is separated from the Ashantes
                        measures the benefits of American slavery; and if the colored population is
                        now worthy of sovereignty, the cotton plantations must
                            have been the most efficient schools of religion and morality which have
                            hitherto been established on earth. A scrupulous conscience would feel
                            the urgent duty of kidnapping the remaining population from Central
                            Africa, to pass them through the process which has refined and
                            sublimated their happier kinsmen beyond the Atlantic. It is not
                        necessary to answer more seriously foolish women and effeminate rhetoricians
                        who affect to vindicate the equality or superiority of a disgraced race.
                        There may become anomalies in a republican system which exclude from all
                        share of power a third of the southern population; but wise statesmen are
                        rather anxious for results than studious of theoretical symmetry, and it is
                        always easy to furnish sound reasons for measures which are found to be
                        practically expedient. </p>
                    <p>Governor Morton, or Indiana, expressed very much the same idea in his recent
                        speech, with the additional point added that if Republicans believed
                        freedmen fit for political power without preparatory education, then were
                        all their former arguments against slavery false, and they were moreover
                        guilty of gaining political power by the most outrageous misrepresentations
                        of what must have been a civilizing institution.</p>
                    <p>In truth, the advocates of universal negro suffrage at the South have no
                        argument at all. Constitutionally they have no right to insist upon it, and
                        practically it would be the extreme of folly. At the New York election the
                        people will pass upon this question. We have no fear of the result.</p>

                        Raymond can utter between now and election. We quoted largely, a day or two
                        since, from a speech of General Banks taking the boldest possible ground
                        against Mr. Johnson's policy of restoration. We also printed a report of his
                        recent radical remarks at Lawrence. It is well known that at a dinner given
                        General Banks in Boston, a week since, he proclaimed in substance that the
                        President must take the back track. And this
                        opponent of the executive policy of restoration is promoted to be Republican
                        candidate for Congress under circumstances which give significance to the
                        rebuke intended to be admistered to Mr. Johnson! </p>
                    <p>This nomination of General Banks was made under the nose of Senator Wilson,
                        who has been imported here from Massachusetts to tell the people of New York

                        had he desired, but he did not. Everybody knows how extreme is the
                        radicalism of Wilson on he negro question; and his object is to carry the
                        Empire State for the Republicans and so weaken the President next winter in
                        Congress. The nomination of Banks has developed the cat under the Wilson
                        meal.</p>

                    <p>Speech by Secretary McCullough</p>
                    <p>CINCINNATI, Oct. 13</p>
                    <p>The publishes a speech made by Secretary McCullough at Fort Wayne, Indiana,
                        on Wednesday night, in which he gives his views on the national finances. He
                        said he was not one of those who seemed to repudiate coin as a measure of
                        value, and to make a sound paper currency the standard. On the contrary as
                        belonged to that class of persons who, regarding an exclusive metalic
                        currency as an impracticable thing among enterprising and commercial people,
                        nevertheless look upon an irredeemable currency as an evil which
                        circumstances may for a time render a necessity, but which is never to be
                        sustained as a policy. By the common consent of nations gold and silver are
                        the only true measures of value. They are the necessary regulatiors of
                        trade. He favored a well secured paper currency. No other can to any extent
                        be a proper substitute for coin. It is not expected that there shall be a
                        dollar in coin in reserve for every dollar of paper in circulation this is
                        not necessary. For all ordinary home transactions, paper currency is
                        sufficient; but there are constantly occurring periods when the balance
                        between countries, and in the United States, between the different sections,
                        must be settled in coin. These balances are insignificant and would in
                        comparison with the transactions out of which they arise, and when a vicious
                        system of credit does not too long postpone settlements, they are arranged
                        without disturbing the movement of coin whenever specie is needed for this
                        purpose or for any other purpose, the paper currency of the country should
                        be convertible into it, and a circulation not so convertible will not be,
                        and ought not to be, tolerated by the people. The present inconvertible
                        currency of the United States was a necessity of war, but now that the war
                        has closed, the government should not be a borrower; the currency should be
                        brought up to a specie standard, and he saw no way of doing it but by
                        withdrawing a portion of it from circulation. He had no faith in a
                        prospertiy which was the effect of a depreciated currency, nor could he see
                        any safe path to tread but that which leads to specie payments. The extreme
                        high prices now prevailing indicates that the business of the country is in
                        an unhealthy condition. We are measuring values by a false standard. We have
                        a circulating medium altogether larger than is needed for legitimate
                        business, and the excess is used in speculations. The United States is
                        to-day the best market in the world for foreigners to sell in. The
                        consequence is that Europe is selling us more than she buys of us, including
                        our securities, which ought not to go abroad, and there is a debt rolling up
                        against us that must be settled, in part at least, in coin. The longer the
                        inflation continues the more difficult it will be for us to get back to
                        specie payments, to which we must return sooner or later. If Congress shall,
                        early to the adproaching session, authorize the finding of the legal
                        tenders, and the work of reduction is commenced and carefully and prudently
                        carried on, we shall reach it probably without injury and embarrassment to
                        legal business. If not, we shall have a brief period of seductive
                        prosperity, resulting in widespread bankruptcy and disaster. He spoke of the
                        evil tendency of the present inflation on the public morals, converting the
                        business of the country into gambling, and seriously diminishing the labor
                        of the country. We are apparently getting richer, when morality languishes,
                        and the productive industry of the country is being diminished. He was
                        hopeful that by wise legislation, we will escape a financial collapse, and
                        that the currency may be brought to the specie standard without these
                        financial troubles which have in all countries, followed protracted and
                        extensive wars.</p>

                    <p>EXECUTIVE OFFICE, Jackson, Miss., Sept. 25, 1865</p>
                    <p>By an order, bearing date the 20th instant, Col. Samuel Thomas, Assistant
                        Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau in this State, proposes to transfer to
                        the civil authorities of the State the right to try all cases in which the
                        right of freemen are involved, either for injuries done to their persons or
                        property. This proposition is made, however, on condition that "the judicial
                        officers and magistrates of the provisional government of the State will
                        take for their mode of procedure the laws now in force in this States,
                        except so far as those laws make a distinction on account of color, and
                        allow negroes the same rights and privileges as are accorded to white men
                        before their courts," by which I understand that negroes shall be allowed to
                        testify in cases where their interest is involved. And believing that the
                        late constitutional amendment which abolished slavery abolishes all laws
                        which constituted a part of the policy of slvavery, and in declaring that
                        the negro shall be protected in his person and property establishes
                        principles which of themselves entitle the negro to sue and be sued, and, as
                        a necessary incident of such right, that he is made competent as a witness,
                        according to the laws of evidence of the state.</p>
                    <p>Now, therefore, I, William L. Sharkey, Provisional Governor of Mississippi,
                        with a view of securing our citizens the rights of trial before their own
                        officers and under their own laws, rather than by a military tribunal and by
                        military law, do hereby proclaim and make known that in all cases civil or
                        criminal, in which the rights of negroes are involved, either for injuries
                        done to their persons or property or in matters of contract, the testimony
                        of negroes may be received, subject to the common law rules of evidence as
                        regards competency and credibility which prevail in regard to white persons.
                        And I do, therefore, accept the proposition of Colonel Samuel Thomas,
                        Assistant Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau of this State, and request
                        that no freedmen's Court shall hereafter be organized, and that those
                        already in existence be closed and instructed to transfer the cases before
                        them to the civil authorities; and I hereby instruct all judicial officers
                        and magistrates to act upon this subject.</p>
                    <p>Given under my hand, and the great seal of the State affixed, this day and
                        date above written.</p>
                    <p>W.L. Sharkey.</p>
