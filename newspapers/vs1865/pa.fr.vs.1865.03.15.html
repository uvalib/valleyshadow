<b>Effects of Emancipation by War</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that emancipation could have occurred without the enormous human and
                    material costs of war.<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Albany Argus</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Albany Argus, in discussing this question,
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"We shall have sunk more treasure than would have purchased the freedom of
                        every black! We shall have wasted more lives than all those we have
                        emancipated! We shall have exchanged our real liberties, for the mockery of
                        freedom we give blacks! That race, loosened from its dependency, will be
                        lost; and in the contest with the white, will dwindle and perish, as the Red
                        man has done.</p>
                    <p>We had 400,000 slaves when the Union was formed, and we had nearly that
                        number of freedmen when the war broke out. Left to State action, to the
                        action of individual benevolence, to the operation of agricultural
                        machinery, to the influence of developed wealth and civilization, the
                        emancipation of the negro would have been a reality. The man would have
                        become free, and the race would have been saved.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy believed in these modes of human progress. They rejected the
                        theory of absolutism of the State--that creed which has risen into such
                        frightful proportions, which is destroying all individualism or character,
                        and turning freedmen into the abject subjects of a despotism. If all was
                        gained to freedom that visionaries dream of, in the emancipation of the
                        blacks, it would be more than lost again, in their creation of an absolute
                        State, asserting all the prerogatives of an infallible church, and wielding
                        despotic power, to extend, in the name of God, its bigoted creed.</p>
                    <p>If this war had been arrested, we should have had, not merely emancipation,
                        but the elevation and preservation of the black. We should have given the
                        freedom he needs to the white also. We should have extended the liberties of
                        trades, extinguished monopoly and privilege, reduced the power of the State,
                        and of all political bodies, to their minimum, so as to leave the individual
                        free. This is Democracy, and that is progress.</p>
                    <p>War has reversed all this. It has sent the world back on its track. It has
                        substituted force for reason, passion for intellect. It has turned the
                        genius of men from inventions for production, to contrivances to mutilate
                        and kill. It has wasted wealth and piled up debt. It has exaggerated the
                        power of States, and corrupted the governing class and debased the governed.</p>
                    <p>It has lowered the prospects of all. It has loaded the poor so they cannot
                        rise. It has swollen the coffers of the rich. It has made a mockery of the
                        Constitution whose sacredness was the political religion of our people.
                        Instead of allowing the negro to be developed into freedom, it has wrested
                        him by force from his place, and must leave him to perish--planting the
                        black man's grave by the side of the red man's on the outer border of white
                        civilization."</p>

<b>The Draft</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Suggests that the people of Franklin county are not rushing to the draft in
                    order to beat back the South, but instead are advocates of peace and no longer
                    maintain hope in the Lincoln administration.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The excitement attendant upon the draft has been kept up to fever-heat in
                        this district for several weeks past. It has brought to town daily large and
                        anxious crowds of people. We presume this is about the state of affairs in
                        all other places where the draft is being enforced. We cannot say that the
                        people come here to rush to arms to give the "back bone of the rebellion"
                        its last fracture, or to "rally once again" around the old flag. The "back
                        bone" and the "old flag" seems to give them little concern for just now.
                        They have more important business on hand and cannot afford to waste time
                        with such obselete [sic] matters. They are here as "Peace Commissioners,"
                        ready to make peace with Jeff Davis, or "any other man," on any terms that
                        will let them out of the draft! They would'nt
                        [sic] mind patching up a peace and giving a liberal supply of "greenbacks"
                        to boot if they could be saved from the draft. They are willing to sacrifice
                        everything on earth, save themselves, to escape the draft. They have no hope
                        from Old Abe any longer. They voted for him with the
                            understanding that there were to be no more drafts and have been
                        "slightly sold." It was, indeed, a melancholy spectacle to behold our
                        long-faced Republican friends from the country wandering about our streets
                        from day to day, for several weeks past, in search of some avenue through
                        which to escape from the horrible draft! They had come to town to get out of
                        the draft--to coax out, beg out, buy out or back out, anything so that they
                        could get out, rather than risk their precious lives fighting for
                        Abolitionism. Oh! no, that was carrying the joke a little too far. They were
                        willing to do the voting for that abomination, but not quite ready to do the
                        fighting. Sensible fellows to be sure, but rather to be pitied that they cut
                        their wisdom teeth at so late a day. Every one of them had voted for Abe
                        Lincoln, "the smutty joker," and Andy Johnson, "the inebriate," under the
                        most positive assurance from their party leaders and their party papers,
                        that the elevation to office of these two dignified individuals would be
                        sufficient in itself to give the rebellion its death-blow. They had been
                        assured and re-assured that no more drafts would be required if they voted
                        for Lincoln and Johnson--they voted accordingly and were beautifully duped.
                        Just before the election the Republican papers, all over the country, were
                        filled with such stuff as this: "The re-election of Lincoln will be a
                        dreadful blow to the rebels." "If Lincoln is re-elected the South will give
                        up and the Union will be re-established in thirty days." "The re-election of
                        Lincoln will end the war and no more drafts will be required." This is an
                        honest sample of the sort of stuff so plentifully supplied confiding voters
                        about election times.</p>
                    <p>The amount of gullibility to be found in the Republican party is truly
                        astonishing. The leaders of the party seem to understand this well and shape
                        their course accordingly. No matter how monstrous the falsehood, they are
                        ready to put it forth knowing that their blind and bigoted followers will
                        gulph it down with greediness, and when the deception is discovered they are
                        just as willing to undergo the operation a second time, as if they really
                        found a pleasure in being deceived. There has not been a month since the war
                        commenced but it was to end in a blaze of glory, according to Republican
                        logic. This story has been told until it has become thread-bare, but is
                        repeated again to-day for the thousandth time and as readily believed. No
                        party has ever insulted the intelligence of the people, with falsehoods and
                        deceptions, as persistingly and as barefacedly as the Republican party. The
                        Draft officer and the Tax collector are, however, realities with which the
                        people are fast becoming acquainted and in whom they can believe. Their
                        visits are not "few and far between," and as they call around every few
                        weeks they can give precise information, to any doubting Republican, that
                        the war still goes bravely on at the cost of three thousand lives and three
                        millions of dollars a day! If this does not bring them to their senses they
                        can make a point by claiming exemption from the draft on the plea of
                        "Manifest mental imbecility."</p>

<b>The Damage Bill</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Prints extract from the House of Representatives' consideration of a bill
                    to appoint assessors to valuate the damage sustained by border counties such as
                    Franklin county. Suggests that no help from the legislature will be forthcoming.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The special order in the House of Representatives, of the evening session on
                        Thursday last, was the act appointing assessors to make a valuation of the
                        damage sustained by rebel raids in the border counties. We make the
                        following extract from the published proceedings:</p>
                    <p>The first section of the bill was defeated in committee of the whole, and
                        came before the House for discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sharpe spoke at length, stating that the object proposed was simply to
                        obtain and procure a record of the losses in such a form that it could be
                        furnished by the Governor to the national authorities. It was not designed
                        to take one cent from the State Treasury.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McClure referred to the sufferings of the border people, who from the
                        accident of locality, had alone felt the burden of war in this State. They
                        now ask no special privilege but only desired their losses recorded in an
                        official form. Future Legislatures would see that the treasury of the
                        Commonwealth was protected against any unjust claims. The time might come
                        when the nation would deal justly with those who had suffered unequally.
                        Preceding Legislatures had set the example of appraising the damages, and it
                        would be but simple justice to accord to the people a history of their
                        sacrifices.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brown on behalf of the widow, the orphan and the broken households
                        throughout the State protested against their taxes being increased to pay the wealthy men who had suffered at
                        Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>From this, it will be perceived that the Legislature is not disposed to do
                        anything even looking to the relief of the
                        plundered people of the border.</p>

<b>Relief for the Border</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Condemns members of the Pennsylvania legislature for not supporting relief
                    measures for border counties.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We would direct special attention to the letter of our Harrisburg
                        correspondent published in the present issue of the Spirit. The letter gives a full account of the doings of the
                        Legislature concerning the bill to appoint Commissioners to make a valuation
                        of the damages sustained from rebel raids by the border counties. No one can
                        read these proceedings and not be amazed at the bitter and vindictive
                        character of the opposition manifested by the Republican members against
                        this righteous measure. We are well satisfied that the Republican party in
                        this State will one day regret their unfair and unmanly opposition to this
                        measure, and their making it a party question--for such clearly they have
                        made it. It will come home to them in some form of retaliation and that,
                        perhaps, sooner than they expect, for no people after calm reflection can
                        sustain a party displaying such heartless[ness] against a ruined and
                        suffering people. Humanity revolts at such gross inhumanity. Could we take
                        the men who have opposed this bill from family to family and let them
                        witness for themselves the destitution and misery they are suffering, we
                        feel convinced that, unless every spark of humane feeling is dead in them,
                        they would blush with shame for having defeated this measure of relief. We
                        wish to say nothing more on this subject, at this time, and what we have
                        said is more in sorrow than in anger. Our people must suffer on patiently
                        and expect no relief until we have a Democratic Legislature at Harrisburg.
                        At the hands of that party they can expect justice and mercy--that some wise
                        provision for their relief will be planned and carried out. The people must,
                        however, bear in mind that with the Republican party rests the
                        responsibility of having defeated this bill looking to an indemnity for the
                        losses they have sustained by a public enemy. Let them ask themselves of
                        their two enemies which is the worst--the one
                        that destroys or the one that withholds aid and sympathy in their
                        sufferings?</p>
                    <p>There is one point in connection with this matter upon which we have no
                        hesitation in expressing ourselves freely. The charge of disloyalty made
                        against the people of this section of the State we fling back with scorn
                        into the vile throats that uttered it. There never was a people more sorely
                        tried and who have stood more staunchly by the Government than the people of
                        the border counties. There is not a man to be found among us who would aid
                        the rebels in any way. When Lee's army passed through this section it could
                        not obtain a single recruit, a guide or a particle of information though
                        pressingly sought for. We know too that the Democrats of this place counted
                        their numbers, and noted their movements from day to day and at great risk
                        sent scouts on foot through their pickets to convey the information to the
                        military authorities at Harrisburg and elsewhere. There is one, to us
                        sorrowful, fact that should convince the most obdurate blockhead that we are
                        not friends to the rebels--had we been such our town would not have been
                        burnt.</p>
                    <p>As to the charge of treating soldiers badly, we have only to say that
                        whenever they can find a soldier who will say that our people have not

                        show how much we have done for the soldiers, but while the charge rests
                        solely on the unscrupulous assertion of a Republican member of the
                        Pennsylvania Legislature we deem it unworthy of notice.</p>

                    <p>To say nothing of the enormous prices of all the necessaries of life,
                        including clothing and provisions, by reason of the depreciation of the
                        currency and the inordinate cupidity of the speculators, the extravagant
                        increase in the rent of dwelling houses is beginning to be an onerous burden
                        on the poor and laboring classes. This increase is already twenty-five,
                        fifty, and, in some instances, as high as a hundred per cent, over former
                        rates, and if the present state of things continues a few years longer, it
                        will be next to impossible for any laboring man or mechanic in moderate
                        circumstances to get a house to shelter his family. This is no fancy
                        picture, says the Lancaster Intelligencer. The
                        fact must be as apparent as the light of the noonday sun to every man, woman
                        and child of common sense in the community. Hence it is evident that the
                        taxes which property holders complain of, growing out of the war, are levied
                        with compound interest on the renters, and they
                        (not the wealthy class) have to pay the piper. And yet, strange to say, not
                        a few of these same down-trodden working men are still found in the ranks of
                        Abolitionism, whenever election day comes round, kissing the hand that
                        smites them, and shouting lustily for Abraham Lincoln and the freedom of the
                        negro! Such conduct is unaccountable on the part of the laboring classes.
                        When, oh when, will the people get their eyes open, so as to see the
                        oppression under which they and their children after them will be made to
                        sweat and toil and suffer?</p>

                    <p>
                        Lieut. General Grant Commanding armies U.S.
                    </p>
                    <p>General, in my despatch dated Waynesboro', I gave a brief account of the
                        defeat of Gen. Early by Custer's Division. The same night this Division was
                        pushed across the Blue Ridge and entered Charlottesville at two P.M. The
                        next day the mayor of the city and the principal citizens came out and
                        delivered up the keys of the public buildings. I had to remain at
                        Charlottesville two days; this time was consumed in bringing over from
                        Waynesboro' our ammunition and pontoon trains, the weather was horrible
                        beyond description and the rain incessant. The two divisions were during
                        this time, occupied in destroying the two large iron bridges, one over the
                        Ravenna river and the other over Muses creek, near Charlottesville, and the
                        railroad for a distance of eight miles in the direction of Lynchburg. On the
                        6th of March I sent the first division, Gen. Devin commanding, to
                        Scottsville, on the James river, with directions to send out light parties
                        through the country and destroy all the merchandize, mills, factories,
                        bridges etc. on the Ravenna River, these parties to join the division at
                        Scottsville. The division then proceeded along the canal to Duggettsville 15
                        miles from Lynchburg, destroying every lock and in many places the bank of
                        the canal. At Duggesttsville we hoped to secure the bridge to let us cross
                        the river as our pontoons were useless on account of the high water. In
                        this, however, we were foiled, as both this bridge and the one at Hard
                        Rocksville were burned by the enemy upon our approach. Merrit accompanied
                        this division. The third division started at the same time from
                        Charlottesville and proceeded down the Lynchburg Railroad to Amherst Court
                        House, destroying every bridge on the road and in many places miles of the
                        track. The bridges on this road are numerous and some of them 500 feet in
                        length. We have found great abundance in this country for our men and
                        animals; in fact the canal had been the great feeder of Richmond. At the
                        Rockfish river the banks of the canal was cut, and at New Canton, where the
                        dam is across the James river; the guard lock was destroyed and the James
                        river let into the canal carrying away the banks and washing out the bottom
                        of the canal. The dam across the river at this point was also partially
                        destroyed. I have had no opposition, everybody is bewildered by our
                        movements. I have had no news of any kind since I left. The latest Richmond
                        papers was of the 4th, but contained nothing. I omitted to mention that the
                        bridges on the Railroad from Swoop's Depot on the other side of Stanton to
                        Charlottesville, were utterly destroyed, also the bridges for a distance of
                        ten miles on the Gordonsville Railroad. The weather has been very bad
                        indeed, raining hard every day, with the exception of four days, since we
                        left. My wagons have from the state of the roads, detained me up to the
                        present. We have captured 14 pieces of artillery, 11 at Waynesboro' and 3 at
                        Charlottesville. The party that I sent back from Waynesboro' started with 6
                        pieces but they were obliged to destroy 2 of the 6 for want of animals. The
                        remaining 8 pieces were thoroughly destroyed.</p>
                    <p>We have captured up to the present time 12 canal boats laden with supplies,
                        ammunition, rations, medical stores, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>I cannot speak in too high terms of Generals Merrit, Custer and Devin and the
                        officers and men of their commands. They have waded through mud and water
                        during this continuous rain and are all in fine spirits and health.</p>
                    <p>Commodore Hollins, of the rebel navy, was shot near Gordonsville, while
                        attempting to make his escape from our advance in that direction.</p>
                    <p>Very respectfully your ob'dt serv't,</p>
                    <p>P.H. Sheridan, <br>Major General Commanding.</p>

                    <p>The War. <br>[From the Age, of March 11.]</p>
                    <p>We have at length received accurate information of general Sheridan's cavalry
                        expedition, southwest along the Shenandoah valley. Sheridan's force
                        consisted of five brigades of cavalry, numbering about six thousand men. He
                        left his camp near Winchester early on the morning of February 27th. His
                        troops marched southwest along the turnpike that runs through the valley. On
                        the 27th Sheridan passed through Kernstown, Middletown and Strasburg,
                        crossed Cedar creek, and at nightfall reached Woodstock, thirty miles from
                        Winchester. Here the Federal troops bivouacked. On the 28th they resumed
                        their march, passing through Edenburg and crossing the north fork of
                        Shenandoah, near New Market. Nine Federal soldiers were drowned in crossing
                        the stream. At dusk the army encamped at a point just south of New Market
                        and twenty seven miles from Woodstock. On March 1 the Federal cavalry
                        marched through Harrisonburg, crossing Middle river, and encamping 4 miles
                        northeast of Staunton, having marched twenty six miles during the day. It
                        was here that the Confederate pickets were first discovered.</p>
                    <p>General Early had but a small force at Staunton, his main body being at
                        Charlottesville, forty miles east of Staunton. The Virginia Central Railroad
                        connects Charlottesville and Staunton. This is not the Richmond and
                        Lynchburg railroad. General Lee, upon hearing of Sheridan's advance along
                        the valley, reinforced both Lynchburg and Charlottesville, so as to meet the
                        Federal troops whichever way they should turn. Early, upon Sheridan's
                        approach, abandoned Staunton, having first removed all the public property.
                        He retreated east along the Central railroad towards Charlottesville. After
                        Sheridan's troops had been in camp four miles northeast of Staunton, for
                        three hours, he ordered his army under arms, and at midnight on March 1
                        attacked Staunton. The enemy were gone, however, and the few pickets that
                        had been left in Staunton were easily driven out. Without any delay, a
                        brigade of Federal cavalry turned east from Staunton and marched along the
                        railroad towards Charlottesville. They advanced seven miles; destroyed a
                        railroad bridge over Christian's creek, and then returned to Staunton, where
                        Sheridan's main army was bivouacked.</p>
                    <p>On March 2d Sheridan ordered Custer's two brigades of cavalry to march from
                        Staunton towards Charlottesville. They marched east along the railroad and a
                        common road, and at Fishersville, seven miles east of Staunton, met the
                        Confederate pickets. The pickets retreated six miles to Waynesboro', where
                        the main force of the enemy was posted. Early ordered a retreat from
                        Waynesboro' to Charlottesville. It was not made quickly enough, however. By
                        a skillful movement, Custer succeeded in cutting off a portion of the
                        Confederate troops and took them prisoners. The contest was short and
                        comparatively bloodless, the Federal loss being very slight. Twelve hundred
                        Confederate prisoners, seven cannon, and one hundred wagons, were captured.
                        General Early was not taken, but withdrew with the balance of his army in
                        good order towards Charlottesville. The roads being in a shocking condition,
                        the cannon and wagons were destroyed by their captors. On March 3d, General
                        Custer, with the main force of Sheridan's cavalry, advanced along the road
                        to Charlottesville as far as Greenwood, fifteen miles from Charlottesville.
                        A brigade of Sheridan's force brought the prisoners to Winchester, arriving
                        there on Tuesday last. We have no information of Sheridan's progress since
                        March 3d. The rumors, however are that he has withdrawn from Greenwood and
                        gone westward towards Lynchburg. Whilst the Federal guard with their
                        prisoners were returning to Winchester, they were attacked by the
                        Confederate cavalry. The Confederates were defeated, however, with a loss of
                        twenty-seven prisoners.</p>
                    <p>A Federal naval expedition consisting of thirteen vessels, on Monday last
                        sailed up the Rappahannock. Its object was to capture a large amount of
                        tobacco stored near Fredericksburg, which was to be smuggled into the
                        Federal lines. The expedition sailed up the river without accident, and
                        without opposition; the troops landed at Fredericksburg. The tobacco, said
                        to amount to about ninety-five tons, was found and captured. The railroad
                        bridge and buildings at Fredericksburg were destroyed. One hundred
                        Confederate prisoners are reported captured. The vessels sailed down the
                        Rappahannock with the tobacco on board.</p>
                    <p>Upon the evacuation of Charleston the Confederates abandoned all the towns
                        along the sea-coast. Georgetown had no garrison when Dahlgren's fleet
                        reached it. The capture was, therefore, bloodless. Everything of value had
                        been removed from the city. The Harvest Moon, Dahlgren's flagship that was
                        blown up by a torpedo, is a total loss. Everything on board went down with
                        her.</p>
                    <p>A brigade of three thousand negro troops has been recruited in Charleston.
                        There are ten thousand Federal troops in Charleston, that have lately
                        arrived. They are a reinforcement for Sherman.</p>
                    <p>The steamer Amazon, a Savannah river boat, recently run the guantlet [sic] of
                        the Confederate pickets on that river and came down to Savannah. Her captain
                        voluntarily gave himself and his boat to the Federal authorities.</p>
                    <p>Railroad communications is re-opened between Columbia and Charlotte.</p>
                    <p>[From the Age of March 13.]</p>
                    <p>For some time past a Federal expedition has been concentrating at Newbern,
                        North Carolina. It left there a few days since and advanced along the south
                        bank of the Neuse river towards Kinston. Kinston is thirty miles northwest
                        of Newbern, and twenty miles south of Goldsboro'. The expedition was led by
                        Generals Schofield and Terry, and its object was to get to Goldsboro', and
                        destroy the railroad which runs south from Weldon. The Confederates were at
                        Kinston, under Generals Bragg and Hoke, and had been reinforced by A.P. Hill
                        with troops from Richmond. On Wednesday last, the Federal advance was
                        intrenched within four miles of Kinston. The Confederates attacked the
                        intrenched camp, and after an obstinate contest drove the Federal troops
                        three miles towards Newbern. Fifteen hundred Federal prisoners and three
                        cannon were captured. On Thursday the two armies confronted each other
                        twenty three miles from Newbern. It was thought that the Federal troops
                        would retreat to Newbern. This contest proves conclusively that on Wednesday
                        last, Sherman was not at Goldsboro'; nor at Raleigh, norwest of Goldsboro';
                        nor at Fayetteville, west of Goldsboro'. He could not have been near any of
                        these places, without making the retreat of the Confederates from Kinston
                        imperative.</p>

                    <p>During the past week the Provost Marshal's office has been crowded by
                        conscripts, some of them putting in substitutes, others claiming exemption
                        for physical disability and other causes, and the larger number donning the
                        blues for service. A large number left daily for the rendezvous and, judging
                        from appearances, the present draft will put more men into the army than any
                        former one. We hope the necessity which requires these men to be taken from
                        their homes will soon have passed away, and that peace and union will soon
                        be restored to a bleeding and distracted land.</p>

                    <p>The oil fever is the most contageous [sic] and wide spread malady of the
                        time. It beats yellow Fever, measles and even negro on the brain. Some of
                        our older citizens will remember the merino sheep excitement, and the
                        prospective in growing silk, but silk and wool, California and cotton, all
                        fade away before the slippery greasy king whose throne was first built in
                        Venango county, but whose domain now extends throughout Western
                        Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. People are boring for "ile" even in
                        the eastern part of the State, expecting to strike either "ile," a molasses
                        quarry or castile soap. With the opening of spring, the excitement promises
                        to be unparalleled, and everybody will be boring holes in the ground.</p>
