<b>What Makes A Lady</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> When Beau Brummel was asked what makes the gentleman, his quick reply was,
                        "Starch, starch, my lord!" This may be true; but it takes a great deal more
                        to make a lady; and though it may to some seem singular, I am ready to
                        maintain that no conceivable quantity of mushn[unclear], silk, or satin,
                        edging, trilling, hooping, flouncing, or turbelowing can per se or per dressmaker, constitute a real lady. Was not Mrs.
                        Abbott Lawrence just as much a lady when attired in twelvecent calico, in
                        Boston, as when arrayed in full court dress at St. James, London? " As Mrs.
                        Washington was said to be so grand a lady," says a celebrated English
                        visitor (Mrs. Throllpe), "we thought we must put on our best bibs and bands;
                        so we dressed ourselves in our most elegant ruffles and silks, and were
                        introduced to her ladyship; and don't you think we found her knitting, and
                        with her check apron on! She received us very graciously and easily; but
                        after the compliments were over she resumed her knitting. There we were,
                        without a stitch of work, and sitting in state; but General Washington's
                        lady, with her own hands was knitting stockings for her husband!" Does not
                        that sweet republican simplicty command your admiration? </p>

                    <p> TRUTH is ever consistent with itself, and requires no special effort on the
                        part of those whose statements are based on it, to make such statements
                        harmonize at all times. It is different however with falsehood. A person
                        given to lying should above all things have a good memory, and in order to
                        give his lies any kind of currency, he must exercise considerable care to
                        have them agree. Our neighbor of the Repository
                        has become utterly reckless in this respect, and pays no more regard to
                        consistency than if such a thing were, as Mr. Toots would say, "of no
                        consequence whatever." As an evidence of this, hear what he says in his
                        issue of the 21st ultimo: </p>
                    <p> "The rebel sympathisers among us, who co-operated with the traitors during
                        the fierce struggle just ended, and controlled the opposition at the last
                        election, seem to feel that their party existence depends upon their making odious, and thwarting the administration, and are
                            busy in impeding and deranging the efforts of the government." </p>
                    <p> In the above extract the Repository plainly
                        charges "the rebel sympathizers" (meaning ourself and other Democrats) "with
                        making odious and thwarting the administration." </p>
                    <p>Now, we wish the public to read the above in connection with the following
                        taken from its last issue:</p>
                    <p> "The SPIRIT is attempting to capture President Johnson by gradual approaches
                        in imitation of its party. Each week it becomes a little stronger in its
                        commendation of some of his official acts. In last week's issue it says that
                        "the Democracy have seen in the course of the President much to approve, and
                        very little to condemn," and in a few weeks more it will probably declare
                        him a second Jackson. We congratulate the SPIRIT on its lucid intervals, and
                        bid it good speed in getting over in getting over in
                            support of a sound Union administration." </p>
                    <p> It certainly requires some ingenuity to reconcile these two extracts. In one
                        we are charged with "making odious and thwarting the administration." and
                        with being busy "in impeding and deranging the efforts of the government."
                        and in the other that we are "getting over in support of a sound Union
                        administration." We confess to having ever had a disposition to "support"
                        any that we considered "a sound Union administraton," and since the
                        accession of President Johnson, we have seen much in his course which we
                        could approve, and very cordially commend. The Repository, thus far, is right, in the last quoted extract. In
                        the future, as in the past, it may expect to find us approving all acts of
                        the administration which, in our opinion, deserve our approbation and
                        support; but at the same time we will as freely condemn what we can not
                        approve. </p>
                    <p> The only way by which we can account for the descrepancy in the two
                        extracts, is on the supposition that the Repository has two editors. We know that the "chief" was absent several weeks attending to the interests of
                        the "Imperial" and "Sterling"--or(?) his own, in the oil regions, and that
                        during such absence the heavy work was done by a fellow who generally gives
                        loose rein to his fancy, without regard to truth or anything else. </p>

                    to the demands of those who support black suffrage. In contrast, the Spirit
                    argues that Johnson will not back down from the Radicals' challenge because he

                    <p>This new system of banking, fastened upon the country in the hour of trial by
                        the old money hunks who fought Jackson in his day, promises as much now as
                        then, but are these promises based upon anything more secure and less
                        dangerous than the old U.S. bank system?--we think not.</p>
                    <p>The men who contend for a uniform paper currency for the whole country, are
                        men who have accumulated large estates and desire to perpetuate the same in
                        their families by putting the country under bonds in shape of a heavy
                        perpetual national debt, making it the basis of banking, and by that system
                        associate the wealth of the country, so organized as to overshadow every
                        other interest and control the government of the country.</p>
                    <p>That class cites England as a precedent, telling the people how large a debt
                        she owes, how stable and properous she is under this heavy debt, but fail to
                        tell the people England has by and through this system a pauper list of over
                        250,000 of grandees, gentle folk, besides her active and useful thousands
                        who also live upon the producing and laboring class, while the great mass of
                        her subjects through this money system have no more to say in the government
                        than the ox or horse upon the manor of the lord of the soil.</p>
                    <p>We don't desire now, to discuss the merits of this new banking system, but
                        only to throw out a thought for the consideration of those more competent
                        than ourself to handle this question, and elaborate an argument that will
                        expose the danger growing out of the system to republican institutions and
                        the interest of the whole people.</p>
                    <p>It is said Judge Chase, the author of this system of banking, is already
                        endeavoring to make advantage out of his own bantling, for the purpose of
                        reaching the Presidential chair in 1868, but he may possibly find long
                        before that day his system crumble to pieces, and himself an object of dire
                        hate and public scorn, even more intense and violent than that visited upon
                        a Law or a Biddle.</p>
                    <p> These national banks now number over one thousand and it is quite safe to
                        say will double within a year. Our State or local banks are all fast
                        becoming national banks, soon the people will have no other money. Men under
                        these specious promises will lose their accustomed caution, and as inflation
                        increases speculation will increase, men will sell and buy, money contracts
                        will become due. Mr. Jones will lift his deposits say ten, twenty, or
                        perhaps fifty thousand dollars at the First National Bank of Funkstown,
                        carry the same to Discountville to pay off his farm, bought from Mr. Hunks;
                        the vendor says to Mr. Jones, "I don't like this money, can't take it."
                        "But," says vendee. "Mr. Hunks, those are national bills, all genuine and receivable by the United States
                        Government in payment of debts and dues, except"--"No matter. Mr. Jones,
                        here is our contract, and I am judge of what money I will take, and as I am
                        not obliged to receive this sort of money, you had just return to the bank
                        and exchange these bills for gold or legal tender." </p>
                    <p>Mr. Jones returns to the First National Bank of Funkstown, after laying his
                        money package upon the counter, says he to the cashier, "Mr. Hunks won't
                        receive this money, but demands greenbacks or gold. Now, if you please, Mr.
                        cashier, I will feel obliged if you'll exchange with me."</p>
                    <p>"Indeed Mr. Jones it is impossible, we have neither gold nor greenbacks."</p>
                    <p>"Well," says Mr. Jones, "you'll redeem your bills, and as Mr. Hunks will not
                        take his money, I cannot receive other than legal tender for these your
                        bills, and will be obliged to carry your bills to a Notary Public for
                        protest." The bills are protested and forwarded to the Treasury Department
                        at Washington, D.C.</p>
                    <p>The Comptroller of the Treasury is re-required to realize on the bonds
                        deposited by the First National Bank of Funkstown, and after thirty days
                        must begin the redemption of the bills of the First National Bank of
                        Funkstown. The Treasury agent puts upon the market one, two, or five hundred
                        thousand dollars of 5-20 U.S. bonds, belonging to the First National Bank of
                        Funkstown, announcing at the same time that noting but gold or legal tender
                        will be received as money for these bonds, as national bank bills are not
                        legal tender they cannot be received; yet the duty of the Treasury agent is
                        imperative, and these bonds must be sold that the bills of the First
                        National Bank of Funkstown may be redeemed according to law. Down goes
                        Five-Twenties, down, down, down, the people take the alarm, a panic ensues,
                        who is to stop it and how is it to be stopped.</p>
                    <p>Some persons will say, "Why, let Congress declare all national bank bills
                        legal tender; Congress can do no such thing, no more than Congress can
                        compel Mr. Hunks to take Mr. Jones' promissory note as legal tender.
                        Congress may suspend specie payment, as England did, what then?--why to
                        compensate for this check to depreciation, gold, real estate, and every
                        commodity will go up, up, up, no one can tell how far.</p>
                    <p>All this may or may not happen, we hope it will not, but if something is not
                        done to restrain this national banking sytem, and the nation cease to borrow
                        from these national banks, it will come, for it is the logical sequence of
                        the system.</p>
                    <p> We have confidence in the prudence and the foresight of President Johnson,
                        that he will call for some action of Congress early to check this mad
                        banking system, and by recommending a continuance and extended issue of
                        legal tender U.S. bills for circulation amongst the people, and thereby ward
                        off an evil as threatening almost as the invasion of our country by a
                        foreign enemy; but will the loyal Congress see
                        it, or will their loyalty permit them to support President Johnson
                        and save the country from a panic, and the government securities from
                        depreciation. </p>

<b>President Lincoln on Negro Suffrage</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In response to Radicals who are touting a recently-uncovered letter written

                    that Lincoln believed in granting blacks the vote in only a few, limited

                    <p>EXECUTIVE MANSION</p>
                    <p>
                         Hon. Michael Hahn: 
                    </p>
                    <p>MY DEAR SIR: I congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as the
                        first free State governor of Louisiana. Now you about to have a convention,
                        which, among other things, will probably define the elective franchise. I
                        barely suggest, for your private consideration, whether some of the colored
                        people may not be let in, as, for instance, the very intelligent, and
                        especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks. They would probably
                        help, in some trying time to come, to keep the jewel of liberty in the
                        family of freedom. But this is only a suggestion, but to you alone.</p>
                    <p>Truly yours,</p>
                    <p>A. LINCOLN</p>
                    <p>On which note it is proper to observe:</p>
                    <p>1. That Mr. Lincoln's request of secrecy shows that he felt it was, if not
                        intrusive, at least indelicate, for the President of the United States to be
                        making suggestions respecting the regulation of suffrage in a State.</p>
                    <p>2. That Mr. Lincoln concedes that this is a matter for exclusive State
                        control. The State convention then soon to be held, he said would probably
                        define the elective franchise: and it is only in an indirect and covert
                        manner that he seeks to influence its action, not by authority, not even by
                        advice, but only by a diffident suggestion made through a citizen of the
                        state.</p>
                    <p>3. That it was only very intelligent negroes or those who had fought with
                        gallantry for the Union, who were included in the suggestion.</p>
                    <p> If the negro suffrage party will stand on Mr. Lincoln's ground nobody in the
                        North will oppose them. Let them explicitly admit that the whole subject is
                        outside the jurisdiction of the federal government, and that only a State
                        convention in each State is competent to decide it, and they will show a
                        becoming respect for the judgment of the deceased statesman they elected
                        President. If the letter to Governor Hahn is paraded as authority it is an
                        authority against them, both as regards
                        jurisdiction over the subject, modesty in making the suggestions respecting
                        it, and the extent in which the experiment of negro suffrage was deemed
                        safe. On the point of jurisdiction Mr. Lincoln's opinion was positive; on
                        the other points it was so hesitating and doubtful that he did not care to
                        avow it to the public. The earlier sentiments of Mr. Lincoln were decidedly
                        hostile to negro citizenship and suffrage. In the famous Illinois contest
                        for the senatorship between him and Judge Douglas in 1858, Mr. Lincoln
                        defined his views as follows: </p>
                    <p> Judge Douglas has said to you that he has not been able to get from me an
                        answer to the question whether I am in favor of negro citizenship. So far as
                        I know, the judge never asked me that question before. He shall have no occasion, to ever ask it again, for I shall tell him
                            frankly that I am not in favor of negro citizenship. * * * </p>
                    <p> My opinion is that the different States have the power to make a negro a
                        citizen under the Constitution of the United States if they choose. The Dred
                        Scott decision decides that they have not that power. If
                            the State of Illinois had that power, I should be opposed to the
                            exercise of it.</p>
                    <p> Mr. Lincoln said more to the same effect, is that he was "not in favor of
                        bringing about, in any way, the social and political equality of the white
                        and black races." "I am not," said Mr. Lincoln, "nor ever have been, in
                        favor of making voters or jurors of  negroes, nor of
                            qualifying them to hold office." </p>
                    <p> These early views of Mr. Lincoln are of no sort of consequence as bearing on
                        the main question. President Lincoln and President Johnson are both on
                        record as strongly opposed to negro equality; and as citizens of their
                        respective States they were entitled to entertain on it any views they
                        pleased. As a federal question there is no place
                        for it, and on this point there is an entire concurrence between the
                        opinions of late and actual presidents; both alike regarding it as a matter
                        of State discretion. </p>
                    <p>If President Lincoln's private correspondence on this subject must be
                        divulged, let not false glosses be put upon it.</p>

                    <p>"Those who think that when a State has been reconstructed under President
                        Johnson's plan of provisional government, it will pass from the control of
                        the administration altogether, will find themselves much mistaken. A State
                        government to be legal, must me acknowledged as such by the President, and
                        by both Houses of Congress. If the Southern States are reconstructed upon a
                        basis of insecurity to the republic, injustice to other States, or disregard
                        of the great issues settled by the war, the whole subject will come before
                        Congress on the admission of members."</p>
                    <p>Here, then, is to be the fight. The radicals, finding that their power passed
                        away with the advent of Johnson, will martial all their forces next winter
                        to embarass his efforts at reorganization, and prevent any of the Southern
                        States securing a representative in Congress unless pledged to radicalism
                        and negro suffrage. But they will fail in this. The Southern States will not
                        require re-admission as territories are admitted.--Their representatives
                        will come to take their seats as if nothing had happened. The President will
                        have no control over them. His "provisional governments" will have passed
                        away and been succeeded by the old State organizations, under which these
                        representatives will come delegated to Congress. Uniting themselves then,
                        with conservative members from the North, the radicals will become powerless
                        to stir up and continue the disgraceful strife that has so long sundered the
                        sections. Secessionism is now dead, which fact is nowhere more felt than at
                        the South. To endeavor to continue a war of sections on so debasing an issue
                        as negro suffrage is therefore most criminal and reprehensible. Let the
                        South do her duty fairly: elect good and true Union men and the Northern
                        conservatives will protect them from the radicals and negro suffrage.</p>

                    <p> The Augusta Chronicle publishes a detailed
                        statement of what passed at the celebrated peace conference in Hampton
                        Roads. The materials for this statement were furnished by Alexander H.
                        Stephens. They consisted in part of oral communications made by Mr. Stephens
                        to the writer, add in part of the confidential written report (never before
                        published) furnished by the rebel commissioners to the rebel President.
                        --From the report, which was signed by all three of the commissioners, as
                        being more illustrative than anything else in it of the liberal temper
                        manifested on that occasion by Mr. Lincoln. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Seward then remarked: Mr. President--It is well to inform these gentlemen
                        that yesterday Congress acted upon the amendment of the Constitution
                        abolishing slavery.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lincoln stated that was true, and suggested that there was a question as
                        to the right of the insurgent States to return at once and claim a right to
                        vote upon the amendment, to which the concurrence of two-thirds of the
                        States was required. He stated that it would be desirable to have the
                        institution of slavery abolished by the consent of the people as soon as
                        possible--he hoped within six years. He also stated that four hundred
                        millions of dollars might be offered as compensation to the owners and
                        remarked; "You would be surprised were I to give you the names of those who
                        favor that."</p>
                    <p> The Chronicle also makes on the authority of Mr.
                        Stephens, the following statement: </p>
                    <p>Mr. Stephens came home with a new cause of sorrow, and those who said he
                        talked of coming home to make war speeches and denounce the terms offered
                        simply lied. Before Mr. Lincoln's death, he thought he was doing a favor to
                        him not to include that offer of four hundred millions in gold for the
                        Southern slaves, in the published report, for it would be used to the injury
                        of Mr. Lincoln by those of his enemies who talk about taxation and the debt.</p>
                    <p>These remarkable statements, which, if true, are important materials of
                        history, raise two questions to which public curiosity will seek an answer:</p>
                    <p> 1. Is it probable that the main statement--that relating to the offer by
                        President Lincoln of the four hundred millions--is true!</p>
                    <p>2. Supposing it true, who are the parties referred to by Mr. Lincoln whose
                        approval of the offer would have surprised the rebel commissioners?</p>
                    <p> The fact that the statement was made in a confidential report prepared by
                        the commissioners for the information of Mr. Davis and signed by all their
                        names, creates a strong presumption of its truth, which can be rebutted only
                        by evidence of its intrinsic improbability. If there be such improbability
                        it certainly does not lie in any conflict between the offer and the tenor of
                        Mr. Lincoln's antecedent views. In his second annual message, Mr. Lincoln
                        said: "It is none the less true for having been often said, that the people
                        of the South are not more responsible for the introduction of this property
                        than the people of the North; and when it is remembered how unhesitatingly
                        we all use cotton and sugar, and share the profits of dealing in them, it
                        may not be quite safe to say that the South has been more responsible than
                        the North for its continuance. If, then, for a common
                            object, this property to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done
                            all at a common charge!"A comparison of this passage with the
                        statement of the commissioners, renders the alleged offer entirely credible. </p>
                    <p>The next question is, who Mr. Lincoln probably referred to in his dark
                        intimation respecting those who approved of the offer. As he used the plural
                        number, we can lift only one corner of the veil. Whoever may have been the
                        surprising indorsers of this offer, it is certain that Mr. Horace Greely was
                        its original proposer. In his letter to President Lincoln reccommending the
                        Niagara Falls negotiation (surreptitiously published about the time of the
                        Hampton Roads conference for the purpose of defaming Mr. Greely) he
                        suggested, as one of his six points to constitute the basis of peace, the
                        payment of four hundred millions in United States five per cent bonds, as a
                        compensation to the loyal owners of slave, to be distributed among the
                        States in the ratio of the slave population; the share of each State to be
                        at the absolute disposal of its Legislature. The paternity of the four
                        hundred million offer made by President Lincoln clearly belongs to Mr.
                        Greely. It would seem, from the statement of Mr. Lincoln, that when he
                        showed it to others, it had the fortune to be indorsed in some very
                        unexpected quarters.</p>
                    <p>The facts here collated have only a historical interest; but they throw a
                        curious light on one of the most remarkable transactions during the way. We
                        dare say it was hardly surmised by those who violated confidence to procure
                        the publication of Mr. Greely's letter, that President Lincoln was, at that
                        very time, giving the most scandalous part of it the highest sanction it
                        could possibly receive.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some inquiries having recently been addressed to the Commissioner of Internal
                        Revenue, in relation to several cases in which the writer had some doubts,
                        the following reply was received from Deputy Commissioner Rollins:</p>
                    <p>"I reply, that where property which is employed in business is lost, by fire
                        or otherwise, it may be restored to the condition before the loss, from the
                        profits of the business inwhcih it is employed, provided restoration is made
                        in the same year in which it is destroyed. If it is not restored, no
                        deduction will be made on account of the loss and animals lost by theft,
                        &amp;c., may be replaced by others of equal value</p>
                    <p>"When a farmer has lost his fencing, as in the case you state harmed by the
                        armies, he is entitled to deduct the expense of restoring it to its former
                        condition from the income of his farm; but no deduction can be made from
                        other sources. The rate is, that loss incurred in presenting one kind of
                        business cannot be deducted from gains derived from a business of an
                        entirely different endeavor. Therefore a merchant doing business in
                        Baltimore cannot deduct from his gains in that business loss mearred from
                        his farming operations.</p>
                    <p> "Where a father has Leg it control over his minor
                        son, so as to earn his wages, he can claim no deduction on the son's
                        account. If the father has no legal control over his son's wages, the son
                        must return his own income, but only one deduction of $600 will be allowed.
                        The son will be entitled to his proportionate share of said deduction." </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> Now that the war is over, it may be interesting to many to learn the
                        following items showing to whom pensions may be granted. <br> We give what
                        occurred on the occasion entire: </p>
                    <p>1. Invalids, disabled since March 4th, 1861, in the military or naval service
                        of the United States, while in the line of duty.</p>
                    <p>2. Widows of officers, soldiers and seamen who have died of wounds received
                        or disease contracted in the service as above.</p>
                    <p>3. Children under sixteen years of age of either of the aforesaid deceased
                        parents, if there is no widow surviving or from the time of the widows
                        marriage.</p>
                    <p>4. Mothers of officers, sodiers or seamen, deceased as aforementioned, and
                        who were dependent on the son for support, in whole or in part.</p>
                    <p>5. Sisters under sixteen years of age, dependent on said deceased brother
                        wholy or in part for support, provided there are none of the last three
                        cases above mentioned.</p>
                    <p>Invalids and friends of deceased soldiers are remined that in order to have
                        said pension commence when the service terminated, the application therefore
                        must be made within a year of the discharge of the invalid, or decease of
                        the officer, soldier, or as the case may be.</p>
                    <p> Mr. Holmes.--You always claimed to be. <br> (Laughter.) </p>
                    <p> The President replied: He always thought that slavery could not be sustained
                        outside of the Constitution of the United States, and that whenever the
                        experiment was made it would be lost. Whether it could or could not, he was
                        for the Union, and if slavery set itself up to control the Government, the
                        Government must triumph and slavery perish. The institution of slavery under
                        the issue, and we might as well meet it likewise, patriotic and honest men.
                        All institutions must be subordinate to the Government and slavery has given
                        way. He could not if he would remand it to its former status.</p>
                    <p>He knew that some whom he now addressed looked upon him as a great people's
                        man and a radical; but however unpleasant it might be to them, he had no
                        hesitation in saying that before and after he entered public life that he
                        was opposed to monompolies, and perpetuities and entailes. For this he used
                        to be denounced as a demagogue. When they had a monopoly in the South in
                        slaves, though he had bought and held slaves, he had never sold one. From
                        the Magna Charta we had derived our ideas of freedome of speech and liberty
                        of the press, and from unreasonable searches, and that private property
                        should not be taken for public uses without just compensation. He had thse
                        notions fixed in his mind, and was, therefore, opposed to this class of
                        legislation. Being providentially brought to his present position he
                        intended to exert the power and influence of the Government, so as to place
                        in power the popular heart of this nation.</p>
                    <p>He proceeded on the principle that the great masses are not like mushrooms,
                        clinging about a stump and owing their existence to the murky weather. He
                        believed that this nation was sent on a great mission to afford an example
                        of freedom and substantial happiness to all the powers of the earth. The
                        Constitution of the United States, in speaking of persons to be chosen as
                        representatives in Congress says: "The electors of each State shall have the
                        qualifications requisite for Electors to the most numerous branch of the
                        State Legislature."</p>
                    <p>Here we find a resting place. This was the point at which the Rebellion
                        commenced. All the States were in the Union, moving in harmony; but a
                        portion of them rebelled, and to some extent paralyzed and suspended the
                        operations of their Governments. there is a constitutional obligation
                        resting upon the United States Government to put down Rebellion, suppress
                        insurrection and to repel invasion. The slaves went into the war as slaves,
                        and came out free men of color. The friction of the Rebellion has rubbed out
                        the nature and charcter of slavery. The loyal men who were compelled to bow
                        and submit to the Rebellion should, now that the Rebellion has ended, stand
                        equal to loyal men everywhere. Hence the wish of restoration and trying to
                        get back the States to the point at which they formerly moved in perfect
                        harmony.</p>
                    <p>He did not intend to serve any particular clique or interest. He would say to
                        the delegation that slavery is gone as an institution. There was no hope
                        that the people of South Carolina could be admitted into the Senate or the
                        House of Representatives until they had afforded evidence by their conduct
                        of this truth. The policy, now that the rebellion is suppressed, is not to
                        restore the State Governments through military rule, but by the people.
                        While the war has emancipated the slaves, it has emancipated a large number
                        of white men. He would talk plain.</p>
                    <p>The delegation said that was what they desired.</p>
                    <p>He could go to men who had owned fifty or a hundred slaves, and who do not
                        care as much for the poor white man as they did for the negro. Those who own
                        the land have the capital to employ, and therefore some of our Northern
                        friends are deceived when they, living far off, think they can exercise a
                        greater control over the freedmen than the Southern men who have been reared
                        where the institution of slavery prevailed.</p>
                    <p>Now, he did not want the late slaveholders to control the negro votes against
                        white men. Let each State judge of the depositary of its own political
                        power. He was for emancipating the white man as well as the black.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Holmes asked, "Is that not altogether accomplished?"</p>
                    <p>The President replied that he did not think the question was fully settled.
                        the question as to whether the black man shall be engrafted in the
                        constituency, will be settled as we go along. He would not disguise the fact
                        that, while he had been prersecuted and denouced at the South as a traitor,
                        he loved the great mass of the Southern people. He opposed the Rebellion at
                        its breaking out and fought it everywhere; and now he wanted the principles
                        of the Government carried out and maintained.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Holmes interrupted by saying, we want to get back to the same position as
                        you describe. As we are without law no courts are open, and you have the
                        power to assist us.</p>
                    <p>The President replied: --The Government cannot go on unless it is right. The
                        people of South Carolina must have a Convention and amend their Constitution
                        by abolishing slavery and this must be done in good faith; and the
                        Convention or Legislature must adobt the proposed amendment to the
                        Constitution of the Union, which prohibits and excludes slavery everywhere.</p>
                    <p>One of the delegates said: --We are most anxious for civil rule, for we have
                        had more than enough of military despotism.</p>
                    <p>The President resuming, said that, as the Executive, he could only take the
                        initiatory steps to enable them to do the things which it was incumbent upon
                        them to perform.</p>
                    <p>Another of the delegates remarked that it was assumed in some parts of the
                        country that, in consequence of the Rebellion, the Southern States had
                        forfeited their rights as members of the Confederacy, and that if they were
                        restored it could only be on certain conditions, one of which was that
                        slavery shall be abolished. This could be done only through a convention.</p>
                    <p>the President repeated that the friction of the Rebellion had rubbed slavery
                        out; but that the Constitutuion of South Carlpina did not establish slavery
                        it would be better to insert a clause therein antagonistic to slavery.</p>
                    <p>Judge Frost said: --The object of our prayer is the appoinment of a Governor.
                        --The people of South Carolina will accept these conditions in order that
                        law and order may be restored, and that enterprise and industry may be
                        directed to useful ends. We desire restoration as soon as possible. It is
                        the part of wisdom to make the best of circumstances. Certain delusuions
                        have been dispelled by the revolutuion, among them that slavery was an
                        element of political strenth and moral pwer. It is very certain that the old
                        notion respecting State rights, in the maintenance of which those who in
                        South Carolina made the Rebellion, erred, has ceased to exist. Another
                        delusion, namely, that "Cotton is king," has also vanished in the mist.</p>
                    <p>We are to come back with these notions dispelled and with a new system of
                        labor. The people of South Carolina will cordially cooperate with the
                        Government in making that labor effective, and elevating the negro as much
                        as they can. It is, however, more th work of time than the labor of
                        enthusiasm and fanaticism. The people of</p>

                    <p>RICHMOND, June 26.</p>
                    <p>EDITORS SPIRIT:</p>
                    <p>I left Chambersburg on the 22d inst. I was compelled to stay at Harrisburg
                        one day to get the pay due me for services in the Signal Corps. Paymaster
                        Justus Phelps' account differed from mine about sixty dollars. He committed
                        an error of ten dollars on account of my rank, and twenty-seven in my
                        clothing account. These I had corrected, but he still retained the
                        twenty-five dollars bounty paid me when I enlisted, more than a year ago.
                        One year men are not the only ones whose bounties are withheld.</p>
                    <p>I reached Baltimore on the evening of the 23d in time to take the steamer
                        Daniel Webster, which leaves at 6 P.M. for Richmond, fare $8.00, meals
                        $1.00. I sat on the main deck for two hours, watching the approaching and
                        receding tugs, schooners, &amp;c., that dotted the bay. To a verdant
                        land-bubber this seems extremely pleasant, and I availed myself of all the
                        pleasure it afforded. I slept comfortably in one of the berths of the cabin,
                        arose early, breakfasted, and went on deck again. At 7 A.M. we landed at
                        Fortress Monroe and then embarked on the Milton Martin, and at 7 we left the
                        Hampton Roads, for Richmond. Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Hampton Roads,
                        Sewell's Point, &amp;c., are just what the newspapers say they are.
                        Nothing new that would interest any one can be added here. Soon after we
                        started I made the acquaintance of an intelligen sergeant of a N.Y. Battery,
                        who had served with the armies operating against Richmond for more than four
                        years. He knew all about the James River, and he entertained me during the
                        whole trip. We passed a dozen different landings, points, plantations of
                        note, &amp;c., but I can't notice them all. Fort Pocahontas, at Wilson's
                        Landing or Jamestown called forth my especial attention. --The river is very
                        narrow here, and the fort seems to have been built to prevent the rebels
                        obstructing the stream. here are the remnants of historic Jamestown. All
                        that remains of this first English settlement is the remnant of an old
                        church. Let the name of the fort here, and Fort Powhatan, eight miles above,
                        suggest the early history of this place.</p>
                    <p>Harrison's and Aikett's landing are not devoid of interst in connection with
                        the history of the present war, but let it pass. At Wilson's landing I was
                        shown a Rebel Major whose treason cost him no little. --He is the son of one
                        Morgan, but to satisfy the demands of an eccentric uncle, the donor of all
                        his possessions, he had his name changed to that of his benefactor--Allen.
                        He is now Wm. C. Allen, familiarily called "Buck" Allen. Before the war
                        "Buck" Allen owned upper and lower Brandon, and Jamestown lands amounting to
                        nine thousand acres. He had also three thousand slaves, fourteen miles
                        private Rail Road, houses, barns, &amp;c., accordingly. He left the
                        Rebel army a year ago, and it is said much of his real estate, that was
                        forfeited will be restored him. Of course his slaves are slaves no more.</p>
                    <p>The Signal Towers on this line awakened a lively interst. Some of them mount
                        up more than two hundred feet, and I was not long concluding that if I had
                        been on duty here instead of the Department of Pennsylvania, one more
                        soldier would have died, of a broken neck, a natural consequence of my
                        ascent to such a tower.</p>
                    <p>Dutch Gap Canal is on this line. We passed the canal, and I scrutinized it
                        closely. After steaming on for half an hour, we came to the same Dutch Gap
                        Canal. I [unclear] it is not more than three hundred years long, and less
                        than twenty yards wide. It is a remarkable fact that the traveler who
                        follows the James River is no nearer Richmond after steaming for eight miles
                        than he was before steaming at all. I've reached Richmond at 4 P.M.,
                        Saturday. I have been over most of the city. --In the first hour of my stay
                        here, I got into the capitol and Jeff's residence. The capitol is massive,
                        but old, rusty and abused. --It resembles in structure very much the capitol
                        at Harrisburg, except that it is built of stone. The grounds are handsome
                        [unclear] throughout, with walks, &amp;c., just like that of my own
                        State. Close to the building is a splendid marble monument. [unclear]
                        General Washington on his horse is on the [unclear], with the horse's head
                        southward, but Washington is pointing with his right hand and looking to the
                        South-South West. --Lower on a sub platform or sub pillars are the statues
                        of Thomas Jefferson, Mason (not of Mason and Slidell reputation) and Henry.
                        Jefferson is facing eastward, and his face depicts great though. His left
                        forearm crosses his breast, and his left hand holds a scroll, and with a pen
                        in his right hand, his arm is thrown across his breast above his left, with
                        the hadn as high as his shoulder. Mason looks South East and has arms
                        hanging at his side, with a pen and scroll in his hands. Henry is looking
                        southward, with his right arm extended as in advancing gesture, bearing in
                        his hand a sword, grasped near the centre, and with it is a scroll bearing
                        the one word LIBERTY. A separate statue of Hart is near this, but I know
                        nothing of his history. I had occasion to visit Jeff.'s mansion--Gen.
                        Halleck's headquarters. I was in two of the rooms and can pronounce them
                        elegant. --The furniture is superior to any I saw North. The sentinel here
                        told me that the same was used by Jeff. Vice President Stephen's residence
                        is nearly opposite and is little less elegant. At this as well as all other
                        buildings of any note, private and public entrance is gained by mounting a
                        flight of high steps. The city looks old and rusty. Gen. Lee's mansion is on
                        Franklin Street between 7yh and 8th, and is a three storied brick building,
                        enclosed with an iron fence. It is very plain, as is also most all the city,
                        yet there are a few houses of superior architecture and handsomely
                        ornamented. From the James (excepting those houses next the river) to Broad
                        street the houses are very large. North of that they are generally small.
                        Excepting that part next the James, the city is not compactly built. The
                        streets are all shaded, the squares short, the site hilly. A great deal of
                        the south side was burnt, covering four or five times as much ground as the
                        Chambersburg burnt district. This looks just like C. did. I visited Castle
                        thunder and Libby Prision, situated in the south east part of the city,
                        slose to the burnt district. They are the dirtiest, most stinking holes I
                        ever saw men in. The scene is too disgusting to write about. Force is the
                        only allurement I could ever admit, to get me there.</p>
                    <p>Boarding here commands $3.50 a day. I stopped at the Monumental Hotel. The
                        house and furniture are common, but the fare and attention is very good.</p>
                    <p>I attended Episcopalian services at St. Pauls Church on Sunday evening. This
                        is a finer church than any in Chambersburg, and from a rough estimate I
                        believe about ten or twelve hundred persons can be seated comfortably. The
                        pews are cushioned, with wood work engraved. Large hewn stone is the
                        building material. Fourteen persons were admitted to membership. I thought
                        the church music unlike any I ever heard North. The church has as good an
                        organ as any I ever heard.</p>
                    <p>For the satisfaction of our northern ladies I will here say, that as a
                        general rule the Richmond females do not follow northern fashions. Half
                        crowns, no crowns, puff hair and waterfalls are among the things to come.
                        Some ladies here, whom I believe to be from the North, because of the
                        company they keep, follow the style of caps, no crowns, &amp;c., that
                        are used in C. Not a short slack, or Josie or Garibaldi seems to have
                        entered the city, Duster or no wrappings at all.</p>
                    <p>I met in the city one Corporal Henneberger from C. He is very one of Co. D,
                        11th Cavalry's best.</p>
                    <p>I reported here to Gen. Curtis. This morning I leave for Texas via Old Point
                        Comfort.</p>
                    <p>My regiment left here June 1, and has already reached Texas. So says Curtis.
                        I am sorry to leave Richmond for it is decidedly pleasant.</p>
                    <p>Yours, Respectfully. 127--11-5</p>
