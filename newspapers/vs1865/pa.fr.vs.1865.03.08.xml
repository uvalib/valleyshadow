                    know too well how utterly his practice has been at variance with the professions

                    <p>The inaugural address of President Lincoln, which we print this morning, has
                        been looked for by the public with less interest than is usually exhibited,
                        even in ordinary times, in regard to a public expression from the pen or
                        lips of a President of the United States. The indifference is attributable,
                        probably, to the fact that the people know too well how utterly his practice
                        has been at variance with the professions he made in his first inaugural, to
                        have any confidence in his utterances now. It was expected, however, that he
                        would make some attempt to excuse his violations of the Constitution which
                        he had swown [sic] to support, and his abandonment of principles which he
                        had solemnly put forth as his rule of conduct. In lieu of any such attempt,
                        however, he has given us the mere trash to which we refer our readers as
                        unworthy of comment. In regard to the wide gulf between the professions in
                        his first inaugural and his practices ever since, he has attempted no
                        explanation. He had nothing to say, and he has said it.</p>

                    <p>Pulpit eloquence, like everything else, is in a state of revolution. Barrow
                        and South, and Sherlock and Tillotson, and Warourton, and Horseley, and mild
                        Simeon, have passed into oblivion, and Beecher, and Brooks, and Parson
                        Brownlow are trump. Beecher, it is said, has talent. Brooks is a sort of
                        elaborate, premeditated Spurgeon--that is a Spurgeon without his physical
                        antics. Being of bulky frame he only cuts paper rhetorically, the following
                        from the <emph rend="italic">Inquirer</emph> indicates:</p>
                    <p>There was an Arab once who had the devil for his servant. When his term of
                        service had expired, the devil begged as his reward to kiss the shoulders of
                        his master. The request was granted, but out of the spots where the devils
                        lips had touched sprang serpents, which ever darted their fangs into the
                        breast of the unhappy man. He strove to tear them away, but could not for
                        the agony. The devil of slavery had kissed the strong shoulders of the
                        republic, and serpents sprung from her defiling lips are preying upon her
                        life. It is agony to tear them off, but it is death to let them remain.
                        Despite our anguish, we have taken courage to rid us of the abomination.</p>
                    <p>This is the style in which the Rector of Trinity indulges, and in which the
                        feminine congregation of Trinity delight. "Devils," and "snakes," and
                        "Arabs," and "serpents," and "agony," and "kisses," and "defiling lips," and
                        "anguish," and "abomination" make a pretty strong dose of ecclesiastical
                        eloquence, but the young and old women, the loyal church wardens and
                        vestrymen, swallow it gratefully. What would that meek, and moderate, and
                        decorous, and saintly man, Bishop White, say, if he could revisit our
                        moon-struck world, and hear such wretched stuff?</p>
