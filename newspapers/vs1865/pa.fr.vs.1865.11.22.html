<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"We reproduce from the Harrisburg Telegraph
                    of last week, the following article in order to show to our readers the degree
                    of harmony and affection existing between prominent shoddy politicians of this

                    very pretty fight as it stands, and if continued, people may hear some truth

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"The people of Pennsylvania will be glad to know that Col. A. K. McClure,
                        editor of the Franklin Repository, has had an
                        interview with the President. Our quondam friend makes the most of this
                        interview by devoting two columns of the last issue of his paper, first, to
                        create the impression that he is on easy terms of familiarity with the
                        President, and second, to vent his spite on that high dignitary, by
                        assailing his administration, instead of his personal reputation as he did
                        only eight months since.-Then Col. A. K. McClure wrote and spoke of Andrew
                        Johnson as if he (Johnson) was the most besotted and degraded wretch in the
                        country, alike unfitted for the place which he had just been elevated, and
                        unworthy the confidence of the people who had carried him into power. More
                        than one reader of the Repository still remembers
                        the disgust created by McClure's base assault on the Vice President-an
                        assault precipitated doubtless to gratify a personal hate or a partisan
                        jealousy-and an assault which only found its echo in the columns of the
                        meanest copperhead organs in the state. Now, forsooth, the facetious McClure
                        writes of Andrew Johnson's "symetrical" form, his "cold, grey eye, that
                        looks on if in its calmest glances there slumbers behind it quite enough to
                        quicken it;" of his "finely chiseled Roman face;" of his "genial smile,"
                        with such other common-place compliments calculated only to nauseate those
                        for whom they were intended, and to which trained mendicants resort when
                        attempting to bamboozle charitably disposed old gentlemen into the bestowal
                        of a few coppers. In all candor, McClure should have been the last man to
                        seek the presence of Andrew Johnson, after the manner in which he maligned
                        and traduced that gentleman. His profession of having been instrumental in
                        the nomination of Governor Johnson as candidate for Vice President, many be
                        accepted as so much twaddle and stuff. He supported the Tennesseean, not
                        because he liked him, but because at the time it suited one of his
                        self-compensating tricks to do so. At the late election, this same McClure
                        predicted and prayed for our defeat in this State, because he was then
                        anxious for such a disaster as a means of pandering to his own vanity and of
                        castling the blame of such a catastrophe into the face of the President. And
                        yet this man sought the presence of Andrew Johnson, coolly offering him his
                        counsel, then turns away to impress the people of Pennsylvania with the idea
                        that the President of the United States harbors a secret purpose to betray
                        their interests by catering too lovingly and distributing his favors too
                        liberally to the rebels of the South! Truly, the age of impertinence, as
                        well as the race of insolents is neither past or exhausted. </p>
                    <p>We do not notice McClure's "Hour with Andrew Johnson," to expose and defeat
                        his ingenious attempt to bring the President of the United States to
                        reproach in Pennsylvania. It is not necessary for us to do so, as the trick
                        is alike shallow and transparent. The people of Pennsylvania have endorsed
                        the policy of the President of the United States-the people of other States
                        have placed the seal of approval on the same policy. Whatever designing
                        politicians may claim, no truly loyal man in the free States-no men imbued
                        with a sensible devotion to the real interests of the entire country, are
                        ready, while they are welcoming one race of men from bondage, to thrust
                        another class into that black night of degradation from which, if the
                        programme of those who conspire for such an adjustment of our domestic
                        affairs were carried out, there would be no rescue for any man born below
                        Mason and Dixon's line during the past thirty years. Such men as our friend
                        McClure seem more anxious to deal horribly with unarmed traitors than they
                        were emulous to meet traitors armed cap-a-pie,
                        and boiling for a fight. </p>
                    <p>When De Witt Clinton organized the initial movement for the construction of
                        the great system of internal improvements in New York, that are now the
                        wonder of the world, Major Noah, then a leading journalist in that State,
                        undertook to "write down" Governor Clinton; but long before such scribes as
                        Noah had completed their part of the task, Clinton had finished his work,
                        making the State which he governed one of the most prosperous in the Union.
                        May we not calm the same result for President Johnson. Long before such
                        scribes as McClure have finished their task of "writing down" the President,
                        he will have completed his gigantic work, and secured for his country a
                        peace and prosperity unparalleled for its glory and incomparable in its
                        wealth. Everywhere among business men, among the class who add most to the
                        wealth of the country by their labor and their enterprise, that policy is
                        heartily approved.-No sane man in the North desires to make a Van Dieman's
                        land of the South. No man with a regard for the dignity of his race, wants
                        to enslave his brother, or to stamp him indelibly with the disgrace of a
                        crime into which he was led by misrepresentation ignorance and prejudice.
                        The punishment of the South is already greater than that suffered by any
                        other people for a similar offence. Its social organization destroyed-its
                        most vigorous youth in the grave-its patrimonies blotted out-its pride
                        forever humbled-what more can a victorious people want for the humiliation
                        and punishment of those whom they once called fellow-citizens, and about
                        whose necks they were wont to cling with the affection of brothers. Men like
                        Andrew Johnson, who suffered severely and fought bravely for the honor of
                        the country, are imbued with the proper spirit in seeking the adjustment of
                        our difficulties-while those of the McClure stamp, who, not having felt the
                        war while it raged, are now clamoring for halters and ostracisms. One thing
                        is very evident, the people are with the President. He has their
                        unmistakable endorsement; and if Andrew Johnson wants the support of
                        McClure, let him grease a stick and he can catch "Pete" at his leisure."</p>

                    <p>Wendell Phillips, some months ago, made his proclamation that the fate of the
                        nation was in the hands fo the Clerk of the last House of Representatives,
                        who, by law holds over till the new Congress elects a Speaker, and whose
                        duty it is to prepare an official list of members. Mr. Phillips avowed that
                        in the firmness of the Clerk in excluding from the roll the names of members
                        from reconstructed States, was vested the only hope of National salvation.
                        This was the rock or sandstone upon which we reposed, and he expressed a
                        melancholy apprehension that the Clerk might not be a man of solidity.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Edward McPherson, the Clerk of the House, would have been a singular
                        person if he had manifested any considerable opposition to this and kindred
                        efforts to magnify his office, but he would have commended himself to the
                        judicious, if he had been careful not to show a disposition to assist in the
                        process of the exaggeration of his consequence. We find in the New York
                        Evening Post, a Washington letter dated October
                        23, contained the following: </p>
                    <p>"The Clerk of the last Congress, by law, holds over till the new Congress
                        elects a Speaker, and it is his duty to procure an official list of members.
                        He calls the roll when the House meets, and when the election for Speaker
                        takes place he uses this roll. Great power is conferred upon the Clerk, but
                        it could not be otherwise. Mr. McPherson has informed his friends, without
                        reservation, that he will not place upon the official list of members any
                        person claiming to be elected from a State that has been in rebellion
                        against the Government. To be differently would be to decide, himself, one
                        of the most important questions before Congress; for to let in eighty
                        Southern members at the offset to vote upon the subject of their own
                        recognition, would end the controversy in their favor at once."</p>
                    <p>That members of Congress elected in States that were involved in the
                        rebellion will present themselves in the Hall of the House of
                        Representatives, on the first monday of December next, is certain. "Knocking
                        at the door," is a figure of speech. There is no military or other guard at
                        the door to inspect the passes of members, and pronounce upon their
                        validity. Horace Maynard and Colonel Stokes, of Tennesee, will not encounter
                        any more difficult in walking into the Hall, than the Hon. Benjamin
                        Eggleston and General R. B. Hayes, of Ohio.</p>
                    <p>Tennesee we suppose may be counted a State that has been in rebellion against
                        the Government. Mr. McPherson has-if the Post's
                        correspondent is well informed, and we have no doubt he is-told his friends
                        without reservation, that he will not place the names of Maynard, Stoke, and
                        others of the Tennesee delegation (the application of this example to all
                        the reconstructed States is clear) upon his official roll. Perhaps a motion
                        shall be made directing that he shall call all the States and the names of
                        their representatives; and perhaps he will refuse to do so. Can he imagine
                        that the decision of this momentous question rests with him alone? </p>
                    <p>An instructive precedent will readily be cited by readers of Congressional
                        history. On the 2d of Decmber 1839, at the opening of the twenty-sixth
                        Congress, Hugh Garland, Clerk of the twenty-fifth Congress, refused to call
                        the names of the members from New Jersey, because the seats of all the
                        members from New Jersey were contested. For three days there was an excited
                        and wild debate, the House being both unorganized and disorderly. On the
                        fourth day, the clerk was directed to call the roll again, and commencing
                        with Maine had proceeded according to the geographical situation of the
                        States, as far as New Jersey and was about to say that he would not call the
                        names of members of that State, when John Quincy Adams, who had not had
                        anything to say about the controversy up to that moment, suddenly took the
                        floor and said: "I rise to interrupt the Clerk."</p>
                    <p>Instantly there was profound silence in the Hall, and Mr. Adams said:</p>
                    <p>We degrade and disgrace our constituents, and the country, because the Clerk
                        of the House, the mere Clerk whom we employ, and whose existence depends
                        upon our will usurps the throne and sets us, the
                        Representatives and vice-gerents of the whole American people at defiance,
                        and holds us in contempt. And what is this Clerk of yours? Is he to suspend
                        by his mere negative, the functions of Government, and put an end to this
                        congress? He refused to call the roll? It is in your power to compel him to
                        call it, if he will not do it voluntarily. (Here Mr. Adams was interrupted
                        by a member, who said he was authorized to say, that compulsion could not
                        reach the Clerk, who avowed that he would resign rather than call the State
                        of New Jersey.) Well, sir, let him resign, continued Mr. Adams, and we may
                        possible discover some way by which we may get along without the aid of his
                        powerful talent, learning and genius. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Adams submitted a motion to require of the Clerk to call the roll for New
                        Jersey, and there was a general outcry of "how shall the question be put?"
                        All knew that the Clerk would not put it. Mr. Adams said: "I intend to put
                        the question myself." That solved the difficulty. Richard Barnwell Rhett, of
                        South Carolina, sprang upon a desk, and moved the Hon. John Quincy Adams, of
                        Massachusetts, take the chair, as presiding officer, and officiate until the
                        House be organized by the election of its constitutional officers.-The
                        motion was put and carried. Mr. Adams was escorted to the chair. New Jersey
                        was called and the House organized. If Edward McPherson, "the mere clerk,"
                        "usurps the throne," and attempts to play the
                        role of Hugh Garland, it will not be difficult to find one who can follow
                        Adams precedent in bringing order out of chaos. It was easy for the
                        courtiers of Ferdinand to make an egg stand on end after Columbus had shown
                        them how so remarkable a feat might be accomplished.</p>

                    <p>The War Department computes the number of deaths in the Union armies since
                        the commencement of the war, at 325,000 and of Southern soldiers at 200,000,
                        making at least 525,000 lives that have been lost, a part of the costly
                        price paid for defence of the nation's life. At Gettysburg, 23,000 Union
                        soldiers were killed, wounded, or taken prisoners-our greatest loss during
                        one campaign. General Grant's losses, from the time he crossed the Rapidan
                        until Lee's surrender, were about 90,000. Great as were our losses, they are
                        far below those incurred in European wars, owing to our superior medicinal
                        and sanitary arrangements and the care of the government for its troops.</p>

                        cast in Texas, it comes to the prothonotary of this county, postmarked
                        "Philadelphia November 18th." It pretends to be the vote of Battery "B"
                        Independent Artillery and Company "A" of the 77th regiment Pennsylvania

                        although the Republican candidates for Sheriff and County Treasurer were
                        meritorious soldiers. Perhaps the soldiers of the battery on the day of the
                        election suspected that Duncan and Stenger would run McConaughy and Rowe
                        close, and hence the necessity of voting for them.</p>
                    <p>At any rate they did'nt keep any account of the balance of the local ticket.</p>
                    <p>What transparent fraud! Seventeen were enough to beat Stenger but it would'nt

                    <p>Inquiries are frequently made, when the term of this or that Judge of the
                        Supreme Court of Pennsylvania expires; when vacancies have occurred by death
                        or otherwise; and who were elected to all such vacancies. The following
                        compilation answers all these questions, and gives, in brief, a complete
                        history of our Supreme Bench, from 1851-the year we first elected Judges
                        under the amended Constitution, down to the present time. It is a matter of
                        interest to many, and worthy of preservation for reference:</p>
                    <p>In 1850 the Constitutional Amendment making all the Judges of this
                        Commonwealth elective by the people were perfected. During the session of
                        1851 the Legislature divided the State into judicial districts, and made all
                        other provisions requisite to give full effect to this change in the organic
                        law. In the following autumn the first election for Judges was held.</p>
                    <p>For the Supreme Bench the Democrats nominated Jeremiah S. Black, of Somerset,
                        Ellis Lewis, of Lancaster, John B. Gibson of Cumberland, Walter H. Lowrie of
                        Allegheny, and James Campbell, of Philadelphia.</p>
                    <p>The Whigs nominated Richard Coulter, of Westmoreland, Joshua W. Comly, of
                        Montour, George Chambers of Franklin, Wm. M. Meredith, of Philadelphia, and
                        William Jessup, of Susquehanna.</p>
                    <p>All the Democrats were elected except Campbell; who fell behind his ticket
                        because of a strenuous opposition to him from men to whom he was personally
                        objectionable. The only Whig elected was Coulter.</p>
                    <p>The Judges elect draw drew lots for the period each was to serve. Black drew
                        for three years, Lewis for six, Gibson for nine, Lowrie for twelve, and
                        Coulter for the full term of fifteen years. Black, having the shortest term,
                        was Chief Justice.</p>
                    <p>Coulter died in April, 1852. For the vacancy the Whigs nominated Thomas A.
                        Budd, of Philadelphia; the Democrats, John C. Knox, of Tioga. Knox was
                        elected.</p>
                    <p>In 1854 the Democrats nominated Black for re-election; the Whigs nominated
                        Daniel M. Smyser, of Montgomery. Black was elected. Lewis became Chief
                        Justice.</p>
                    <p>In 1857 the Democrats nominated Wm. Strong, of Berks, in the place of Black,
                        who had accepted the office of Attorney General under President Buchanan,
                        and James Thompson, or Erie, in place of Lewis, whose term of service was
                        expiring, and who declined a re-nomination. The Whigs nominated James Veech,
                        of Fayette, and Joseph S. Lewis, of Chester. Both the Democratic candidates
                        were chosen. Lowrie became Chief Justice.</p>
                    <p>In 1858 the Republicans nominated John M. Read, of Philadelphia, to fill the
                        vacancy made by Knox becoming Attornerney General under Gov. Packer. The
                        Democrats nominated W. A. Porter, of Philadelphia. Read was elected.</p>
                    <p>In 1863 the Democrats nominated Lowrie, who had been Chief Justice six years,
                        for re-election. The Republicans nominated Daniel Agnew, of Beaver. Agnew
                        was chosen. Woodward became Chief Justice.</p>
                    <p>The Bench is now occupied by Woodward, whose term will expire in 1867; Strong
                        and Thompson, whose terms will expire in 1872; Read, whose term will expire
                        in 1873; and Agnew, who will go out in 1878. If Strong and Thomson should
                        both be on the Bench when Woodward's term shall end, they will cast lots for
                        the Chief Justiceship.</p>
                    <p>Of the present Judges, as has already been seen, Woodward, Strong and
                        Thompson were elected as Democrats; Read and Agnew as Republicans.</p>

                    <p>By act of Assembly of 1857 Cumberland, Adams, Franklin, Fulton, Bedford,
                        Huntingdon and Blair counties were constituted the 7th Normal School
                        District of the State. The interests of our schools now demand that this
                        district shall establish a school.-A move in that direction has been made in
                        some of the counties, and the location of the school must soon be
                        determined. The act provides that when any number of citizens not less than
                        13 shall as contributors or stockholders establish such school, they shall,
                        upon recognition by the commissioners appointed for the purpose, be a
                        corporate body entitled to all the benefits of the provisions of the act of
                        Assembly. The school already established at Millersville, Lancaster county,
                        and at Edinboro, Erie county, fully establish the fact, that these schools
                        will be well patronized. Millersville had 697 and Edinboro 817 students of
                        all grades during the past year. The money expended by such an institution
                        in the vicinity where it exists will be a sufficient inducement for our
                        business men and farmers to interest themselves in securing its
                        establishment in Franklin county.</p>
                    <p>While we regard this feature of the enterprise as a pecuniary motive for
                        prompt action, the interests of schools in Franklin county will be greatly
                        promoted by having a convenient source from which to supply our schools with
                        first-class teachers, and a convenient school in which to educate our sons
                        and daughters who may desire to engage in the profession of teaching.</p>
                    <p>Let every one then take an active part in this matter and attend the district
                        meetings to be called by the school directors of the county, to whom
                        circulars will be sent. A convention of delegates, three from each district
                        will be held in Chambersburg on Friday the 19th of December, for county
                        action, and a convention of delegates one for every twenty-five schools from
                        the whole Normal District will also meet in Chambersburg on the 10th of
                        January 1866. The school will most likely, be established in this valley.
                        Franklin County we believe, for facilities of transportation, healthful
                        location and central position, and large supplies of the necessaries of life
                        for boarding houses, at reasonable rates, offer fine inducements for the
                        establishment of the school within her borders. Let her act promptly in
                        securing a large amount of stock and it will be done.</p>

                    <p>One of the Abolition papers published at Lancaster, in boasting of the
                        loyalty of that county, during the war, refers to the fact that they paid
                        over two and a quarter million dollars as bounties. The reader will
                        recollect that this is the wealthiest county in the State, and this large
                        amount of money was offered, to get soldiers from other counties, to fill
                        their quotas, so that the loyal citizens could not be shot at by the rebels,
                        now they claim that this kind of loyalty crushed the rebellion. To which the
                        Clinton Democrat replies, that the loyalty of Lancaster is undisputed, and is of long
                        standing, that that county during the Revolution furnished more beef and
                        provision to the loyal army of George the III, than all the other counties
                        in the State combined, and this boast of loyalty is therefore no new thing
                        for that locality. </p>

                    <p>Within the past few days the Government officials have brought to light facts
                        against the Internal Revenue Department. Yesterday the officers seized wells
                        No. 47, 54 and 76, three of the largest on the Thomas Holmden farm. The
                        Government claims amount to $148,000, of which $88,000 is owned by the
                        United States petroleum company, and about $60,000 by a large operator here,
                        who, it is alleged, last night made all his interest over to a second party.</p>
                    <p>The Government has notified the owners of the working interest in the wells
                        not to allow any more oil to the United States company until the claim is
                        paid.</p>
                    <p>There is much excitement here on the subject, and it is feared the bottom has
                        not been reached.</p>

                    <p>Correspondence of the Valley Spirit</p>
                    <p>Harrisburg, November 15, 1865</p>
                    <p>Yesterday was a gala day for the colored population of this city. Delegations
                        of aristocratic "darks," and others not so aristocratic, arrived on nearly
                        every train during Monday and Monday night, coming from distant towns to
                        participate in the grand reception to be given to the colored soldiers of
                        Pennsylvania under the auspices of the "Garnet Equal Rights League" of this
                        city. Monday night was passed in comparative quiet, the only incidents
                        worthy of note being the arrest by the policy of several colored "gemmen"
                        who were fond parading the streets at a very late hour with loaded muskets
                        and revolvers. Quarters in the "Lock-up," with which they were provided
                        during the remainder of the night, served to cool the ardor of their
                        patriotism somewhat and to remind them that, though they had been accorded
                        the privilege of holding a celebration, they were not yet the absolute
                        owners of the city.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday-the day fixed for the reception-was as pleasant as though it had
                        been ordered for the occasion. The sun never shone more brightly, its genial
                        rays, shedding a gentle heat around and the soft and balmy breezes playing
                        through the naked trees and out "meadows brown and sere," conspired to make
                        the day vie in loveliness with any in the "merry month of May." Old dame
                        nature surely was quite lavish with her bounties and contributed largely to
                        the enjoyment of our sable friends on this great and grand occasion. Early
                        in the morning squads of ebony colored swains and damsels could be seen
                        promenading our principal streets, or seated on some grassy plat basking the
                        in the sunshine, talking, laughing, and sometimes kissing, all of which betokened the great exhuberance of feeling
                        which swelled the bosoms of "de culled folks." </p>
                    <p>South Street-the negro's Broadway-was spanned by two arches made of
                        evergreens, on one of which was inscribed the motto: "Welcome, welcome,
                        colored soldiers."-On this street are located the "high-toned" African
                        church-a very respectable one-story brick building, the "Jones House" and
                        the "Garnet House"-two first class negro hotels.
                        Here the darkies from abroad were mostly "piled in" for lodging during their
                        stay in the city. But to the reception. </p>
                    <p>The procession was formed on East State street about ten o'clock A. M. It
                        consisted of about two hundred "American citizens of African descent" in
                        uniforms and carrying muskets, a few of whom no doubt were real soldiers who
                        had been in service, but it is said the majority were merely darky civilians with borrowed uniforms and muskets. These
                        led the advance. Next in order followed a coach drawn by four white horses containing the orator of the day,
                        Prof. William Howard Day, of New York, and other distinguished colored
                        individuals. Several two-horse coaches followed bearing other colored
                        gentlemen of note, among was the Rev. Stephen Smith, of Philadelphia, the
                        President of the day. The Paxton Lodge of colored Masons, with white aprons,
                        brought up the rear. The procession being formed it marched by the nearest
                        route, passing through several alleys, to the residence of General Cameron
                        on Front Street, where they halted and listened to a short address from the
                        General; after which they immediately countermarched and repaired, almost on
                        a double-quick, to the ground sin front of the Capitol. Here the dark
                        multitude was addressed by Prof. Day for the space of an hour and a half.
                        Day is a mulatto of rather prepossessing appearance, considerable
                        intelligence and some powers of oratory. He does not, however, rank with
                        Fred. Douglass as an orator.-Douglass is calm, deliberate, methodical and,
                        at times, eloquent in his style. This man's style is just the reverse. His
                        utterance is rapid, and more fervent than impressive, partaking largely of
                        the Methodistic style of oratory. His language was the purest Saxon, and
                        some of his sentiments were even elegantly expressed. The enfranchisement of
                        his race, of course, was the theme of his oration. </p>
                    <p>Immediately before the delivery of the oration, Mr. Thomas Chester, Chief
                        Marshal, read letters from Gen. Meade, Gen. Butler, Geo. L. Stearns and
                        Charles Sumner, expressing sympathy for their cause; and also stated that
                        the Committee had received a letter from his Excellency, Andrew Johnson,
                        President of the United States, but which he did not read, leaving the logical inference to be drawn that it did
                            not suit. The ceremonies on the hill were
                        opened with prayer by the Rev. John Walker Jackson, who has made himself
                        somewhat notorious in this community as a political preacher. The scene
                        about this time was shocking to all sense of propriety and decorum. Just
                        before the prayer, the Band (a colored Band from Philadelphia) played a
                        lively air which operated so powerfully on the enthusiastic nature of some
                        of the colored "fems" in the crowd as to cause them to shuffle "de heel and
                        de toe," giving the whole thing the appearance to the looker on of a big
                        dance. After the music and dancing ceased, the praying began amid the most
                        interminable din and noise that ever greeted mortal ears. Jackson prayed and
                        the "nigs" chattered right, left, front and rear of him. It seemed to be a
                        contest between them as to who had the righ tto the floor, or whose duty it
                        was to give way. I think the "nigs" won; for Jackson, apparently exhausted
                        in the effort to be heard, cut his prayer short and retired. </p>
                    <p>Public meetings were held in the evening in the African Church on South
                        Street and in the Court House. The meeting at the Court House was addressed
                        by Prof. Smith, of Boston-a coal-black darkey and Prof. Day, on the great
                        topic of the day-negro suffrage. The first speaker was quite witty in some
                        of his remarks, and frequently elicited the applause of his colored
                        auditory. The house was well filled with negroes and quite a sprinkling of
                        "white trash." The names of the speakers at the Church I did not learn. The
                        ceremonies of the day were wound up in a grand "hoe down" at Brant's Hall,
                        commencing at ten o'clock and ending your correspondent knoweth not when,
                        but certainly not before the "wee sma' hours" of the morning.-I learn that
                        the hop was quite a select affair, none but the more aristocratic and
                        respectable darkies being admitted.-The "common niggers," I presume, had a
                        "hoe down" of their own at the "Garnet" or "Jones House" on South Street,
                        but I do not know the fact. </p>
                    <p>The day passed off, with one exception, without any serious disturbance, and
                        the negroes generally behaved themselves with propriety, which was probably
                        much owing to the fact that all the hotel keepers refused to sell them any
                        liquor. There was, however, an affray in the evening at the depot, which at
                        one time threatened to become serious. It seems a big negro attempted to
                        force himself into a car against the wishes of the conductor, and being put
                        off the platform he drew a revolver and fired at the conductor, but
                        fortunately, I believe, hit no one. This enraged the crowd of by-standers
                        who rushed upon the negro and beat him severely, and probably would have
                        killed him, had not Barney Campbell, the Chief of Police, arrived on the
                        spot in time to save him from the hands of the infuriated crowd. He was
                        taken to the Mayor's office and thence to jail. Another negro flourished a
                        fazor who was disposed of in like manner.</p>
                    <p>On the whole the demonstration was decidedly a failure, having nothing, but
                        its blackness to recommend it. The procession numbered scarcely three
                        hundred persons all told, and the managers showed their good sense by
                        abandoning the published programme and marching by the nearest and most
                        direct route to and from General Cameron's residence. Such demonstrations on
                        the part of the negroes are all wrong; and the false philanthropy among the
                        whites that encourages them, instead of proving a benefit to the race, will
                        in the end prove an incalculable injury. It tends to make them dissatisfied
                        with their present condition and inspires them with hopes that can never be
                        realized in a community of white people.</p>
                    <p>Your old friend Hutchinson has sold his lease in the United States Hotel to
                        Conrad Zimmerman, of this city, for $35,000. Mr. Hutchinson henceforth will
                        give his entire attention to the management of the "Lochiel" which, as you
                        are aware, he leased some time ago, from its proprietor, Harry Thomas. Hotel
                        keeping has proved a lucrative business in this city during the war, but
                        whether it will continue so, time alone can determine.</p>
