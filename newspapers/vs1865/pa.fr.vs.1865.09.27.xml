                <excerpt>"The leading men of the [Republican] party have already openly declared war
                    against him, and announced their intention to fight him at every step, and, if

                <transcript>
                    <p>The Republican party is rapidly arraying itself in open hostility to the
                        administration of President Johnson. His wise and conciliatory measures for
                        the pacification of the country, and the speedy restoration of the Southern
                        States to their proper positions within the Union does not suit its
                        purposes. The grand scheme of plunder, corruption and negro equality stands
                        in imminent danger of being suddenly brought to an end by the operation of
                        the policy of the President. The President has takent he Constitution for
                        his guide andadopted a policy in accordance with the spirit and meaning of
                        that instrument, at once wise, magnanimous and just, for doing which he has
                        incurred the everlasting enmity of the radicals. The leading representative
                        men of the party have already openly declared war against him, and announced
                        their intention to fight him at every step, and, if possible, to make his
                        policy a failure, as they have already declared it to be.</p>
                    <p> It will be remembered that a convention was recently held in the State of
                        Mississippi, under the auspices of Provisional Governor Sharkey, who was
                        appointed by President Johnson to carry out his policy or restoration in
                        that State. The Convention performed its duties to the entire satisfaction
                        of the President, who congratulated the Governor, in a letter, upon the
                        happy and satisfactory results of the labors of the Convention. But not so
                        with the leaders of the Abolition party. Not a single word of commendation
                        has yet been heard from one of them. But, on the contrary, the more bold
                        among them have openly expressed their diisapporbation of the course of the
                        Convention, and consequently of the President, whilst the timid and weaker
                        brethren--such as our neighbor of the <emph rend="italic"
                        >Repository</emph>--have smothered their wrath and kept ominously silent.
                        Mr. Charles Sumner, probably <emph rend="italic">the</emph> leading
                        representative man in the party, boldly denounced the whole convention in
                        his recent speech before the Republican State Convention of Massachusetts,
                        denouncing it as "little better than a rebel conspiracy to obtain political
                        power." Remember tha what Mr. Sumner calls a "rebel conspiracy" was
                        instigated, promoted and endorsed by President Johnson. Is not this opposing
                        the Government?" What has become of all that intense "loyalty" of Mr. Sumner
                        and his fellow partisans during Mr. Lincoln's administration, when they
                        denounced all who said a word against the President or his policy as
                        traitors to the "government?" </p>
                    <p> But this is not at all. The Chicago <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph>, the
                        leading Republican journal of the Northwest, and which seems to have a
                        little more straight-forwardness and common honesty than its Eastern
                        contemporaries of the same political persuasion, speaks thus of the
                        President's Mississippi policy: </p>
                    <p>We will not inquire into the motives which prompted President Johnson to
                        issue his extraordinary order to General Slocum. It is sufficient for us to
                        know that it virtually proposes to recognize the rebel army in Mississippi
                        after the loyal army has been mainly disarmed and disbanded. It is
                        sufficient for us to know that such a policy gives power for mischief to
                        those who will be only too glad to use it, power to make the condition of
                        the freedmen less tolerable than the condition of slavery from which they
                        emerged, power to drive every Northern man out of the State, and to revive
                        the reign of terror which has been the normal condition of the South for
                        twenty years--in short, all the power which bayonets and bullets can give to
                        unrepentent slave drivers and rebels. It looks very much as though the great
                        battle had to be fought over again before the victory would be secure.</p>
                    <p>So chagrined does the Tribune seem because the President is permitting the
                        people of the South to resume their constitutional rights, that it threatesn
                        us with another war. What the war is to be for, it does not cleraly state.
                        It cannot be for the purpose of restoring the Union, for a speedy
                        restoration of the Union is what it objects to.--It must, therefore, be to
                        prevent a restoration--to keep the Southern States out of the Union until
                        such time as their people may be willing to adopt all the wild theories and
                        fancies of fanatical Abolitionism. We opine it will be a long time before
                        the people of the North will agree to enlist in such a war.</p>
                    <p> All the Republican State Conventions recently held have either directly or
                        indirectly assailed the policy of the President. In Minnesota they went so
                        far as to <emph rend="italic">vote down</emph> a resolution endorsing the
                        "civil and military policy of President Johnson." In Pennsylvania the
                        Convention was controlled by Thaddeus Stevens the most bitter and
                        uncompromising opponent of the President's policy in the whole land. The
                        resolutions were sugar-coated with one of a milk and water character in
                        favor of the President, simply because it would have been im ipolitic to
                        have done otherwise; but no one will be deceived by so flimsy a subterfuge,
                        as the spirit of determined hostility to the President is breathed through
                        every line and syllable of the remainder. Contrary to the facts in the case,
                        they declare the President's policy a failure," doubtless because the "wish
                        was father to the thought," and announce the antagonistic doctrine that the
                        States must be held as conquered provinces and their people as subjugated
                        aliens, "subject to such rules and regulations as the supreme law-making
                        power of the nation" may prescribe; and the late speech of Thaddeus Stevens
                        must be construed as the only true interpretation of the platform of the
                        party in this State, he being the leading spirit of the Convention that
                        framed it, and its admitted author. In this speech, which was made by
                        authority, after consultation with the leading politicians of his party in
                        the State, Mr. Stevens declares open war upon the President and denounces
                        his policy of "restoration" as a most "flagrant usurpation." </p>
                    <p> Such is the position of the leaders of the Republican party in this and
                        other States. They have determined to thwart the President at every step,
                        and rather than see his plan succeed they will prevent any restoration of
                        the Union whatever, if it be in their power to prevent it. Indeed, Mr.
                        Stevens admits this in so many words when he says that "Restoration will
                        leave the 'Union as it was'--<emph rend="italic">a hideous idea.</emph>" The
                        Democratic party, on the contrary, is a unit in favor of the President's
                        policy of restoration. No Democrat in this broad land can be pointed out who
                        has yet uttered a word of dissent, but all with one voice, endorse it
                        heartily, cordially, and even enthusiastically. They do this not vfrom any
                        sinister motives, but because they believe it to be constitutional and just,
                        and calculated to result speedily in a restored Union. </p>
                    <p>Citizens of Franklin county, the issue is before you, if you are opposed to
                        the Union and Constitution of our fathers--if you are in favor of keeping up
                        a large standing army to hold the Southern States in subjection as conquered
                        provinces--if you are in favor of increased taxastion to enrich the public
                        plunderers, who for four years have fattened on the public treasury--if you
                        are in favor of increasing our already enormous national debt until the
                        country sinks beneath the burden--if you are in favor of converting our
                        constitutional form of government into a centralized military despotism to
                        gratify the ambition and malignant hate of such men as Chase, Sumner and
                        Stevens, then vote the Abolition ticket. If, on the other hand, you are in
                        favor of President Johnson's plan for the speedy restoration of the Southern
                        States to the Union, for the restoration of the civil authority in those
                        States, the withdrawal of the military and the conswequent reduction of our
                        national expenses--if you wish to see the Constitution restored to its
                        supremacy in all the land, and the rights of States and citizens secured on
                        a solid foundation--if you desire peace, plenty and prosperity again to
                        smile upon the whole country as in former times under the benign influences
                        of Democratic rule, then vote the Democratic ticket. Such are the positions
                        of the two partiesin the pending political contest. Choose ye between
                    them.</p>

                <summary>At recently held Republican State Conventions around the country, the
                    article reports, leading members of the party publicly criticized President
                    Johnson and his Reconstruction policies. The cause of the latest flurry of
                    protests is Johnson's endorsement of the Mississippi convention, where many

                    <p> OUR entire ticket can succeed if we do our whole duty.--<emph rend="italic"
                            >Repository</emph></p>
                    <p> It is almost past belief, but nevertheless true that the great shoddy party
                        of Franklin county, which once boasted its thousand majority, has come down
                        to this. "Our entire ticket can succeed if we do our whole duty." The <emph
                            rend="italic">Repository</emph> does not, as in years gone by, boast of
                        assured success, and the immense majority which its ticket will receive at
                        the ballot box, but despondingly admits that there is a <emph rend="italic"
                            >bare possibility</emph> of success "if we do our whole duty." The fact
                        is the editor of that paper is a shrewd politician. He long since saw the
                        handwriting on the wall, and prudently declined a position on the ticket
                        with the <emph rend="italic">naive</emph> remark that this was a good year
                        for some one else to run. He knows very well that negro suffrage, and the
                        refused on the part of his party friends in the Legislature, to indemnify
                        the border people for losses sustained during the war are the last straws
                        which are breaking the back of his party in the southern section of the
                        State; he has therefore, passed from the front ot the rear, and is cheering
                        his fellow partisans with the very cold encouragement that they <emph
                            rend="italic">may</emph>, possibly succeed if they do their "whole
                        duty." No sir! You <emph rend="italic">cannot</emph> succeed in electing a
                        man on the ticket, and well you know it! Do not, therefore, hold out
                        delusive hopes to the poor victims who are doomed to slaughter. Do not make
                        their defeat, to them, more unbearable by encouraging expectations which you
                        know will fail to be realized. </p>
                    <p>The Colonel is as desponding in regard to the result in the State, as he is
                        in relation to the county. He is an adept in discovering the signs in the
                        political horizon, and can see a storm coming before such fellows as
                        Stumbaugh get an eye open. He plainly descerns the approaching avalanche and
                        sounds the note of alarm in the camp of the "loyal." He thus gloomily sums
                        up the chances of endorsing negro suffrage in the State this fall.</p>
                    <p>"Immediate and thorough organization only will save Pennsylvania this fall.
                        Our opponents are well prepared for the conflict. They will poll their full
                        vote. In the Northeast they will do quite as well as last year.</p>
                    <p>In the Southern counties--those South of the Juniata and Susquehanna and East
                        of the Alleghenies, we cannot materially improve the October vote of last
                        year. It is possible to reduce the crushing majorities of York, Cumberland,
                        Adams, Fulton and Bedford a thousand; but more is not to be expected; less
                        may be the result.</p>
                    <p>Philadelphia must fall off essentially in her vote, because the vast
                        manufacturing for the army has been almost wholly arrested, and thousands of
                        government employees and operatives on government work of various kinds,
                        have been scattered in other channels of industry over the country. Their
                        reduction must diminish the large Union majority of last year from 2,500 to
                        3,000, and the adjoining county of Delaware can scarcely fail to be
                        similarly elected by the same causes.</p>
                    <p>The success of the Union ticket depends wholly on the organization and full
                        vote of Lancaster, Dauphin, Somerset, Bradford, Susquehanna, Tiogo, Erie,
                        Crawford, Indiana, Lawrence, Allegheny, &amp;c. If these Union
                        strong-holds shall be systematically and thoroughly organized and polled, we
                        shall carry the State by a decisive majority. If they fail, as they did last
                        year in October, the State will inevitably be lost.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>We believe it to be an [unclear] truth that protection of the citizens
                        against all wrong is the true design of human government. This is evident
                        from the acknowledged fact that government was established solely on account
                        of the[unclear] danger and insecurity which universally prevailed in a state
                        of nature. It cannot, therefore be improper to say that no government
                        deserves the allegiance of the people, that is too weak or too indifferent
                        to their welfare, to strive to protect them, so deeply were the fathers of
                        the Republic impressed with this truth, that they imposed upon the United
                        States, the constitutional duty of guaranteeing to every State in the Union,
                        a republican form of government and to the citizens protection from invasion
                        and domestic violence. This language was the utterance of men, who had just
                        emerged from the smoke and blood of an eight years war, with kingcraft and
                        oppression. Alongside of the guarantee of a republican form of government to
                        the States, was placed the solemn pledge of the people against invasion and
                        domestic violence. The one right was regarded as sacred as the other. These
                        obligations were not incorporated into the constitution, as glittering
                        generalities, but were meant to convey an assurance, that in all time, the
                        government of the Union would be in truth as well as in name the protector
                        of the citizens. So implicitly have we been accustomed to rely upon the
                        fulfillment of all the pledges of the constitution, that until within the
                        last four years no one has ever been found bold enough to doubt the
                        beneficence of the government or, to deny its obligation to protect the
                        people.</p>
                    <p>But with our melancholy experience of the last four years, we may well be
                        pardoned for questioning the fidelity of those who now administer the
                        government, to the interests of the people. To rehearse again the trials and
                        sufferings of the border is a painful retrospect. But if it shall avail to
                        make one single voter pause and reflect upon what we say, our pain will be
                        changed to pleasure.</p>
                    <p>The border counties have never complained of the ordinary burdens of the
                        war.--They have sent their young men into the army, and cast their money
                        into the public treasury without a murmer. They felt that this was a debt,
                        which loyalty was bound to discharge, but they feel that they have good
                        ground to consider themselves grievously wronged when, in addition to those
                        common calamities they have been required to suffer, wrongs not commmon to
                        any other part of the country. Having sent the flower of their youth to die
                        upon the battlefield and having discharged cheerfully all their obligations
                        to the government, they had a right to expect that they would be protected
                        against invasion, or if that were not possible, they believed they had a
                        right to demand indemnity for losses sustained at the hands of the public
                        enemy. Our readers need not be told that no adequate means were adopted by
                        the government to protect the border from invasion. With the ruins of this
                        once beautiful town around them, they scarcely need to be reminded of the
                        horrors of the 30th of July. Crushed beneath a calamity unparallelled in the
                        war, our despoiled and beggared citizens went up to the Legislature at its
                        extraordinary session in 1864, with a prayer for relief. We felt the
                        misfortune so keenly ourselves that we could not think it possible that
                        others would be less sensitive than we. Argument was used and entreaty
                        employed in our behalf. The Constitution was appealed to, and the duty of
                        the government to indemnify us from losses, was stoutly urged, but neither
                        logic nor sentiment could move those who held control of the public purse. A
                        proposition to pay the sufferers in Chambersburg one million of dollars did
                        not receive a single Republican vote, and a bill to pay them two hundred
                        thousand dollars which had passed the House was curtailed to one hundred
                        thousand dollars by the hostile majority in the Senate.</p>
                    <p> During the last session of the Legislature so embittered were the
                        republicans against the indemnity bill that they would not allow even a bill
                        to ascertain the amount of the losses, and which did not provide for their
                        payment to become a law. Although Col. McClure received the suffrages of
                        many democrats under the hope that his influence with his party would be
                        strong enough to overcome their opposition to the measure yet of so little
                        avail were his most strenuous exertions against their insane and unreasoning
                        hostility that they were only effectual to command half a score of votes
                        from his own party. The <emph rend="italic">Legislative Record</emph> will
                        show, that during all these struggles for the success of the measure, the
                        Democrats were true to their constitutional obligations and universally
                        voted in favor of payment of our losses. </p>
                    <p>The arguments of the Republicans against the bill were grossly insolent in
                        tone and puerile in logic. They charged that the people of the border were
                        cowardly and disloyal. That they were direlict in duty in not driving the
                        invaders from the State, a feat which required three days of hard fighting
                        at Gettysburg, to accomplish. It was even denied that the State was bound to
                        reimburse her citizens for their losses, and lastly it was argued that it
                        was too soon to commence the payment of those claims, as the war was not
                        over. The last of these objections was the only one that was ever regarded
                        as having any reason or plausibility. But happily the close of the war has
                        removed this objection. It can now be readily ascertained what the losses
                        have been, and how much money will be required to pay them. There is no
                        danger now in establishing such a precedent. No one can, at this time have
                        any just or reasonable excuse for refusing our people relief. No one who
                        respects his constitutional obligations, will attempt to do so.--But to whom
                        shall we entrust our great cause? In whom shall we confide, now that the
                        hour has come when we have a right to demand redress? There is an old
                        proverb, "if a man cheats me once it is his fault, if he cheats me twice it
                        is my fault." Let us improve the lesson of this proverb, we have been once
                        cajoled into believing that the election of a Republican to the Legislature
                        would lead to the success of of our measure. Let us not again be seduced
                        into the grave error. "Though one rose from the dead," he could not convert
                        the Republican party to the support of this bill. The party has boldly and
                        defiantly taken a position of antagonism to this bill. They have committed
                        themselves beyond recall against the measure. The experience of two winters
                        ought to be enough to convince every voter that nothing short of an entire
                        change in the administration of the State government, will suffice to make
                        the scheme of the border successful. We are amazed at the effrontery of the
                        Republican Legislative candidates, claiming the suffrage [unclear] the
                        voters of this district, upon a promise that they will be able to do what
                        strong men in their own party were utterly incapable of accomplishing.</p>
                    <p> Voters of Franklin county and sufferers of the 30th of July, be not deluded
                        by such specious pretexts. We have an abiding faith that <emph rend="italic"
                            >sooner</emph> or later the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be
                        just to all her citizens and true to the creed of its philanthropic founder.
                        But this tardy justice will never come to you until the angean stables of
                        abolitionism shall be cleansed by the Hercules of Democracy. The party that
                        has betrayed the Constitution whilst professing to do it homage can never
                        safely be entrusted with the restoration of your rights. The election of
                        republicans will but postpone the hour of your deliverance. It will bring
                        you no hope nor accomplish relief. When we in our daily walks through the
                        streets of this town, pass the paths of once happy homes and behold their
                        former owners striving with their little means to rebuild the crumbled walls
                        and to rekindle the fire upon the old hearthstone our bosoms heave with
                        indignation at the fanaticism which has wrought such ruin and our hearts
                        long with an irrepresible longing for the advent of that blesses day which
                        shall witness the restoration to power of the only party in the country that
                        has its whole political creed embodied in the noble declaration of "equality
                        among all the States of the Union, and protection to all the citizens of all
                        the States in the full enjoyment of all their rights." </p>

                    <p> Every man in Franklin county who has been plundered of his property by the
                        rebels, and every sufferer by the burning of the town of Chambersburg should
                        consider well before casting his ballot for representatives to the
                        legislature. All previous applications to the legislature for a just
                        indemnity for losses sustained through these sources, have failed through
                        the hostility of Republican members, nearly every one of whom <emph

                        favor</emph> of the righteous claim of our citizens. Such being the case,
                        can any resaonable man hope anything from the justice, or generosity, of a
                        Republican legislature?--We think by this time all should be satisfied that
                        our only prospect of success in the matter, is through a Democratic majority
                        at Harrisburg. We urge upon all to consider the matter well. If you do so,
                        we feel assured that you will cast your votes for Wm. McLellan and David L.
                        Tressler, the Democratic candidates. Mr. McLellan has been unceasing in his
                        exertions to procure compensation to our citizens for losses sustained
                        through the inability of the government to protect the border, and if
                        elected, will do all that character, zeal and ability can effect in bringing
                        about so desirable a result. </p>

                        bright. Our glorious old party is not dead, but is everywhere united, and
                        harmonious as the "happy family." On the other hand the bone of contention
                        has got among your opponents, and all is jealousy and discord.--Simon and
                        Thad flout Bill and Andy, and Andy and Bill won't trust That and Simon, and
                        so Aleck looks on in gloomy despondency, and vents his sad forebodings
                        through his <emph rend="italic">Repository</emph>, in this wise: </p>
                    <p>"Immediate and thorough organization only will save Pennsylvania this fall.
                        Our opponents are well prepared for the contest. They will poll their fall
                        vote. In the north east they will do quite as well as last year."</p>
                    <p> More than this: the Colonel admits (and he is a shrewd observer) that in the
                        counties south of the Juniata and Susquehanna and east of the Alleghenies,
                            <emph rend="italic">Shoddy can't improve the vote of last
                        October.</emph> More even than than this; he says "<emph rend="italic"

                        to 3,000 and the adjoining county of <emph rend="italic">Delawae can
                            scarcely fail to be similarly affected!</emph>" Still more: he says that
                        if the "Union strongholds"--Lancaster, Dauphin, Somerset, Bradford,
                        Susquehanna, Tioga, Erie, Crawford, Indiana, Lawrence, Allegheny,
                        &amp;c., --"<emph rend="italic">fail, as they did last year in October,
                            the State will inevitably be lost!</emph>" Lost to shoddy, he
                        means--but, oh glory, what a gain to patriotism, honesty, and every other
                        public virtue. </p>
                    <p> So up and be doing, Democrats! <emph rend="italic">One of the ablest and
                            shrewdest of your opponents admits, as above, your power to carry the
                            State!</emph> Do not let incaction wrest the victory from your grasp.
                        you have a platform in which your malignant enemies cannot pick a flaw. Upon
                        that platform you have two of the best and noblest soldiers of the war,
                        whose wounds commend them to your sympathy and gratitude, and whose
                        abilities and characters are most superior and pure. You have everything in
                        your candidates to insure success; if you only perservere and work as
                        gallantly as you did last fall. Let us all, then, go to work at once, and
                        bring about such a victory as will forever <emph rend="italic">overthrow

                    <p>You are upon the eve of a most important election.</p>
                    <p>Both political organizations have announced their platforms, and presented
                        their candidates for your suffrages.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic party distinctly affirms its support of the policy of
                        reconstruction adopted by President Johnson, and announces its opposition to
                        negro suffreage and negro equality.</p>
                    <p>Upon these, THE REAL ISSUES OF THE CANVASS, the Republican platform is
                        ambiguous, its candidates are mute, its central authority is silent.</p>
                    <p>We believe that is is your right to know their sentiments, and that they who
                        seek your support should be frank in the expression of their opinions.</p>
                    <p>Can you sustain the President by voting for those who refuse to endorse his
                        policy? Will you hazard the superiority of your race by voting for those who
                        are unwilling to proclaim their belief in the inferiority of the negro?</p>
