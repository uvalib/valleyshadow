<b>Secretary of the Interior</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Provides a brief overview of a report issued by the Secretary of the
                    Interior stating that, as of the end of last June, the federal government had
                    sold or appropriated 451,373,840 acres of land during the prior year.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The report of Secretary Harlan, of the Interior Department, opens with an
                        exhibit of the operations of the General Land Office during the fiscal year
                        ending last June. The total amount of public lands sold and appropriated
                        during that period was 451,373,846 acres. The cash receipts of the
                        government from this source, for five quarters ending September 30th, 1865,
                        were $1,038,400 78. Upon the subject of pensions (ante-rebellion), the
                        Secretary says that only two of the old heroes of the Revolution are now
                        living, to whom are paid the $300 a year provided by act of Congress. The
                        names of these survivors are William Hutchings, of Penobscot, Maine, aged
                        101 years, and Samule Cook, of Clarendon, Orleans county, New York, aged
                        ninety-nine years. With reference to the Indian Bureau, Mr. Harlan states
                        that the whole number of Indians in the States and Territories do not now
                        exceed 350,000. Their barbarism is deprecated, and suggestions made for
                        aiding in their colonization. A large business is represented in the Patent
                        Office. The numper of applications for the year ending Sept. 30, 1865, was
                        11,860, and the number of patents granted was 6,262. The Pacific railroad
                        has been progressing satisfactorily at both ends of the route.</p>

                    the contest is based upon fraudulent returns from soldiers stationed in Texas.<br>(Names in announcement:  Calvin Duncan,   McConaughy,  Robert McGaughy,   Stenger,   Rowe)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As the time for our Legislature to convene draws nigh, it may not be amiss to
                        say a few words to our readers in relation to the Senatorial contest in this
                        district.</p>
                    <p>After an election, people generally know who are elected and who defeated,
                        but seems such is not the case in the present instance. The contest is not
                        yet closed though the people gave Mr. Duncan a clear majority of twenty-five
                        votes.</p>
                    <p>The spirit of partizanship generally runs high and waxes warm as election day
                        approaches, debates are fierce and fiery.--Election day boils with political
                        heat and excitement, but when the polls close and the votes are counted, all
                        parties admit by word and deed that the contest is over--the battle lost or
                        won. And when the returns come in showing this candidate elected, and that
                        one defeated, all acquiesce and say so let it be. It is the expressed will
                        of the majority and is accepted as a fixed fact. The candidates so elected
                        go with the good wishes of all into their respective offices, and the
                        vanquished receive the sympathies of their friends. This generous and
                        magnanimous disposition thus usually manifested is truly commendible, but
                        when an unsuccessful candidate--though defeated by only a small
                        majority--contends for his election against the will of the people so
                        expressed, and by unscrupulous and even fraudulent means, seeks to thwart
                        the will of the people, and foist himself into a position which of right
                        belongs to another, he becomes an object of contempt instead of sympathy.
                        True men of all parties join in denouncing the attempt and say with one
                        voice, "let the will of the majority, as expressed at the ballot-box rule;
                        by its decision we stand and desire no appeal."</p>
                    <p>But it seems that David McConaughy, the defeated candidate for Senator, is
                        not content with the decision of the ballot, and desires an appeal--an
                        appeal to what? To the court? No! There, as at the ballot-box, he would get
                        justice. Justice is not what he is after. His appeal is to a partisan
                        Committee asking it to do for him what the people refused, give him a seat
                        in the Senate of the State.</p>
                    <p>The Return Judges of the district met on the day required by the law and
                        after counting all the votes, gave Mr. Duncan a
                        certificate of his election. Mr. McConaughy then became aware that he needed
                        a few more votes and his anxious eyes were immediately turned Texas-ward.
                        The Commissioner sent to that State to procure the ballots of the soldiers
                        there, had failed to bring any return for this district, for the reason that
                        no vote had been cast for any but State officers. Mr. McConaughy at once
                        flies from Gettysburg to Harrisburg, from Harrisburg to Philadelphia and
                        back again to Harrisburg, consulting by the way, the wise men and
                        soothsayers, distinguished individuals and party leaders; but getting no
                        relief for his uneasiness, until some mastermind among his friends,
                        suggested the Texas fraud and the process of "cooking them up" begun. In due
                        time the "Texas returns" came to hand, but like the offspring of sin and
                        shame, were without a father--the courts of justice in their kindly care of
                        the fatherless may supply the deficiency in this respect--and were left to
                        dry nurse in the Prothonotary's office. These "returns" we state
                        emphatically are forged, and can be proved false and fraudulent by the very men whose names
                        ARE APPENDED AS OFFICERS OF, AND VOTERS at the alleged election. Does Mr.
                        McConaughy presume that such returns as these will be taken as genuine and
                        counted, so as to secure him the seat? It is presuming a great deal in him
                        to ask honorable Senators to stamp with their seal of approval such
                        returns.--Men may do many things through partisan spirit, and are often made
                        to strain a point; but to indorse a fraud so base as this, is asking a
                        little two much of men laying any claim to honesty. </p>
                    <p>We are in the dark as to what furnace those returns were forged in, but are
                        confident that some of the "blowers and strikers" are to be found very near
                        home.</p>
                    <p>The fraud is so palpable that many of our Republican friends denounce it as
                        such--denounce the fraud and its authors, the forgery and the forgers. It is
                        said that McConaughy persists in that the soldiers in Texas did vote for ;
                        and that "three or four of the boys assured him that they voted for him." He
                        may possibly know more about the boys voting than we do; he certainly does
                        about the "returns."</p>
                    <p>In the contest of Col. Rowe against Mr. Stenger, Mr. Howe says he believes
                        the returns from Texas a forgery, and if he is confirmed or satisfied in
                        that opinion, he will abandon the contest. It was only in anticipation of a
                            fair vote having been cast in Texas that he
                        filed his petition. The deserter vote, he thinks--in common with every sound
                        lawyer--will be sustained and there is nothing in it on which to base a
                        contest. But it seems that to Mr. McConaughy the deserter vote is a great
                        lever. It is an awful desecration of the ballot-box to have a deserter cast
                        a vote, yet the pure and untainted Texas returns are all right. Terrible to
                        him is the thought that a soldier who fights and deserts, and then fights
                        again and is regularly discharged, should be allowed to vote! Would Mr.
                        McConaughy disfranchise soldiers who did some
                        fighting because they did not do more, and claim the right himself, who did
                        none at all? Would he disfranchise the three hundred thousand deserters from
                        our army? This would be heavy work, but we scarcely think it can be
                        successfully attempted. A defeated shoddy candidate will, like a drowning
                        man, catch at a straw, but the candidate, like a drowning man, will find
                        that a straw will scarcely bear him to port. </p>
                    <p>From the extraordinary exertions of Mr. McConaughy to get the position one
                        would suppose he had some extraordinary claim to the office. What is his
                        claim?--Is it because the people of the district want him? The vote don't
                        show it. He was "so notoriously unpopular" that his own party would never
                        have nominated him with any other intention than to "shelve" him. They did
                        shelve him; not quite so high up nor so far back as they desired, but still
                        high and far enough back for practical purposes. Does his merits lie in his
                        military achievement? The historians of the late war differ on the subject.
                        While the gallant army of the Potomac were heroically driving Lee's army
                        across the river, the gallant McConaughy armed cap-a-pie, in full uniform
                        captured a Union man, whilst attending wounded Union soldiers, dragged him
                        from his friends and family and incarcerated him in a bastile. Gallant and
                        heroic McConaughy! The deeds of valor performed by General Meade at
                        Gettysburg sank into insignificance when compared with thine. Is it his
                        honesty? Respectfully referred to Robert McGaughy.</p>

                    calling on the government to confirm the land titles granted by General Sherman
                    to the former slaves of the Sea Islands. Two days later, a bill was presented
                    requiring the Judiciary Committee to inquire whether any inhabitants of the
                    former Confederate states are entitled to compensation for damages committed by
                    U.S. troops. And on Dec.15th, the House resolved that "no representatives from
                    any of the late Confederate States shall be admitted to a seat until Congress
                    shall declare such State entitled to representation."<br>

<b>Local and Personal--The Normal School</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Declares that the meeting of the Normal School Board reflects the depth of
                    the town's cultural and learning institutions, which have rebounded remarkably
                    since Chambersburg's near destruction in 1864.<br>(Names in announcement:  F. M. Kimmel,  B. S. Schneck, Esq. J. W. Douglas,  Jason Hamilton,  J. Henninger,  A. McElwain,  W. H. Hockenberry)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The meeting held at the Court House on Saturday evening last was highly
                        creditable to the spirit of our Borough. Chambersburg, robbed, burnt, and
                        almost crushed out of being, rises majestically from its ruins, determined
                        to more than repair the wanton destruction of its material prosperity and
                        its literary institutions. The flourishing Academy and Female Seminary of
                        our town were not among the least of our losses. We mean not only the
                        buildings but the Schools.--The advantages of a flourishing literary
                        Institution in our vicinity cannot be too highly appreciated. To be able to
                        educate our sons and daughters without sending them to distant points, to
                        miss their pleasant faces in the domestic circle and to be unable to
                        administer to their comfort, when a fevered brow or aching head would make
                        home of all things most desirable, are considerations which the affectionate
                        parent dwells upon with anxiety.</p>
                    <p>For the information of our citizens in regard to the Educational advantages
                        offered in Normal Schools we append the following section of the Act of
                        Assembly in relation to Normal Schools. We refer the reader to the School
                        Law for full information on this subject.</p>
                    <p>Section cxxix.--Each School shall have at least Six Professors of liberal
                        education and known ability in their respective departments, namely: One of
                        Orthography, Reading and Elocution; one of Writing, Drawing and Book
                        Keeping; one of Arithmatics; one of Geography and History; one of Grammar
                        and English Literature; and one of Theory and practice of Teaching, together
                        with such Professors of Natural, Mental and Moral Science, Languages and
                        Literature as the condition of the School and the number of Students may
                        require.</p>
                    <p>We hope the honorable Committee appointed at the meeting, will be encouraged
                        and cheered in their work by an appreciative and liberal reception by our
                        citizens.</p>
