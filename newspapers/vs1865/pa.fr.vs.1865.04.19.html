<b>The Murder of the President</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes a solemn reaction in Chambersburg to the news that President
                    Lincoln had been assassinated.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The news of the murder of President Lincoln was received in this place on
                        Saturday morning last, and was so astounding as to seem almost incredible.
                        The news spread with great rapidity, causing universal gloom and sorrow. The
                        Chief Burgess at once issued a recommendation that all business be suspended
                        and that the bells be tolled from 11 o'clock for the rest of the day. In the
                        evening a meeting of citizens was held in the Methodist Church, at which
                        arrangements were made, to give a fitting expression to the public sentiment
                        at this great national calamity. The several churches, on the Sabbath, were
                        clothed in sable drapery and the services were of the most solemn and
                        imposing character. All the sufferings of our citizens since the outbreaking
                        of the rebellion, are as nothing, compared with this last crushing
                        affliction, by which the whole nation suffers.</p>
