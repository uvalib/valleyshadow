<b>The Conspirators</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprimands President Johnson for his decision to try the conspirators
                    involved in Lincoln's death in a military court, in spite of the fact that the
                    war has ended. As a result, the article asserts that the "community at large"

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In reaction to criticism leveled by the Repository, which asserts that the
                    Spirit has become "more Union than Union men themselves," the Democratic organ

                        no disposition to crowd him out, but on the contrary, will make room for

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A MEETING of persons who have belonged to the army, was held recently in New
                        York, to organize an association for political purposes, under the title of
                        the "United Service Society." The objects of the society are to organize a
                        separate party from either of the two in existence, which shall cast its
                        vote for the candidate which it deems to be of most advantage to its
                        purposes. Gen. Warren officiated as President. Among the resolutions
                        adopted, the two following are the most significant:</p>
                    <p>8. That the time has come when the application of martial law and trial
                        before military courts should cease wherever civil law and government exists
                        under the authority of a loyal State of the Federal Government, excepting as
                        to persons in the military and naval service of the United States. 9. That
                        the interest of the industrial classes demand an equalization of the
                        taxation which shall bear alike upon all and specially upon none; and that
                        no particular kinds of property, whether it be government securities or
                        otherwise, should be exempted from the burdens which we all owe to a common

<b>Huge Standing Army To Be Kept</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Speculation in Washington indicates that a huge standing army will be
                    maintained in the wake of the war. It is envisioned that the cost to maintain
                    the troops will not be less than $175 million annually, a sum that is sure to
                    dismay and anger citizens already burdened by high taxes.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Advices from Washington say that the regular army, or permanent military
                        organization of the country will be organized upon the following basis:</p>
                    <p>General officers-One General, five Lieutenant Generals, fifty Major Generals,
                        and seventy-five Brigadier Generals. The regular army proper to be composed
                        of nineteen regiments of infantry, six regiments of cavalry and five
                        regiments of artillery, all filled up to the maximum number; besides these,
                        fifty thousand colored troops will be retained with the regiments filled up
                        to the maximum number.</p>
                    <p>Hancock's corps will be increased to a full corps of three divisions, about
                        thirty thousand men. The veteran reserve corps, twenty-five regiments filled
                        up to the maximum number.</p>
                    <p>The medical staff will be increased to one hundred full surgeons, with a
                        corresponding number of assistant surgeons.</p>
                    <p>The infantry and cavalry regiments of the regular army comprise three
                        battallions of eight hundred men each.</p>
                    <p>Under the proposed arrangements the total strength of the army will be nearly
                        as follows: Regular infantry, 45,000; regular cavalry, 14,400; regular
                        artillery, 12,000; colored troops, 50,000; Hancock's corps, 30,000; veteran
                        reserve corps, 25,000--total, 177,000 men.</p>
                    <p> The cost of keeping up such a huge standing army as that will not be less
                        than one hundred and seventy-five million dollars
                            annually. The people will not submit to be taxed to raise that
                        amount for a single day longer than they believe it to be absolutely
                        necessary. Indeed it will be hard to convince them that any such burthen
                        upon the industry and the wealth of the ocuntry is at all necessary even
                        now. They know very well that our volunteer system will supply any needed
                        number of soldiers at ten days notice, if the emergency should demand it.
                        Would it not be wise then to reduce the propsed standing army one-half, or
                        even more, at the same time to arrange for reducing it still further at the
                        earlierst period possible. The people of this country will never support a
                        large standing army in time of peace. </p>

<b>Three Theories</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the article, there are three possible solutions for the
                    readmittance of the states formerly in rebellion. The first, President Johnson's
                    model for Reconstruction, proposes appointing provisional governors to guide the
                    restoration process and allows individual states to decide whether to permit
                    black suffrage. The second is the "Radical Abolition theory," which contends
                    that Congress should determine when the Confederate states have become
                    sufficiently repentant to rejoin the Union. And the third alternative, the
                    "Democratic and true Constitutional theory," posits that the states should
                    simply be readmitted, "with all their rights unimpaired," once the authority of
                    the Constitution has been restored.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> In the development of events, three theories appear to loom up as to the
                        restoration of the Union. President Johnson proposes to restore the States
                        by rebuilding or remodeling through the appointment of Provisional
                        Governors, who shall say, by instructions received, who shall be the future
                        electors of these States. They reconstruct the States de
                            novo [unclear]. After these States are so formed they may say
                        whether negro suffrage may exist or not. </p>
                    <p>The Radical Abolition theory is that the seceded States are out of the Union
                        and must be re-admitted upon such terms and conditions as Congress shall
                        prescribe, and as they now have the majority in Congress, this will enable
                        them to regulate their admission and institutions as they may prescribe.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic and true Constitutional theory is that the rebellion having
                        subsided and the authority of the Constitution being restored, the States
                        remain, with all their rights unimpaired, under the Constitution of the
                        United States and all that can be necessary, therefore, is for these States
                        to place themselves into their former practical relation in the Union. This
                        latter is certainly in accordance with the unanimous resolution of both
                        houses of Congress as passed in July, 1861, and for which President Johnson
                        must have voted, as he was then inthe United States Senate. The resolution
                        is as follows:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That this war is not waged on our part
                        in any spirit of oppression, or for any purpose of conquest, or interfering
                        with the rights or established insitutions of the States, but to defend and
                        maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and to preserve the Union with
                        all the dignity and rights of the several States unimpaired--and that as
                        soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease. </p>
                    <p>The difference in these theories is that the first is a concentration of
                        power in the hands of the President; the second, in Congress, and the last
                        leaves the States in the hands of the people under the Constitution of the
                        United States.</p>

<b>Reconstruction</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Applauds President Johnson for appointing southerners to administer the
                    Reconstruction governments, in spite of northern protestations. Taken from a
                    Republican journal, the article contends that individuals who complain the most

                    <p>President Johnson shows excellent wisdom in appointing loyal Southern men to
                        official positions int he South. Those Northern citizens who think the
                        safety of the country depends on their getting such places and enriching
                        themselves by speculations in cotton and tobacco are naturally much
                        aggrieved, and will be among the loudest howlers of the new radical
                        opposition. But the country is satisfied. Everybody sees that nothing could
                        tend more to perpetuate the alienation of the Southern people than to send a
                        lot of greedy Northerners to rule over and plunder them. The disappointment
                        and vexation of such men is the cief secret of the present hullabaloo

                    <p>BEAUFORT, S.C., July 1, 1865.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--At last writing I was at
                        Richmond, and was loth to leave it. --Reared among huckleberry bushes, wild
                        flowers and stately oaks, I was taught to love nature. The handsome shade
                        trees, shrubbery and vines of Richmond made it like home. I left there on
                        Monday, June 26, on the Thos. Collyer, for Fortress Monroe, and after the
                        necessary red tape maneuvering there, I was placed on board the tug Gen. McClellan and run out the Roads to the Empire, which was to sail for Brazos the same
                        evening. Owing to a stiff gale, we lay in the Roads till Tuesday morning.
                        This is the last vessel but one of the Texas Expedition. We have on board 64
                        horses, about 35 colored soldiers and 5 officers--with water, forage,
                        rations, &amp;c. Our vessel is a steam propeller with three masts, and
                        is by no means a good one. Until we passed Cape Hatteras we were in sight of
                        land, but after that I saw only the rolling waves. Of all the disagreeable
                        things I ever experienced, the first two days on the ocean was the most.
                        Talk of riding in a stage coach over mountains, getting off an Ale spree, or
                        settling up your last boarding bill, none of them compare to sea-sickness.
                        The vessel rolled and rocked, moving like a "see-saw" until my head sounded
                        like a machine shop. We have been on shore for 20 hours and still my head is
                        swimming, in and out doors, although I have been thoroughly cured of
                        sea-sickness. On the eve of the second day we put on full sail and the
                        vessel became steady which was the first of my cure. I saw hundreds of hog
                        fish three and four feet long, shooting along the top of the water, ever and
                        anon jumping up two or three feet out of the water. Lt. Oviatt dispersed a
                        "school" of them instantly by shooting at one. </p>
                    <p>After a voyage of 74 hours from Fortress Monroe we landed at Port Royal, S.C.
                        to coal up. The place afforded no facilities for coaling and we were obliged
                        to run up here, 15 or 20 miles for that purpose. Port Royal is a place of no
                        real importance--a small military point, garrisoned chiefly by colored
                        troops.</p>
                    <p> Arrived at Beaufort, S.C., I started out to see the city. Population about
                        2,500, chiefly colored. There are only a few good houses here, but the shade
                        trees make it a perfect picture. The squares are regular, and at regular
                        intervals of about twelve paces shade trees are planted, such as sycamore,
                        live oak, weeping willow, a species of ash and wild plum, &amp;c., on
                        both sides of the street. If half the care had been taken to build regularly
                        as was taken to plant, Beaufort would be a perfect Eden. The 32d, 104th,
                        128th U.S.C.T., and two batteries are doing duty here. Col. Baird's, 22d
                        Regt. was recruited at Philadelphia, and in it I found a number of
                        Mercersburg men. The residents here possess some mechanical enterprise, but
                        a more independent, impudent race I never saw. The soldiers are a glorious
                        exception, dressing tidily, speaking in mannerly and assuming a soldierly
                        bearing. I think favorably of the colored soldiers. The intelligence of the
                        people is unquestionable. At a saloon having for
                        its sign "Soder Warter, Buiskit and Yanky Cakes," I stopped to get a small
                        plate of ice cream at 25 cents, and a claret punch at 30 cents. Watermelons,
                        green corn, apples, &amp;c., are plenty in market. </p>

                    <p>We sail to-day intending to coal again at Key West, Florida, and stop no more
                        till we reach Brazos, on the Rio Grande. I learn from one of the officers
                        aboard that we shall hardly have a mail for two months. More anon.</p>

                    <p>This is the only delegation that has appeared in Washington from South
                        Carolina having anything like a representative character; and this was
                        confessedly disloyal. Yet they received the impression from the President
                        that the work of "restoration," since that is the word he prefers, would be
                        practically entrusted to their hands. Dr. Mackay, representing the decisive
                        Union element, of which he was always a solitary representative, came to
                        Washington, but it was not to ask for a governorship. Dr. Crowly presented
                        to the President the compliments of those who were in favor of colored
                        suffrage there; but it was only to ask for the privilege of free discussion,
                        which had thus far been denied to them. Only those who had a hand in the
                        rebellion have been publicly consulted on the subject of the future
                        political relations of the State to the Union. In this respect South
                        Carolina is not an exception. Neither Governor Holden, nor Judge Sharkey,
                        nor Judge Parsons, nor Governor Johnson had a clear record, or could take
                        the oath required by the laws without perjury.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Friday, the 30th ult., at Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
                        rendered a decision that the act of the Legislature, passed April 25th,
                        1864, authorizing the levying of a bounty tax to raise volunteers, by
                        township and corporate authorities, was in accordance with the State
                        constituion and legal. The question arose originally in a suit started in
                        Indiana county, where the lower court decided the act to be legal. It was
                        thence carried up to the Supreme Court, where it was argued by some of the
                        most eminent legal talent in the Commonwealth, and after a long interval, a
                        majority of the judges have rendered the decision mentioned.</p>
                    <p>This case has been watched with more interest perhaps, than any brought
                        before our courts. Upon its issue millions of dollars were pending, and
                        there is scarcely a township which is not affected by the decision. Many
                        persons have refused to pay their bounty tax until the case had been fully
                        tested, and they will now be compelled to settle with the collector without
                        further delay.</p>
                    <p>The Court in this case, as in a number of others, since the war commenced,
                        divided according to partizan sympathies. The two Democratic judges,
                        Woodward and Thompson, gave opinions contrary to the legality of the act;
                        the two Republican judges, Reed and Agnew, pronounced it entirely
                        constitutional; and Justice Strong, who was elected by the Democrats to the
                        place he occupies, but who has in all political issues during the rebellion,
                        co-operated with the Republicans, cast his decision alongside of Reed and
                        Agnew, as was predicted.</p>
