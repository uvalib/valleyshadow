<b>Vondooism in Mobile--Old Superstition Revived</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Details the rites of a voodun ceremony performed in Mobile. Although the
					authorities in New Orleans outlawed the religion and persecuted its adherents
					during the antebellum era, voodun continues to be practiced in the Gulf region.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Mobile Tribune</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>In the good old days of Louisiana, when Lafitte was doing his quiet little
						business along the lake shore, and Barataria was synonymous with the Isle of
						Pines, when gens d'armes stood on the corners of
						the streets of New Orleans, and watchmen with club and rattle and leather
						cap, were not--in those good old days Vondooism was religiously believed in
						by all the negro population, and by not a few of those whose color should
						have been a warranty of more intelligence. For years past the infernal rites
						of this dark superstition have been conducted near New Orleans, only at long
						intervals and with the utmost secresy. The police succeeded, in one
						instance, some twelve years since, in making a clean haul of the negroes,
						including the principal Fetish Man, old Obi Woman--natives of Africa--and
						all the charms, &amp;c., used in the incantations. The negroes were
						severely punished, and the chock given to the practice and rites of the
						superstition. </p>
					<p>We have heard of such scenes as, those being enacted in or near Mobile by the
						negroes, but never till last night did we witness any thing of the kind in
						this city. In company with a few policemen we went to a house situated
						beyond the gas works, and occupied by an old negro who claims to be on Obi
						man. Approaching the house very carefully, and peering through the crevices
						in the walls, a wild weird spectacle was presented. Around a small fire of
						pine in the middle of the floor--or room, for the floor there was none--and
						over which was hung a cot, sat a group of negro men and women entirely
						naked; their hair or wool twisted in to pig tail curls and ornamented with
						sprigs of some kind of herb, intermingled with dried roots, their eyes
						closed; the master of ceremonies or High Fetish Priest, with a snake skin
						around his neck, and his wool grizzled with age and garnished more profusely
						than the rest, was chanting something in a droning voice, while the
						remainder of the "congregation" responded, as it were, with a low and
						long-drawn howl.--The old negro with the snake skin clapped his hands and
						the whole rose and commenced a most furious stamping around the pot.</p>
					<p>This being over, they all squatted down again, and the "Obi - man" resumed
						his chant, at the same time holding in his hand a covered basket, from which
						he drew and dropped into the pot--first a dead snake, next a frog, then a
						young alligator or lizard, and last of all the herbs and roots from his own
						and the hands of other negroes. Silence was observed by all for some minutes
						after the last deposit had been made, after which the pot was taken from the
						fire, and while the nauseating mixture was yet reeking hot, they each dipped
						the end of the middle finger of the left hand into it, and applied the ends
						of their fingers to their tongues. Another dip in to the pot was taken with
						the middle finger of the right hand, and certain cabalistic gestures
						described on the breasts, foreheads and shoulders--one assisting the other
						in the operation.--Not a word was spoken until their clothes had been
						resumed and they had got clear of the house.</p>
					<p>Although on high occasions the Fetish or "Obi man" may demand a human
						sacrifice in his inhuman rites, and, which sacrifice is generally a young
						child, nothing of the kind was attempted in the Vondoo-bow-wow of last
						night. The presence of the police would, of course, have prevented anything
						of this nature, had it ever been thought necessary by the old negro
						conducting the affair. Old negro women were sometimes "used up" as
						"material" in these meetings at Vondooton, near New Orleans, one of whom
						escaped the sacrificial knife on one occasion, and caused the arrest of the
						whole gang.</p>

<b>Progress of Pacification</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Lauds the pace of reform in the South, proclaiming the President's
					reunification policy a success.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Despite the preconcerted misrepresentation of the conditions of the affairs
						at the South which are so industriously circulated by the employed agents of
						Radicalism, the President's plan of restoration appears to work noiselessly
						and so far without any serious interruption. That causes for complaint, and
						criticism may be found in a great many localities, too, over so vast an
						extent of country, was naturally to be expected. It is to be considered,
						says the Boston Post, that the triumph of the
						Government in this gigantic struggle implied immediate submission on the
						part of the people of the South in the first place, and, secondly, a sudden
						and entire change of their personal relations to a race living among them
						till now as servants and chattels, and numbering nearly one-half what they
						did themselves. This amounted to a complete and thorough revolution in their
						social life and character, to say nothing of the unexpected blasting of
						their hopes of political independence. </p>
					<p>But making rational allowances for these things in a comprehensive an just
						view of the matter, we honestly believe that more persons are surprised at
						this alacrity of the South in accepting its duties and place once more than
						at, any symptoms of hanging back, much less of sullenness and traculeuey,
						which only makes her present example of all the more value. South Carolina
						is represented on good authority to be equally well disposed with
						Mississippi, while Florida and Alabama appear even in advance.</p>
					<p>The people of the South manifest almost instinctively a strong feeling of
						confidence in President Johnson, as if they needed not to be told that he
						understood the character of the dismal swamp into which a futile attempt at
						secession has driven them. They seem to believe that he knows their
						condition and entertains a genuine sympathy for them in it. That belief of
						itself would tend to soften a great many asperities toward the Union. And in
						that single view, born and bred as he was among the people of the South, his
						occupation of the Presidential chair at this critical time excites the
						reflection that it is providential. He displays firmness and caution in
						combination. With all his resoluteness he is patient.-His intrepidity does
						not cloud his sense of justice. It is well for the country, at a time when
						more rests on the shoulders of one man that an any previous period in our
						history, that such a character was placed at that point where the vast
						weight of responsibility rests. A weaker man would yield and break down; his
						native robustness holds up the whole frame of the present political action.</p>
					<p>It is, so say the least, a serious imputation on the motives and conduct of
						men, no matter who they are or what place they occupy, that they are so
						industrious in picking out all facts and rumors, great and small, that can
						be made to tell against the intentions of the Southern people, and in giving
						them as wide publicity as possible.-Common fairness demands that both sides shall have a hearing. There is something
						very different from the true patriotism in such conduct; and as for the
						larger love of freedom indicated by a practice of such a character, it is a
						freedom of which most men would prefer to be entirely clear. It is the
						pettiness of a most contemptible partizanship, that would peril the peace
						and happiness of a nation for sake of keeping its self-seeking little
						organization together.-Such men will be forced to admit to the progress
						which is making in the restoration in the end; but their perverseness will
						keep back the confession until it shall first have wrought their own
						confusion, and shown them up before the public as unworthy of their
						confidence or respect.</p>

<b>The Result</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Although the recent elections in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, and Pennsylvania
					failed to produce the Democrats' desired results, according to the article, the
					party's future remains bright. Pointing out that the Republicans in Pennsylvania
					and Ohio sidestepped the issue of black suffrage in an effort to retain the
					support of the "thousands who would have deserted their cause had [the party]
					hoisted the negro equality flag," it asserts the next Congress "will develop the
					real position" of the party.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The recent elections in Pennsylnania, Ohio, Indiana and Iowa, while they have
						not resulted as we could have wished, are in the main by no means
						discouraging. Indeed, if heavy reductions of the former large Republican
						majorities mean anything, the result is highly cheering. In Pennsylvania and
						Ohio the Republicans dodged the most important issues between the
						parties-the negro suffrage question-and thus succeeded in retaining the
						support of thousands who would have deserted their cause, had they hoisted
						the negro equality flag.-As the Democratic press and the Democratic
						conventions were almost unanimous in their indorsement of President
						Johnson's reconstruction and conciliatory policy-the ver policy advocated by
						the Democratic party ever since the war began-and as the Republicans
						ostensibly supported the same views, the declared
						issues were narrowed down to almost as imperceptible difference. So
						far then as the Administration is concerned, which party has lost in an election thus indorsing President Johnson, yet remains to be seen. So far the Democratic party
						have nothing to complain of. When either takes issue with the policy of
						reconstruction and anti-negro equality, as supported by the Administration,
						the question of difference will come fairly before the people. The next
						Congress will develop the real position of the Republican party, and show
						whether it has come to our principles or not.
						Till then the Democracy can afford no wait.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Since the close of the war many of the best lands in the State of Virginia
						are being thrown upon the market. Many of the owners have become
						impoverished to a great extent during the progress of the war, and now that
						it is ended, are unable to restore the ravages which it occasioned.
						Particularly is this the case in the valley of the Shenandoah, which during
						the past four years has been ravaged by friend and foe, having been
						literally swept by fire. Of this valley Mr. James Black of Washington city,
						in letter to a friend in Scotland, published in the Glasgow Herald of the 2d of the August, 1865, says: </p>
					<p>"On the 20th of June I was sent on a tour of inspection through the States of
						Maryland and Virginia, to make an examination of the country, state of
						agriculture, and the probably value of the lands. I first visited the
						Shenandoah Valley in Western Virginia. This valley lies between the Blue
						Ridge and North Mountain. Its length is nearly one hundred and fifty miles,
						and its breadth from eight to ten miles, with beautiful rolling land on the
						banks for the river, and stretching far up the side of the mountains on each
						side. This whole valley has been traversed by both armies five times, so
						that everything has been destroyed that would destroy. It is of the finest
						soil I have ever had a foot on, and somewhat resembles that around Dunbar,
						in East Lothian; but with the advantage of this climate, is more valuable
						even that East Lothian. Transportation from here to the principal markets of
						the country, both by water and rail, is cheap and easy."</p>
					<p>The farmers of Pennsylvania, knowing the surpassing richness of this lovely
						valley, are now crowding into "the Old Dominion" in search of investments
						for their capital, and homes for themselves and families in that garden spot
						of the Union. Almost daily numbers of them pass though Hagerstown on their
						way to Virginia for their purpose. There is nowhere in the broad and a
						people superior to our Pennsylvania farmers in all those elements of
						character which go to make up a good citizen and a honest man. And the
						settlement of a considerable number of them in Virginia will soon again make
						that sorely stricken land, bloom and blossom with prosperity and beauty. Our
						Virginia neighbors will find in them a people who will prove a valuable
						acquisition to the material prosperity of their State in the development of
						the producing capacity of its lands.</p>
