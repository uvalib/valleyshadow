<b>The War Over -- What Then?</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Predicts that the Republican party is feeling a loss now that the war is
                    over and it no longer can use the military to impose its power on the people.<br>

                    <p>The effect, upon parties, of the end of the war is beginning to be much
                        discussed. The Abolitionists cannot but feel that, with the end of the war,
                        must come a terrible shock to their power as a party. They know that it must
                        at once cut off from them hundreds of thousands whose pecuniary interest
                        alone led them to sustain an administration that was profitable, and who,
                        contracts being unattainable, and the myriads of forms which executive
                        patronage can assume only in time of war being no longer available, will
                        abandon the party to which they have for four years been giving a purchased
                        and heartless support. The war has given the party now dominant, engines all
                        powerful for the crushing of its political opponents. These engines will be
                        no longer available, or even have existence, when the strife shall cease.
                        The Abolitionists, while the war lasted, could absolutely control the ballot
                        boxes. They could call to their aid the influence of military officers upon
                        Democratic soldiers in the field, compelling the latter, whose comfort, and
                        even whose lives were at the mercy of their superiors in the military rank,
                        to suppress their own sentiments, or even to assume the political notions of
                        those superiors--which superiors were controlled in turn for their
                        dependence upon an Abolition administration for military promotion. This
                        element of strength will be destroyed by the return of peace. The vast
                        armies of political spies, mouchards, government
                        detectives, provost marshals, deputy provost marshals, deputy-deputies,
                        commissioners of drafts, enrolling officers, recruiting officers, examining
                        surgeons, inspectors of horses, inspectors of mules, inspectors of every
                        conceivable thing used in the army, agents to buy and agents to sell,
                        fellows between the two latter in complicity to both and making "good
                        things" out of their jobs, the swarms of officials connected with the
                        machinery by which trade was regulated between "loyal," insurgent and
                        semi-insurgent communities, confiscation agents, additional turnkeys to the
                        densely populated bastiles, petty lords of military hospitals all over the
                        land, dilapidated preachers of easy virtue who had calls to "support the
                        government," not particularly by preaching or praying, but by pocketing with
                        commendable regularity the salaries of the chaplaincies--all these, and
                        thousands upon thousands of others not enumerated, could be relief upon
                        always to labor diligently for the success of the party from whom they had
                        their daily bread, well buttered. All that is over now--if the war be really
                        ended.</p>
                    <p>Just so soon as the Abolition party shall be stripped of the power to bribe,
                        to intimidate, to force acquiescence in their monstrous wrongs, will come
                        their doom; and when they shall be obliged, unsustained by the agencies of
                        which we have spoken, to confront the disenthralled people at the polls, God
                        pity them!</p>
                    <p>Democrats might well rejoice to witness the close of the war. Bonfires,
                        illuminations, bell ringings, the loud booming of artillery, would but
                        inad[e]quately express their joy at the prospect of restored vitality to the
                        will of the governed.--Age.</p>

<b>Religion and the Government</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the President's decision to allow Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, an
                    outspoken abolitionist, to speak at the raising of the United States flag over
                    Fort Sumter, South Carolina.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If anybody thinks the American government has no righteous bias, he is most
                        egregiously mistaken. It seeks to appear neutral, but it is not difficult to
                        discern which way it leans. Its religion, however, is of a very utilitarian
                        character. It compliments most those churches or religious bodies, which
                        serve its interest best according to its notion. Those bodies which have
                        thrown themselves most cordially into the worldly current receive its chief
                        attention. And it seems meet that they should thus have their reward.</p>
                    <p>We notice in a recent order from the President, that the United States flag
                        is to be erected over Fort Sumter, Charleston harbor, with imposing
                        ceremonies. This is all right. That flag deserves to be honored on the spot
                        where treason first trailed it in the dust. To this there can be no
                        objection. But it is also ordered, that Rev. Henry Ward Beecher shall be
                        invited to deliver an address on the occasion. We suspected that something
                        like this would take place, when it was reported, a short time ago, that
                        Henry Ward was closeted with the President, in Washington. It was given out
                        also, at the time, that said Reverend gentleman expressed a desire to preach
                        the gospel (?) in Charleston, as soon as it should fall into the hands of
                        our forces. No doubt some such desire was expressed to the President, and,
                        as a result, Mr. Beecher is now invited to deliver an address on the
                        occasion referred to.</p>
                    <p>The order seems to us to be in bad taste. It looks like a taunt to the South.
                        It is not usual to call clergymen from the sacred desk to deliver orations
                        on such occasions. It is known that Henry Ward Beecher is most obnoxious to
                        the people of the South. To parade him before a fallen foe does not seem to
                        argue either great courage or magnanimity. If Mr. Beecher wishes to preach
                        tot he people of that fallen city, let him go and preach. But why should the
                        government select him for such a mission? Is his Christianity the purest and
                        the best? Does the government intend to express its partiality for his
                        system and creed? What is the object?</p>
                    <p>There is something grand and inspiring in the elevation of the old flag over
                        the ruins of Sumter, by Gen. Anderson. But that the occasion should be
                        improved by a stump speech from Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, seems to us a
                        descent from the sublime to the ridiculous.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since the taking of Richmond, the capture of Mobile and the surrender to
                        General Sherman of the army under command of General Johnson, it must have
                        become apparent to every one that the great rebellion, which for four years
                        has deluged our country with fraternal blood, and placed in jeopardy the
                        very existence of free government, has at length received its death blow.
                        The government set up by those in rebellion has been dispersed, its
                        President a fugitive, its finances broken down beyond repair, and its armies
                        utterly defeated and destroyed. With no organized force in the field, with
                        the exception of the army of Kirby Smith, west of the Mississippi, the
                        rebellion may be considered as crushed--dead beyond resurrection. The
                        military power has thus effected all that it can do towards the restoration
                        of the Union, and other agencies must now be invoked to restore the country
                        to its former condition of unity and prosperity.</p>
                    <p>Many of the questions which have agitated and divided public opinion in the
                        Northern States during the progress of the rebellion, have ceased to have
                        any practical importance, whilst the continued discussion of others, yet of
                        interest to the people, can result in effecting no good purpose. The
                        emancipation policy of the party now control[l]ing the destinies of the
                        country, is fixed and determined, and no amount of opposition can change or
                        alter it during the continuance of that party in power. The Democracy have
                        warmly and persistently opposed this policy ever since its inauguration.
                        They have opposed it for the reason that it was in manifest violation of the
                        Constitution of the country, and in the belief that a continuance in it
                        would retard, instead of hasten, the suppression of the rebellion and the
                        restoration of the authority of the government over the rebellious States.
                        They believed, and still believe, that a continuance in that policy to the
                        end to which its advocates confidently expect it to lead, namely: the
                        elevation of the negro to a position of social and political equality with
                        the white man, will prove a curse instead of a blessing to the black as well
                        as to the white race; but inasmuch as its adherents will retain power for
                        the next four years, during which period its bad or good results will have
                        been fully developed, further active opposition can do no good and may as
                        well be abandoned; it may therefore for the present, be considered a dead
                        issue. The war being now practically at an end, the best mode of conducting
                        it can no longer be a subject of controversy. Thus these old grounds of
                        difference lose their importance and new and delicate issues claim public
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>The administration of President Johnson in its work of restoration, will
                        necessarily have many subjects of difficulty to meet. Subjects fraught with
                        important consequences to the country. He has as yet made no declaration of
                        the policy which will govern him in the duties of his position, but promises
                        to deal with questions as they arise and make his policy known by his acts.
                        That he will [be] disposed to punish with severity the instigators and
                        leaders of the rebellion, is most certain, but that he will be lenient and
                        conciliatory to their deluded followers, the masses of the Southern people,
                        is equally beyond doubt. His course, however, in this respect, is only of
                        importance to us in its bearing on the difficult and delicate work of
                        re-constructing, re-organizing and restoring the seceded States to their
                        position in the Union. The policy which will govern in this great work is a
                        matter of great interest to the people of the country at this time, as on it
                        will depend the permanency of peace and the future prosperity of our country
                        and people. For our part we are hopeful, and are disposed to believe that
                        his course will meet general approval and be conducive to the best interests
                        of all.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson is emphatically a man of the people. Born and raised in the
                        South, there is, perhaps, no public man who so well understands the temper
                        and views of the people of that section, or can
                        make better use of those influences on which reliance must be placed, to
                        convince the larger portion of the Southern population that their true
                        interests are adverse to those of the men who excited the rebellion. To
                        secure the cooperation of the Southern people in the work of
                        re-construction, would seem to us less difficult under a southern man of Mr.
                        Johnson's stamp, than under any other, and hence we deem it fortunate that
                        such a man was in a position to succeed our murdered President in the
                        administration of the government at such a critical conjuncture in the
                        affairs of the country. The intellectual ability and force of character
                        possessed by him, and displayed in every position which he has occupied,
                        leave no room to doubt his capacity to fill the high position devolved upon
                        him with credit to himself and his democratic training. He was born and
                        raised a Democrat, and we much doubt if those principles of democracy,
                        imbibed in youth and strengthened in manhood, have lost their hold upon him
                        and given place to their opposites. In the settlement of many questions of
                        the most vital importance to the interests of the people which will arise
                        during his administration, we expect to see his native democracy cropping
                        out and asserting itself. We feel assured that the day of New England's
                        ascendency in the councils of the nation is fast passing away, and that the
                        administration of President Johnson will be more in accordance with the
                        views of the people of the Middle and Western States than of those who have
                        so long ruled us with a high hand. Truly this is a consummation devoutly to
                        be wished. In the new era upon which the country has entered, the path of
                        duty to the Democracy is a plain one. In the future, as in the past, they
                        will make every sacrifice of treasure and blood to sustain the government in
                        its efforts to suppress treason and rebellion, and yield a willing obedience
                        to every Constitutional act tending to that end. During the progress of the
                        fearful contest, which for four long years has convulsed the country, they
                        have pursued the even tenor of their way in this path regardless of the
                        malignant slanders, and the bitter persecutions of their political enemies.
                        On every battle-field of the republic thousands of its adherents have sealed
                        their devotion to their country with their blood and attested the patriotism
                        of the good old party.</p>

                        Democrats. If in the progress of events under the new administration, its

                        fearlessly, not however in a factious spirit, but with a view to is change
                        or abandonment.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The day set apart for the obseq[u]ies of the late President in the city of
                        Washington was observed by our citizens in a manner befitting the mournful
                        occasion. All business was suspended and the solemn deportments of our
                        people during the day evinced that they fully participated in the feelings
                        of grief caused by the atrocious crime by which the Chief Magistrate of the
                        nation was cut off at a most critical conjuncture of public affairs. Nearly
                        every residence, office, workshop and dwelling in the town was draped with
                        the sombre emblems of mourning. Sadness appeared to pervade the entire
                        community and every countenance wore the impress of grief at the loss of a
                        friend. The interior of the different places of worship were appropriately
                        clothed in black and at 12 o'clock, services of the most solemn and
                        impressive character were had in each. In the afternoon a procession of the
                        Military, Fire Companies, the different benevolent Associations and citizens
                        generally was formed which after passing through the principal streets
                        halted at the Depot where an eloquent and appropriate address was delivered
                        by C.S. Eyster, Esq., the orator selected for the occasion by the committee
                        of arrangements. During the progress of the procession through the streets
                        minute guns were fired by a battery of artillery and the toll of the church
                        bells added solemnity to the display.</p>
                    <p>It is with pleasure that we chronicle the fact that not a single instance of
                        disorder occurred during the entire day. Every one seemed fully impressed
                        with the solemnity of the time and deported themselves accordingly.</p>
