<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>(Delivered before the Republican State Convention of Massachusetts.)</p>
                    <p> "With all these evidences of disloyalty to the Government, of injustice to
                        loyal black men, hate to the loyal white, of clinging to the dead carcass of
                        the Confederacy, of incompatibility of habit, of thought, and ideas of
                        government with the loyal States clustering around us, are not our judgments convinced and reason constrained to the
                            conclusion that reconstruction at the present time, and on the present
                            basis, of necessity must be and is a fallacy?" </p>
                    <p> Respectfully referred to President Johnson, who knows that reconstruction "on the present basis" and "at the present
                        time" is not a failure. </p>
                    <p>"Can we doubt that, this being apparent, a loyal and patriotic President and
                        Congress will devise means by which these rebellious States will be held, as
                        in fact they are, conquered territory, captured in public war."</p>
                    <p>Suppose they should do so, is it likely that--</p>
                    <p>"The soothing hand of time acting upon the present inhabitants and emigration
                        from from the North and abroad, shall have formed communities at the South
                        ignoring the traditions of the past, acting upon new ideas, with a love and
                        pride in the Union glowing in their hearts; with a civilization and system
                        of labor in consonance with those of the North; ready, willing, fit and
                        desirous of forming political connections with loyal States, and making,
                        indeed, that which our fathers formed, a 'Union of hearts and a Union of
                        hands,' of strength, vigor and power to defy the world in the arts of peace
                        or the deeds of war."</p>
                    <p>Conquered people, whose property has been taken as spoils of war; who have
                        been disfranchised and held as political outlaws; over whom negroes are set
                        to rule, are not likely to soon forget their traditions, swallow those
                        wrongs and form a union of hearts and hands. History never knew such a case.</p>
                    <p> "At the South there are nearly six millions of people, more than one third
                        of the inhabitants, always true, always faithful to the Government, fighting
                        its battles and alsmost worshipping its flag, as loyal as they are black;
                        but I am sorry to say the ad-mixture of the white blood of their former
                        masters prevents me from saying, 'in every instance,' as black as they are
                        loyal. I am ready to have these vote and then I have no
                            fears of a disloyal South. (Applause.) In this I am answered that
                        the negroes are too ignorant to vote. They knew more about Government than
                        their masters--they knew enough to be loyal." </p>
                    <p>The above is likely to prove exceedingly soothing--in time. Ben agrees
                        perfectly with H. Winter Davis--"numbers not intelligence;" and makes a
                        black skin, ignorance and loyalty synonomous. He might have added a black
                        character, for the greatest rascals have always been the loudest loyalists.</p>
                    <p>He who is worthy of handling a bullet in defense of the country should carry
                        a ballot in the government of the country." The fact of serving his country
                        in the field should be his certificate of naturalization, his
                        enfranchisment, his citizenship, his qualification to vote everywhere. (Loud
                        applause.) It is due to those in whose hands we have trusted the musket that
                        they should have the ballot. Grant this, and the equality of right to the
                        ballot, in white or black, is settled at once and forever."</p>
                    <p>Of course it does not matter whether those "black loyalists" handled the
                        musket thro' patriotism or for a big bounty; whether they ever burned powder
                        in it or shot five miles at a rebel; whether they ran away at the Petersburg
                        ditch or fought their rations and the pestilent "greybacks" in camp--they
                        must vote all the same.</p>
                    <p>"To this was objected that neither Congress nor the President can give this
                        franchise; it is placed by the Constitution of our fathers in the hands of
                        the several States. True; but it was not placed by our fathers in the hands
                        of the rebellious, disloyal inhabitants of conquered territory, who by their
                        treason have forfeited not only all their political rights, but their lives,
                        and now have under the Constitution and the laws no right to breathe save by
                        the clemency of the Government.</p>
                    <p> "Might makes right," is Ben's theory. To do anything only requires power, and Congress having power can do that for which it has no authority. In fact he is in favor of no Government
                        but the will of the demagogues who, for the time, hold the reins of physical
                        force. It will be noticed that all the radical plans are based upon a
                        destroyed Union, and that the Butlers, Sumners, Stevenses, &amp;c., all
                        agree that the Union is not restored and must not be restored until the
                        whites shall have been placed in a political bondage more irksom and
                        degrading than the late African physical servility. Why pollute words by
                        talking of a Union of hearts and hands, associated as they are with
                        declarations that the negro is the only loyalist--that he must vote and
                        govern; that the white man is the only traitor--that he must lose all his
                        political rights--his property--be a serf and an outlaw, and possess not
                        even the right to breathe? </p>
                    <p> "The negro will vote joyfully to pay for the war expenses which gave him
                        liberty, property and life, while his master will repudiate that debt which
                        was contracted in subjugating him. It is for the
                            interest of bondholders in the United States that the negro should
                        vote. Your seven-thirties are worth a premium of ten per cent, if the
                        negro has the ballot. There will be neither fear of assumption of the rebel
                        debt, or the repudiation of our own from his vote." (Applause) </p>
                    <p> Once more we breathe freely. Thad Stevens and the shoddy leaders of
                        Pennsylvania want negro suffrage to fill up their rapidly depleting ranks,
                        but Ben adds an equally strong reason--It will add a
                            premium of ten per cent, to the seven-thirty bonds! At last we
                        find truth in a nutshell. It is not for the benefit of the negro; not to
                        carry out a "grand moral idea" in the interest of God and humanity, nor yet
                        to establish a perverted clause of the Declaration of Independence, that
                        negro suffrage is to be forced upon the white men of the country, North and
                        South, but to keep the shoddy thieves in power and to
                            add A PREMIUM OF TEN PER CENT UPON THE UNTAXED GOVERNMENT BONDS
                        HELD BY THE SHODDY ARISTOCRACY! </p>
                    <p> "Upon any theory the President and Congress have full power in their own
                        hands. Let them refuse a State any political power to
                            give any representatives their seats who shall have been elected by an
                            exclusion of any portion of the loyal citizens of his district from the
                            polls in consequence of a constitutional provision of a State during the
                            existence of slavery, made when no such considerable class of citizens
                            existed, and the matter will be reformed by the States themselves, and a
                            just and equal qualification of voters, applicable alike to black and
                            white, will be provided." </p>
                    <p> This is the way the game is to be played. Congress is to checkmate the President's "mild and generous method" (if
                        possible,) and the Southern States are to be kept out of
                            the Union until they agree to adopt negro suffrage--that is,
                        until they agree to lay down all political rights and power at the feet of
                        the blacks and demagogues who intend to control them. When this shall be
                        effected Government bonds are to be worth to shoddy
                            speculators TEN PER CENT, PREMIUM and the New
                            England fanatics and Pennsylvania demagogues expect to reign
                        forever. </p>
                    <p> How do the people of Pennsylvania like the radical programme laid down for
                        them by Butler and Stevens, and Sumner and Cameron, and the rest of the
                        shoddy leaders and bondholders? Are they prepared to allow the negroes to vote to keep shoddy
                            theives in power, and they are willing that NEGRO vote shall add
                        TEN PER CENT PREMIUM TO BONDS THAT ARE NOW FREE OF TAX while the working
                        classes are so heavily burthened to pay the interest on them? We trust not?
                            Let them vote for LINTON and DAVIS and all will be well.</p>

<b>The Monthly Statement of the Public Debt</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Secretary McCollogh announced that, as of August 31st, the country's public
                    debt amounts to $2,757,253,276. The report discusses the overall impact of the
                    debt on the economy, and calls on the Secretary of the Treasury to continue the
                    practice of keeping the public informed on the state of the federal government's
                    finances.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Contrary to the intimations given out from Washington, Secretary McCulloch
                        has published a detailed statement of the public debt, as it stood on the
                        31st of August. The exhibit is more favorable than the country expected. Had
                        it been withheld, the public creit would have lost the advantage which must
                        attend the knowledge that the increase of the debt for the month is very
                        small.</p>
                    <p> We trust that the wholesome practice thus continued may not again be
                        interrupted or relinquished, until the current revenue exceeds the
                        expenditures, the debt is all funded, and the liabilities of the government
                        are so fixed that they undergo no important changes from month to month. We
                        are not aware that there is any law requiring
                        these regular statements; but their obvious propriety, their advantage to
                        the business public, and the protection which they afford against unfounded,
                        mistaken, or exaggerated rumors as to the condition of the government
                        finances, ought to be considered as controlling reasons in favor of the
                        practice. There is, to be sure, a law, passed in 1844, requiring the
                        Secretary of the Treasury to publish monthly statements but not statements
                        of the public debt; only of the amount of money
                        in the several government depositories, and of drafts made against it. This
                        law is in the words following: </p>
                    <p>"That the Secretary of the Treasury cause to be published in some newspaper
                        of the City of Washington, on the first day of each month, the last
                        preceding weekly statement of the Treasurer of the United States, showing
                        the amount to his credit in the mint of other depositories, the amount for
                        which drafts have been given, and those remaining unpaid, and the balance
                        remaining subject to his draft; and that he also specially note any changes
                        that may have been made in the depositories of the treasury during the
                        preceding month, and report to Congress, at the commencement of the next
                        session, the reason for such changes.</p>
                    <p>The law, it will be seen, does not require the kind of statements now
                        furnished by Secretary McCulloch; but though he is under no legal compulsion
                        to furnish them, their great and obvious utility should prevent his
                        intermitting the practice.</p>
                    <p>The gratifying feature of the new statement is the smallness of the increase
                        of the public debt during the month, the increase, being less than half a
                        million, of one eigth of the daily expenditure during some periods of the
                        war. The following figures exhibit the increase for the month:</p>

                    <p>Next to the unexpected smallness of this augmentation, the point of most
                        interests in connection with the new statement, is its bearing on the
                        further inflation of the currency. This question is so complex that the
                        figures of the Secretary do not enable us to solve it, although they suffice
                        to indicate some possibilities. The amount of legal tender circulation has
                        decreased during the month $1,099,310, which, though small compared with the
                        whole amount, is so far as it goes, favorable. A slow contraction is better
                        than further expansion. But although the amount of legal tenders in
                        circulation has diminished, the volume of the currency has nevertheless
                        increased, by new issues of national bank notes much larger than the
                        withdrawn legal tenders so that the currency is more expanded than it was at
                        the beginning of the last month.--The great vacuum which is opened in the
                        South, and the money required for moving the grain crops of the West, have
                        some tendency to rectify the reduncancy, by large uses for money during the
                        autumn months.</p>
                    <p>The great amount of coin in the treasury ($15,435,771) will operate in two
                        different and opposite ways on the price of gold. It tends to increase the
                        proper and legitimate price as regulated by supply and demand, and it tends,
                        at the same time, to keep down fictitious and artificial prices blown up by
                        the combinations of speculators. The keeping of so large an amount of gold
                        locked up in the treasury, where it is inaccessible to the business
                        community, has an effect on its price similar to what would be produced on
                        the price of grain, if the government should store half the wheat in the
                        country in public granaries; to be kept against a year of famine. It makes
                        gold higher to every person who has occasion to buy it, and the government
                        compels the whole mercantile community to be large purchasers for the
                        payment of duties on imported goods. This constant taking of gold out of the
                        channels of business and hoarding it producing an artificial scarcity, which
                        will grow more and more artingent as long as the policy is persisted in.</p>
                    <p>It cannot be pretended that this accumulation of coin in the treasury is a
                        necessary safe-guard to the public credit. All the government needs is to
                        make sure of its ability to pay the interest on its gold bearing bonds. This
                        interest is only sixty-four millions and a half per annum, payable in July
                        and January. The interest due next January is thrity-two millions and a
                        quarter, and as the gold received from customs is ten millions a month there
                        would be left a surplus of eight millions on the first of January, if the
                        treasury did not possess a dollar of the present accumulation. The
                        government is impairing its own credit by creating a needless scarcity of
                        the article by which the value of its notes are measured.</p>
                    <p>The only offset to this evil is the power which the possession of so much
                        coin gives the government to break down any combination to carry up the
                        price of gold, by lowering the price, at its pleasure, and ruining the
                        speculators. But it could do this as effectually with a surplus of fifteen
                        millions as with a surplus of forty-five. If it poured out thirty millions
                        into the channels of trade, it would lower the price by increasing the
                        supply, and still retain the power (if it thinks such a policy expedient) to
                        repress speculation.</p>
                    <p>This tremendous power over the price of gold, and, through it, over the
                        prices of all other commodities, should never be possessed by any public
                        officer, however upright and pure. It is too susceptible of abuse.--Let him
                        make what use of it he will, he is so exposed to imputations, that a man of
                        sensitive honor would hardly know how to act. He has a wolf by the ears, and
                        he can neither hold it nor safely let it go. If Mr. McCulloch hoards gold,
                        he produces an artificial scarcity which injures alike the business of the
                        country and the public credit, if he sells it, he makes or breakes fortunes,
                        and if he has any confidants their friends are likely to profit by their
                        knowledge. This is one of the infinite mischiefs of having one kind of money
                        for the government and another for the people.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is only necessary to give the Democratic State and county tickets a
                        complete triumph, that every Democratic voter should be at the polls on
                        Tuesday next. It is the important duty of every lover of constitutional
                        freedom, to cast his vote, in this emergency for the right men. The white
                        man's party alone have the capacity and power to regulate the government,
                        and to bring it back to the principles and purity of its founders. The evils
                        brought upon the country by the so-called Republican party, are almost too
                        greivous to be borne; and not content with evils already inflicted, they
                        threaten us with still greater ones.</p>
                    <p> Thus stands their record. They have arrested and incarcerated our citizens
                        in government Bastiles, not only without probable
                        cause, but also without legal warrant, and after dishonoring them to
                        the extent of their power, have discharged them without trial and have
                        scoffed at their demands for justice. They have denied to the people the
                        right of free speech and a
                            free press, rights, the existence of which form the very bulwarks
                        of freedom, and are formidable to tyrants only. They have, in a great
                        measure made the civil subordinate to the military power, and have
                        established a multitude of dangerous courts, for the trial of persons
                        suspected of crime unknown to the Constitution and laws of the land. </p>
                    <p>It is contemplated by the leaders of that party, in defiance of the
                        Constitution, to confiscate all the large estates of the people of the
                        rebellious States, ostensibly to apply the proceeds to the payment of the
                        national debt, and to pay pensioners, but in reality to find offices and
                        emoluments for partisan officials. The reason assigned for this effort to
                        excite the rapacity and cupidity of the North against the widowed families
                        of our Southern neighbors, is the devilish maxim that to the "victors belong
                        the spoils."--To this end they affect to treat them as "foreign States" and
                        "alien enemies."--</p>
                    <p>With one breath they protest most stoutly that those States could not escape
                        from the restraints of the Constitution, and therefore large armies were
                        marshalled to enforce obedience to its authority; and with the next they
                        aver with still greater vehemence, that they are out of the Union and must
                        be treated as "alien enemies." In other words they are within the Union for
                        all the purposes of obedience to the mandates of the Constitution, and out
                        of it for all purposes of spoliation and robbery. It is even suggested by
                        the violent and fanatical of that party, that the rebellious States shall
                        not be permitted a voice in the national councils, through their
                        Congressmen, for a generation and that Congress shall usurp the legislative
                        powers of the States and give the ignorant negroes of the South the right of
                        suffrage and social equality.</p>
                    <p> The execution of these measures would maintain the strife between the two
                        sections for many years, would involve the necessity of a large standing army, add immensely to our present
                        ruinous debt, the payment of which would swallow up the profits of the
                        labor, skill and industry of our people, and ultimately produce national
                        bankruptcy. </p>
                    <p> These evils are great, but by a reference to the public prints, it will be
                        seen that still greater ones are threatened by that same party. It is
                        proposed to give the African the right to the "ballot-box" and the right to the "jury-box," and also to give him "social
                        equality." It is true that a very large portion of the rank and file
                        of that party object to these views. But others and by far the most active
                        of the party are resolutely bent on enforcing them. </p>
                    <p> The Democracy alone can extricate the nation from this peril. They alone can
                        reestablish the government on its old foundation; they alone can bring back
                        the purity of the election franchise, and retrenchment and reform of the
                        expenses of the government. They alone can save the nation form the horrible
                        dogmas of negro suffrage and negro equality dogmas which are not only disgusting to the great
                        majority of the white race, but which stand arrayed against the Decrees of
                        Providence. </p>
                    <p>The misrule and usurpations of the party in its brief existence demonstrate
                        their unfitness for civil rule, and their fanatical doctrines with regard to
                        the black man show they are unworthy for the confidence of a free and
                        enlightened people. Let no such party be trusted.</p>
                    <p>We would also call the attention of voters to the fact that whilst the
                        Democratic party in the Legislature have uniformly voted for the payment of
                        the damages sustained by the citizens of our valley during the war, the
                        Republican party with the same unanimity have opposed the measure. If our
                        citizens wish to be compensated for their losses they must sustain the
                        Democracy. Let the Democracy arouse in the power of their might and defeat
                        the enemy. Let every man give at least two days to his country at this
                        crisis; one in getting out the voters to the polls, and the other to the
                        election day, in seeing that every vote is cast for the Constitution and the
                        country.</p>
                    <p> We have no other laws to fix the qualifications of voters than our own Acts of Assembly and every man that comes
                        within these requirements is entitled to his vote. </p>

                        when drafted from voting. And it is further said, that the late Provost

                        partizans have been employed to visit those persons with a view to terrify

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> With Major-General Hartranft, the Republican candidate for Auditor General,
                        says the Easton Sentinel we have been on intimate
                        personal terms for sixteen years past--almost from his boyhood--and against
                        his personal character or his lilitary record, we have not one word to say.
                        There is one act of his, however, that we cannot reconcile with the acts of
                        his past life--and that is, the superintending of the hanging of a
                        woman--Mrs. Surratt. His officiation in the capacity of chief hangman, a
                        business which, Gen. Sherman very appropriately says, belongs to Sheriffs
                        and not to soldiers, might not be considered a wrong, were it not for the
                        fact, that in this case, he publicly declared, over his own signature, that he believed the victim innocent How a man with
                        his high sense of duty and exalted rank in the army, could so degrade
                        himself as to assist in hanging a woman for a crime of which he says he
                        believed her innocent, we cannot imagine. Had this proposition been
                        presented to him before he became confaminated with the influences of the
                        shoddy party and the doctrine of negro equality, we are sure he would have
                        resented it with indidgnity, and would have resigned a thousand commissions,
                        did he possess them, rather than do that which he believed to be wrong. But
                        such is the result of his political affiliations, and we leave him to settle
                        the matter with his own conscience. Reader, is a man who will hang a woman,
                            who he believes to be innocent, a fit person
                        to receive your votes for a high and responsible civil position? We ask the
                        question, from you must come the answer. </p>
