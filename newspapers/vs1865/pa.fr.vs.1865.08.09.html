<b>Absolutely Free</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Denigrates the decision made by the Connecticut Legislature to pass a
                    resolution declaring that all men ought to be free and are deserving of the same
                    rights and privileges.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Connecticut Legislature, which adjourned a few days ago, adopted a series
                        of resolutions, among which this is one:</p>
                    <p>"All men within the limits of the United States ought to be absolutely free;
                        and no permanent discrimination in rights and privileges ought to exist
                        between different classes of free men.</p>
                    <p>We suppose the wise legislators intended in this resolution to use the word
                        "men" in its restricted, masculine sense. They did not mean to include women
                        in their assertion of right. Their resolution, therefore, is not open to
                        criticism on this ground. But the broad statement that "all men within the
                        limits of the United States ought to be absolutely free," is so absurd that
                        it challenges notice. We need not pause to define the word free. No
                        definition that can be given to it will make this assertion correct
                        doctrine. The men who adopted the resolution could not possibly be such
                        ignoramuses in political economy as to believe it themselves. If every man
                        was "absolutely free," what would become of property and life? How long
                        could local or general peace and prosperity be kept? What would be the
                        relations of the strong to the weak? --We are pained at the signs of time
                        when we see legislative bodies dealing in these claptraps of politics, using
                        sounding phrases like this to catch the ears of unthinking people. If the
                        members of the Connecticut Legislature really believe the absurd doctrine
                        here enunciated, they are no more fit to be legislators than were the
                        Jacobins in France. They are equally insane with those men who made the
                        world to abhor the very idea of liberty by their attempt to establish
                        absolute freedom. We do not refer to the Indians, to foreigners recently
                        arrived, to criminals, to insane persons, or other exceptionable cases.
                        These are amply sufficient to attract the notice of thinking men, but we
                        direct attention only to the manifest folly of a Legislature asserting that
                        every man ought to be absolutely free, when its own existence is for the
                        very purpose of making laws which shall prevent men from being absolutely
                        free. We have no doubt that these very men, in this very Legislature, had
                        been enacting laws restraining the freedom of various classes of people in
                        their own State just before they passed theis "bunkum" resolution about the
                        United States. The second branch of the resolution is as foolish as the
                        first.</p>

<b>Where the Danger Lies</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes northerners who continue to resist the re-unification of the
                    country on the grounds that the South has still not shown itself adequately
                    contrite for the war. This group, the article proclaims, is the greatest
                    impediment to national reconciliation. The Southern rebellion may have been
                    crushed, but "Northern fanaticism remains rampant and threatens perpetual war."<br>

<b>The Fruits of Negro Equality</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Traveling to Panama to see how that country has managed since slavery was
                    abolished, a writer from the New York Herald reports on the condition of the
                    freedmen there in order to gauge the probable effects of emancipation on blacks
                    in the South. Using statistics that point to rising illegitimacy rates, he
                    asserts that morality among ex-slaves in Panama has declined precipitously since
                    they gained their freedom, an occurrence that seems to be taking place in the
                    U.S. as well. Under these circumstances, it will prove disastrous to grant the
                    former bondsmen in the South the right to vote.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> You may suppose that much I have heretofore written in regard to affairs in
                        this State is because I have taken a prejudicial view of matters and things,
                        and have not taken pains to inform myself properly as to their true
                        condition. I will now give you an outline of a conversation I had few
                        evenings since with a native of Panama--a gentleman of education and
                        refinement--one who knows and thoroughly understands his country, and would
                        upon no account say anything against it. I wanted some information on the
                        subject, and frankly told him so, and what use I intended to make of it. The
                        first question I put was: "What is the population of the city of Panama and
                        suburb arrabal [unclear]" Answer--"About twelve
                        thousand, including foreigners." --Second--"What proportion of the twelve
                        thousand are pure white?" Answer--"Less than two
                        thousand." Third--"Of the children born among this population what
                        proportion are legitimate?" Answer--"About three-tenths, and these nearly
                        altogether among the whites, for there are but few marriages among the
                        blacks." He went on to say that on one occasion he took a census of an
                        adjoining department of this State, and among eleven hundred persons he
                        found seven married couples only. What I have given you is a very fair
                        picture of the state of society hereabout, and you will find it about on a
                        par--no worse--than other parts of the world where the negro has, by
                        mistaken sympathy, been brought above his proper level. From knowledge of
                        what the Southern States were prior to the rebellion, I feel perfectly safe
                        in asserting that--notwithstanding Mrs. Stowe, Fanny Kemble, Butler and
                        others--there were more legitimate children born among the slaves than there
                        are among what is termed "freedmen." Morality among them here is a thing
                        almost unknown, and some of the cases of incest you hear of are of the most
                        revolting and disgusting character. --I will say one thing, however, in
                        favor of the class who are natives of this soil--that in everything they are
                        as far advanced above the Jamaica negro as it is possible to be. --The
                        latter has very likely acquired some little education: this at once makes
                        him saucy arrogant and desirous of aping all the manners and customs of the
                        white men. The Jamaica mulatto is far worse, and can excel the world for
                        impudence, and in nine cases out of ten is utterly worthless. They are
                        shunned by the natives, and the lowest term one can use here towards a black
                        or mulatto is to say that he is a "Jamaica nigger." This cuts like a
                        two-edged sword, and is more telling in its effect than if you were to use
                        the vilest words known in the English language. I had intended to drop the
                        black subject, but thought that a little information from the best source
                        about "Mosquerra's progress in civilization" would not be amiss, and might
                        throw some light on what might be expected to the United States should the
                        same couse be pursued with the "freedmen" there as has been in this country
                        and among the West India Islands--namely, universal suffrage. </p>
                    <p>There are important facts and pertinent to the real issue which the people of
                        this country are called upon to decide. If forcing the negro race into
                        equality with the white in Central America without preparation or training
                        has produced the results described, what right have we to hope that like
                        causes will not produce like effects in the United States? To be sure the
                        colored men in this country are a step in advance of those in Jamaica and
                        Central America, but even here the effect of sudden emancipation upon the
                        moral condition of the freemen has been disastrous. What then, may not be
                        feared if the radical programme of negro suffrage be engrafted upon
                        emancipation? The example of Jamaica and Central America should not be
                        overlooked by moralist when balancing in his mind the proofs for and against
                        negro equality and negro suffrage. We should decide this question as
                        Christians and not as mere politicians.</p>

                    <p>"I see by the papers sent me, that there is much talk about giveing negroes
                        the right to vote. It is all d--d nonsense. To know the negro, you ought to
                        see them as we see them here. Of all human kind, they are the most debased
                        and worst. They are but little above the brute creation--cattle in human
                        form. The right of suffrage is the highest, most important of all our
                        political rights. To give these beings this right, in their present state of
                        degradation, would be damnable; to those who have been brought in contact
                        with them as we have, the thought is sickening. In their present condition
                        of freedom, they are wrose than when under the direction and control of
                        their masters. They do not know enough to know what freedom is. All construe
                        it to mean freedom to live in idleness--freedom to 'lie around loose,'--to
                        roll in the dirt--to bask in the sun--to wallow in their own filth--to steal
                        whatever comes within their reach, if they can do it and not be seen. To
                        place such creatures on a level with the electoral class, is lowering the
                        Republican form of Government to a degree that must make it the laughing
                        stock of the whole world. God save us from such madness.</p>

                        his position by the circulation of the most absurd falsehoods. The plan is
                        to systematically libel the Southern people by originating stories of great
                        dissatisfaction among them and unwilling on their part to submit to the

                        President's policy of restoration, are now heard to say that "the South will
                            compel the President to hold them as

<b>Provost Marshal Shot</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article, from the Bedford Gazette, corrects the Associated Press'
                    report on the murder of John Crouse, the deputy provost marshal of Bedford
                    county, by John P. Reed. Reed had recently returned from Canada where he had
                    studied law during the war. The article emphasizes that Reed did not go to
                    Toronto to avoid conscription; rather, he was drafted long after he had become a
                    student. Also involved in the altercation was Reed's brother, Mengel, who, the
                    news service alleged, served in the Confederate army. The two are now in

                    <p>BEDFORD, Pa. Aug. 1. <br> Jacob Crouse, late duputy provost martial of
                        Bedford County, was shot dead in the street to-day by John P. Reed, a lately
                        returned Canadian refugee. His brother, Mengel Reed, who has been in the
                        rebel army, was also engaged in the affray. They have been arrested and
                        lodged in jail. --Great excitement prevails in consequence of the affair. </p>
                    <p> The above is a telegram to the Associated Press. It is due to truth to say
                        that John P. Reed, Jr., was not a Canadian refugee. He went to Toronto to
                        study law, and for no other purpose. When he went there he was a free man.
                        Neither the Government nor any private individual had made any claims upon
                        him from which he found it necessary to flee; and when drafted, long after he became a student at Toronto, he put
                        in a substitute and received an honorable discharge from Capt. Eyster. His
                        brother Mengel was captured at McConnellsburg, by the rebels, and
                        re-captured by the Union troops near Gettysburg a few days after. --Neither
                        of them were arrested, but placed themselves in the hands of the Sheriff.

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Maligns radical northern ministers who continue to speak out against the
                    South, preaching violence and zealotry.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a large class of preachers whose violence toward the South, now
                        being vented in the churches on Sundays, looks and sounds ridiculous by
                        contrast with the changed temper and revival of old regards at the North.
                        Such hot-headed zealots are the exponents of the worst passions of every
                        civil crisis, and kindle while they share a violence and a ferocity of
                        temper to which the laity can rarely attain, since most of the laity are
                        less likely than such members of the clergy to mistake their irregular
                        passions for divinely inflamed ardors. While the ministers of the gospel
                        have sought to sooth the exasperations and molify the hates generated by
                        sectional strife and a bloody war; while from one end of the vast theater of
                        our war to the other, for four long years, they have comforted the
                        afflicted, consoled the dying, and borne beside them both, to the borders of
                        the grave, the only lamp whose rays penetrate and illumine the darkness
                        beyond, these other fitly-dubbed "bloodhounds of Zion" have been galloping
                        to and fro crying for more slaughter, and exasperating the measured hotility
                        of armed combatants in to malignant hatreds, fit only for devils. --This is
                        not strange. In the civil wars of England, as of any other land, such
                        preachers have been the exponent of the worst passions any where kindled
                        among the people; but oddity and the ludicrousness of the thing to be
                        remarked among these creatures just now is, that their brains are boiling
                        while those of their followers are becoming cool, and like those
                        thermometers whose indexes register the maximum of temperature and do not
                        follow the mercury down the tube, they still fancy themselves in the lead of
                        affairs which in fact have stranded them high and dry, and they gesticulate
                        as wildly, and scream for their glut of blood as fiercely as ever they did
                        when men believed and obeyed them. AS CATO, no matter what his theme, would
                        finish off his speech saying: "and it is only my opinion that Cathage must
                        be destroyed." so these pestilent fellows finish off their prayers to Heaven
                        for mercy and forgiveness to themselves with a due distribution of Divine
                        vengeance on the unforgiven South, and conclude a sermon on a Saviour's love
                        with an exhibition of their own capacity to hate--"being also of the opinion
                        that negroes should vote and copperheads be damned."</p>
                    <p>Whereas there is now hardly one political journal at the North which deems
                        public necessities to demand a liberal use of the gallows, there is a
                        "religious" journal at Buffalo, edited, doubtless, by some noodle who knows
                        as little of the difficult science of politics as many politicians know of
                        the mystery of godliness, which cries out for "hanging the fiends." A
                        reverend brawler by the name of J.D. FULTON, whose mental constitution would
                        seem to be such that, whatever the degree of his own piety, he can propagate
                        nothing but superstition in one sex and infidelity in the other, tells his
                        hearers to "wait a few years if you want to see men damned in this world,
                        and you will behold these chivalric southrons meeting with their deserts."
                        Really, now, is it a mundane St. Paul we have among us? "Slavery has gone
                        out of the South and CHRIST is going in." Or, after all, is it a John the
                        Forerunner who speaks: "Up North we had made up our minds about the southern
                        confederacy, and we thought it just as bad as hell, so that when we didn't
                        want to say hell we said southern confederacy." Is this ribald tongue
                        sacred, then, or is its looseness more shocking and shameless than the most
                        outrageous profanity of a drunken Fulton Market fisherman?</p>
                    <p>In the face of exhibitions like these it would seem as if the press could not
                        suffer any scruples to hinder it from unfrocking all these pulpiteers whom
                        ignorance drives to teaching politics, and irreverence to making game of the
                        gospel and of Almighty God. It can serve no ill purpose to tell the people
                        just what these ribaldry-mongers are. They are false to their commissions.
                        They teach not religion, but irreligion; not piety, but infidelity; not even
                        politics, but intolerance; and in young hearts they make a stony sterility,
                        where neither faith nor good works can take root. It is these ordained
                        mountebanks who think to save souls by telling their congregations that,
                        "although lamb in the butchers' shops is worth nine cents a pound, they may
                        all have the Lamb of GOD for nothing:" who are so forward to instruct the
                        American people how to restore good government, compose a disordered state,
                        adjust the balances of political power, and how to harness the social and
                        industrial forces which are impelling these states along the track of their
                        mighty career. On themes like these, for which they have neither faculties
                        nor training, they may, nevertheless, continue their effrontery of
                        discoursing as teachers; but their cloth cannot long protect them from being
                        stripped and lashed for their ignorance and impudence, just as other men
                        always are who make a similar exhibition; and if the result shall be that
                        the stripping and the lashing exposes not only their incompetency in
                        temporal things, but shall happen also to lay bare their spiritual
                        nakedness, so much the better for all except those who say "pious" with
                        closed nostrils.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p> On Tuesday morning last, our usually quiet town was thrown into a state of
                        intense excitement, by the shooting of Jacod Crouse by J.P. Reed, Jr., both
                        of this place. We will try to narrate the circumstances under which this
                        unfortunate affray took place, as accurately as we can gather them from
                        those who were witnesses of the occurrence. --Mengel Reed, a student of
                        medicine in Philadelphia, and a brother of J.P. Reed, Jr., has been staying
                        at his father's house for some days on a visit. Whilst Mengel was sitting in
                        front of his father's house and frequently when walking with ladies on the
                        street, Crouse would call him "rebel," "traitor," and accost him in this
                        wise, "How are you, Reb?" This was borne silently by Mengel until Saturday,
                        when sitting in front of his father's office, Crouse, passing him, said,
                            "How are you, Johny?" Mengel replied that he
                        would cane him, if he would continue to insult him. J.P. Reed, Jr., hearing
                        the altercation between them and asked what was the matter, Mengel replied,
                        "This creature has insulted me again." J.P. asked Crouse, "Did you?" The
                        latter replied "Yes, I did!" and came menacingly toward J.P., who struck him
                        and knocked him down. Crouse, being a powerful man, rallied, when he was
                        again knocked down by Reed. At this juncture, the peace officers interfered
                        and the parties were separated. On Saturday night, as Schell W. Reed, a
                        brother of Mengel and J.P. Reed, Jr., was going from his uncle Jacob Reed's
                        house towards his father's, Crouse leaped upon him, struck him to the ground
                        and was beating him terribly, when J.P. Reed, Jr., came to the rescue and
                        knocked Crouse down several times. At this crisis a large crowd had gathered
                        in the street, and for a few minutes there seemed to be imminent danger of a
                        riot. Through the exertions, however, of the constables and Capt. Adams, of
                        the 187th, order was restored. Thus matters stood until Tuesday morning,
                        when J.P. Reed, Jr., and Jacob Crouse met on the street. Crouse said
                        something to Reed, and the latter told him he wanted to have nothing more to
                        do with him, at the same time turning to walk away. As Reed turned, Crouse
                        struck him with a stone nearly felling him, and was in the act of striking
                        him with another stone, when Reed fired upon him, killing him almost
                        instantly. This is a sad, sad affair, and we hope may be the last of the
                        kind it shall ever be our painful duty to record. Mr. Reed gave himself up
                        to the authorities and was placed in the county prison. We hope our readers
                        will not make up, or express, any opinion in regard to this case, in view of
                        the fact that some of them may be called to sit upon it as jurors. Reserve
                        your opinions until you hear the testimony in court. </p>
                    <p>P.S. An effort has been made by the counsel for the prosecution, to prove a
                        conspiracy for the killing of Couse, which has utterly failed. No one was
                        committed except the three Reed boys. The physician of J.P. Reed, Jr., says
                        he is hurt badly by the blow received from the stone in Crouse's hands, and
                        that if he had been struck a few inches higher he would have been
                    killed.</p>

                        to reorganization in that State; estimates that 120,000 men of that State
                        went upon the battle-field of whom 70,000 are dead or disabled. If we apply
                        the same ratio of enlistments in the other States that held out during the
                        war, and make an approximation of the numbers sent out from the remainder of
                        the slave States we shall have the following interesting table as calculated

                    <p>If all the men who were once got into the rebel army were retained during the
                        war or during their ability to serve, there were according to this
                        calculation, 464,000 men in the rebel service at the close of the war. --But
                        if allowances be made for desertion, &amp;amp;c., and for the sick in
                        the hospitals who have recovered and are not counted by Governor Parsons
                        among the diabled, we shall find this number of 494,000 diminshedto
                        something like the actual number that either surrendered to our forces or
                        scattered to their homes immediately after the fall of Richmond. It seems,
                        therefore, from this verification of the solution of the problem that
                        Governor Parsons was not far from the truth.</p>
