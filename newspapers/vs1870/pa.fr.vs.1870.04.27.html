<b>Carpet-Baggers</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper denounces the Radical's use of carpet-baggers to run for office
                    in the South.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There seems to be a reaction against carpet-baggers. Even the most
                        uncompromising Radicals of the North are reaching the conclusion that it is
                        a disgrace to the nation to have fellows sent to Congress from the Southern
                        States who have just squatted there within the last year. After the case of
                        Mr. Sypher was disposed of in the House of Representatives the Philadelphia
                            Inquirer thus vented its feelings: "Let us
                        hope that Mr. Sypher will be the last of the carpet-baggers. Let us hope,
                        too, that the South shall be so enfranchised by a general amnesty that it
                        can select its own people to represent it upon the floors of Congress. What
                        does a Pennsylvanian know of the political economy of Louisiana? Who can an
                        alien represent there?</p>
                    <p>It is high time that the Radicals should come to their senses. Such outrages
                        were never perpetrated in the history of our country as have been committed
                        in the Southern States, upon the rights of the native population. Perfect
                        strangers have settled there and, backed by military power and sustained by
                        the votes of the negroes, have been selected to represent constituencies
                        about whose wants and interests they know absolutely nothing. It is a good
                        sign that the Radicals are becoming disgusted at this condition of affairs.</p>
                    <p>This result is partly due to the disfranchisement of large numbers of the
                        whites in these States. If they were allowed to vote, men would be sent to
                        Congress who could at least claim to be the representatives of their
                        districts. That was a sensible suggestion which Chief Justice Chase made the
                        other day, in his letter to the negroes of Columbia. After congratulating
                        them on the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, he suggested that the
                        fittest way they could celebrate the event, would be to sign a memorial
                        petitioning Congress, to wipe out all disfranchising laws, and grant a
                        general amnesty to the people of the South. Let a general amnesty be
                        proclaimed, and the rule of carpet-baggers will be at an end.</p>

<b>Wilson Female College</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Chairman of the Advisory Committee of Wilson Female College announces
                    that the school is close to opening. He complains only that the citizens of
                    Chambersburg have thus far subscribed no more than $5,000 to the school.
                    Greencastle had offered $15,000 or $20,000. Figures closer to those numbers
