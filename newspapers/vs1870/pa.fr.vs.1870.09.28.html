<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>So says John Cessna. In his speech in the Court House last week, he made the
                        extraordinary statement that any person who expected to have the question of
                        negro suffrage submitted to the people, was certainly an "ignoramus." To
                        sustain this position he explained the provision of the Federal Constitution
                        for its own amendment, claiming that the most ignorant man could see that
                        any proposed amendment must be submitted to the State Legislatures or to
                        conventions called by the people of the States, and that whenever
                        three-fourths of either of these ratify it, it becomes a part of the
                        Constitution. But the people of Franklin County know that this was not the
                        position which the radical leaders, including Cessna, took two years ago.
                        When the Democrats charged that it was the intention of the Radicals to
                        force negro suffrage upon the people without allowing them to vote upon the
                        question, these same Radicals denounced the charge as a lie gotten up for
                        electioneering purposes. They pointed to the State Constitution and the
                        election laws with the word white in them, and to
                        the provisions of our State Constitution with reference to its amendment.
                        They said it was utterly impossible to force negro suffrage upon the people
                        because the State Constitution provides that two
                        Legislatures must endorse the proposition and then it
                            must be submitted to the people. Our readers will remember how
                        distinctly the issue was made in 1868 when Capt. John Walker was the
                        candidate of the Radical party in this County for the Assembly. He was
                        elected, not alone on account of his high personal character, but because
                        his neighbors and friends believed him to be inexorably opposed to the
                        Fifteenth Amendment. He went to Harrisburg, and when it was discovered that
                        the Radical leaders were about to cheat the people on this question--when
                        the question of the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment was being
                        agitated at Harrisburg--from Metal township (Capt. Walker's own election
                        district) went an earnest protest signed by many of his prominent brethren
                        of the Radical party against its adoption. They began to see the infidelity
                        of the men who had made cheap promises. But this protest could not hold
                        Capt. Walker to his pledge. The party discipline was too rigid--the lash was
                        applied with too much severity--for Capt. Walker to carry out the wishes of
                        his constituents, he yielded to the influences brought to bear upon him and
                        voted to ratify the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>
                    <p>So great was the indignation in his own party at this vote, that when the
                        Radical County Convention met in 1869, it was deemed advisable to leave his
                        name off the ticket. Captain Walker was not considered a
                            safe candidate for the party because of his vote to ratify the Fifteenth
                            Amendment.</p>
                    <p>And although an able and worthy gentleman was put in nomination by the
                        Radical Convention, such was the indignation at Walker's betrayal of his
                        constituents that the Democratic majority on the State ticket ran up to 308
                        and the majority for the Democratic candidate for Assembly exceeded that
                        figure. The people resented the conduct of the Radical representative on
                        this very question. Let them do it again.</p>
                    <p>It is in very bad taste for Cessna to come to Franklin County and talk about
                        her people being "ignoramuses" for expecting an opportunity to vote on this
                        question, when all their expectations were the result of Radical teachings.</p>
                    <p>Not only did the speakers of the party take this position, but the organ of
                        the party, the Repository, sought to impress the
                        same views upon its readers. As far back as 1865, Col. McClure endeavored to
                        allay the apprehensions of the people on this subject by entering into an
                        elaborate explanation of the provisions of the State Constitution. He was
                        sagacious enough to see what would be proposed by the agitators of his
                        party, and he knew that negro suffrage would not be palatable to the people
                        of Franklin County. Accordingly, he sounded the first false notes and
                        persuaded his readers that their right to vote upon this question could not
                        be interfered with.</p>
                    <p>Now, Cessna says that the people were "ignoramuses" for
                            believing Col. McClure--that they ought to have had sense enough
                        to know that McClure was deceiving them.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps this position might be a good one, if Cessna had not committed
                        himself in the same way. In his joint discussion with Judge Kimmell at
                        Waynesboro', he took this same position, as those who were present will
                        remember. He hooted at the idea of negro suffrage being forced upon the
                        people without them having an opportunity to vote on the question. On the
                        contrary, Judge Kimmell endeavored to warn the people that day of what was
                        surely in store for them. He told them that the Radicals meant to give the
                        negro the ballot by packing the State Legislatures. But Democrats were not
                        believed then. This horde of loyal scoundrels who are robbing the government
                        and the tax payers, possessed the confidence of a majority of the people of
                        this Congressional District, and they elected this double faced individual
                        who blows hot and cold in the same breath and thinks that the people of
                        Franklin County are such "ignoramuses" as not to know the difference.</p>
                    <p>What say you, voters of Franklin County? Are your memories so shallow that
                        you can not recollect the promises which Cessna made two years ago? He has
                        betrayed you, and now seeks to make you believe that he never made any
                        promises at all. Defeat him for his bare-faced falsehoods.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A fit of desperation has seized the Editor of the Repository. He hears from all quarters the terrible complaints
                        which are coming up from the people against Cessna for his indifference to
                        the interests of the people. Not only complaints greet his ear, but curses
                        loud and deep. Thereupon, he becomes frenzied, for are not his hopes of a
                        protracted term as Assistant Assessor hanging on Cessna's re-election? He
                        resolves, therefore, that Cessna must be re-elected even if the hopes of the
                        people for payment of losses must be completely wrecked in order to do it.
                        Accordingly, he shows that Cessna went to Harrisburg and paid his own expenses (about one dollar and fifty cents for
                        supper and lodging, his passes having carried him free over the railroads)
                        in order to put Skinner on the Committee of Ways and Means. Five prominent
                        gentlemen spoke to Speaker Strang in favor of Skinner's appointment and it
                        seems to us that it was putting it a little strong under those circumstances
                        for Cessna to say that he did the work himself.
                        But Cessna never was suspected of having any modesty.</p>
                    <p>But failing to make a respectable defence for Cessna, the Editor of the Repository thinks it wise not only to belittle Mr.
                        Meyers' services but also to impugn his motives in relation to the Border
                        Claim bill. In the last issue of his paper he uses this language:</p>
                    <p>We say then that, in addition to the promise of support
                            from the leaders of the Franklin county Democracy for his nomination for
                            Congress, Mr. Meyers presented his bill to the Franklin County Border
                            Damage Committee, for the services of the Patriot in urging the payment
                            of the border damages, and demanded payment of it." The italics
                        are his own. Now the Editor of the Repository
                        willfully and deliberately misrepresented Mr. Meyers in this matter. He knew
                        very well (at least, being a member of the Border Claim Committee, he ought
                        to have known) that the bill rendered by the Patriot office was not for "the services" of that paper, but for copies of the Patriot furnished to the
                        Committee. Here is the bill that was presented by the Patriot office:</p>
                    <p>HARRISBURG, May 12th, 1870.</p>
                    <p>MR. J. W. DOUGLAS:</p>
                    <p>1870. To Patriot, Dr.</p>
                    <p>Feb. 24. To 800 copies Weekly Patriot at 5
                        cts.....$40.00</p>
                    <p>And here is the letter which accompanied the bill:</p>
                    <p>HARRISBURG, PA., May 12, 1870.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir: Enclosed find bill for copies of Weekly
                            Patriot: said copies were ordered by Col.
                        Stumbaugh, and contained an article on the "Border Claim Bill." It has been
                        suggested that you were the proper person to send the bill to. We sent the
                        bill to Col. Stumbaugh but suppose he has overlooked the matter. Col.
                        Stumbaugh will certify to the bill, as to its correctness. Please give it
                        the proper attention.</p>
                    <p>Yours very truly,</p>
                    <p>B.F. MEYERS &amp; Col.,</p>
                    <p>To J.W. Douglas, Esq. per K.</p>
                    <p>This bill was sent to Mr. Douglas because that gentlemen is the Treasurer of
                        the Border Claim Committee, and the suggestion referred to in the letter as
                        to the proper person to whom the bill should be sent, was made by gentlemen
                        who were members of that Committee.</p>
                    <p>Now it certainly was enough to ask the Patriot to
                        give us the influence of its editorial columns gratis without expecting that office to furnish us 800 copies of the
                        paper for nothing. The Editor of the Repository
                        did excellent service with the pen in the same cause, and for this it does
                        not expect pay, we presume. But for its job work done for the Committee, it
                        has a bill in excess of that of the Patriot. For
                        that it has been partly paid and will demand payment of the balance, and it
                        deserves to be paid. The Spirit asks nothing for
                        its editorial articles, for it was its duty to do its utmost to procure
                        payment for the Border Claims if possible. But it has a bill for job work in
                        excess of the bill presented by the Patriot. A
                        portion of this bill has been paid, and we expect payment of the balance.</p>
                    <p>It seems to us that the Editor of the Repository
                        has gotten himself into a very indefensible position by making this impudent
                        and unfounded charge. His hot zeal for the little fellow who feeds him on
                        Government "pap" has outrun his discretion.--When next he endeavors to get
                        up a sensation, let him confine himself to the truth.</p>
                    <p>We can not wonder at his departure from the truth in this campaign, however,
                        after that "whopper" which Cessna threw out at McConnellsburg the other
                        evening. Cessna was accounting for his infamous conduct in favor of Wallace,
                        in the case of Wallace vs. Simpson in South Carolina. He said that one of
                        the chief reasons for his astounding action, was that on the day of the
                        election nineteen hundred loyal men had been slaughtered
                            at the polls. The news of this massacre was only furnished to
                        John Cessna.</p>
                    <p>It looks as if the Editor of the Repository had
                        slept in the same bed with Cessna.</p>

                    <p>Messrs. Editors: The Radical meeting last night in
                        Shady Grove, was attended by a considerable number of the neighbors without
                        respect to party. Greencastle was also slightly represented. Curiosity no
                        doubt led most of those present to the spot. The Greencastle band was in
                        attendance and performed well. The Radical bills announce about two dozen
                        meetings to be held at different places between this and the election by the
                        party. These meetings are intended principally to drum in the "disaffected"
                        of the party, as the speakers themselves last night called the "weakkneed"
                        Republicans (another of their expressions) by diverting their minds as much
                        as possible from the issue of their disaffection to other  very
                        interesting to the people, entire absence of any cheering, except 
                        called upon, evidently manifested at night, for even these calls were
                        feebly responded to.</p>
                    <p>If the leaders of the party only persuade the rank and file  the
                        outrageous imposition of the  amendment, they would hug the idea
                         by victory this fall; but from some  or other, they seem to be
                        in great to how a large number of their fervent supporters are biting
                        at the black  such means as coaxing, or  or appeals to the baser
                        passions  or false swearing, or bribery  required to bring them

                        other foundation than the  imaginations or the most malicious 
                        of Radical politicians for these  insinuations against the whole
                        Democratic party, every one would be  perfect amazement at the success
                         Radicals in conquering the rebellion.  men appear to be unable
                        to distinguish between an honest difference from their  and sympathy
                        for the rebels.  hearted professions that the men  the
                        Democratic party are honest or  is only another way of calling us
                         ignorant, since they allow us no  but "rebel sympathizers!" It
                        would  to call every Democrat a "rebel sympathizer." That would be too
                        bare-faced.  stabs at the Democratic masses  the shoulders of
                        our leaders, have  answered to arouse the prejudices 
                        "weak-kneed" Republicans sufficient to overcome the many shortcomings of the
                        party in the past as it is hoped their prejudices can in the same way be

                    <p>GREENCASTLE, Sept. 26, 1870.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--We attended a meeting on
                        Saturday night at Upton, of that party which inasmuch as it "saved the
                        country" is so desirous of ruling it. It had been heralded forth for the
                        past week that there was to be a grand rally of the loyal men on that occasion, and "Frank" Meyer's prospect for
                        Congress was to be darkened terribly. Urgent appeals were sent out to
                        individuals, but alas! loyalty was not forthcoming; and the meeting held
                        there proved to be a burlesque on the Radical party. By an actual count
                        there were but seventeen Republican voters there. Every other man was a
                        Democrat. And yet this is the place that used to turn out its hundreds to a
                        Republican meeting.</p>
                    <p>The orators were Fred Foreman, W. U. Brewer, Jere. Cook and John Stewart. We
                        can pass by the speeches of Foreman and Brewer for they contained nothing;
                        also the speech of Cook who spoke of the beauties of the income tax and,
                        being a good mathematician, showed very conclusively (to himself) that there
                        had been a reduction of expenditures during the Grant regime. But Stewart!
                        Oh how loyal he was! He became so enraged at the audacity of Meyers for
                        daring to run for Congress, that he imagined that he was in the army again
                        "and thrice he fought his battles o'er and thrice he slew the slain." He
                        declared that Meyers was a Copperhead, and at
                        this juncture his voice was drowned by three hearty
                            cheers for Meyers. Somewhat disconcerted he pounced on Skinner
                        comparing him to Benedict Arnold and here again his
                            voice was drowned by cheers for Skinner. He next proceeded to
                        inform his seventeen voters that the political skies never looked brighter
                        for the Radicals. But the seventeen were sad, for they thought of
                        Connecticut, New York, North Carolina and Oregon. He said that no
                        Republicans would leave the ranks on account of negro suffrage; and yet by
                        his side, within four feet of him, stood a man who declared as for him and
                        his sons they intended in the future as not in
                        the past to vote the full Democratic ticket. And we can tell Mr. Stewart
                        that if he is desirous of seeing more such men let him visit this community;
                        find out the temper of those who have heretofore been identified with his
                        party and he will go home a sadder and wiser man. In the meantime let them
                        have another "grand rally" at Upton.</p>
                    <p>Yours, MONTGOMERY.</p>
