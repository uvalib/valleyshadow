                <transcript>
                    <p>In a supplement to the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>, we, last week,
                        presented to our readers, the message of President Grant, but were unable to
                        make any comments upon it, owing to the late hour at which it was received.
                        The American people have, no doubt, been surprised and horrified at the
                        effrontery of our Chief Magistrate in following his acknowledgment to
                        Providence, for abundant crops, for having been "spared from foreign
                        complications and war with foreign nations," and for the restoration of
                        comparative harmony, with such a reckless and untruthful sentence as
                        this:--"It is to be regretted, however, that a free exercise of the elective
                        franchise has, by violence and intimidation, been denied to citizens in
                        exceptional cases in several of the States lately in rebellion, <emph
                            rend="italic">and the verdict of the people has thereby been
                        reversed</emph>."</p>
                    <p>We say <emph rend="italic">reckless and untruthful</emph> because of the
                        meaning the President doubtless desires to convey. He is evidently stung to
                        the quick by the recent Conservative triumphs in States which he and other
                        Radical leaders fondly supposed had been "fixed up" permanently for the
                        Radical party.--He seeks to convey the idea that the fears of the newly
                        enfranchised negroes were so operated upon by threats and violence that they
                        remained away from the polls, or, if they went, were prevented from voting,
                        and "the verdict of the people has been thereby reversed." This is not
                        dealing with the people in a spirit of candor. He knows very well that the
                        defeat of his party and the condemnation of his Administration are not owing
                        to this cause at all, but in a great measure, to another cause which throws
                        the responsibility of the defeat upon the President himself. Viewed in this
                        light the language of the message is true, but we can not conceive that the
                        President was confessing his sins when he wrote it. "An honest confession is
                        good for the soul," but he is not in the habit of making honest confessions.</p>
                    <p>In what sense is this language true?--Why, <emph rend="italic">the President
                            sent his soldiers into those States for the purpose of controlling the
                            elections there</emph>. Through the "violence and intimidation"
                        practiced by these soldiers, the elective franchise was denied to many white
                        voters, and this conduct of the Administration was received with such
                        disfavor that the real republican spirit, which can not brook such
                        interference, rebelled against it, and the former verdict of carpetbag
                        scalawags and worthless negroes has thereby been reversed. We agree with the
                        President that "it is to be regretted" that such intimidation and violence
                        have been <sic>practised</sic> by him, and no one should make greater haste
                        than he to get down on his knees and pray for pardon on account of it. But
                        if such violence and intimidation were necessary to awaken the people to a
                        sense of the outrages which the Administration has committed, then, though
                        the trial has been a severe one to the Southern people, and the strain has
                        been great upon republican institutions, it is <emph rend="italic"
                        >not</emph> a matter of regret that the President was weak enough to attempt
                        to retain power by this violence and intimidation. It was he who announced
                        that he would "have no policy to enforce against the will of the people."
                        The people are heartily tired of, and thoroughly disgusted and enraged at,
                        the interference of the military at the polls and in civil affairs. Let the
                        President not seek to enforce <emph rend="italic">this</emph> policy against
                        the will of the people.</p>
                    <p>The President has no word of sympathy, or encouragement, for Cuba. He says
                        that "it is not understood that the condition of the insurrection in Cuba
                        has materially changed since the close of the last session of Congress." The
                        injuries resulting to American citizens by reason of the "system of
                        arbitrary arrests, of close confinement, and military trial and execution of
                        persons suspected of complicity with the insurgents, and of summary embargo
                        of them and their properties and sequestration of their resources by
                        executive warrants"--which system was inaugurated and carried out by the
                        authorities of Spain--have been represented to the Spanish government from
                        April 18th, 1869, to June last, but the negotiations are still pending, and
                        we are not informed by the President that he has any hope that definite
                        action will be taken soon. It is a disgrace to this republic that this delay
                        in the vindication of the rights of American citizens is permitted by the
                        President, and that, too, in favor of Spain, when her authorities are
                        striving in the most brutal manner to crush the gallant people of Cuba, who
                        are struggling to relieve themselves from the yoke of tyranny and who are
                        looking anxiously towards annexation with the United States. But as long as
                        the President retains Hamilton Fish as Secretary of State, no other course
                        will be pursued.</p>
                    <p>The President renews his recommendations in favor of the San Domingo job,
                        saying that time has only confirmed him in the view that the best interests
                        of this country, commercially and materially, demand the ratification of the
                        treaty for the annexation of this island. There is no subject treated of in
                        the message about which the President grows so earnest and emphatic, as this
                        one. As the <emph rend="italic">Morning Patriot</emph> said, one would think
                        that, like Helmbold's Buchu, San Domingo would "cure all the ills that flesh
                        is heir to." It is set forth as a perfect panacea for all the nation's woes.
                        But it is doubtful whether this scheme of the President--so generally
                        denounced by the press and the people last session--will be endorsed by the
                        representatives of the people during the present session. There are so many
                        ugly rumors afloat and so many direct charges made as to the peculiar
                        interest which the President has in this project, that honest men in
                        Congress will hesitate long before they allow the shadow of suspicion to
                        rest upon their names on account of their connection with it. Those lots
                        which are said to be staked off and marked "Grant" are thought to account
                        for the extraordinary interest which the great receiver of good gifts
                        manifests in this annexation scheme. So great is this zeal that on the
                        opening of Congress, an effort was made to have Senator Patterson, who is
                        hostile to the San Domingo job, dropped from the Committee on Foreign
                        Relations and Senator Conkling substituted in his place. Senator Conkling
                        was opposed to it also last session, but is said to have undergone a
                        remarkable conversion. This effort failed, and the President is reported to
                        be considerable mortified at the result.</p>
                    <p>The following remarkable language is found in the message in relation to the
                        Alabama claims:</p>
                    <p>I regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment of the
                        claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted by that
                        Government during the rebellion. The cabinet of London, so far as its views
                        have been expressed, does not appear to be willing to concede that Her
                        Majesty's Government was guilty of any negligence, or did or permitted any
                        act during the war, of which the United States has just cause for complaint.
                        Our firm and unalterable convictions are directly the reverse. I, therefore,
                        recommend to Congress to authorize the appointment of a commission to take
                        proof of the amounts and the ownership of these several claims, on notice to
                        the representative of her Majesty at Washington, and that authority be given
                        for the settlement of these claims by the United States, so that the
                        Government shall have the ownership of the private claims as well as the
                        responsible control of all the demands against Great Britain. <emph
                            rend="italic">It cannot be necessary to add that whenever Her Majesty's
                            government shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment
                            of these claims, the United States will enter upon their consideration
                            with an earnest desire for a conclusion consistent with the honor and
                            dignity of both nations</emph>.</p>
                    <p>It might, perhaps, be best that the United States Government should have the
                        ownership of the private claims, though we notice that Hon. Reverdy Johnson
                        recommends each of the claimants to proceed for himself. But when, in
                        addition to this, the President speaks of the Government having the
                        responsible control of <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the demands against
                        Great Britain, there is a vagueness about it that the people will fail to
                        understand. What are the other demands beside the private claims? When Mr.
                        Johnson went as Minister to England, his instructions only covered private
                        claims, and he was not instructed to demand a settlement for anything else.
                        He had no notice that the Administration desired him to make any other
                        demand until the Senate refused to ratify the Clarendon Johnson treaty.</p>
                    <p>But what is most remarkable about the President's language is his evident
                        purpose to give England her own time to settle these claims. He says that
                            "<emph rend="italic">whenever her Majesty's Government shall entertain a
                            desire</emph> for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims, the
                        United States will enter upon their consideration," &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Jones owes Smith a debt, but denies that he owes it. He refuses to pay it and
                        is in no hurry to enter into negotiations for its adjustment. Is it likely
                        that it will ever suit his humor to pay it? What would be thought of Smith
                        as a business man if he should say "whenever Jones shall entertain a desire
                        for a full and friendly adjustment of my claim, I will enter upon its
                        consideration." Would it not rather be advisable for Smith to institute
                        measures to compel a settlement of his claim?</p>
                    <p>So England owes the United States. She denies the debt and refuses payment.
                        She declines to enter upon fresh negotiations for the settlement of the
                        claim. And President Grant proposes to wait until "Her Majesty's Government
                        entertains a desire" to settle it. It is something new for a debtor to give
                        a creditor all the time he desires to pay a debt. But President Grant
                        intends to treat England with still greater indulgence, for he proposes to
                        wait England's pleasure about entering upon negotiations to ascertain how
                        much she owes us. There were times when England did not treat the United
                        States with such delicate consideration.</p>
                    <p>The President is manifestly frightened at the Revenue Reform movement. The
                        lesson which Brown and Schurz taught him in Missouri has had the effect of
                        making him tremble for his chances for another term and he tries, by dealing
                        in "glittering generalities," to save himself and party from defeat. He
                        talks of tariff for revenue being necessary, as if everybody did not know
                        and admit it. But he does not say that a tariff for revenue is the only
                        tariff he is in favor of, or define what articles he desires to see
                        "protected" and to what extent. He turns up his nose at the revenue reform
                        movement, by saying that "revenue reform has not been defined by any of its
                        advocates to my knowledge, <emph rend="italic">but seems to be accepted as
                            something which is to supply every man's wants, without any cost or
                            effort on his part</emph>." Nobody has claimed anything of this kind for
                        it, and the President has only disgusted still further his dissatisfied
                        party friends, by making any allusion at all and, worst of all, <emph
                            rend="italic">such</emph> an allusion, in a state paper. If the
                        President wished to enlighten the country by defining his views on the
                        tariff, the people would have read them with interest,if not with profit,
                        but when he takes occasion to deride a popular movement in one of his
                        messages, without explaining his own position, except by the utterance of
                        such general principles as everybody acknowledges, his hold upon the masses
                        is wonderfully weakened.</p>
                    <p>The people are not to be hoodwinked by such clap-trap as "reduction of
                        taxation, and tariff to be so arranged as to afford relief to the greatest
                        number." They would rather know what taxes he thinks ought to be reduced.
                        They want the infamous income tax abolished. They would be glad to know his
                        opinion on that. They want an adjustment of the tariff which will "afford
                        relief to the greatest number," but they would rejoice to know <emph
                            rend="italic">how</emph> the tariff should be adjusted, in the judgment
                        of the President, to accomplish that end. They want to see every law
                        enforced, but they prefer to see it done <emph rend="italic">after</emph>
                        the law has been broken instead of <emph rend="italic">before</emph>.
                        Americans are presumed to be law-abiding citizens. They want to see every
                        tax collected as long as it is legal, but they desire to have it done by
                        civil process. They have no love for this business of putting a soldier with
                        a bayonet at the back of the tax-gatherer. They want to see economy in the
                        disbursement of the taxes, but not that kind of economy which pays the
                        tax-gatherers two-thirds of the taxes that have been wrung from the people.
                        They want the debt of the nation paid to the last cent, but they do not
                        believe in paralyzing the industry and rendering stagnant the business of
                        the country in order to pay it in a few years. They want "a reduction of
                        taxes as rapidly as the requirements of the country will admit," but they
                        would like to know just how rapidly the requirements of the country will
                        admit of it. On this subject they are anxious, but the President throws no
                        light on it. They want "honest and fair dealings with all other peoples, to
                        the end that war with all its blighting consequences may be avoided," but
                        they would not see the national honor stained for the mere purpose of
                        keeping Spain and England in a good humor. They are in favor of "a reform in
                        the whole civil service of the country," but when President Grant turns
                        Secretary Cox out of his Cabinet for making an earnest effort in that
                        direction, they doubt the sincerity of this declaration in the message. They
                        believe in "a pure, untrammeled ballot," but since the President has made
                        his Administration infamous, by the employment of troops to overawe and
                        intimidate voters, they do not regard him as a safe judge as to what "a
                        pure, <sic>unntrammeled</sic> ballot" is.</p>
                    <p>General Grant has fallen in the public estimation very much since his
                        accession to the Presidency, and this message will not be likely to restore
                        to him the confidence of the people. He may as well get off the track for
                        1872.</p>

                <summary>Provides scathing commentary on President Grant's recent message.
                    Criticizes the administration's policies concerning Cuba, San Domingo, the
                    Alabama claims, and tariffs. Also detests Grant's remark that blacks were
                    intimidated from voting when soldiers in the South supposedly keep white voters
                    from the polls. Believes Grant has lost touch with the sentiments of the people
                    and stands no chance of re-election in two years.</summary>
