<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On account of the productiveness of her soil, Franklin always has ranked
                        among the wealthy counties of Pennsylvania. It is to agriculture almost
                        exclusively that she owes her rank. Of manufactories she has but few, and of
                        the vast quantity of valuable ore now known to exist within her limits, very
                        little use has heretofore been made. From present indications, however, the
                        day can not be very far distant when Franklin will take her place among the
                        leading iron-making counties of the State. Recent explorations have shown
                        that iron ore of the best quality abounds not only along the foot of the
                        South mountain and the Tuscarora, but also in the heart of the valley, at no
                        great distance from Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>This town ought to become a great iron-manufacturing point. No better sites
                        for Furnaces can be found anywhere than on the west side of the
                            Conocochengue, from the bridge at King street down to
                        the "turnhole." The waste water of the Falling Spring would suffice to
                        supply a large number of establishments. Nothing that can be hoped for here
                        would do half as much for us as would the erection of extensive Iron Works
                        in our midst. Add this source of prosperity to our agricultural resources,
                        and Franklin would soon excel any county of her size in the State for
                        wealth.</p>
                    <p>Could not something be done to induce men of capital in other parts of the
                        State to erect Iron Works here? It would "pay" our business men and property
                        owners to raise a purse and purchase a site and present it to any Company in
                        Philadelphia, Reading, Lancaster, or other place possessed of capital and
                        skill, who would build a Furnace on it. To our water and our ore we have
                        reason to believe there will soon be added cheap coal, through an extension
                        of the Southern Pennsylvania Railroad westward from Loudon to Broad Top.
                        Will not some of our active citizens "lay their heads together" and see
                        whether something can not be done to secure the erection of Iron Works at
                        this place?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The colored people of Chambersburg have for some time past experienced
                        considerable inconvenience from the want of a suitable place to bury their
                        dead. The small graveyards attached to their churches have long since been
                        full to overflowing, and they have been excluded from Cedar Grove Cemetery
                        and other burial places of the whites. Through the benevolence of T. B.
                        Kennedy, Esq., and of Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. M'Lellan, this want of the
                        colored people is now about to be supplied. Mr. Kennedy has donated to them
                        a piece of land containing about one acre, and Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs.
                        M'Lellan have rendered them some much-needed assistance and counsel in
                        relation to the laying out and management of a Cemetery upon it. The land
                        donated adjoins the old Fair Grounds on the western side of town, a short
                        distance beyond the borough limits. It lies near the turnpike, with which it
                        communicates by a street just laid out, and is an elevated and handsome
                        piece of ground, admirably adapted to the purpose for which it has been set
                        apart. It is the intention of Mr. Kennedy to deed the land to five Trustees,
                        all colored men, three of whom have already been selected, via: Henry Monks,
                        Ceaser Ball and Asken Hall. The two others have not yet been selected. Those
                        above named are among the most intelligent and most respectable of our
                        colored residents, and we do not doubt that they will execute the important
                        trust confided to them faithfully and well.</p>

<b>Wilson College</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Wilson Female College will open on October 12th. The paper suggests that
                    the school provide some means of conveyance for Chambersburg women who will
                    attend the school but not board there. "We take it as certain that every parent
                    sending a daughter to the institution would rather pay from $15 to $25 per year
                    for the omnibus, than have his child risk and probably ruin her health by the
                    over-exertion and exposure incident to walking out and in." The school year will
                    cover winter and the rainy spring and fall seasons, and walking, even if it
                    seems like a good idea, could prove disastrous. "Even in the weather best
                    adapted to walking, when the sky is clear and the air is crisp, young ladies
                    could not walk daily without the risk of injury, unless great care were taken.
                    They would necessarily become somewhat heated, and the first impulse of most
                    young people in that condition is to sit down in a cool draft of air, and the
                    almost invariable result is a cold in the head, throat or lungs."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Delegates are to be elected on Saturday evening next who will meet in
                        convention on Thursday, the 4th proximo. These primary meetings should be
                        well attended and great care should be taken to select intelligent and
                        upright men as delegates. Men of good judgment are needed who will sacrifice
                        all personal interests for the general good. Abuses have recently crept into
                        our Conventions, the repetition of which ought to be prevented. Proper care
                        has not been taken in the selection of candidates, so that in some cases men
                        utterly incompetent have been nominated for important positions. This is
                        true of both parties.</p>
                    <p>There are not many offices to be filled at the election next Fall. But a few
                        of these are important. Perry and Franklin are to elect again two members of
                        the Legislature. The main subject of legislative interest to our people is
                        the Border Damage Bill. They do not intend to surrender their claim on the
                        State government for payment, and they, of course, intend to elect men who
                        will further their interests and press their claim with vigor. In the
                        Democratic Convention there will, doubtless, be no difficulty in making the
                        legislative nomination, as we understand it is conceded to Captain George W.
                        Skinner who was untiring in his efforts in behalf of the border claim bill
                        last Winter. He was an efficient representative, and the Convention will, we
                        doubt not, cheerfully acknowledge his services by tendering him a unanimous
                        re-nomination.</p>
                    <p>A Commissioner is to be chosen. This office has recently come to be a very
                        important one. The business interests of the County have become so
                        multiformed and varied as to require excellent business men as
                        Commissioners. Such a man it is the duty of the Convention to nominate. He
                        ought to be a man of ability and strict honesty. There are ugly rumors
                        afloat, whether having any foundation in fact or not, in relation to the
                        Commissioners' Office. The Democratic party owes it to itself and to the
                        people to nominate a man who will be above all suspicion of being influenced
                        by corrupt motives. The Convention should take good care not to weaken the
                        ticket by an unwise selection for this office.</p>
                    <p>But, perhaps, the most important duty the Convention will have to perform is
                        the selection of Congressional conferees. We are about to enter into a
                        vigorous contest to defeat that little demagogue, John Cessna. We all desire
                        to see that man nominated, whoever he may be, who can poll the largest
                        number of votes against him. To secure the nomination of that man will be
                        the aim of every good Democrat. The fight will be a fierce one. The Radicals
                        have the negro vote. That vote will be neutralized by the dissatisfaction
                        with and disgust at the fanaticism of the Radical party, on the part of
                        conservative white men. Cessna's own tremendous unpopularity will tell
                        wonderfully in favor of the Democratic candidate. How important, therefore,
                        that our candidate should be a man of ability and personal popularity!</p>
                    <p>There has been, heretofore, an extraordinary looseness in the manner of
                        selecting Congressional conferees. At one time the candidate has been
                        allowed to make his selection. At another, the County Committee assumed the
                        power to choose. But the most common way has been after the other business
                        of the Convention was finished, when all was excitement and confusion and
                        the delegates were getting nervously anxious to go home--for some one to
                        rise with a written resolution, declaring that "Mr. --------, Mr. --------,
                        and Mr. ---------- are hereby selected as conferees to meet the conferees
                        from other counties,&amp;c." The resolution passes without half the
                        delegates knowing what it is. Such a proceeding is decidedly
                            illogical</p>
                    <p>The selection of conferees is the most important business of the next County
                        Convention. If the Convention should declare in favor of one of our own
                        citizens, in our judgment, it should hither allow him to select his own
                        conferees, or it should go into a ballot for conferees just as for other
                        nominations.</p>
                    <p>The danger in allowing a resolution to pass in which three persons are named
                        as conferees is that those three persons may be committed to some particular Congressional candidate from some
                        other county, who might not be the choice of the people of this County, and
                        in this way, conventions are ofttimes deceived. It is a sly way of
                        accomplishing what designing leaders do not care to do openly. Such
                        resolutions have more snakes in them than any
                        other kind. They are often intended to defeat in the Conference the man in
                        whose favor the Convention has declared.</p>
                    <p>By putting eight, ten or a dozen good men in nomination--men of integrity,
                        intelligence and sound judgment--and selecting three from these by ballot,
                        the Convention would have some assurance that the Franklin County Conferees
                        would act for the best interests of the party, without reference to the
                        grinding of any particular axes.</p>
                    <p>A good rule to govern delegates in the selection of conferees would be not to
                        vote for any man who solicits votes for himself or has others to solicit
                        them for him, for it is safe to infer that such a man is anxious to go into
                        the Conference as "some other man's man." The delegates should act upon
                        their own judgments, in a spirit of manly independence, and anxious only to
                        secure the best nomination that can be made. We respectfully, but earnestly
                        ask their attention to the correction of this loose mode of selecting
                        Congressional conferees.</p>
                    <p>Animated as we are by a desire to promote the best interests and insure the
                        success of the Democratic party, we have imperfectly thrown out these
                        suggestions, trusting that our Democratic friends will consider them in the
                        spirit in which they are offered.</p>
