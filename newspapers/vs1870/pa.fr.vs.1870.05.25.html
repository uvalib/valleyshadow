<b>The New York Elections. Victory for White Men.</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper hails Democratic electoral victories across the state of New York
                    as a blow to Radicals and a "victory for white men." "Although some fifteen
                    thousand negroes were clothed with the right of suffrage and exercised it in
                    support of the Radical candidates, twice that number of white men came out from
                    the ranks of the Radical organization, and, enlisting under the banner of the
                    White Men's Party, fought the good fight with courage and unswerving zeal, and
                    won a most glorious victory. White men have made up their minds to rule this
                    country."<br>

<b>A Bill to Imprison White Men so as to Let Negroes Vote</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Denounces laws passed in Congress for enforcing the 15th amendment, claims
                    its an assault on state sovereignty. Claims the only way to reverse the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>So obnoxious is the Fifteenth Amendment to the white people of the country,
                        that Congress finds it necessary to pass the most stringent bill for its
                        enforcement. The pains and penalties prescribed by the Act that recently
                        passed the Senate are terrible. These "wards of the nation" are to be
                        protected in the exercise of the right of suffrage in every State,
                        territory, district, municipality, or other territorial sub-division, no
                        matter what may be contained in any constitution, law, custom, usage or
                        regulation of any State of Territory to the contrary. Congress, at one
                        sweep, wipes out the power of any State to regulate the elective franchise
                        within its limits for any purpose. If this is not a centralization of power
                        in the General Government equal to any demand ever made by the original
                        advocates of that theory, we fail to understand the effect of this new
                        measure. Why it is almost as much as a white man's liberty is worth for him
                        to attempt to challenge a negro's vote, for he
                        may be construed to be hindering him in the
                        exercise of the right of suffrage. White men, the only privilege you have
                        left, and the Lord only knows how long this may be left to you, is to vote against the party that forces such a monstrosity
                            upon you. Your necks are under the heels of these Radical
                        fanatics. They do not stop to reason. They are hurried on by passion from
                        one outrage to another. And, if allowed to go on unchecked they will
                        undertake ere long to disfranchise those who dare to vote against their
                        nefarious schemes. New York has led off gloriously. Conservative men of
                        Franklin County, cast in your lot with us and help us to crush the Radical
                        demagogues who pretend to represent Pennsylvania in Congress. Let us teach
                        them that the white men of the old Keystone State have rights which they are
                        determined shall be respected. Join with us in the cry, White men must rule America.</p>

<b>Grant's Insult to Hancock</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper criticizes Grant for refusing to award General Winfield Scott
                    Hancock command of a division. Grant based his decision on political
                    differences. In the opinion of the editor, the move dishonors a war hero and

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some weeks ago we stated that immediately upon the issuing of the
                        proclamation announcing the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, John
                        Cessna began a correspondence with the colored men of Chambersburg with a
                        view to procuring their votes. We now have the pleasure of laying before our
                        readers one of the letters since addressed to a colored man in this Borough,
                        by the Honorable John's Secretary. It seems that the member from the 16th
                        Congressional District is able to keep a clerk for the simple purpose of
                        conducting his correspondence with the negroes and "sending them all the
                        speeches and documents he may have." Cessna wants a list of these voters for
                        the purpose of calculating his chances for re-election. We tell him now that
                        if he gets 800 negro votes in this Congressional District, it will not save
                        him. He ought to strain his ear and listen to the mutterings of discontent
                        that are coming up from the throats of white men who voted for him before,
                        but who have now joined the "white men's party," and, of course, intend to
                        tomahawk him next time. Let him get 500 negro votes in Franklin County, if
                        he can, and we will still beat him 800 here without any trouble. Every day
                        white men are declaring their purpose to quit the rotten hulk of Radicalism.
                        These men will vote the straight Democratic ticket. But these are not all
                        that will strike at John Cessna. Go where you will in this County you can
                        hardly meet a man who speaks well of him. He is as deeply despised as any
                        man within the range of our acquaintance. How well he will run among the
                        Republicans can be predicted from this state of facts. But here is the
                        letter:</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON,<br> May 2, 1870.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir: This package of speeches is from the
                        Hon. Jno. Cessna, who desires that you distribute them among the colored
                        voters in Chambersburg. They are the speeches of Hon. Mr. Revels the U.S.
                        Senator from Miss., the colored man who has held that very high and exalted
                        position.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Cessna requested that you have a list of all the colored voters in
                        Chambersburg made out and sent to him, as he wants to send them all the
                        speeches and documents he may have. Please attend to this at once and send
                        on as many names as possible and direct your letters to Hon. Jno. Cessna,

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. John Doebler was elected last Fall as the Assessor of this
                        Borough.--Owing to private reasons, he resigned his position recently. It
                        became the duty of the Commissioners to appoint an Assessor. They appointed
                        Mr. George Foreman. A Board having a Democratic
                        majority selects an extreme Radical as Assessor.
                        Here was the opportunity to insure an honest registration of the voters of
                        this Borough by the appointment of some faithful and competent Democrat, and especially was it important because
                        of the addition to the registry of the names of the colored voters. A
                        Democrat would have prevented the registration of those negroes who, we
                        understand, are to be imported from Maryland to help to beat white men.</p>
                    <p>When Democrats elect men to office they expect them to carry out the
                        principles of the party, or at least to do nothing that will tend to the
                        defeat of those principles.</p>
                    <p>Contrast with this the action of a Republican Board a few years ago. Mr. Wm.
                        Flory had been elected Assessor of this Borough. He died, and a Republican
                        Board appointed Mr. John Rhodes, dec'd., a thorough Republican. That party
                        never does such foolish things as a matter of personal favor.</p>
                    <p>We are heartily sick of, and disgusted at this kind of Democracy. We regret
                        that we obliged to write thus, on account of our personal relations with the
                        Democratic Commissioners, but it has become a necessity. The Democracy can not overlook such a want of fidelity to
                        their interests.</p>

<b>The Orrstown Election</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>ORRSTOWN, May 20, 1870.</p>
                    <p>Editors Spirit:--The local editor of the Repository last week took advantage of a little
                        progressive movement in our Borough and styled it a Radical victory, desiring to convey the impression that because
                            two Radicals had been elected, "Orrstown, the
                        former stronghold of Democracy, ratifies the fifteenth amendment." This is
                        an impression far from being correct, and I think a mere statement of the
                        facts will at once set the matter in its proper light.</p>
                    <p>A regular ticket was nominated by the Democrats at their convention, but as
                        this ticket was composed entirely of men opposed to certain improvements, on
                        the following day a ticket was formed of men favoring these improvements,
                        made up in part of the regularly nominated ticket and besides containing the
                        two Radicals elected. As but little interest is manifested in our Borough
                        elections, it was no matter of surprise to those who got afloat the new
                        ticket to know that it was elected by a small majority. But it was a matter
                        of much surprise to those of us who supported
                        this ticket to have it heralded about as a Radical victory and every
                        Democrat who voted for it, most severely condemns this unkind act of our
                        Radical neighbors. Not a half dozen Radical votes were polled, yet they cry
                        because of a mere local success, "Radical victory." The truth is, were an
                        election to be held in our Borough to-day both of these men would meet with
                        a most inglorious defeat. There is no complaint of them as public officers,
                        but it certainly is a question of honesty whether they did right in
                        proclaiming themselves victorious champions of the Radical party because a
                        mere local matter without any regard to politics, was the sole reason for
                        their selection.</p>
                    <p>Neither Mr. Dehart or Mr. Kniseley, the successful Radicals, owe their
                        election to their personal popularity or any superior qualification they
                        possess over their defeated opponents (as the Repository would have its readers belive) but only because they were supporters of this new measure. It is but
                        justice to the Democrats who supported this ticket to have these facts made
                        known, that it may be plainly understood that they voted for no Radical for
                        political reasons, and that they consider it unmanly and unjust in the
                        successful Radicals to have so attempted to construe it before the public.
                        Probably the astute correspondent of the Repository will find Orrstown not as entirely given up to the
                        reprobateness of Radicalism, when he comes before its people again for their
                        suffrages.</p>
                    <p>Hoping this may fully explain away "the ratification victory," I am truly
                        yours,<br> A Supporter of the <br> IMPROVEMENT TICKET.</p>
