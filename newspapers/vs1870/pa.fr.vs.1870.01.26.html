<b>Carrying Concealed Weapons</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Calls for the legislature to pass a bill banning concealed weapons.
                    Believes they are instigators of crime and a threat to the safety of the
                    community.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is the duty of our State Legislature to enact a law against the practice
                        of carrying concealed weapons. There never was a time, in the history of our
                        country, when this practice prevailed to such an alarming extent as it does
                        now. It is one of the most fruitful causes of crime. Men become engaged in
                        conversation, get excited, then angry, a bitter war of words ensues, blows
                        are exchanged, and then, one of the party draws a knife, or pistol, or some
                        other weapon, and inflicts a dangerous, or, perhaps, fatal wound upon the
                        other.</p>
                    <p>In our own County, we have men who go armed all the time with dangerous
                        weapons. The "billy," the knife, the revolver are constantly carried by such
                        fellows. The negroes of our town carry razors in the legs of their boots,
                        which they do not hesitate to use on a light provocation.</p>
                    <p>There is no necessity for carrying these weapons for self defence. Prohibit
                        all from carrying them and there will be no danger to anybody. Let the
                        punishment be tolerably severe and this monstrous evil can be checked. All
                        good citizens will unite in the attempt to suppress the practice, for it is
                        fraught with great danger to the peace of every community. Let our Senator,
                        or Representatives not allow the present Session to go by without an effort
                        to pass a bill to punish this dangerous class of ruffians.</p>

<b>Go Up Higher</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports with dismay the number of states which have ratified the 15th
                    amendment and the election of a black man as Senator from Mississippi. Asks
                    Conservative Republicans how they feel about this turn of events.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals are rapidly pushing the negro business to the farthest extreme.
                        Not only is it announced that twenty-six States have ratified the article
                        known as the fifteenth amendment, leaving only two to be supplied, but what
                        is still more gratifying to Radical hearts, a genuine, full-blooded negro
                        has been elected a United States Senator from the State of Mississippi.
                        There is but one step higher, and that is to the Presidential Chair. No
                        wonder that there is joy in the Radical camp. The name of this free American
                        citizen Senator of African descent, is H. R. Revels. He has been elected for
                        the term ending in 1870, and Governor Alcorn will then succeed him. General
                        Ames has been elected for the term ending in 1875. Thus we have a negro and
                        a military carpet-bagger elected as Senators from Mississippi. How do our
                        Conservative friends of the opposition party relish this dose of "the
                        nigger," after having laughed at our predictions to this effect as being
                        foolish?</p>

<b>Couldn't Stand It</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes how blacks were given a post of honor at Geary's inauguration and
                    how white firemen withdrew in disgust. Predicts that only worse will happen
                    under present "fanaticism".<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Governor Geary was inaugurated for his second term last week. A regiment of
                        negroes from Philadelphia was given the post of honor in the procession, and
                        the white firemen of Harrisburg, numbering about five hundred, withdrew in
                        disgust. Considerable discussion has arisen from this action, and the
                        conduct of the managers of the ceremonies is greatly condemned, whilst that
                        of the firemen is applauded. If we must endure the negro in the United
                        States Senate, however, we must learn to endure him in processions and at
                        the polls. This country has certainly been given over by Providence to the
                        reign of a most horrible fanaticism.</p>
