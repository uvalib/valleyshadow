<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>During the campaign, the Radical leaders of Franklin County were willing to
                        foot all the bills the payment of which was necessary to qualify the negroes
                        to vote. All they asked of them was that they should vote for Cessna and the
                        whole ticket. Accordingly, in the Borough of Chambersburg, out of the
                        $100,000 corruption fund, they paid the taxes of over two hundred colored
                        suffragists. All but a few who were property holders, were assessed
                        twenty-eight cents and this was the amount that had to be forthcoming in
                        every case.</p>
                    <p>Now, all this was cheerfully paid under the expectation and in the hope of a
                        glorious triumph. But when defeat was their lot instead of victory, they
                        began to regret the useless expenditure of this money, and, after casting
                        about for some time to reimburse themselves, they hit upon the idea of
                        assessing each colored voter seventy-five cents.
                        They knew that a large portion of them could not, and would not pay
                        anything, and they thought that by assessing three quarters of a dollar,
                        they might raise from those who were able to pay as much as they had
                        expended for all. Colored agents were selected to go among the negroes and
                        collect this assessment. One of these agents got from the poor darkies for
                        this purpose about twenty dollars which he
                        "salted down" in his own pockets, saying "if I hab to do de dirty work, I'se
                        gwine to be paid for it."</p>
                    <p>The darkies say it isn't cheap work voting the
                        Radical ticket.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some time ago, a woman about thirty years of age, came from Cumberland county
                        to the Alms House, having with her a child three or four years old. About
                        nine weeks ago she was confined and gave birth to a male infant.--Both the
                        children remained at the Alms House and the mother went to the Montgomery
                        Hotel to work. On last Wednesday morning, she went out to the Alms House and
                        took the children away.</p>
                    <p>About ten o'clock of the same morning a child was found in a woodpile on the
                        ground attached to Mr. T. B. Wood's Foundry in this Borough. Its clothing
                        was there with it. This fact was soon noised about town. Dr. Boyle, who is
                        the Physician at the Alms House and who was present at the birth of the
                        infant to which we referred, went to the house to which this child had been
                        taken and immediately recognized the child of the woodpile as the one that
                        belonged to the Alms House. He went to the Montgomery Hotel and confronted
                        the woman telling her that she had abandoned her child, that the fact was
                        known, and that she must at once take it in charge.--She answered him
                        nothing, but afterwards went to the house and claimed the child.--It was
                        discovered that she had made her arrangements to leave town in the one
                        o'clock train of Wednesday and commit the child to whatever fate might
                        befall it.</p>
                    <p>A colored woman expressed an earnest desire to take the child and raise it,
                        and to this proposition the heartless woman cheerfully acceded, parting with
                        it without any apparent reluctance whatever. She took the older child and
                        left on Thursday. She gives the name of Elizabeth Grimes. She is a white
                        woman, but the father of the child is certainly a black man.</p>
