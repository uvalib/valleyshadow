<b>Victory</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Celebrates the victory Democrats achieved in Franklin County. Credits the
                    victory to Conservative voters from both parties who abandoned Radical
                    doctrines.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Once more we have met the enemy and they are ours. In spite of Cessna's
                        immense corruption fund, in spite of the six hundred and fifty negroes who
                        voted the Radical ticket, in spite of the unflagging exertions of the "Bread
                        and Butter Brigade," the Conservative men of Franklin County have won a
                        glorious triumph. The infidelity of the Radical leaders has been most
                        signally rebuked. Their broken pledges rise up to haunt them and will not
                        down at their bidding. They cheated the people, and the people have uttered
                        their condemnation of their treacherous conduct. The fraudulent ratification
                        of the Fifteenth Amendment has benefitted them nothing here. On the contrary
                        it has lost them many Republican votes and given the County permanently to
                        the Democracy.</p>
                    <p>The returns from the County, as far as they have been received, indicate a
                        majority for Meyers over Cessna of from one hundred and fifty to two
                        hundred. Skinner, for Assembly, leads the ticket largely and will very
                        likely have a majority of three hundred over Mahon. The majority for
                        Milliken will be in the neighborhood of one hundred. From the advices we
                        have as we go to press, the whole Democratic County ticket is elected.</p>
                    <p>For this signal victory, the Democracy owe their heartiest thanks to the
                        Conservative men who have heretofore acted with the Republican party, but
                        who, disgusted at the negro suffrage movement, have joined heads with us to
                        save the county from the evil consequences of Radical doctrines. They were
                        long suffering and patient, believing and trusting in the honesty of their
                        leaders, but the faithlessness of these leaders was too manifest to deceive
                        them this time. Thanks, many thanks for their timely and powerful aid. They
                        will never have reason to regret this action.</p>
                    <p>To the Democrats, we say, you have made a noble fight. You have been appalled
                        by no obstacles that were thrown in your pathway. You have battled for the
                        same principles to which you have clung through many disasters. And victory,
                        complete victory has crowned your efforts.</p>
                    <p>This is a Sedan defeat to the Radical party in Franklin County. This election
                        was their last chance to save themselves. They voted the negroes in droves,
                        but negro votes would not win. Henceforth, white men will control the
                        affairs of Franklin County.</p>
