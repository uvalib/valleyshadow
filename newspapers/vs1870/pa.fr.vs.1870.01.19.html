<b>Virginia</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Notes with satisfaction that even Radicals are getting tired of
                    Reconstruction. Though some diehards insist on more demands, most congressmen
                    are willing to readmit Virginia immediately. Emphasizes the fact that Franklin
                    county's own Congressman, Cessna, disapproves of Virginia's readmission. Prints

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals in Congress had a protracted and interesting squabble last week
                        over the question of the admission of Virginia.--In the Senate, the debate
                        between Sumner and Trumbull was spiced with a good deal of personal
                        bitterness. Sumner and Drake were, of course, bent on prescribing certain
                        other conditions before she should be admitted. They were supported by a few
                        others. But the most of the Radical Senators seem to have become heartily
                        tired of this work of reconstruction, and expressed their intention to vote
                        for her admission without any further conditions, inasmuch as she has
                        already complied with the terms prescribed by Congress, and the faith of the
                        representatives is therefore pledged to give her representation at once. No
                        vote was reached in the Senate.</p>
                    <p>In the House the contest was marked with equal bitterness. The members whose
                        hearts are filled with gall towards the South, took occasion to give vent to
                        their angry feelings. They care nothing about the integrity of the Union.
                        They regard Virginia as an unpardonable offender, because she defeated the
                        regularly nominated Radical candidate for Governor and elected a man whose
                        views are more conservative. Hence they resolved to execute vengeance upon
                        her and teach her that hereafter she must conform to the wishes of the
                        Radical leaders in every particular, or be forever deprived of
                        representation.</p>
                    <p>In the front rank of these Radical fanatics, was the member from the
                        Sixteenth Congressional District of Pennsylvania.--Cessna harbors all the
                        hatred against the Southern people that it is possible to cram into a body
                        of his dimensions. On the final passage of the bill, there were one hundred
                        and forty-two ayes and forty-nine nays, and among the latter is Cessna. What
                        have his constituents to say of this vote? Surely, when they consider that
                        Virginia has complied with every one of the terms laid down as the
                        conditions precedent to her admission, they must condemn this action of
                        their representative in refusing to fulfill the Congressional part of the
                        contract.</p>
                    <p>The representatives, who are disgusted with this tinkering business, are
                        beginning to show some signs of good sense. The people have been disgusted
                        with this business for a long time. They are not so ignorant, as seems to be
                        supposed by their representatives, that they fail to observe that whilst it took the people but four years to suppress a
                            gigantic rebellion, it has taken the Radical constitution tinkers almost
                            five years to patch up the work of reconstruction, and it is not
                            finished yet. These fellows who are throwing themselves in the
                        way of union and perfect reconciliation may confidently expect to be
                        repudiated by the people at the polls. The following is the text of the bill
                        as it passed the House. It is likely to pass the Senate also:</p>
                    <p>Whereas, That the people of Virginia have adopted
                        a Constitution, republican in form, and have in all respects conformed to
                        the requirements of the act of Congress entitled "An act authorizing the
                        submission of the Constitution of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas to a vote
                        of the people, and authorizing the election of State officers provided by
                        the said Constitutions and members of Congress, approved April 10, 1869;
                        therefore,</p>
                    <p>Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
                            of the United States of America, That the said State of Virginia
                        is entitled to representation in the Congress of the United States.</p>
