<b>Buy the Arlington Property</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on the fight in the Senate over the legal ownership of Arlington.
                    Even though the editor wishes the estate to remain a cemetery, he acknowledges
                    the fact that Lee's heirs have legal right to the land. Urges Congress to stop
                    making patriotic speeches and just buy the land from Lee's heirs, thus making it
                    government property.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>An excellent opportunity was presented last week in the United States Senate
                        for the utterance of cheap patriotic sentiments. Senator McCreary, of
                        Kentucky, asked leave to introduce a resolution restoring the Arlington
                        property, near Washington, to the widow of Robert E. Lee. This property was
                        owned by General Lee, or his wife, at the outbreak of the war, and was
                        abandoned by them when Lee took command of the Confederate army.</p>
                    <p>In looking about for a place to bury the dead who fell in that vicinity,
                        Stanton and his co-adjustors selected Arlington. One would have thought that
                        in their search for such a place for such a purpose, they would have taken
                        extraordinary care to see that the title of the Government to the property
                        would be unimpeachable for all time to come. But strange to say, they seem
                        to have overlooked this matter altogether. The prominent idea with them was,
                        that the selection of this ground would be most mortifying to the
                        Confederate chief, and for that reason, it was chosen. Accordingly, the
                        remains of many brave Union soldiers, as well as those of many who fought
                        under the Confederate banner, have been interred upon the Arlington
                        property. It is now claimed that the title to this property is in the heirs
                        of General Lee.</p>
                    <p>Of this, there can be no doubt. All this fuming and fretting, all this
                        foaming at the mouth and gnashing of the teeth in a frenzy of patriotic
                        feeling, amounts to nothing. It is well enough to be patriotic, but true
                        patriotism never seeks to override law. And all this glowing declamation
                        about the sacredness of the graves of the Union dead, and all these bitter
                        epithets and fierce anathemas, leveled at the head of Senator McCreary, do
                        not and can not wipe out the fact that the Government has no shadow of title
                        to the ground in which these bodies lie.</p>
                    <p>It is in the power of the Senate to refuse leave to introduce such a
                        resolution. It is in the power of the press to denounce the mover of the
                        resolution for his indiscretion and want of consideration for the gallant
                        Union dead. But this does not settle the question satisfactorily.</p>
                    <p>Let it be admitted that Lee was a traitor of the darkest dye. But the
                        Constitution of the United States it is provided that "no attainder of
                        treason shall work corruption of blood, nor
                        forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted." Congress
                        is, therefore, forbidden to pass any bills of attainder, or forfeiture,
                        except during the life of the offender. If General Lee was the owner of the
                        Arlington property at the beginning of the war, and committed treason, that
                        treason worked a forfeiture of the property during his life, and at his
                        death, it reverted to his heirs at law. This is precisely the state of facts
                        and no amount of bluster, or rhetoric, or invective can alter it.</p>
                    <p>We recognize no wisdom in the Senate treating the proposition of the Senator
                        from Kentucky in the manner they did. The difficulty in regard to this
                        property must be met some day, and the sooner it is met, the better. We
                        would have the remains of our soldier dead rest there until the sound of the
                        resurrection trumpet. We feel all the horror that any of these blatant
                        patriots feel at the idea of disturbing their bones. But we would have them
                        rest, if possible, on ground the title to which will be forever
                        incontestable. It strikes us, therefore, that it would be better for grave,
                        dignified and reverend Senators to set about the work of settling this
                        question permanently, instead of talking buncombe for their constituents.</p>
                    <p>This Arlington property ought to be purchased from the heirs of Robert E.
                        Lee. That is the way, and the only way, to solve the problem, and the sooner
                        members of Congress turn their attention to that view of the subject, the
                        better it will be for the peace of mind of those who have relatives and
                        friends buried there, and the more satisfactory will it be to the
                        law-abiding and constitution-loving citizens of the Union. They ought to
                        take immediate measures, in accordance with the constitution and laws, to
                        secure this resting place of our dead from molestation forever. But this
                        summary mode of postponing the question, by refusing to listen to anything
                        on the subject, will not accomplish that result. Suppose that the legal
                        heirs of General Lee were to take possession of the Arlington property. By
                        what authority would the Government eject them?</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper applauds the senators who introduced bills to abolish the income

                    earliest day possible. We do not see how members, or Senators can justify

                    <p>Greencastle has a sensation. The Echo, in a
                        paragraph under the above heading, says: "This mysterious personage has
                        again commenced her peregrinations through the town, as she was seen on
                        several occasions last week in various sections of the borough. She is said
                        to be a tall, gaunt, cadaverous looking female, and does not appear to look
                        any older than when she first made her appearance some ten years ago. The
                        fleetness and noiselessness of her movements is the secret by which she
                        preserves her mysterious role. If the truth were
                        known, we have no doubt that she would prove to be some rascally he wag strolling around (probably with gum shoes
                        on) trying to create a sensation. A good sized club laid on vigorously
                        across her or his spinal column would, we think,

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The first annual re-union of the surviving members of the 126th Regiment
                        Pennsylvania Volunteers, was held in Chambersburg on Tuesday, Dec. 13th,
                        1870. Some two hundred officers and men of the 126th were present, besides
                        invited guests from other regiments. The Committee of Arrangements consisted
                        of the following persons:--Chairman, T.M. Mahon; Sergt. John A. Seiders,
                        Lieut. Geo. F. Platt, Lieut. Josiah W. Fletcher, Lieut. Geo. W. Welsh and
                        Sergt. Harry Strickler. For the well arranged programme and the able and
                        successful manner in which all the proceedings were conducted, this
                        Committee deserves great credit.</p>
                    <p>According to the programme the regiment first assembled in the Court House at
                        1 1/2 o'clock P.M., where the Address of Welcome and Annual Oration were
                        delivered. The meeting was called to order by T.M. Mahon, and the exercises
                        opened with prayer by Rev. J. Ault.</p>
                    <p>He returned thanks to Him who had permitted the meeting of the day. Though
                        many had been called to lay down their lives on the field of battle or to
                        die a lingering death in the damp tent or loathsome hospital, a goodly
                        number was spared to meet in peace, when the fires of rebellion were
                        quenched and the honor of the Government sustained. He prayed for the
                        President; the Government; all public councils, that they might rule in the
                        fear of God; for the Nation in its sin, that repenting it might become an
                        example of righteousness to all the world; that He would bless these
                        returned soldiers in all their pursuits. When duty called, they buckled on
                        the armor of Liberty, might they now gird on that of the Spirit, and as they
                        fought under the "Banner of the Stars" for the preservation of the Union,
                        might they now also go forth and battle under the banner of Christ for the
                        gaining of His kingdom.</p>
                    <p>The following officers were then elected: President, Col. James G. Elder;
                        Vice Presidents, Capt. Wm. H. Davidson and Sergt. John A. Seiders;
                        Secretary, Lieut. W.H. Mackey; Treasurer, Sergt. McLellan.</p>
                    <p>Col. Elder on taking the chair said:</p>
                    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:--It affords me great
                        pleasure to meet so many of you here to-day. Comrades of the 126th, I greet
                        you who have come to-day to this re-union.--We meet to mourn for our
                        comrades slain, and rejoice with those living. I bid you welcome.</p>
                    <p>Col. Elder was followed by Lieut. Col. Rowe in an address of welcome.</p>
                    <p>After the address was delivered a recess of ten minutes was voted, for the
                        purpose of allowing the members an opportunity to welcome Gen. Tyler. They
                        crowded around their old leader and no doubt felt a welcome, truer than
                        words could express, in the hearty grasp of each soldier's hand.</p>
                    <p>The recess over, the following business was transacted: The report of the
                        Committee on Constitution &amp;c. accepted, and the following
                        Constitution and By Laws adopted:</p>
                    <p>
                        Constitution
                    </p>
                    <p>The object of this organization is to promote and encourage among the
                        survivors of the 126th Regiment P.V. the feelings of friendship and sympathy

                        of the Valley Spirit, Franklin Repository, Public
                            Opinion, Valley Echo, Village Record, Mercersburg Journal, Fulton
                            Democrat, Valley Sentinel, Shippensburg News, Carlisle Volunteer,
                            Carlisle Herald, State Journal, Morning Patriot, Juniata Democrat
                            &amp; Register, and the Juniata
                            Republican, for their kindness in publishing the notices of our
                        Re-union sent to them by the Committee of Arrangement.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That a copy of the above Resolutions be
                        sent to the Editors of the said papers.</p>
                    <p>Adjourned till 5 o'clock P. M.</p>
                    <p>
                        Banquet
                    </p>
                    <p>At five and a half o'clock P.M. the regiment re-assembled at Repository Hall.
                        Here the taste and good judgement of the Com. of arrangements were well
                        displayed in the beautiful manner in which the hall was decorated and in the
                        convenience of all the arrangements. Three tables were spread with an
                        abundant supply of those "good things" which delight the inner man which had
                        been prepared by E Shank, the genial proprietor of the Montgomery House, who
                        knows how, if any one does, to tempt the palate and spoil digestion. To
                        prevent confusion the middle table was reserved for the ladies and other
                        invited guests, whilst the "old boys" of the 126th, after Rev. J. Ault had
                        asked a blessing "did good service on the flanks." After supper the guests
                        were provided with seats, and the members of the regiment gathered round the
                        middle table and pledged to cold water the following toasts, proposed by
                        Col. Rowe:</p>
                    <p>First: "The Union."</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Jere. Cook responded briefly to the sentiment--"The Union"--by saying
                        that so much has already been well spoken during the progress of the day's
                        exercises that he felt they would thank him for being brief, and he was as
                        willing to confer that favor as they were to receive it. He was the more
                        willing to be brief because the toast announced, presented an exhaustless
                        subject. After a few pointed remarks as to the origin of the Union, and the
                        central idea about which it was framed, the principle that all men are
                        created equal, he stated that the antagonism which existed on that subject
                        led to the rebellion. War was accepted by the Government to preserve the
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>"That," continued Mr. Cook, "is why it seems to me fit and proper that this
                        sentiment should be entertained by us. But for the war, we would not be
                        assembled in the capacity we are; and as we fought in defence of the Union,
                        at our first re-union to recall the memory of those terrible scenes of war
                        and bloodshed now almost overgrown with the luxuriant growth of the fruits
                        of peace, we naturally rejoice that the Union is safe.</p>
                    <p>"It seems to me that this sentiment ought to convey something more to our
                        minds than the idea of the integrity of the nation. It is true there are no
                        states missing in the restored Union, but this is not all that is required
                        to constitute a perfect Union. We all rejoice heartily that our armies were
                        able to hold the rebellious states in the Union in spite of the madness of
                        secession, but we rejoice far more at the unmistakable signs of returning
                        reason to the people of those states, and the evidences of their growing
                        love for the old flag and government. All these satisfy us that the end has
                        justified the war. Let us recognize in this sentiment the facts, that our
                        re-union has no sectional feeling in it, and no sentiment of hostility
                        toward those who were arrayed in arms against the Union, but have returned
                        to her in good faith and sincerity; that this is a Union of the people of
                        the United States, as well as of the several States, that ours is a
                        homogeneous government, that we are one people. Let us give special
                        expression to the thought that whatever of rejoicing we feel and express
                        here, some of it, at least, is due to the recognition of the fact that the
                        Union which was preserved through the war has brought un-numbered blessings
                        to those who in their madness fought against it with arms in their hands, as
                        well as to those who were triumphant in the war, and that the blessed fruits
                        of peace are to-day acknowledged and prized by them as well as they are by
                        us.</p>
                    <p>Second:--"The Patriotic women of America." Response by Wm. Kennedy.</p>
                    <p>You do well to propose a toast to women, for in our idea of this worlds
                        happiness woman and toast are inseparably connected. I appreciate the
                        feeling of gratitude which prompted the committee to make this toast an
                        essential part in their programme. For without women I would like to know
                        where any of us would be tonight, and more, there is not one of us would
                        have a button on his shirt. "Women," said the great Toodles in a Herculean
                        effort to vent the feelings that swelled in his bosom, "women, lovely women,
                        your a trump." With women on our side we win the battle of life. Some one
                        has said "woman is like ivy the greater the ruin the closer she clings, and
                        he was a sour old bachelor who perverted it into the closer she clings the
                        greater the ruin. Woman sir is the necessity of our being; the great Creator
                        saw it was not good for man to be alone, so He gave him woman to increase
                        his joys and double his expenses. But we are to talk of the patriotic women
                        of America. They like the Spartan Mother never nursed a coward; she told her
                        son when she sent him forth to do battle "Come back with your shield or on
                        it," but how much higher and nobler is her character who gave her son and
                        left the issue with the God of battle. It is my duty on this occasion to
                        speak of those women, who through the weary night hours watched by the
                        bedside of the suffering, binding up wounds; administering the cooling
                        draught, whispering words of comfort, closing the eyes in death, and bearing
                        the last message to loved ones at home. If it be true that drying a single
                        tear is greater than shedding rivers of gore then we must yield the palm to
                        woman.</p>
                    <p>While we were in the battle forgetting our danger in excitement she was
                        suffering at home. My comrades it does require some courage to stand in
                        battle, but you will agree that not upon man but woman the sorrow must fall.</p>
                    <p>Third:--"To our dead comrades." Drank in silence.</p>
                    <p>Fourth:--"The Army." Response by Gen. Tyler.</p>
                    <p>In responding to the sentiment which has just been announced, I feel as if it
                        would have been better if you had selected some one who belonged to the
                        regiment rather than me to respond, and the more so, since it is not my
                        forte to make speeches, in other words I'm not a "speechist."</p>
                    <p>Looking back we find that the first organization of armies was among the
                        Egyptians; several thousand men were arranged in what they called the army.
                        The army was divided into divisions. The men were armed with pikes and
                        swords and there were no cannon and muskets in those days, but this is
                        history and I'll leave it and come down to our army which raises its hat to
                        the "stars and stripes;" the army which forms the nucleus around which the
                        citizens of our government rally to protect it in time of danger. Its dead,
                        its living heroes we all know and it would be folly for me to stand here and
                        try to portray them. It is due to-night that I should repeat what I made a
                        part of the official history of the war, that it is a pleasure for me to be
                        surrounded by these men who performed their duty as soldiers honorable and
                        well, what can I say more? It seems to me that that covers the ground. I
                        will say that I always felt honored by the alacrity with which you performed
                        my commands, and shall carry the feeling to my grave. It must, it should be
                        gratifying to the pride of every one to know that their record is without
                        spot; theirs is the pride of sustaining their country, right or wrong,
                        preferring that it should be right , but their country right or wrong. This
                        is the fourth regimental re-union I have attended since the war, and none
                        can be compared to this. There is nothing more gratifying to him who has
                        been honored by commanding men than to know that his men think he has done
                        his duty. The government gave me the power to comand but you did
                        the work. God bless you.</p>
                    <p>Fifth:--"The citizen soldier." Responded to by Lieut. Geo W. Welsh.</p>
                    <p>The tyrants of the Earth, in all ages, have sustained themselves upon their
                        thrones by the power of standing armies, supported by resources wrung from
                        the hands of their toiling subjects. By this means the ambitious and selfish
                        have enslaved and perpetuated the slavery of millions. Wrest, for a day,
                        from the hands of Emperor, King, Czar and Sultan the power of these hired
                        soldiers, and the next dispatch which flashes beneath the Atlantic from the
                        Old World will proclaim that in all Europe there exists not a throne, crown
                        or sceptre. Remove from the soldiers which purpose these armies all hope of
                        gain and preferment, and they will disappear like mist before the rising
                        sun. Stimulated only by promises of reward and promotion, without an impulse
                        of patriotism, these mercenary wretches have become traitors to the best
                        interest of their fellow men, the tools by which despots rivet their
                        shackles on the limbs of their victims.</p>
                    <p>How different the character of the citizen soldier! Stimulated only by
                        patriotism, and love of race, the citizen soldier ignoring all selfish
                        interests has been the defence of liberty in every age. Wherever the iron
                        grasp of despotism has been broken, wherever the freedom of a people has
                        been achieved, it has been done by the citizen soldier. Look at the history
                        of your own government. It was the citizen soldier who achieved your
                        liberties, the citizen soldier who has defended and sustained them. In every
                        battle of the revolution from the opening fray at Lexington to the closing
                        fight at Yorktown, it was the citizen soldier who met the drilled and
                        disciplined hireling of the tyrant and at last vanquished and drove him from
                        our shores. In our late war with England, veterans who had been drilled and
                        disciplined under the eye of Wellington, soldiers who in Europe had been the
                        victors of many a bloody field, were vanquished by the untrained citizen
                        soldier in almost every battle from Niagara to New Orleans. It was the
                        citizen soldier who sustained our nation's honor in every battle in the war
                        with Mexico and planted our flag on the walls of her capitol.</p>
                    <p>An in the last great struggle for national life, it was the
                        citizen, untrained in war, who at the call of his country in the hour of her
                        extreme peril relinquished his peaceful avocation, and from work bench and
                        plough and desk came to her defence and crushed the power of treason and
                        rebellion.</p>
                    <p>Despots may sustain their thrones by the power of a mercenary soldiery but
                        the liberties of a free people when threatened by tyranny are only to be
                        sustained and defended by the patriotism of the people themselves.</p>
                    <p>Sixth:--"The Comrades of other Regiments." Response by Capt. G.W. Skinner.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chairman:--I certainly did not expect to be
                        called upon to respond to this or any other toast. My eloquent friend, Mr.
                        Kennedy, has broadly asserted here this evening that no American mother ever
                        nursed a coward, but I am afraid I am about to disprove the truth of his
                        assertion by shirking the duty you, sir, have just imposed on me. Besides,
                        by your own intimation, the time for this part of the programme of the
                        evening has passed. I must go so far, however, as to thank you and the
                        gallant boys of the 126th, in behalf of my comrades of other regiments, for
                        your kind remembrance of us on this occasion. I feel that it is no uncommon
                        honor you have done us--Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville toasting the
                        other battle fields of the war. Between all soldiers, Mr. Chairman, there
                        exists a common bond of sympathy. It was well said by Col. Rowe in his
                        address of Welcome to-day, that we are all in a manner brothers. Yes,
                        brothers. Having been called forth to succor the same cause, having passed
                        through the same routine of duties, and having shared the same kind of
                        dangers--the tie that binds us is almost as strong as that which draws to
                        one another the hearts of those who, in childhood's hour, knelt at the same
                        parental knee. Between my own regiment, which held a re-union here a few
                        weeks ago, and the 126th there exists a peculiar bond of sympathy. It might
                        be said that the same section sent us forth, and in the ranks of the one
                        were numbered many friends and relatives of those in the ranks of the
                        other.--We gave you our sympathy in the field; we felt proud of your
                        bravery, and we unite to-night, present and absent ones alike, in wishing
                        you a good time generally. Again we thank you for your kindness.</p>
                    <p>Seventh--"The Loyal People of the Border who fought the enemy at the front
                        while their homes were ravaged by rebel invaders." Response by Lieut. Pott.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Pott in his response took occasion to refer to the repeated invasions
                        made by the rebel armies into the defenceless border counties, and the havoc
                        made by them upon the property of loyal citizens, many of whom were at the
                        front fighting the common enemy, and animadverted severely but forcibly upon
                        the unwarranted assaults of the press of the State upon our citizens in
                        their appeal to the Legislature for relief. We regret that the extreme
                        length to which he extended his remarks compels us to forego the pleasure of
                        publishing them in full, and it would be doing him manifest injustice to
                        present an unsatisfactory abstract of them.</p>
                    <p>The toasts: "Pennsylvania, the Keystone," "The Flag," "The 126th Reg. P.V."
                        "Our Fulton County Comrades," "Our Juniata County Comrades," were taken
                        together and responded to by all the members of the regiment in three hearty
                        cheers.</p>
                    <p>Interesting letters and dispatches were received from a number of members of
                        the regiment, whose attendance great distance and other circumstances
                        rendered impossible. Kindly greetings and remembrances, tender sympathies
                        for the old associates and expressions of regret that they could not be
                        present came from the far off Pacific coast, from Nebraska, from New
                        Orleans, from Baltimore and other points.</p>
                    <p>The Regiment now adjourned to the Court House to listen to the recitations
                        and await part fourth of the programme.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Samuel Palmer was introduced and recited the "Charge of the Light
                        Brigade" in an excellent manner. As no one had been chosen to complete the
                        next part of the programme a vote was taken and Sheriff Fletcher was called
                        upon to recite "Sheridan's Ride." The Sheriff, after remarking that he stood
                        on delicate ground in attempting to recite this "poet-praised poem of an
                        artist poet," delivered the production very well indeed.</p>
                    <p>The Promenade Concert followed next and, as it was intended it should be, it
                        was the crowning feature of the day. On re-entering the Hall we found the
                        scene entirely changed. The tables were cleared away and the room was
                        crowded with ladies and gentlemen, promenading. Ladies from abroad and the
                        pretty girls of Chambersburg as well, with the Chambersburg Cornet Band and
                        Orchestra discoursing inspiring music and the floor all ready for dancing,
                        is it surprising, good folks, that those inclined to trip the "light
                        fantastic" could not resist the temptation to dance? And dance they did till
                        the midnight hour had struck, and the shriek of the locomotive whistle
                        warned the delegations from abroad that it was time to leave. The citizens
                        of Chambersburg will long remember with pleasure the happy re-union of those
                        brave defenders of the nation's honor, who fought at the front while their
                        homes were ravaged by rebel invaders.</p>
