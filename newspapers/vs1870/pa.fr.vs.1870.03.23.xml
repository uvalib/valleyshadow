                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Reformed Church Messenger</emph>, published at
                        Philadelphia, has an article on the Border Claims, which we presume was
                        written by that excellent gentleman, Rev. Samuel R. Fisher, D. D., who was
                        on the border during the war and is perfectly cognizant of the extent of the
                        losses of our people. He was himself a sufferer by the fire that destroyed
                        Chambersburg. It would be well for some of the Philadelphia dailies which
                        have abused us so vigorously and energetically, and who yet pretend to treat
                        us fairly, to exhibit their fairness by publishing an article like this
                        which takes the right side of the question. We give this article prominence
                        for the reason that it is moderate in its tone and correct in its
                        statements: "Two weeks ago some reference was made in our columns to what
                        are termed the Border claims. An effort is being made to secure from our
                        present State Legislature, the passage of a bill, which shall make provision
                        for their payment. We had hoped that the justice of these claims would be
                        generally admitted, and that the movement referred to, would meet with
                        little or no opposition. Our expectations in this direction, however, we are
                        sorry to find, are sadly disappointed. Most of our city papers, as well as
                        some others in different parts of the State, have manifested a most violent
                        opposition to it. In some instances, the most flagrant slanders upon the
                        people on the border are indulged in, and resort is also had to the most
                        flimsy arguments.</p>
                    <p>"We happen to form a portion of those, who are called border sufferers, and
                        passed through their sorry experience. On this subject, therefore, we speak
                        from personal knowledge. The claim, as far as our knowledge of them extends,
                        we believe to be just. They are no trumped up affairs, as has been alleged.
                        They were passed upon by disinterested persons, from another part of the
                        State, appointed for the purpose by the Legislature. Some of them are far
                        from being equal to the losses really sustained. Such we know to be the case
                        with those, in which we are interested. If fully paid, they will cover but
                        little more than half of the actual loss.</p>
                    <p>"Some of the city dailies soberly argued against these claims on the ground
                        that, during the war, in other parts of the State, in Philadelphia and
                        Pittsburg, for instance, great losses were sustained from the suspension of
                        business, and their payment might be pressed with as much justice as those
                        of the people on the border. It should be borne in mind, however, that the
                        claims of the border people are not for any such losses as these. On this
                        score their losses, for which they set up no claim, were much greater even
                        than those of the people of Philadelphia and Pittsburg. The interruption of
                        business in these cities, altogether covered only a few weeks. On the
                        borders, they continued for months during each of a series of years. Those
                        who witnessed the continual swaying backward and forward of the distracted
                        people, as the army of the enemy approached or withdrew, know what that to
                        which we refer means. Had those, who set up this objection to the border
                        claims, known something of this by experience, they would be ashamed to
                        offer such a flimsy plea of opposition.</p>
                    <p>"The border people are charged with treating our soldiery, not only with
                        indifference, but also with culpable neglect, and are even represented as
                        being disloyal! Never was any charge more unfounded. The people cheerfully
                        co-operated with the friends of the government, in their efforts to put down
                        the rebellion. To this end they contributed both men and means, as largely
                        as any other portion of the country. The soldiery themselves, who spent any
                        time among them, can bear witness how cheerfully everything in their power
                        was done to administer to their comfort. We, personally, along with others,
                        cheerfully devoted both time and money in this direction.</p>
                    <p>"It is said again, these losses were sustained in the common cause of the
                        country, and therefore recourse should be had for their payment, to the
                        General, and not to the State Government. Those who urge this plea forget,
                        that it is only through the State Government that payment for these and
                        similar losses is to be secured from the General Government. The States of
                        Ohio and Indiana promptly paid their citizens the losses sustained from the
                        Morgan raid, and have long since been re-imbursed by the General Government.
                        The great State of Pennsylvania should act as magnanimously towards its
                        citizens.</p>
                    <p>"It is further said, that these claims are presented, not by the original
                        sufferers, but by others who have bought them up at a large discount, and
                        that the most corrupt means are resorted to for the purpose of securing
                        their payment. We know not how it may be with the claims of others. Those,
                        in which we are interested, remain in first hands. Besides this, we do not
                        know what particular appliances are brought to bear to secure the passage of
                        the act asked for from the Legislature. Certain it is, however, we would
                        never give out countenance to any thing that is illegal or improper. Knowing
                        our claims to be just, all we ask is, that their justice may be
                        acknowledged, and their payment promptly provided for in a legitimate way.
                        These claims, we doubt not, will eventually have to be met, even though the
                        present opposition should succeed in causing delay.</p>
                    <p>"After the above was in type, we were pleased to learn, that a bill for the
                        relief of the border sufferers has been reported on favorably in the House
                        of Representatives. The provisions of the bill are so reasonable, that they
                        cannot fail to recommend it to general favor. In its present shape it must
                        pass both houses, receive the signature of the Governor, and thus become a
                        law.--Some light seems to dawn upon the darkness of those, who have so long
                        suffered from the sore losses inflicted upon them by merciless foes. The
                        bill, as reported, provides that the State shall devote all the monies which
                        it may hereafter receive from the counties of Adams, Bedford, Cumberland,
                        Franklin, Fulton, Perry and York, for direct taxes, and taxes on railroads,
                        &amp;c., within their limits, to a fund, from which the claims shall be
                        paid as fast as the fund accumulates. Certificates of indebtedness of the
                        value of $100, $300, $500, and $1000, shall be issued by the treasurer,
                        which shall bear interest at the rate of five per cent until paid."</p>

                <summary>The Franklin County Horticultural Society met on March 15th. J. P. Keefer
                    read an essay on "Gathering and Storing of Fruits." "Much useful information can
                    be gathered by attending these meetings, and our citizens should more generally
                    improve the privilege of being present. The election of ladies to membership in
                    the society is exerting a favorable influence, and they now frequently grace its
                    meetings."</summary>
