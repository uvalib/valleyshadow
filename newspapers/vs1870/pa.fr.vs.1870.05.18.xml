                    <p>Democrats are united in sentiment as to the negro vote. From all parts of the
                        County we have words of cheer as to our position. Men who never voted the
                        Democratic ticket in their lives send us greeting and say, "we intend to
                        vote the white man's ticket." The disgust with the Radical party is
                        profound.</p>
                    <p>A soldier said to us the other day, "I fought three years to free the negro,
                        and I do not regret it. I would have fought three more, if necessary, for
                        the same end. But I can not consent to see them take part in the affairs of
                        the government. You are right. They ought never to be allowed to hold
                        office, and make laws for white men." Such, we doubt not, is the sentiment
                        of the white soldiers of Franklin County. They would have spurned from their
                        presence, during the war, the man who would have seriously proposed to give
                        the negro the ballot. And now, they will grind to powder the party which has
                        abused their confidence by forcing this odious doctrine upon them against
                        their will.</p>
                    <p>A mechanic called into our office last week and subscribed for our paper.
                        Said he, "I want it because it is the white man's paper. I go for a white
                        man's ticket. I read your article on 'white men must rule America,' as I
                        stood at my bench. One of my companions had handed it to me. I turned to him
                        and said, I have voted the Radical ticket for the last time. Consider me a
                        member of the white man's party."</p>
                    <p>Such is the feeling which is taking hold of the people. They are becoming
                        alarmed at the terrible extreme to which this negro equality doctrine has
                        been pushed. They have foresight to see to what still further extremes it is
                        likely to be pushed. And they have resolved to stop it if they can.</p>
                    <p>Laboring men, mechanics, merchants, farmers, all ranks and conditions of
                        life, are becoming imbued with the idea that one grand, overwhelming effort
                        must be made to save our institutions from the perils which environ them by
                        reason of this dangerous power which has been lodged in the hands of
                        irresponsible negroes. This state of mind makes action with the old
                        Democratic white men's party a necessity.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy always hang their banner on the outer wall. In the coming
                        campaign, our motto will be, "white men must rule America." Let all the
                        people who favor that doctrine join hands with us at once, so that we may
                        win a signal triumph over the Radical conspirators who procured a fraudulent
                        ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, and who are now pandering to the
                        negro vote, simply to enable them to share still more largely in the public
                        plunder.</p>

                    <p>Senator Sumner has introduced a bill into the United States Senate, for the
                        purpose of preventing any distinction from being made in theatres and all
                        places of public amusement, hotels, railway carriages, steamboats,
                        institutions of learning, churches and cemeteries <emph rend="italic"
                            >throughout the United States</emph>, on account of race or color.
                        To-day if a negro enters the Continental Hotel of the Girard House in
                        Philadelphia, he is not allowed to register his name and have a room
                        assigned to him. It is the same in New York City. Sumner has resolved to
                        break down this odious barrier. He has determined that equality for the
                        negro before the law means that he shall be allowed to go without lot or
                        hindrance wherever the white man is allowed to go. If the negro desires to
                        occupy a room, or even a bed at a hotel in company with a white man, he must
                        be permitted to do it, no matter how many protests may be entered by the
                        white man against such an arrangement. <emph rend="italic">Not to grant his
                            request would be a discrimination on account of race or color</emph>.</p>
                    <p>The negro must be allowed to go into any car he prefers, and sit on any seat
                        he chooses. He must have any berth on a steamboat that he desires. He must
                        be taught in the same classes with the whites in the public schools, and no
                        private institutions of learning are to be allowed to close their doors
                        against him. There must be no schools exclusively for whites. A white boy at
                        college must not dare to protest against having a colored boy for his
                        roommate. <emph rend="italic">That would be a discrimination on account of
                            race or color</emph>.</p>
                    <p>In the churches, negroes must be allowed to sit in the same pews with the
                        whites. If you have a pew that you imagine is your own because you pay rent
                        for it, you must not, on that account, presume to refuse a black man
                        admission to it, alongside of your wife and daughter, because <emph
                            rend="italic">that would be a discrimination on account of race or
                        color</emph>.</p>
                    <p>In the cemeteries, the black man must be buried by the side of the white man.
                        Family lots will have to be surrendered as being too exclusive. As in life,
                        so in death, <emph rend="italic">there must be no discrimination on account
                            of race or color</emph>.</p>
                    <p>If a white man desires a private box at a theatre to accommodate himself, and
                        some ladies and gentlemen of his acquaintance, he can have it, but if a
                        negro wishes to sit in that same box, he is to have that privilege, no
                        matter how distasteful it may be to the white ladies and gentlemen. If it is
                        too much crowded to admit another person, some one of the whites can retire
                        so as to make room for the negro. <emph rend="italic">There must be no
                            discrimination in anything on account of race or color</emph>. This
                        fanaticism will run to such a terrible extreme that, in a short time, a
                        white man dare not say <emph rend="italic">no</emph> to a negro who solicits
                        the hands of his daughter in marriage, because it will be <emph
                            rend="italic">a discrimination on account of race, or color</emph>.</p>
                    <p>White men, what will you say at the polls to this doctrine of negro equality?
                        Are you willing to aid in clothing the negro with privileges, the exercise
                        of which is an infringement upon your own constitutional rights?</p>
                    <p>It has been well said that the country is <emph rend="italic">best</emph>
                        governed which is governed <emph rend="italic">the least</emph>.--But
                        Americans are governed entirely too much. Our Congress seem to be afraid of
                        the people all the time. Instead of legislating for them, they seem bent on
                        enacting laws to limit their privileges and render worthless their dearest
                        rights. If they keep on as they have been doing of late years, a white man
                        will soon have no rights which a negro will be bound to respect.</p>
                    <p>White men, let us rally in solid column to dislodge this "party of great
                        moral ideas" which seeks to govern white men by the votes of black men.</p>

                        soldiers on the 30th instant. Col. J.G. Elder presided, and Jere Cook was
                        made Secretary. Col. Theodore McGowan was chosen Marshal for the occasion
                        and instructed to appoint the necessary Assistant Marshals.</p>
                    <p>T.J. Grimison, G.W. Skinner and T.M. Mahon were appointed a special committee
                        to procure flowers, and were requested to invite the ladies both of
                        Chambersburg and the surrounding neighborhood to join with them for that
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>Special invitations were extended to the Housum Zouaves, to the Clergy of the
                        town, and to all citizens to participate in the exercises.</p>
                    <p>A committee on General arrangements was then appointed, composed of J.G.
                        Elder, J.L.P. Deatrich, G. W. Skinner, S.W. Hays, D.F. Leaher, J.A. Seiders,
                        T.J. Grimison, S. G. Lans, C. Creasler, G. F. Platte, G. W. Welsh, G.
                        Wampler, H. Srickler, W. Clugston and S. Barnes.</p>
                    <p>The meeting then adjourned to meet at the office of T. J. Grimison on Monday
                        evening next.</p>
                    <p>It is specially desirable that as many of the old soldiers as can make it
                        convenient will attend on that occasion in order to perfect the necessary
                        arrangements for the exercises of the 30th instant.</p>
