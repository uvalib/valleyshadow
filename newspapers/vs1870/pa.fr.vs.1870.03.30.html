<b>And Grant Said "Let Us Have Peace"</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints an article which comments on Republican reconstruction mishaps in
                    Virginia. Protests the retention of military officials in the state even though

                    recently in Richmond.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The disturbance that has taken place in the city of Richmond, Virginia, is a
                        remarkable proof of the want of the requisite sense and disposition on the
                        part of the Grant administration to restore peace and order in the South.
                        Its efforts in that direction since the rebellion closed, have been the
                        merest pretence, designed to hoodwink the people of the whole country, while
                        every measure proposed or adopted in the name of "reconstruction" has been
                        but a party in a general scheme to keep the Southern States and people in
                        practical subjection to the Republican party. It is quite clear that
                        Virginia, being admitted into the Union as a sovereign Commonwealth, on an
                        entire equality in the respect with all of the other States, is, ipso facto, relieved from the provisional military
                        rule imposed on her by Congress, and that it was the plain duty of the
                        Washington administration to declare that rule at an end and to recall every
                        Federal official, military and civil, the moment that the re-established
                        State Government was duly recognized by Congress and formally inaugurated.
                        Had this been done, two weeks of tumult and violence, involving the lives of
                        several citizens of Virginia, would not have occurred. Cahoon would not then
                        have dared to insist, vi et armis, upon holding a
                        municipal office in Richmond after his authority to exercise it had expired,
                        nor would General Canby have interfered at all in a difficulty which he only
                        embarrassed by his equivocal attempt to settle it. Grant and his Secretary
                        of War have been shamefully derelict in this serious emergency, and if they
                        mean to pursue the same course hereafter, winking at a riot provoked by
                        Federal officials or partisans, in order that a pretext may be created for
                        protracting military despotism in the South, and perpetuating the ascendancy
                        of the Republican government in that section is a monstrous sham and the
                        people of the entire country might as well open their eyes to the fact at
                            once.---Sunday Mercury</p>
