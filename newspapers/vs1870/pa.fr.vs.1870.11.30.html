<b>Drive in the Wedge</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Comes out in favor of working with liberal Republicans to defeat the more
                    Radical wing of the Republican party. Believes such tactics will splinter the
                    Republicans and make Democratic victories certain in the long run.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Certain Democratic journals of the State affect to be horrified at the idea
                        suggested, that the Democrats of the House of Representatives should combine
                        with the Radicals who are opposed to the gentleman who is likely to be the
                        Radical caucus nominee for Treasurer, and thus elect an independent Radical
                        to that position. In short, Mr. Mackey will be nominated by the Radical
                        caucus as he was last year. Some of the Radical members of the House will
                        most probably remain away from the caucus so that they may be left free to
                        act as they please afterwards. These men will form a coalition with the
                        Democrats to beat Mr. Mackey. Now, it is insisted in some quarters that the
                        Democrats should hold a caucus, make a regular nomination, and, if these
                        bolters desire to defeat Mr. Mackey, they can vote for the Democratic
                        candidate. If they refuse to do this, then Democratic members are exhorted
                        to stand firm and vote for nobody but their own caucus nominee.</p>
                    <p>We do not look at this matter in this light. We have not yet turned up our
                        eyeballs, or held up our hands, in holy horror, at the suggestion to elect
                        an independent Radical Treasurer. We would much prefer, of course, the
                        election of a Democrat to that office. So would all Democrats. But, under
                        the circumstances, this can not be reasonably expected. The Radicals have a
                        majority in the House. If a Democrat were elected Treasurer, by the
                        assistance of bolting Radicals, these bolting Radicals would be denounced as
                        traitors to their party and the responsibility for the election of a
                        Democrat would be cast upon their shoulders. They know this, and as they are
                        not desirous of occupying such a position, or anxious to be driven virtually
                        from their party, they will undoubtedly refuse to throw their votes to a
                        Democrat.</p>
                    <p>But the Democrats are in a minority. They are not responsible for any
                        legislation. Their party does not expect them to elect Democratic officers,
                        because their inability to do so is universally known and recognized.</p>
                    <p>Here then is the position. A splendid opportunity is offered to drive the
                        wedge into the Radical party. Each new dissension in the ranks of any
                        organization undermines its strength. Disintegration is going on rapidly in
                        "the party of great moral ideas." Its leaders are halting, doubting,
                        puzzled, and the rank and file are wavering and deserting. The surest way to
                        keep up the disintegrating process is to keep up the dissensions that exist.
                        The bolting Radicals can not come to us for the reason which we have stated.
                        But we can go to them. We believe in defeating Radicalism by the aid of any
                        honorable combination that can be made. In 1860 when the Democratic party
                        was split into factions and torn by dissensions, these same Radicals did not
                        hesitate to nominate Democrats as their candidates for important positions,
                        and thus they were successful. On the same principle, we would lay hold of a
                        Radical for this Treasury nomination, and elect him to the utter
                        mortification and discomfiture of the Radical leaders.</p>
                    <p>A thrill of ecstasy ran through the Conservative heart of the country at the
                        brilliant triumph over Radicalism in Missouri. That triumph was secured by
                        the Democrats endorsing the candidate of a bolting convention. It was a
                        combination which exposed the utter weakness of the President. No man ever
                        made a more bitter fight to sustain his administration than did Grant to
                        procure the endorsement of the people of Missouri. The Democracy everywhere
                        are jubilant over his failure.</p>
                    <p>The men all over the Union who are tired of the mismanagement of our
                        financial affairs, are looking forward with joyous expectations to the
                        proposed combination between the Democrats and the Revenue Reformers in the
                        Forty-Second Congress. We are in favor of that combination. We do not think
                        that it will be at all disgraceful to the Democrats, even if they help to
                        elect a Revenue Reform Radical to occupy the Speaker's chair. It is the duty
                        of the Democracy to keep sowing discord among their opponents. That is the
                        sure way to win in the end.</p>
                    <p>It is said that the combination which elected Mr. Irwin did the Democratic
                        party no good. Where is the warrant for this assertion? One thing is
                        certain. The Radical majority is reduced in the Legislature, and the State
                        has been carried by the Democrats at the recent election. We are certainly
                        getting along better than we have been of late years. It seems to us that it
                        would be policy to keep up the same style of skirmishing.</p>
                    <p>We are not at all punctilious about this matter. We would not stand upon the
                        order, or the manner of beating our opponents. We wish to defeat them and
                        defeat them honorably. There is clearly no dishonor in this mode of fighting
                        and, for our part, we say, drive in the wedge and split the Radical party
                        into fragments.</p>

<b>Thanks to the Soldiers</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Chastises Grant for using military force in peace time. Specifically is
                    troubled by soldiers enforcing the 15th Amendment and the collection of taxes.
                    Says military force should only be used in times of great peril, which has not
                    occurred recently.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It seems that the Grant Administration feels inclined to keep constantly
                        before the people the doings of the military in a time of profound peace.
                        There is an evident purpose to accustom the public mind to military
                        interference in civil affairs so as to prepare the people for further
                        encroachments without shocking their sensibilities. The act to enforce the
                        Fifteenth Amendment, which authorizes the employment of troops at all the
                        polls, outrages all republican notions and is in direct conflict with many
                        of the State COnstitutions.</p>
                    <p>But a more recent occurrence is deserving of consideration by the people. A
                        few days ago, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue expressed his thanks to a
                        detachment of the regular army for the manner in which they had assisted the
                        internal revenue officers to collect certain taxes. It is very questionable
                        whether he would not have gained greater honor for himself by rebuking them for the assistance they rendered. Not
                        that the taxes ought not to be collected. Not that the laws ought not to be
                        enforced. We do not mean this by any means. But we do mean that the military
                        power ought only to be called in on occasions of the greatest peril.
                        President Grant ought to recollect that in this country the people are
                        extremely jealous of the encroachments of the military power and that it
                        ought not to be used against American citizens except when all other means
                        fail. What were these special services which called for the thanks of the
                        Commissioner? Has there been any extra ordinary heroism displayed? Have any
                        astounding feats of valor been performed? Has the carnage been so great that
                        these soldiers waded up to their knees in blood? Not at all. The country has
                        heard of nothing of the kind. And yet special
                        thanks are tendered to the soldiers for collecting taxes.</p>
                    <p>The conduct of this Administration is subversive of American liberty. The
                        people may awake to the fact too late.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are in receipt of the thirty-sixth annual report of the Cumberland Valley
                        Railroad Company. It is addressed to the stockholders, is for the year
                        ending September 30, 1870, and shows a very healthy state of affairs. From
                        the increase of the business of the road, it is not likely that the
                        exchequer of the company will be exhausted for many years to come. Long life
                        to it!</p>
                    <p>The South Mountain Iron Company is now sending its immense deposits of ore to
                        market from at least eight mines which have been opened and the report says
                        that the quantity to be shipped over the road during the coming year will be
                        greatly increased.</p>
                    <p>It then refers to the road now being built by the Southern Pennsylvania Iron
                        and Railroad Company "from a point about six miles south of Chambersburg to
                        their iron mines near Loudon, a distance of 25 miles through the fertile
                        lands of Franklin county." It then says: "These mines have been opened, and
                            allord evidence of an inexhaustible quantity of good ore
                        obtained at the cheapest cost of mining. To induce this company to prosecute
                        their enterprise, your board agreed to loan them three hundred thousand
                        dollars, upon a mortgage of their road and estate, and upon condition of a
                        lease to our company of the road for one hundred years: thus virtually
                        adding to our road a track of twenty-five miles, the cost of which will be
                        about eight hundred thousand dollars. The work on this road is now about
                        one-half done, and that company expect to finish it by the first of April,
                        next. In the purchase of their lands, the erection of furnaces, the building
                        of their road and other improvements, this company will have expended,
                        perhaps, a million and a half of dollars, to pay for which will necessitate
                        a large amount of business in transportation of iron ore, iron and coal, and
                        greatly increase the tonnage upon our road; this, together with the freight
                        of ore and iron from the South Mountain Road, has induced the board to
                        hasten the laying of another track from Mechanicsburg to Bridgeport, a
                        distance of about eight miles, and to increase the sidings at the latter
                        point."</p>
                    <p>The grading of this second track between the points named will be finished
                        during the present season. New sidings have been put in at Kingston and
                        Hagerstown. A new passenger station house has been built at Bridgeport, and
                        one at Hagerstown.</p>
                    <p>The company has purchased additional land at Bridgeport--a strip 60 feet wide
                        and three-fourths of a mile long. Land has also been purchased for sidings
                        at Hagerstown.</p>
                    <p>The report says that "the grading of the extension from
                        Hagergstown to the Potomac at 'Powell's Bend' is about being
                        completed" and the expenditure there has been $167,671.94. On the last day
                        of the last session of the Legislature of Maryland, an act was passed which
                        prevents the connection of this road with the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. It
                        is confidently expected that this act will be repealed during the coming
                        session. On this account, the work on the extension has not been pushed.</p>
                    <p>The whole amount of extraordinary expenditures
                        during the year is $200,359.65.</p>
                    <p>The President, it seems to us, does not regard with favor, for the present at
                        least, the proposition to extend the double track west of Mechanicsburg. He
                        says "it is questionable whether the further extension may not be dispensed
                        with for the present," but that "it is a question which our experience in
                        the next year will determine."</p>
                    <p>The report further says: "A company has been incorporated by the laws of West
                        Virginia to build a road from the terminus of ours, at 'Powell's Bend,' via
                        Martinsburg to the line of that State, and Virginia has incorporated a
                        company to continue this improvement to Winchester, and thence into Luray
                        Valley, looking to a further extension to points crossing the Manassas Gap
                        and Chesapeake and Ohio Railroads, and indeed, communicating with the entire
                        Southwest. Little or nothing has yet been accomplished in the execution of
                        these projects, except the organization of the Martinsburg and Potomac
                        Company, whose road embraces the line between the terminus of our road at
                        "Powell's Bend," and the Virginia State line near Winchester. This company
                        has been organized with the Hon. Chas. J. Faulkner at its head, a
                            suficicient amount of stock subscribed, and the work will be
                        let and commenced immediately. This will render necessary the erection of a
                        bridge over the Potomac river at the present terminus of our road, having a
                        span of eight hundred and forty feet. The river here is shallow, with an
                        entire rock bottom.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion the President pays the following compliment to the
                        Superintendent and master mechanic which the public with
                        prominence were merited. We cannot close this report without speaking in the
                        highest terms of respect of those who are employed in conducting our
                        business. The burthen of the work devolves upon our General Superintendent,
                        O. N. Dall, whose experience, and devotion to his
                        business impel him to calm her, and skillfully grade,  operations. A.
                        S. Hunt, our master mechanic, served an apprenticeship in
                        the shops, whose operations he now directs with so much satisfaction. But
                        the best evidence of the value of the services of such men, is found in the
                         of the quiet manner, and perfect system in which all the work is
                        performed under their direction.</p>
