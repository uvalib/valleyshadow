<b>The Fifteenth Amendment</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Scathingly reports on the inevitable confirmation of the 15th amendment.
                    Attacks it for violating the will of the people and states rights. Only hopes
                    now that some day it will be condemned by like-minded men.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Georgia has ratified the Fifteenth Amendment, and it is claimed by the
                        Radicals that this makes up the requisite number of States to establish it
                        as the law of the land. It is doubtful, however, whether the Secretary of
                        State will declare the amendment ratified by twenty-eight States in view of
                        the fact that New York has withdrawn her consent, given by a former
                        Legislature, and the further fact, that the ratification of Indiana was the
                        act of less than a quorum of the members of its Legislature.</p>
                    <p>The proposition is in itself sufficiently startling, and the manner of its
                        adoption so outrageously regardless of the true sentiment of the people,
                        that he may well hesitate before he declares it ratified according to the
                        forms of law. For instance, there is no sensible man, who has mingled
                        largely with the people of this Commonwealth, who doubts, that, if the
                        amendment had been submitted at any time in the past, or if it were
                            summitted now, to them at the polls, it would have been, and
                        would be now, overwhelmingly defeated. Negro suffrage has always been
                        unpopular with our people and is no less so now. It is an act of fearful
                        injustice to the people, therefore, for a Legislature elected without
                        reference to this question at all to undertake to force this obnoxious
                        doctrine upon a State whose people were up in arms against it and anxious to
                        have an expression of opinion upon it, each one for himself. And so it was
                        in many other States. Designing men have so arranged it that the people, who
                        believe in a White man's government, could express their opinions at the
                        ballot box, but were forced to submit to the action of men of their own
                        party, who claimed to represent them by voting for this amendment, when, in
                        reality, they knew that they would be representing their sentiments truly by
                        voting against it. The amendment, even if ratified by twenty-eight
                        Legislatures is not the work of the people. It is simply a successful piece
                        of political chicanery, having its origin in the minds of wicked aspirants
                        for power, who thought they saw in this measure an opportunity to push their
                        fanaticism, and, at the same time insure the ascendancy of their party for
                        many years to come.</p>
                    <p>Our State constitution contains the word white as
                        one of the qualifications of a voter within this Commonwealth. That same
                        constitution provided the process of its amendment. It is difficult for a
                        Pennsylvanian to see how the Fifteenth Amendment can operate so as to
                        enfranchise the negro, in this State until our State constitution is altered
                        according to its own provisions. The Radicals do not hesitate to violate the
                        forms of law, however, and the amendment will be declared binding upon all
                        the States whenever the Secretary of State issues his proclamation asserting
                        that the ratification of twenty-eight States has been procured.</p>
                    <p>Then, too, there is the other objection, that the assent of the Southern
                        States has been procured by force and fraud. It is an outrage that the
                        American people should not tolerate, that the fundamental law of their
                        republic should be thus changed so vitally by compulsory measures applied to
                        certain States of the Union. Perhaps, some day, these questions may be
                        raised before a competent and fearless tribunal and this scandalous
                        proceeding receive the condemnation that it so richly merits. Meanwhile, we
                        presume, the negro will vote, and be elected to office.</p>

<b>The Negro in the United States Senate</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Quotes from a Republican paper on the acceptance of Hiram Revels in the
                    Senate. He received warm introduction from most Republican senators but some
                    bystanders and upper South Senators only looked on with horror. Generally a
                    positive tone.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Washington correspondent of the New York Herald, writing under date of the 2nd instant, gives the following
                        account of the reception extended to the negro Senator from Mississippi when
                        he presented himself in the Senate on that day. We commend it to those who
                        rejoice in the elevation of the black man to such a position of honor and
                        trust:--"Revels, the Mississippi Senator, the first representative of his
                        race and color chosen to fill a seat in the upper branch of the national
                        legislature, made his appearance again to-day on the floor of the Senate.
                        Revels was dressed in a black suit of fine cloth, coat very long and
                        clerical like, and pants and vest of corresponding proportion. He wore dark
                        gloves, also, and carried a mulatto colored stick. The distinguished darkey
                        made quite a sensation. The moment he came into the Senate Chamber and took
                        his seat on one of the luxurious lounges, several Senators hurried over to
                        him, shook him warmly by the hand and welcomed him to his new field of
                        labor. Charles Sumner was among the first to offer, in very hearty style,
                        smiling all over and saying a quantity of very pretty things, which the
                        colored Senator heard with genuine pleasure. It was a spectacle worth
                        looking at to see Sumner and Revels, thus practically illustrating the idea
                        of political and social equality. Thayer, Chandler, Howard, Cameron, Warner,
                        Spencer, Drake, Lewis, Howe and other Senators paid their respects. Cameron
                        had quite a talk with Revels. Spencer, of Alabama, sat down with Revels,
                        and, while making his congratulations, took a full survey of the ladies in
                        the gallery, who were looking down upon the scene, some with pleasure and
                        others with astonishment and horror. Spencer, you must know, is a great
                        favorite with the ladies. An effort was made to get fiery little Garret
                        Davis to allow himself to be led into the presence of Revels for
                        introduction, but the live Kentuckian could not see it; neither could
                        McCreery, colleague of Davis, who clings to the old time prejudices with
                        true ante bellum tenacity."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Republicans evidently calculate on an eternity of taxation. Mr. Grant's
                        administration is determined to push the scheme of converting the
                        Commissioner of Internal Revenue into a cabinet officer, with a
                        proportionate increase of salary and dignity. This means that there are to
                        be more taxes, and more officials. At the very time when people look for,
                        and have a right to expect a reduction of taxation, and the discharge of at
                        least a portion of the officials who are fattening at their expense, they
                        are met by a plan that involves a perpetuation of taxes and an increase of
                        tax-gatherers.</p>
                    <p>The Radicals have the majority in Congress just now. They have the power, and
                        they will probably exercise it, to push this measure through. But we predict
                        that the new Secretary of Internal Revenue will be the shortest-lived
                        Cabinet official that has ever been known. His official existence may
                        continue until the inauguration of the next President, although it may
                        terminate with the first session of the new Congress that is to be elected
                        next fall. The signs are unmistakable that the people are heartily sick of
                        Grant and all his consequences--brothers-in-law included.</p>
                    <p>When the Democracy comes into power it will make a clean sweep of the whole
                        brood of tax collectors, and effect a thorough reform of our tax system.
                        Even the skeleton of the new Cabinet Minister will not be left to mark the
                        vanity of Republican hopes of everlasting taxes.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime Grant and the Republicans may go on crowding tax-gatherers
                        into the Cabinet, Custom-house, and every other place where a cent can be
                        wrung out of the people.</p>
                    <p>But it will be pleasant work for Democrats to bowl them all over some of
                        these days.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, however, we must all grin and bear it.---Pomeroy's Democrat.</p>
