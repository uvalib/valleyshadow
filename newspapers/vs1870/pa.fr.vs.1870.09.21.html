<b>Be Registered</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges all conservative men to make sure they get registered to vote. Explains the
     intricacies of the Registry laws so no one will get confused, especially naturalized citizens.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>We direct attention to some of the important provisions of the Registry law. It is the duty
      of every conservative citizen to vote at the coming election. His single ballot may have a
      wonderful effect in controlling the majority in the next House of Representatives. Read this
      article and what you must do in order to vote:</p>
     <p>It is your duty to see to it that your are registered. The duty
      is imposed by the law upon the Assessor of your district to register you, but it is a duty you
      owe to the country to see to it that he has not neglected to register you. Do not wait for anybody else to attend to this matter for you. Go, inquire and examine for
       yourself. You have a right to examine the Assessor's lists, free of charge. Nobody can deny
       you that privilege.</p>
     <p>These lists should contain your name, and the names of all other qualified voters in the
      district; they should state, if your a house keeper, the number of your house; the street it
      fronts on; your occupation; if you board, where and with whom you board; if you work for
      another, your employer's name; and opposite your name should be written the word "voter."</p>
     <p>If you find your name is not on the list, go yourself to the
      assessor, and make your claim to be put on. He is bound to add your name. He cannot question
      your right. You need not discuss the matter with him, your "claim" is enough. Give him also
      your precise residence, occupation, &amp;c. He will mark "C. V." opposite your name.
      Attend to this at once. If you delay until within ten days of the election, you may lose your
      vote.</p>
     <p>The law remains the same as to the payment of taxes. You must have paid either a State or
      County tax assessed within two years. If you have not done this, attend to it without delay.
       When you go to the polls take your last tax receipt with you. Let
      nothing prevent you having yourself registered and paying your taxes now lest something may occur to prevent you hereafter.</p>
     <p>Naturalized citizens must exhibit their papers to the Assessor in order to get their names
      registered. If they have not received their "last papers" yet, but intend to take them out
      before the election, they must show their "first papers" to the Assessor.</p>
     <p>All naturalized citizens must take their "papers" with them to the
      polls, unless they have been voting for ten years in the same district.</p>
     <p>They must take their "papers" with them when they vote, even if their
       names are on the list.</p>
     <p>This should not be forgotten for, if it is neglected, they will be deprived of their votes
      by their enemies.</p>
     <p>To naturalized citizens we would say, examine the lists to see whether your names are on
      them or not.</p>
     <p>If you have been naturalized, there will also appear the letter "N." If you have merely
      declared your intention to become a citizen, the letters "D.I."</p>
     <p>Those who intend to "vote on age" being between 21 and 22 years old should see to it that
      they are registered. Let them examine the Assessor's lists and search for their names for
      themselves. They ought to find the word "age" opposite their names.</p>
     <p>Let those who have removed into the district since the last election, examine the lists. If
      their names are there, the letter "R" ought to appear opposite their names.</p>
     <p>To everybody who intends to vote the Conservative ticket, we say, get
       yourselves registered, if you are not already registered.</p>

<b>Cessna's "War Record"</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Disgusted that Cessna attacks Meyers for being a Democratic "Copperhead" during the
     war. Meticulously goes through Cessna's association with the Democratic party during the war,
     pointing out that he only switched parties at the end of the war.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>John Cessna is circulating documents all over this Congressional district attacking the "war
      record" of Mr. Meyers. He is loading down the mails with hundreds of these pamphlets, sent
      under his frank as a member of Congress, but he seems to be perfectly oblivious of the fact
      that he has a "war record" also. Along with this pamphlet attacking Mr. Meyers, he is
      distributing another document containing a "literary" speech delivered before the Alumni of
      Franklin and Marshall College at Lancaster in 1864. The object of this speech was to announce
      to the people of the State his transmigration from the Democratic party to the camp of the
      Republican party, and he therein makes the extraordinary pretension that he had been an
      earnest war man from the beginning of the war down to the time of making the speech. He says:
      "every individual must be found upon the one side or the other of the great struggle which now
      astonishes the world. There can be no neutrality. Men may assume to be indifferent and profess
      to take no interest in the contest, but at heart every one is upon one side or the other. He
      that is not for us is against us. There can be no possibility of avoiding a decision. My own decision has long since been made and position taken. I hope no
      doubtful record of that decision may be left behind me."</p>
     <p>Now let us see. This man who suddenly assumed the barb of "loyalty" and pretended to have been wearing it all the time, and who afterwards delighted his
      malignant soul with shrieking out his vituperations of "Copperheads," was one of the worst
      "Copperheads" himself at the outset of the war. He can not and shall not escape from his own
      record, now that he is pretending to have been, all through the war, "without spot or
      blemish."</p>
     <p>The celebrated Peace Convention assembled in Harrisburg on the 21st day of February, A. D.
      1861. Jefferson Davis had, about ten days before, been inaugurated President of the
      Confederate States at Montgomery, Alabama.</p>
     <p>Cessna was a member of this Peace Convention. It was on his motion that a Committee of
      thirty-three was appointed to draft resolutions expressive of the sense of the Convention. In
      his motion he embodied a provision that the Committee should select it own Chairman. Had this
      not been done he, as mover of the resolution, would have been appointed Chairman of the
      Committee. He was, however appointed a member of the Committee and
      Hon. Ellie Lewis was elected Chairman. That Committee reported a series of resolutions of
      which the following is one:</p>
     <p>Resolved, That we will, by all proper and legitimate means, oppose, discountenance and prevent any attempt on the part of the Republicans
       in power to make any armed aggressions upon the Southern States: especially so long as laws
       contravening their rights shall remain unrepealed on the statute books of Northern
      States, and so long as the just demands of the South shall continue to be unrecognized
      by the Republican majorities in those States and unsecured by proper amendatory explanations
      of the Constitution.</p>
     <p>Cessna voted for this resolution. The whole series was adopted by
      a unanimous vote, and then, Cessna, among others, addressed the Convention
       in a speech corresponding to the spirit of the resolutions. He had not taken his
      position then with the "War party."</p>
     <p>In the fall of 1861, he became the Democratic candidate for Assembly in the Somerset and
      Bedford district and was defeated by Mr. Householder. He went to Harrisburg and began his
      sleight of hand tricks in the matter of contested elections. He succeeded in obtaining the
      seat as a Democrat. The storm of popular passion in favor of the
      war had then swept over the country, but he had not yet taken his position
       with the "war party."</p>
     <p>In the fall of 1862, he was renominated by the Democracy, and elected to the Legislature.
      That was the period when the Democracy carried the State on account of the dissatisfaction of
      the people with the conduct of the war. Democratic candidates "made the most" of this
      discontent. Cessna as a candidate did the same. He denounced the Emancipation Proclamation in
      the bitterest terms. Surely, he had not then taken his position with the
       "war party."</p>
     <p>On the 6th day of January A. D. 1863, he was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives
      by the Democratic members. He had the confidence of the party to a wonderful extent then. If
      the party was the "Copperhead party" then, Cessna as one of its prominent representatives was
      certainly a "Copperhead" also. At any rate he had not taken his position
       with the "war party" then.</p>
     <p>At the Democratic Convention held in Harrisburg on the 4th day of July A. D. 1863, just when
      the news of the Union victory at Gettysburg was electrifying the world, Cessna was present,
      submitting his claims to that body as candidate for Governor. He received nine votes. One of the resolutions passed by that Convention, at whose hands Cessna
      was asking a nomination for the highest office in the gift of the people of the State, reads
      as follows:</p>
     <p>Resolved, That we heartily thank the lion-hearted Democracy of
      Ohio for the manly vindication they have given to the constitution against the great crime
      committed upon it in the arrest and deportation of Clement L. Vallandingham; and we assure
      them of our cordial sympathy in the great struggle they are making for their undoubted rights.</p>
     <p>Cessna had not taken his position with the War party at that
      time.</p>
     <p>Cessna has always insisted, we understand, that he voted for Judge Woodward in October 1863,
      so that he had not "taken his position with the "war party" then.
      Let us see how much longer he acted with the Democratic party. We quote from the address of
      Hon. Francis Jordan, Secretary of the Commonwealth in 1866, to the Union voters of Bedford
      county. Says Col. Jordan:</p>
     <p>"At the August Court, 1864, I was invited by the County Committee to come up and address a
      mass meeting to be held in the Court House. Finding the meeting very large and enthusiastic,
      and only General Koontz and myself to address it, and regarding the issues of immense
      importance. I called on Mr. Cessna on the 30th of August and invited him to aid us, and make
      us a speech. He declined, reminding me that the Chicago Convention was then in session, and he
      waited first to see what it would do. That Convention nominated M'Clellan and Pendleton, and
      adopted its notorious peace platform; and soon afterwards General Sherman captured Atlanta.
      Men much less sagacious than Mr. Cessna, could then plainly see that party, and the rebellion,
      were both in the agonies of final dissolution. Then it was, and not until
       then, that he self-sacrificingly deserted the old Democratic party, and patriotically
      came over and identified himself with us, and the great Union party of the country; and like the bat in the fable, he is now asseverating that he was on our side
       all the time. This is only sixteen short months ago; and yet here is this modest
      gentleman, thrusting himself forward as the first man in the Commonwealth, so recently from
      the ranks of the enemy that he has scarcely had time to change his uniform or learn our
      watchwords. Little could this have been supposed three years ago when he was a candidate for
      Governor before the copperhead convention, which nominated Judge Woodward, or sixteen months
      ago, when he refused to strike a blow with us until he could first ascertain what might be
      expected of the traitors then assembled at Chicago."</p>
     <p>Thus it seems that the little fellow crawled into the Republican party in August 1864, just eight months before the war closed, and he now has the effrontery
      to attack other men's war records and to claim that his position as an excessively loyal man
      had been taken at the beginning of the war.</p>
     <p>We would have been perfectly willing to allow this to pass by in this campaign. We are
      anxious to fight this contest on the issues of to-day. But Cessna has seen fit to reopen the
      subject by circulating what he asserts to be Mr. Meyers' "War record," and we deemed it but
      just that the pot which calls the kettle black should be exhibited to the gaze of the
     people.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>Last Saturday evening, the campaign was opened in Franklin county by the Democracy of
      Chambersburg. The Court House was well filled. On motion of J. McDowell Sharpe, Esq., Mr. B.Y.
      Hamsher was elected President. Messrs. Phares Duffield, of Guilford, and B.F. Nead, of this
      Borough, were chosen Vice Presidents, and Messrs. B.A. Cormany and H. C. Koontz, Secretaries,
      W.S. Stenger, Esq., then made a brief speech and introduced to the meeting Hon. B. F. Meyers
      Democratic candidate for Congress. Mr. Meyers was received with rounds of applause. He
      proceeded at once to discuss the questions at issue in the campaign. He attacked the
      administration of President Grant, charging it with attempting to deceive the people as to the
      extent of the reduction of the public debt. He showed the deception practiced by Secretary
      Boutwell in his monthly statements. He commented upon the fact that it costs several millions more to "run" the governmental machine now than it did
      under the administration of James Buchanan. He spoke of some of the useless items of
      expenditure. Among these is the amount expended in maintaining our large standing army, which
      is being used for no other purpose than to overawe the citizens of the Southern States in
      order to secure the success of the Radical party in that section.--He exposed the rascality of
      Congress in resurrecting the infamous Income Tax in spite of the earnest and overwhelming
      protests of the people. He denounced the Enforcement bill which fines and imprisons landlords
      for threatening to dispossess black tenants on account of politics,
      while it leaves white tenants to take care of themselves. He laid
      bare Cessna's thimble-rigging in the contested election cases whereby he threw Mr. Simpson, of
      South Carolina, and Col. Switzler, of Missouri, out of their seats, although the one had been
      elected by 1,500 and the other by 4,000 majority. He "showed up" Cessna's vote, throwing away
      three-quarters of a million dollars to the North American and European Railway Company on a
      trumped-up claim of the State of Massachusetts for losses in the war of 1812. He made manifest
      Cessna's violation of his pledge in 1866 that the people of the District
       should have an opportunity to vote on the question of negro suffrage. He attacked
      vigorously, and with telling effect, the combination of the New England cotton manufacturers
      and the salt monopolists and the Bessemer steel patentees to "protect" their special interests
      to the utmost whilst they reduced the duty on pig metal from nine to seven
       dollars per ton, and Cessna voted to sustain this "Ring." He then drew a graphic
      portrait of Cessna as a "loyal" man, showing that he and the speaker were Democrats up to 1864
      and that the "Copperhead" articles that he had written were written to aid Cessna's election
      when he was a candidate for the Legislature in Bedford county.</p>
     <p>Mr. Meyers spoke for an hour and a half, and was frequently interrupted with cheers. The
      speech was clear and forcible, free from personal abuse altogether. It was straight-forward
      and manly, the speaker striving to conceal nothing, but only to make a frank avowal of his
      opinion. We congratulate Mr. Meyers on his address feeling, as we do, that it gave
      satisfaction to all the Conservative men who heard it.</p>
     <p>Capt. Skinner was called out and made a few remarks expressing his willingness as a
      candidate to stand by his record last session.</p>
     <p>Senator Duncan responded to the call of the meeting in a brief but happy speech and moved an
      adjournment with three cheers for the Congressional candidate and the whole Democratic ticket.
      The cheers were given heartily and the audience quietly dispersed.</p>

</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>On last Thursday night, the negroes of this Borough indulged in a torch-light procession.
      Whether the Radical leaders lent them their "Wide Awake" lamps, or whether they used part of
      Cessna's $100,000 to buy them new ones, we are not informed. At any rate, about seventy-five
      negroes marched through our principal streets, carrying lamps and singing songs. They bore no
      banners with strange devices or inscription. The white men who managed and who intend to
      manipulate the colored men, thought it advisable not to "pile it on too thick," and therefore
      dispensed with mottoes for the present. Very few of the white Radicals could be seen on the
      streets. They did not seem willing to give open countenance to the demonstration. But the
      negroes made the most of the privileges accorded to them. A column of negroes, armed with
      clubs, marched along each side of the street, to guard the procession from an apprehended
      attack. These fellows with their bludgeons were very impudent and seemed to be "spoiling for a
      fight." On West Market street, they "made a break" through Mr. King's marble yard, pretending
      that some one in that vicinity had done something to disturb them in their march. They found
      no one, as no one had interfered.</p>
     <p>After marching and countermarching to their own satisfaction, they proceeded to Water
      street, where the addresses were to be made. This was near ten o'clock. One made a speech in
      the course of which he said that "the Egg of Democracy was laid in hell and hatched in de
      Souf." He also said he was "gwine to wait to see what de debbil Spirit would say 'bout dis procession and den he would gib it fits." During his
      speech, the darkies became somewhat noisy and the speaker concluded that it was best to stop.
      Another speaker followed him, and began to make a temperance speech, when some of the audience
      yelled "No you don't! No you don't! Cessna buys our whisky. Confine yourself to de questions
      ob de day." He continued, but before he had talked long, the cry of "Murder" was heard. One
      negro had been knocked down by another negro with a stone. As they could not get any whites to
      interfere with them, they determined to have a fight among themselves. Then followed a lively
      skirmish. Stones, clubs, slung-shots and razors were brought into use and several persons were
      roughly handled and pretty severely hurt. The fight kept up until midnight, and the meeting
      was broken up altogether. The next morning several razors were picked up at the place where
      the fight occurred. A half dozen warrants have been issued for some of the leaders.</p>
     <p>The good citizens of that vicinity are not in a hurry to witness another procession of this
      kind. These infuriated negroes were a perfect terror to that whole neighborhood during that
      night.</p>
     <p>We can not say what caused the fight. Certain it is that no whites were
       mixed up in it at all; the fight was confined to the negroes themselves.</p>
     <p>Whether or not, the white managers of the procession had supplied some of the blacks freely
      with money, out of the corruption fund, with which to buy whisky, we can not say, but some of
      them were very full of "benzine," and it must have been supplied liberally from some outside
      source. These poor colored fellows have not much money to spend for liquor, but many of them
      are known to be excessively fond of it. A cheap way for the Radical leaders to please the
      negroes is to furnish them with flasks of whisky.</p>
     <p>Are the the people anxious to see these scenes repeated?</p>
     <p>Do they desire to be disturbed by midnight brawls resulting from such demonstrations? If
      not, let them vote to keep the control of all governmental affairs in the hands of white
     men.</p>

      hands with all whom he met and cultivating terms of perfect familiarity with them. Our old
      friend "Wash" Cooper, he greeted as General Jackson. "Wash" is mad. He says he did not serve
      under General Jackson--that Cessna ought to have known that his military services were
      rendered in Mexico under General Ringgold.</p>
     <p>We can not say whether Cessna allowed any portion of his $100,000 to slip into the hands of
      his colored friends or not; they can tell best about that. But one thing is certain that they
      would have accepted the money more gratefully than they did his cheap pretended friendship. By
      the way, before the right of suffrage was conferred on the negroes, when did Cessna go to such
      trouble to shake hands with them on the streets? He has often been here before, but we never
      knew him to be engaged in this occupation.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>The Synod of the Reformed Church in the United States at its late meeting at Danville,
      resolved to erect a monument to the memory of the late Rev. Dr. Harbaugh, of the Theological
      Seminary at Mercersburg, Pa. The committee, whom they had previously appointed on this
      subject, were allowed to raise subscriptions to meet this expense during its sessions, to
      which there was a quick and hearty response. The committee subsequently adopted a style of
      monument and had it executed by an artist in York, Pa., D. Kern, which is said to be a
      superior place of workmanship, reflecting great credit on Mr. Kern.</p>
     <p>We are informed that the committee having charge of this testimonial of affection on behalf
      of the Synod, intend to unveil it with appropriate services and an address on the 18th of next
      month, (October) at Mercersburg, in this county.</p>
     <p>This monument is said by those who have seen it, to be chaste and original in style, and
      finely executed in the finest Italian marble; and is designed to express the character and
      spirit of the man to whose memory it is to be reared. It will be about twelve feet in height
      when placed in position, resting on a granite base, and terminating in a cross. It is in
      Tableau style--the front surface resting on three terraces, of stone, is three feet in width,
      on which the artist has cut in almost life size in bas-relief a profile bust of Dr. Harbaugh,
      just under the cross, and above a shield which bears his name, title, birth and death. On the
      right side of this shield in relief stands a student with book in one hand, as if on his way
      to, or returning from a recitation, who has stopped to drop a tear at this grave, for his left
      hand is lifted with a fold of his mantle to his eye, as if in the act of wiping away the
      falling tear. Whilst on the other side of the shield stands the figure of an angel of large
      size, and also relief, with head uncovered and face turned upward, whilst the forefinger of
      the right hand, uplifted, is pointing heavenwards. This angel bears in its other hand, gently
      resting on the graceful folds of its flowing robe, a palm-leaf, a symbol of victory. The calm
      countenance of the angel, though in cold marble seems to have in it a beam of hope that speaks
      of the victory over death which they have who die in the faith. And though its lips move not,
      its expression and attitude say to this weeping mourner; "He is not dead;" "he is not here,"
      he is above; he bore the cross, he has gained the crown. Whilst the empty shells, cut out of
      the same stone and lying on the main slab and beneath the cross, silently speak of the
      spirit's departure, and that here rest but the remains, that which was mortal, waiting the
      resurrection of the last day. On the two lower terraces of marble on the front is lettering.
      On the upper a stanza from one of Dr. Harbaugh's hymns, which expresses in a few, but vigorous
      words his childlike, yet strong faith. They read:<br> "Living or dying, Lord.<br> I ask but
      to be thine;<br> My life in Thee, Thy life in me,<br> Makes heaven forever mine."</p>
     <p>The lower slab above the granite base contains simply the family name,<br> "HARBAUGH."</p>
     <p>Upon the right and left face of this lower block, which presents a surface of 12x17 inches
      are out in Pennsylvania German, two extracts of his poem entitled "Heemweh," or Home-Sickness,
      which in the German is touching and full of religious pathos. The one is:<br> "O, wann's net
      vor der Himmel waer,<br> Mit seiner scheene Ruh.<br> Danti waer m'r's do achun
      langverieedt,<br> Ich wisst net, was ze dhu,<br> Doch Hoffnung lelchtet meinen Weg,<br> Der
      ew'gen Heemet zu."</p>
     <p>Which Dr. H. translated himself as follows:<br> "O, were it not for you bright Heaven,<br>
      With its unchanging rest,<br> How heavy would our burdens be,<br> Our life how sore
      distressed;<br> But hope illumes our pathway to<br> The regions of the blest."</p>
     <p>The other inscription in Pennsylvania German from the same poem, is equally expressive of
      all that Dr. Harbaugh wrote concerning the future life, as expressing his own hope. It
      reads:--<br> "Dort find m'r, was m'r do verilert,<br> Un b'halt's in Ewigkeit;<br> Dort
      lews unare Dodte all,<br> In Licht un ew'ger Freid!"</p>
     <p>Which he translated himself thus:--<br> "There we shall find what here we lose,<br> And
      keep it evermore;<br> There we shall join our sainted dead,<br> Who are but gone before."</p>
     <p>This monument in its design and execution, it is said, will bear critical examination; and
      is a worthy memorial of so good, genial and great a man, whose memory will be long cherished
      in the church to which he belonged. Dr. Harbaugh's name will be a household word in the homes
      of thousands of Christian families, without respect to denominational relations, in
      generations to come, who shall cheer their hearts and brighten their hopes for the future by
      reading his "Sainted Dead," his "Heavenly Recognition," and his "Heavenly Home."</p>
     <p>The services and address connected with the unveiling of the monument will, doubtless, be
      interesting, and attract quite a number of persons to Mercersburg from the surrounding
      portions of the country. And as the Synod of the Church, under whose auspices it will be
      erected, meets a day or two later, doubt less some of the delegates to that body--Lay and
      Clerical--will stop in that (to them) classic village, to participate in these sad, yet
      pleasing, memorial services. And, many a tear will again drop around this tomb, where so many
      fell before when they laid his remains in their last resting-place, not two years ago, to
      await the resurrection at the last day. And yet with these tears will flow a subdued joy in
      knowing that he is only "gone before." And being dead, according to the body, by his genius,
      spirit and faith, "he yet liveth," "he yet speaketh," to cheer others in their homeward
      journey.</p>
