<b>The Howl Against Free Trade from Free Traders</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Asks how the Radical press can condemn Democrats on the tariff issue when
                    so many Republicans are in favor of free trade. Gives the example of Cessna's
                    votes in Congress as proof.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Repository seeks to hold the Pennsylvania
                        Democracy responsible for some of the vagaries of the Southern people on the
                        negro suffrage question. Will it apply the same rule to the Pennsylvania
                        Radicals on the tariff question? It keeps writing vigorously in favor of a
                        protective tariff, and yet its Editor knows that the Radicals of the great
                        West are all arrayed in deadly hostility to the doctrines which he
                        advocates. A large majority of the present Congress are Radicals and yet the
                        free-traders nearly had a majority. Why does he attack Democrats, therefore,
                        on account of free-trade notions? Why does he not apply his whip to the
                        backs of his own political friends?--Even General Walbridge, in nominating
                        Grant for another term, intimates that there must only be a temporary
                        postponement of the tariff questions, and that it will soon be expedient and
                        practicable to strike for free trade.</p>
                    <p>And so demoralizing, on this subject, means the atmosphere at Washington that
                            John Cessna voted at the last session to reduce the
                            duty on pig iron from nine to seven dollars per ton. The fact is
                        that some of the strongest free traders are in the ranks of the Radical
                        party, and that ere long they will demand the fullest recognition of their
                        principles in the administration of the government. These long professions
                        on the tariff issue are only intended to cheat the people, just as the
                        solemn promises made by the Radical leaders that the people should have an
                        opportunity to vote on the negro suffrage issue were only intended to
                        deceive.</p>
                    <p>Considering the ugly complications in which the Radical party is involved on
                        the tariff question, and the fact that they have had control of the
                        government for ten years and have not satisfied
                            themselves in all that time in the way of protection, it
                        certainly requires a considerable amount of brass for Radical journals to
                        keep hammering away at Democratic candidates for anticipated action. The
                        sins of omission and commission in regard to this very subject, chargeable
                        upon Radical members of Congress, are allowed to pass by unnoticed, whilst
                        the people are asked to condemn Democratic candidates in advance for what
                        Radicals apprehend they may do. But especially should the organ of John
                        Cessna keep quiet after that vote to reduce the duty on
                            pig iron from nine to sever dollars per ton.</p>

<b>What has Cessna Done for the Border Claimants?</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes Cessna for not doing more to drum up support for border claims
                    payments. Asks why if he's so popular in Congress, he did not do anything to
                    help his own constituents on this issue.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Repository, some weeks ago, promised us a
                        little light on this subject, but we have watched and waited in vain. We
                        have reviewed the honorable member's record, and, if there was any motion
                        made, or resolution read by him in Congress on this subject, it has escaped
                        our notice altogether. We are boiling over with anxiety to do him justice
                        and, if the Repository can give us a line
                        written, or a word spoken, by Cessna in Congress, which squints at an effort
                        on his part to procure payment for the losses of our people, we will be glad
                        to lay it before our readers. It is asserted by Radical journals that he is
                        one of the most influential members of Congress. Indeed, so popular is he
                        alleged to be, that one of the arguments used for procuring votes for him is
                        that he will be elected Speaker of the next Congress. There is no doubt but
                        that Cessna dreams of attaining to that position. Some few of his political
                        friends are, doubtless, sanguine enough to believe that he may be successful
                        in carrying off this prize. Why is it then, we ask, that a man so extremely
                        popular, so wonderfully useful and about to be so signally honored, has
                        never opened his mouth in Congress in behalf of his constituents upon whom
                        the horrors of war fell with such terrible force? Why is it that he was
                        always occupied about other people's business, tinkering at an infamous
                        reconstruction policy, or playing sleight-of-hand tricks in contested
                        election cases? A man of such marvelous influence and prodigious popularity
                        might at least have had the courage, even "solitary and alone," to "put this
                        ball in motion." As this matter is getting to be "serious," we would like
                        the Repository to "give it all the consideration
                        it merits."</p>
