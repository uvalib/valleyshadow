                    <p>The blow of the Vandal that doomed Chambersburg in the summer of 1864 was
                        terrible in its rebound, and its fatal fury fell upon the most beautiful
                        city of the South. Columbia is the capital of the State that gave birth to
                        the monster Secession. It was here, in the midst of her green oaks, almost
                        arching the broad streets with their boughs, that the first convention was
                        called to inaugurate the dismemberment of the Union, and it was here that
                        the first ordinance of secession was fashioned and considered. As if to
                        foreshadow the fearful retribution that was to follow the attempt to destroy
                        the government, the passage of the secession ordinance was interrupted, and
                        the convention driven to Charleston, by the appearance of a malignant
                        epidemic in this usually most healthy city. In the winter of 1865 Gen.
                        Sherman came, and his footsteps were marked by desolation. By whose order
                        the capital of the chivalry was doomed to the flames, I will not attempt to
                        decide, but it is not questioned that released prisoners, long tortured and
                        starved in Southern prison-pens, and portions of the legions of Sherman,
                        especially the sons of the Keystone State, flung the torch into many of the
                        palatial and forest shaded mansions of the sublime votaries of disunion. On
                        that dreadful day and night, when the flames were kissing each other above
                        the house tops of Columbia, the cry - <emph rend="italics">"In memory of
                            Chambersburg,"</emph> carried despair to the inmate of every home at
                        whose door it was uttered. It was the signal of desolation, and the flying
                        mother and children of the South cursed the name of M'Causland as they bowed
                        in agony before the consuming retribution that had fallen upon them. In vain
                        did brigade and division commanders attempt to stop the work of destruction,
                        and Gen. Sherman himself finally appeared amidst the flames and saved a
                        considerable portion of the city. The Convent was swept down in the stream
                        of fire, and the nuns appealed to Gen. Sherman for protection. "Go," said
                        he, "select a retreat and I will guard it." They opened the gates of the
                        Hampton Mansion, and thus saved the parental home of the brilliant
                        confederate trooper. It stands in the middle of a full square, surrounded by
                        a forest of oaks and shrubbery, but it has not escaped the rust and <orig
                            reg="dilapidation">delapidation</orig> that reign throughout the South.
                        On the main business street, extending from the capital a mile or more in
                        the North west, not a tenement survived the flames, and for several squares
                        in almost every direction, the escape of a building was exceptional. A
                        beautiful church was fired because it was supposed to be the place the
                        secession convention met, but its parishioners suffered for the sins of
                        another. The old weather-beaten brick church that entertained the fathers of
                        secession, still stands in painful solitude, surrounded by charred walls and
                        the blackened trunks of the once graceful shade trees that beautified the
                        streets. I have walked through the ruins of the main street in Chambersburg,
                        and heard the shrill greeting of the owl from the broken columns and
                        withered bowers of the fated village, and felt that sorrow had reaped its
                        fullest harvest there; but I then did not know how greatly the people of the
                        North were blessed above the people of the South. Chambersburg has
                        recovered. Her people had energy, industry and hope, and they reared new
                        homes over the ashes of their old ones. Here and there the blow was
                        crushing, but as a rule the same people are there enjoying the beautiful
                        structures they have reared to retrieve their adversity. Not so in Columbia.
                        Her people still sit in despair in the midst of their desolation. Her men
                        walk the streets from day to day in sullen, hopeless helplessness, and her
                        mothers and daughters seem to be widowed in pride, poverty and hate. A few
                        of the more enterprising, chiefly of the despised industrial classes, have
                        built stores on the broad avenue of trade but still four-fifths of the
                        street lies in horrid vacancy, and the houses which escaped, all bear the
                        marks of indolence and decay. Not until the Northman comes, with his capital
                        and energy, or until another generation supplants the present, can Columbia
                        be restored to her former beauty and prosperity.</p>

                    <p>As Gen. Sherman has well said, war is, at best, savage and barbarous. The
                        whole South has felt the force of her memorable sentences written in the
                        ruins of Atlanta; but the measure of judgment meted out to South Carolina is
                        unknown in any of the other Southern States. It was South Carolina that made
                        the sword the arbiter between the North and the South. She would accept no
                        mediation. She spurned the peaceful, constitutional means of redress for
                        real or imaginary grievances. Her guns first thundered against an unarmed
                        vessel bearing provisions to a starving garrison in Sumter, and her hot shot
                        were poured into the little command of Maj. Anderson, before a hostile act
                        had been committed against treason. Here the war began; here it culminated,
                        as Sherman swung across her Northern borders to receive the sword of <orig
                            reg="Johnston">Johnson</orig>, and here have fallen its bitterest
                        fruits. Here the cup of humiliation has been drunk to the dregs. Her people
                        were a people and a law unto themselves. Her lords were the most lordly of
                        all the South, and her serfs the most ignorant and abject. The lowest grade
                        of the negro swarms on the lowlands, along the coast, and the most pitiable
                        and degraded whites I have seen, starve out a miserable existence on her
                        sand hills. And all this is found in one of the most fruitful States in the
                        Union, and enjoying the most salubrious climate. Her plantations embraced
                        whole townships, and poverty and pride were the natural offspring of the
                        madness of her ruling class. Emancipation swept nearly four hundred millions
                        of property away from the few proprietors, leaving them prostrated in
                        bankruptcy, hopelessly ignorant of all rules of industry, and bound by a
                        pride that yet makes them prefer poverty and want, to well earned plenty. If
                        they have been first and deepest in the crime of secession, they have been
                        made to suffer as no other people have suffered. The lordly master of the
                        broad plantation is now the subject and the servant of the bondman. The new
                        capital, commenced by South Carolina, in her boundless pride, long before
                        the war, and designed by the <orig reg="">the</orig> leaders as the capitol
                        of the southern Oligarchy, stands near the centre of the city, still
                        unfinished, and surrounded by massive columns, many of them broken by the
                        fire that swept by it. Its architectural beauty is not apparent at first
                        glance, as its grand Corinthian pillars, elaborately carved stone <orig
                            reg="cornice">cornace</orig>, and exquisite marble finish, are still
                        wanting; but a million dollars worth of the finest marble and stone work,
                        designed to adorn the great capitol of the South, now lie as worthless
                        rubbish throughout the capitol grounds. Already more than three millions
                        have been expended on it, and two millions more will be necessary to
                        complete it. On the imposing front, facing the main street of the city, an
                        elaborate marble finish relieves the cold, grey native granite, and in <emph
                            rend="italics">bas relief</emph> are sculptured the revolutionary
                        leaders, M'Duffie and Hayne. In a lower range of massive granite blocks, are
                        deep alcoves for life-size statues of Calhoun and his co-laborers in
                        secession, some day to be filled, under the new order of rulers, by statues
                        of those who have been most conspicuous in maintaining the universal
                        brotherhood of man, and the dusky features of some child of bondage, may yet
                        fill the niche designed for a Rhett, or a Hammond. The building has been
                        fitted up temporarily this winter, and the first <orig reg="lawmakers">law
                            makers</orig> sitting in the new capital, are the long-despised bondmen,
                        and their few white friends, who, as a rule, are strangers to the State. On
                        its Western walls are the enduring marks of Sherman's round-shot, as they
                        were hurled from beyond the Congaree, to tell of his long dreaded coming.
                        The conqueror sits in her places of power to administer the laws enacted by
                        the recent victims of the lash and chain, and her statute laws are the
                        precursors of a strange people, who are gradually coming to mark her waste
                        places with fruitful fields, and dot her districts with schools to ennoble
                        the coming men of every race, and rear new churches to the living God. Truly
                        - </p>

                    <p>"The mills of the Gods grind slowly,<lb/> But they grind exceedingly small/"</p>

                    <p>Very slowly the more liberal men of South Carolina are learning the lesson of
                        Fate. For nearly five years they have made war against progress. They could
                        not and would not believe that the sacred social and political laws of South
                        Carolina must be changed. They clung to every ray of hope as the drowning
                        man clutches at the floating straw. They had hope in Johnson, but saw all
                        his promises turn to ashes in their hands. They had hope in Seymour, and
                        even in Blair, who shared in the destruction of Columbia, but it vanished as
                        the nation rolled up its great majority for Grant. They took fresh courage
                        from Virginia and Tennessee, but Mississippi and Texas have swept that away.
                        Those who are willing to see at all, now understand that reconstruction is
                        fashioned unalterably, and they would gladly lead their people to wisdom,
                        but it is a hopeless task. They will resist the political rights of the
                        freedman and spurn his counsels and political aid, until a new order of men
                        write the epitaphs of the present leaders of the whites. They will not
                        resist the laws, as a rule. Indeed they profess and mean obedience, but it
                        is the submission of the quarry slave who goes scourged to his dungeon. This
                        wide-spread feeling is the great barrier to the regeneration of the South.
                        The people do not war upon Northern men with violence. The person and
                        property of strangers are safer in South Carolina than in New York city,
                        but, as is most natural, they will war upon the Northern emigrant in a
                        thousand ways. They will shun him socially; they will avoid his place of
                        business; they will not employ him; in short they will render him only
                        civility and deal with him only from necessity. I have now been a month in
                        Columbia, and shared the hospitality of Northern people, but between them
                        and the natives there is an impassable social gulf. A few Southern men
                        lament it, but not one, so far as I know, has been able to open his doors to
                        the most reputable Northern visitors and welcome them to his fireside and
                        family. The attrition of business interests and intercourse gradually makes
                        Southern gentlemen sociable, but their families are beyond the reach of
                        reconstruction. For exercising this fatal influence over the destiny of
                        South Carolina, the women are rather to be pitied than blamed. The Northern
                        women cannot appreciate the sorrows of Southern women. Whether real or
                        imaginary the sorrow is the same. They have been reared in the utmost
                        dependence - not upon themselves, but upon others. They were taught, in
                        theory and in practice, that they were to command and others to obey, that
                        they were to enjoy and others to labor. Of the world they knew nothing,
                        beyond reaping where they had not sown, and now they are bereft of property
                        and service, and are plunged into poverty with utter helplessness to make it
                        perpetual. They dare not learn to be useful to themselves and their
                        children, for that would be disgraceful; they cannot learn, if they would,
                        for there are none to teach them. The independent, self-reliant, progressive
                        woman of the North is an abomination in their sight, and is shunned as an
                        unsexed social monster. Congress may practically reconstruct the men of the
                        South, but what power exists sufficient to the task of reconstructing the
                        Southern women? When this problem is solved, the work is reconstruction can
                        be completed. The solution is a question of years. How long it may take,
                        depends upon the measure of Northern emigration. Northern capitalists are
                        now gradually possessing the Southern railroads. Factories will follow and
                        employ the fine water-powers and cheap labor so abundant here. Farmers will
                        sell their Northern farms at $50 to $150 per acre, and buy equally fertile
                        lands, with the most inviting climate, for from $5 to $15 per acre, and
                        Northern mechanics must come to keep pace with Northern progress. Northern
                        merchants will settle in Northern communities, which will have Northern
                        schools and teachers, and Northern churches and pastors, and necessity will
                        make the Southerner advance. The present generation will move slowly, but
                        the next will be glad to accept Northern ways, and respect Northern energy.
                        The hope of the South is in Northern emigration, and the sooner it comes the
                        sooner will the blessings of peace and prosperity heal the wounds and
                        restore the desolated places of the sunny South. A. K. M.<lb/> COLUMBIA, S.

                <summary>This letter, written by A. K. M'Clure, describes the state of Columbia,
                    South Carolina, after its partial burning during the war. After contrasting this
                    burning to that of Chambersburg, M'Clure argues that the best hope for the South
                    is for Northerners to move there and take over all aspects of industry,
                    agriculture, and social life.</summary>

                <summary>The paper condemns Republicans in the state legislature who cooperated with
                    Democrats in electing a Democratic State Treasurer. The editors hold that they
                    are willing to disagree with the party when warranted, but this is not one of
                    those cases. Divisions within the party resulted in the election of a Democrat.</summary>

                    <p>The readers of the REPOSITORY need scarcely be told that the letter on the
                        first page of this number, Columbia and Chambersburg, is from the pen of
                        Col. A. K. M'Clure. Besides the interest which his able articles always
                        possess for our readers, this one has a special attraction in the fact that
                        it is written from the capital of South Carolina, which like our own
                        beautiful town was burned to ashes in the fierce fires of the rebellion.
                        Though no one will rejoice that those who brought our disasters upon us were
                        made to feel even keener anguish than we were, yet they cannot help but feel
                        that there is just retribution in the terrible calamity which befell the
                        city in which secession and the rebellion had its inception. We expect to
                        furnish our readers other letters written from the South by the same able
                        pen.</p>

                    <p>The Philadelphia <emph rend="italics">Press</emph> of Monday last, pays the
                        following handsome compliment to "the Sketch of the 126th Regiment," and to
                        its author, Judge D. W. Rowe. The sketch is now ready for delivery, and
                        there should be a thousand volumes sold in Franklin County in the next four
                        weeks:</p>

                    <p>COUNTY SOLDIERS' MONUMENT - It is much to be hoped that before many years a
                        soldiers' monument will arise in every county of every State in the Union.
                        These mute memorial shafts, ever pointing upward and recording in enduring
                        form the great sacrifice of the country, will be the best teachers of the
                        coming generation, and the best safeguards of loyalty and freedom.</p>

                    <p>Franklin county, Pennsylvania, is entitled to the credit of, if not first, at
                        least most practically devising the ways and means whereby such a desirable
                        end might be attained. In that county was raised, among other troops, the
                        126th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers. This body, although volunteering
                        under the nine months call, has always been esteemed at home the
                        representative regiment of the county. Judge D. Watson Rowe, of
                        Chambersburg, lieutenant colonel of this regiment, a gentleman of culture,
                        standing and influence, has written its history, and the book is published
                        and sold for the purpose of raising funds for the erection of a monument to
                        all the deceased soldiers of the county.</p>

                    <p>Admirably executed in spirit and style, presenting a faithful record of the
                        history and adventures of the regiment, this little volume, readable
                        anywhere, cannot fail to be intensely interesting at home, and its large
                        sale will doubtless effect the end for which it was written.</p>

                    <p>We commend the idea to the soldiers' organizations which already exist all
                        over the North. It is killing two birds with one stone. Not only is history
                        preserved, but a monument built. The scope of these local works<orig reg=","
                            >.</orig> however, might be the organizations raised in each county or
                        district. All counties would not be so fortunate as Franklin, in obtaining
                        so well-qualified and scholarly a historian as Judge Rowe, but there is not
                        one which could not find in its borders some person who could truthfully and
                        modestly tell the stories of its share in the war.</p>

                    <p>Our attention has been called to a slight error in the "Sketch of the 126th
                        Regiment," in connection with the name of John S. Oaks, who died from wounds
                        received on the field of battle at Fredericksburg.</p>

                    <p>The remarks opposite his name, in the list of casualties, are as follows
                        "Wounded in action at Fredericksburg, Va., 13th Dec., 1862, died 15th
                        January, 1863, at Washington, D. C. Promoted to corporal."</p>

                    <p>Shortly before the battle of Fredericksburg, in which fierce conflict John S.
                        Oaks fell gallantly fighting, we think on the 5th of December, an order
                        discharging him from service, that he might accept a commission as 1st
                        Lieutenant in the Pennsylvania service, was issued from the War Department,
                        and a copy of the order was in his possession when he went into the battle.
                        We do not know that the order had reached his Corps or Division Commander
                        before the battle, but that it had reached him and he refused to avail
                        himself of the opportunity thus offered to be mustered out and escape going
                        into the fight, we do know. The commission offered him was awaiting his
                        arrival at Harrisburg. There is also an error we think as to the date of his
                        death. Our impression from memory is that he expired on the 25th day of
                        December, Christmas day. In justice to the memory of one who numbered
                        ourselves among a large list of very warm friends, we make this correction.</p>
