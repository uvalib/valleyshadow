<b>The "Spirit" and the Colored Voters</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository notes that no blacks will vote
                    for the Democrats in the upcoming election because the party "to him is but
                    another name for slavery." The editorial also charges that the Democrats are
                    attempting to draw white voters away from the Republican party by emphasizing
                    the issue of black suffrage.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Spirit has at last broken the strange silence
                        it has observed since the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, and declares
                        itself and its party to be opposed to negro suffrage. It thus takes occasion
                        to confirm what one of the colored orators told his audience at this place
                        on the 26th of April last, that the Democratic party was pledged to take
                        away the right of suffrage from the colored race and reduce them to a state
                        of servitude again whenever it had the power. In last week's Spirit, in a leader under the same original and
                        progressive captain used by the Carlisle Volunteer, which we had occasion to notice,
                        namely, that "White men must rule America," it
                        lays down the possition to be held by its party
                        during the approaching political campaign. It thus puts its party
                        unmistakably upon the record against the negro, and we have no doubt from
                        the deliberation it has exercised and the length of time it has spent in
                        coming to this determination, that it has not acted rashly, whatever we may
                        think as to its wisdom. The article has been written with unusual dare, and
                        the writer has well concealed the motives which dictated it, yet we are at
                        no loss to understand why he should deliberately set against his party a
                        large body of voters such as the colored vote of this county is.</p>

                    <p>In the first place, he did not do this until time enough had passed to
                        satisfy every person that the Democratic party could not possibly secure
                        even an insignificant portion of the colored vote in the coming election.
                        There was no sacrifice made by arraying the party against the negro.
                        Emissaries of the party leaders were sent among the negroes, they appeared
                        at their meetings, and gave them friendly greetings on the streets, but the
                        black man could not be tempted to swerve from his principles. No matter how
                        friendly Democrats might be, for Democracy, which to him is but another name
                        for slavery, he had nothing but detestation, and he allowed no occasion to
                        escape for making his sentiments known. Indeed it would have been
                        unaccountably strange if any number of the colored voters had been willing
                        to pervert their newly won rights by aiding to put in power the party that
                        had always labored to perpetuate the slavery of the black race. Democrats
                        call them ignorant and stupid and debased. We have yet to see one in our
                        midst ignorant or stupid or debased enough to admit that he was willing to
                        vote the Democratic ticket.</p>

                    <p>It is apparent, if this be so, that in proclaiming for a white man's party
                        the Spirit sacrificed no colored votes for the
                        present at least. But by this course of action it hoped to secure some white
                        voters who heretofore voted with the Republican party. And this is the
                        secret of its only opposition to the negro, after the Constitution had armed
                        him with the ballot. After all, principle had nothing to do with this
                        determination of the Spirit. It obeyed merely
                        its conviction as to good policy casting principle to
                        
                         both sides of the question and reached the conclusion that to oppose
                        the negro would give its party in this section of the State the greatest
                        number of votes. It could lose no colored voters, because it had none, it
                        might gain a few disaffected white voters to its side, if there be any among
                        the Republican ranks. This is the way the Spirit
                        reasoned with itself, but not the way it reasoned on paper, for the public.
                        There it became important to conceal the real design and if possible make it
                        appear that it was the duty of the white race to hold the negroes in
                        subjection and to exclude them from having any voice in the government, or
                        any protection against wrong, save as a sense of justice might operate upon
                        and control the actions of the whites.</p>

                    <p>From the weakness of the argument employed it is easy to perceive how
                        impossible it is to elevate a mere matter of party trickery to the dignity
                        of a principle. If it had been addressed to the party prejudice of the
                        Democracy without disguise it might at least have incited them to undertake
                        the work of the campaign but it is addressed to Republicans, and must fail.
                        Even admitting that there are some dissatisfied ones which we do not,
                        because the real motive is not that which is put forward. The real motive is
                        the success of the Democratic ticket. The one advanced is the protection of
                        our republican institutions. But we doubt if any Republican foresees danger
                        to our republican institutions in ceasing to do wrong and beginning to do
                        right toward our fellow men be they white or black.</p>

                    <p>The Spirit
                        skilfully begins by a false assertion to
                        excite prejudice. It says that "the best men everywhere are disgusted with
                        the doctrine that the negro is the equal of the white man." It knows that
                        there is no such doctrine either for white men or for negroes. Each white
                        man is not the equal of every other white man, nor is a negro necessarily
                        the equal of a white man. It happens that some negroes are better than some
                        white men, and some white men are better than others. What is true is this,
                        that all men, white or black, are entitled to equal rights. That is the only
                        equality. The Spirit merely assumed as the basis
                        of its article something which never has and never can exist.</p>

                    <p>It follows this by a funny statement that our territory is very vast and our
                        Government machinery very complicated and that it needs the best thoughts of
                        the best minds, &amp;c. to keep it in good running order, and that if
                        negroes are introduced among our voters and have a controlling voice in
                        making and administering the laws there can be no hope of the permanent
                        prosperity of the nation; that thoughtful men see in this result either a
                        dissolution of the States of the Union or a conversion of our Republican
                        Government into some other form - a monarchy we suppose - and to prevent
                        these fearful disasters the Democratic party will stick to the doctrine that
                        white men must rule America.</p>

                    <p>The force of this certainly is not strengthened when we reflect that we have
                        just rescued the Government from anarchy and dissolution at the hands of a
                        white man's party, the Democratic party with four millions of human beings
                        without any voice in the Government as a bone of contention. After our
                        bitter experience we had better try the doctrine of equal rights to all, as
                        a mere matter of policy without regard to the eternal principles of justice
                        and truth and right, before flying into the arms of another white man's
                        party, which has nothing higher and nobler to offer than the degradation of
                        one race of human beings at the expense of another. But the real object of
                        this strange article is found in the following extract:</p>

                    <p>It is high time that Conservative men, heretofore identified with the
                        Republican party, who were hostile to negro suffrage and who, if an
                        opportunity had been presented them as was pledged to them by their party
                        leaders, would have voted the amendment down by overwhelming majorities - it
                        is high time for such men to sever the leading strings of party, and cast
                        their votes with men who are in favor of white men ruling America.</p>

                    <p>So the whole thing resolves itself into a bid for Republican voters. We
                        confidentially believe that if there be any who have heretofore voted with
                        the Republican party, and can meditate uniting with the slave Democracy
                        since the negroes have attained the right of suffrage, they are not worthy
                        members of the one and had better at once put themselves in ranks of the
                        other. But even in this extract there is a falsehood. Negro suffrage was an
                        issue fairly before the people of the State in the last election. The
                        Democratic party platform declared the determination, if successful in
                        carrying the Legislature, to repeal the ratification of the Fifteenth
                        Amendment, and the Republican State Convention passed resolutions endorsing
                        the Legislature which had ratified it; the question was discussed during the
                        campaign everywhere throughout the State, and the Spirit has scarcely forgotten how a Republican Legislature was
                        elected on that issue. Let us at least hear no more of that.</p>

                    <p>To the colored voters we have nothing to say further than to express our
                        entire confidence in their good sense and honesty. We believe that they
                        fully understand where their true interests lie, and that they would not
                        have been mistaken even if the Spirit had not
                        done them the favor to make it impossible for them to vote with the
                        Democratic party, and preserve their manhood.</p>

<b>Decoration Day</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

                    Decoration Day, to honor the men killed in the Civil War, and notes that the day

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The 30th day of May has been selected by Gen. John A. Logan, Commander in
                        Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, as the day for decorating the
                        graves of the soldiers who perished in the war for the suppression of the
                        rebellion. This is the third year of the observance of this solemnity, and
                        it is to be hoped that the ceremony will be as general as it was on the two
                        preceding occasions. Its object is to pay homage to the memory of the dead
                        who died for their country. It has no political significance , and
                        heretofore has been participated in by soldiers without regard to party
                        opinions or feelings. If it should ever become perverted into a party
                        observance all its sacredness would be lost, and it had better be burried out of sight or forgotten. But there is no
                        reason that it should be, any more than there was no reason why Democrats
                        and Republicans should not have joined together, as they did, in suppressing
                        the rebellion. Men without a thought to which party they adhered fought the
                        battles of the late war, and without such a thought now they should join in
                        honoring the memories and decorating the graves of their fallen brothers. If
                        they had died in a mere war of factions, if it had been a conflict of rival
                        powers, it would doubtless be wise to forget it as speedily as possible. But
                        this is not such a case. They died to save their country and government, and
                        to solve the gravest problem ever presented to a free people. The principles
                        which they upheld by their death are necessary to the welfare of humanity,
                        and it is for the great boon they conferred by their death that their memory
                        should always be honored and revered.</p>

                    <p>But there are no Posts of the G. A. R. at this place, and it is perhaps as
                        well for this purpose that there are none. It enables the soldiers to do
                        this work without the interposition of organizations created since the war.
                        Let a general call be issued for a meeting of the soldiers for the purpose
                        of making all the necessary arrangements and appointing the committees and
                        officers needed to carry it out. Let the ladies again be asked to aid them
                        by furnishing flowers for the occasion, and then let all with feeling and
                        thankful hearts devote one day to the sacred duty of visiting and decorating
                        the graves of our fallen patriots.</p>

                    <p>
                        To the Editors of the Franklin Repository.
                    </p>

                    <p>I have been prospecting a little, in a political way, in order to locate
                        myself before the nominations are made for the next election. Times change
                        and we change with them. The issues of by-gone years have been settled to a
                        great extent, and many of the most carefully prepared theories have been
                        exploded. I do not wish to be gobbled up by any of the political parties by
                            ad captandum vulgus appeals, so I have gone
                        to work in a quiet way in order to post myself in regard to the material of
                        which the parties are composed. In examining the press I discover that a new
                        party is about to come on the tapis, to be
                        called the White man's party, i.e., the old
                        Democratic party is to be rejuvenated and set agoing with a platform
                        peculiarly adapted to the fastidious nasal organs of its members. The
                        plausibility of such an organism at once attracted my attention, and I think
                        I shall cast in my lot with them and try to induce any others who may be
                        lying about loose to come and enjoy our fellowship. I have not been taken in
                        yet, but have been making the acquaintance of some of the more prominent of
                        that great party. There are some that I have seen who would do credit to
                        themselves if they would say as little as possible about color, but lights
                        and shades you know give variety and attract notice. I would particularly
                        call attention to the moral aspect of this great party. We don't intend to
                        be squeamish at all but we have some of the best men in the vicinity who,
                        especially after a draft of benzine, will swear
                        their biggest oaths and curses against all politics and religions that would
                        set aside God's law in regard to distinctions. There is Deacon G--, he
                        swears he'd leave the church in a minute if the niggers are to be brought
                        in, and the only hope he has of escaping the contamination of the black men
                        is in joining the White men's party. Dr. T-- says he'll attend to their sore
                        shins and broken bones for their money but he can't degrade himself with the
                        idea of voting for the same candidates for office that they do. Merchant L--
                        says he solicits their quarters and half dollars, and will wait on them
                        complacently for even five cents, but he never will pray or vote along side
                        of any such cattle. Farmer B-- says he has from his boyhood, occasionally,
                        worked along side of them, on his own and his neighbor's farm, and when both
                        were hired at the same wages, but the idea of a lawyer, a Congressman or a
                        Senator having to work beside them is repugnant to all our sense of the
                        difference that should exist between a farmer and our public servants. In
                        fact, I feel encouraged by certain indications to hope that our white man's
                        party will be a breakwater against all those old fashioned ideas which would
                        lead us to estimate men by their intellectual or moral attainments. It's the
                        color of a man, I care not how ragged, how lazy, how drunken, how profane,
                        how dishonest, - nay how  he be, it is this color that makes the man
                        eligible to our party, and when I see a member of our great white party
                        through his fumes of bad whiskey, curse the nigger, I hail him as a brother
                        confirmed in the faith and proof against all liability to fall from the
                        grace wherewith we are called.</p>

                    <p>On Monday evening, the 16th inst., a meeting of soldiers of Chambersburg and
                        vicinity was held to make provisions for decorating the graves of deceased
                        soldiers on the 30th inst. Col. J. G. Elder presided, and Jere Cook was made
                        Secretary. Col. Theodore McGowan was chosen Marshal for the occasion and
                        instructed to appoint the necessary Assistant Marshals.</p>

                    <p>T. J. Grimison, G. W. Skinner and T. M. Mahon were appointed a special
                        committee to procure flowers, and were requested to invite the ladies, both
                        of Chambersburg and the surrounding neighborhood to join with them for that
                        purpose.</p>

                    <p>Special invitations were extended to the Housum Zouaves,
                        to the clergy of the town, and to all citizens to participate in the
                        exercises.</p>

                    <p>A committee on general arrangements was then appointed, composed of J. G.
                        Elder, J. L. P. Deitrich, G. W. Skinner, S. W. Hays, D. F. Leisher, J. A.

                        evening next. It is specially desirable that as many of the old soldiers as
                        can make it convenient will attend on that occasion, in order to perfect the
                        necessary arrangements for the exercises of the 30th inst.</p>

                    <p>On the 7th inst. at an election held in this former Democratic stronghold for
                        Borough officers, the following gentlemen were elected:<br> Chief Burgess.
                        - Samuel Knisely.<br> Town Council - Charles Dehart, Dr. Maxwell Kennedy,

                    <p>Mr. Knisely is the first Republican who was ever elected Burgess in this town
                        and his success took the Democrats very much by surprise. Mr. Dehart is also
                        a good Republican. The election of these gentlemen denotes progress in this
                        section of the county. We are glad to see that the Democrats of Orrstown
                        refute their old motto about white slavery and avail themselves of the first
                        opportunity to endorse the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment.</p>
