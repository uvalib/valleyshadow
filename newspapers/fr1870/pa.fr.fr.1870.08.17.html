<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>We cannot deny ourselves the satisfaction of presenting to the people of the
                        county the Democratic declaration of principles reported by Wm. M'Lellan,
                        Esq., to the convention assembled in the Court House, on the 4th inst.
                        Perhaps the interest of those who peruse these resolutions may be enhanced
                        if, when impressed by the extraordinary bigotry of some and the cowardice of
                        others of them, they call to mind that their acknowledged and responsible
                        author was, not many years ago, thought to be the frank, open and highly
                        esteemed advocate of the cherished principles which he here condemns. If it
                        be true, as pro slavery Democrats persist in asserting, that the rebellion
                        was brought about by the assaults of the Abolitionists of the North upon the
                        institution of Slavery, then the author of these resolutions against the
                        adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, and the right of Negro Suffrage is
                        himself, to the extent of his influence and ability, responsible for what he
                        condemns for the Fifteenth Amendment and the right of suffrage unavoidably
                        and logically grew out of the abolition of slavery, of which Mr. M'Lellan
                        was a part. We take it for granted that he does not object to have this
                        responsibility pointed out, since he has seized this public method of
                        repudiating the doctrines which, with his own peculiar fervor and unction,
                        he used to impress upon the minds of his associates and friends. That what
                        we assert is true we need not here undertake to prove, because the self
                        knowledge of many of our readers is amply sufficient to verify it.</p>

                    <p>If these resolutions merely misrepresented the Republican party we think we
                        would pass them by without comment. We certainly could expect no fair
                        presentment against the party by one who turned his back upon it when it was
                        wrestling with the powers of treason and joined the ranks of those who gave
                        traitors every aid and encouragement which they needed save one, and were
                        only restrained by cowardice from bestowing that but we had reason to expect
                        that their author would have the courage to make them reflect the principles
                        of the Democracy. Instead of this they are a fraud upon the mass of
                        Democratic voters of the county who we believe are honest in their opinions,
                        and are put forward by the convention to deceive, and to cover up the real
                        issue of the party.</p>

                    <p>The first resolution we care nothing about. It is simply an appeal to
                        Republicans to help with their votes into power and offices those who are
                        not able to help themselves. To ask persons who do not call themselves
                        Democrats to unite under the banner on which is inscribed "Opposition to
                        Radicalism," may be fairly denomination a beautiful and "glittering
                        generality," but has no point or merit.</p>

                    <p>The Democratic newspaper of the county a few months ago committed the
                        Democracy to the policy of a "White Man's Party." It will be recollected
                        this was done only a few month ago, and not until thorough investigation
                        proved that it was impossible for them to secure any part of the colored
                        vote. As a local question nothing could be gained this fall when it is
                        desperately needed, by holding out inducements to the colored citizens, but
                        there was at least a chance to win some conservative Republicans by judiciously tickling the prejudice which
                        exists against the colored race, and by boldly misrepresenting the history
                        of the Republican party on negro suffrage. The second resolution pretends to
                        give a reason why the Democracy of the county should support a "White Man's
                        Party." It would take too much space to prove its assersions false, and we are sure a council of lawyers or of
                        doctors would quarrel over its meaning, if indeed they could agree that it
                        meant anything at all. We deny that the Fifteenth Amendment was
                        "fraudulently ratified," but we doubt if any sane man would expect as to
                        deny that "the deliberate purpose of the radical leaders, in passing the
                        Fifteenth Amendment was to put all the States of the Union under the
                        domination of negroes, to Africanize a large portion of the country, and
                        degrade the white race morally and socially as well as politically to the
                        low level of the black man." We don't deny it, because common sense will
                        teach any person that this tremendious
                        allegation is merely an attempt to catch votes.</p>

                    <p>We object to the allegation though because in making it Mr. M'Lellan
                        deliberately insulted the intelligence, the morality and the sociel standing of every Democratic voter. Until now
                        no man has dared to assert the superiority of the negro race over the white
                        race; yet Mr. M'Lellan deliberately declares this to be the sense of a
                        convention of Franklin county Democrats and the convention endorses it. In
                        more than one-half of the States the negro population is in the proportion
                        of one to one hundred white population; in the remaining States it is not
                        one-third, and yet with this wonderful desparity in numbers the convention assures us the negroes are so
                        much the superiors of the whites that the moment they are placed on an equal
                        footing with them the latter will fall under their domination, will be
                        Africanized and be morally, socially and politically on a level with them.
                        If it is necessary to insult the intelligence as well as honor of Democrats
                        in this manner in order to get their votes they are the strangest people we
                        ever heard of, and we don't desire to be one of them.</p>

                    <p>The third resolution is throughout a false statement of facts, and a
                        statement or false opinions, which even the Democracy do not believe. For
                        example, instead of the Reconstruction policy
                        adopted by the Radical majority in Congress being "the fruitful source of
                        woe to the country," does not the truth justify the assertion that the destruction policy of the Democratic party from
                        1861 to 1865 has been the fruitful source of woe to the country. Is it not
                        cowardly, to say the least, for the party which plunged half of our country
                        into the very depths of poverty and misery and social evils, and burdened
                        all of it with grevious taxes and an enormous
                        debt, to complain that the party which rescued it from these evils has not
                        done it to their satisfaction? That is precisely the attitude taken by this
                        convention. All the evils they complain of came from the Democracy. They
                        impeach the Republican party because they have not extricated the country
                        from them in a manner to suit them.</p>

                    <p>Georgia is unrepresented in Congress to-day. Why?
                        Because the rebel element has refused to accept the salutary conditions
                        which repentent rebels and loyal men regard as
                        eminently fair and just. Can the auther of these
                        resolutions show any other reason? They charge that "Northern adventurers"
                        thus denounced went South in loyal armies and by their services to their
                        country, if they had no other right, won their title to a residence among
                        the rebels, as well as to any office of trust and profit in the gift of the
                        loyal citizens among whom they settled. But admitting that for a northern
                        man to do this he deserved the reproachful epithet of "Northern adventurer,"
                        is it true? Attorney General Akerman, himself a Southern man, and a
                        conservative, says of the Georgia Convention, and this may be taken as a
                        fair standard of all the Southern States:</p>

                    <p>The usual attendance was 151 members. Of these 75 were natives of Georgia, 46
                        were natives of other Southern States, making 121. Of the remaining, 34 were
                        born in foreign countries, and 26 at the North. Of those 26, 14 were
                        residents of Southern States prior to the war. Of these there were about a
                        dozen of what are called "carpet baggers" in that body.</p>

                    <p>Can it be possible that out of 151 members a paltry dozen were from the
                        North, and that this story of "Northern adventurers" is not even decent
                        Democratic clap trap?</p>

                    <p>But say they, the Radicals have enabled negroes to be elected to
                        Legislatures, and one even to "the high position of United States Senator."
                        We believe they have. We feel inclined to admit that this is true, and while
                        we have little knowledge as to their success as State Legislators, we must
                        confess that the sole representative in the United States Senate has done
                        himself more credit, and the country far more honor than the arch traitor
                        Jeff Davis, who preceeded him and whose place he
                        was taken in that body. They charge the disorderly and riotous conduct in
                        North Carolina upon the Radicals. Do they not know that a large body of men
                        have just been arrested in North Carolina, who belong to an infamous and
                        lawless order called the kuk klux, who have confessed
                        their crimes, and implicated hundreds of others in the disorderly deeds
                        there perpetrated. They are all Southerners and ardent Democrats, every one
                        of them.</p>

                    <p>We charged that in the second resolution the convention presumed upon the
                        ignorance and insulted the intelligence of the Democratic masses. we charge
                        further that in the fourth resolution it has been undemocratic and false to
                        the traditions and teachings of the party in denying to the Chinese
                        introduction into the country, and admission to our industrial pursuits. The
                        Democracy have always boasted of their liberality on the question. They have
                        sought to secure the favor and support of foreigners on the ground that they
                        throw open our shores to the poor and oppressed of every land and give them
                        equal rights with ourselves. But because they believe there is a prejudice
                        against the Chinese among the laboring classes, and especially among the
                        Germans and Irish, they deliberately deny their oldest and most sacred
                        faith, unmindful that it does not stop here, but with the same blow they
                        deal at foreign emigration they strike down their favorite dogma of free
                        trade. If it be good policy, as the Democracy hold, to strike down all
                        protection to home industry, that our people may enjoy the benefit of
                        foreign cheap labor, is it not also good policy to introduce the cheap labor
                        which brings about exactly the same result. If it is good policy in one case
                        how can it be bad policy in the other? We are anxious to hear. And yet this
                        body called itself a Democratic Convention.</p>

                    <p>But let us ask just here why these resolutions, which travel all around Robin
                            Hoods barn, forget to say anything about the
                        doctrine of free trade. Is it not Democratic? We can tell why. In this
                        county and Congressional district there are many Democrats wise enough to
                        appreciate the the importance of protecting home
                        industries and manufactures. There are many others not so wise who are free
                        traders. The Convention was willing to be all things to all men, but it
                        could not be both things at the same time; so unable  ride
                        both horses going in opposite directions at the same time, it concluded to
                        ride neither, and therefore ignored the most important element in the
                        campaign. We ask how can such fraud, such duplicity, such dishonesty commend
                        themselves to the mass of Democratic voters? They are not blind that they
                        cannot see. We hear them inquiring already whether such interlopers as the
                        reputed author of these resolutions is to be allowed to render the
                        Democratic party and principles a byword and a joke to be scorned at. It is
                        for them to say.</p>

                    <p>There is still one more resolution condemning Hon. John Cessna, because he
                        did not attempt to secure to the State reimbursement, or to our citizens
                        payment for losses and damages during the rebellion. One would hardly be
                        expected to answer this seriously, if there were space. As there is not, we
                        will give it all the consideration it merits at another time.</p>

                        oath of Harriet Mackey. The defendent was found

                        costs of prosecution and to undergo an imprisonment of three years in the
                        Eastern Penitentiary. As the REPOSITORY contained a full account of this
                        crime at the time of its occurrence, it is unnecessary to refer to it again.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Peter Lennart - Assualt, on oath of Fred'k Lennart. Verdict guilt.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Mordecai M'Mahon - Horse Stealing, on oath of Daniel Palmer. Verdict
                        not guilty. The facts in this case are about these: A son of Mr. Palmer rode
                        into Chambersburg one Saturday evening, in July last, and hitched his horse
                        in the yard of the Indian Queen Hotel. When he came to go home his horse was
                        gone, and was next seen in the possession of the defendant in this case,
                        near Gettysburg. It was not denied by the defendant's counsel that the horse
                        was taken by the defendant, but they alleged his mind was in such a
                        condition from the use of intoxicating liquors, that he was not responsible
                        for the crime. It was shown that M'Mahon, who came here on a spree from his
                        home in Altoona, was in a state of delirium
                        tremens a week previous to the stealing of the horse, that he
                        continued drinking during the week, that he was drunk when he stole the
                        horse, and that Mr. Palmer placed him in jail in a drunken condition, which
                        was followed by a severe attack of mania potu,
                        which lasted four days. The verdict could not have been different under the
                        circumstances of the case.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Mary Ellen Swingler - Adultery, on oath of John Swingler. The jury
                        returned a verdict of guilty and defendant was sentenced to pay costs of
                            presecution and undergo an imprisonment
                        of nine months in the county jail.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Samuel Stokes - Larceny, on oath of John Smith. Verdict not guilty.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Mary J. Latsbaugh - Forgery and False Pretense, on oath of F U
                        Keefer. Defendant plead guilty, and was sentenced to pay a fine of one cent,
                        costs of prosecution and undergo an imprisonment in the county jail for
                        three months.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Hugh Larmau - Assault and Battery, on oath of Mary Dengler.
                        Defendant plead guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine of one dollar and
                        costs of prosecution.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. John Kimple - Procuring Goods on False Pretense, on oath of Mary J.
                        Latsbaugh. Mary had in a previous case, plead guilty to the charge of
                        obtaining goods from a number of merchants in Chambersburg on forged orders,
                        which she said were written by the defendant in this case. She also stated
                        that the goods procured in this way were to be used as her wedding outfit,
                        when she and Kimple were married. The defense, however, proved so
                        satisfactorily that the defendant was unable to write, and that the witness
                        for the prosecution deliberately lied, that the District Attorney "threw up
                        the sponge," when the jury, without leaving the box, rendered a verdict of
                        not guilty.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Emanuel Hess - Assault and Battery, on oath of Michael Fallen.
                        Defendant plead guilty, and was sentenced to pay a fine of $10 and costs of
                        prosecution, which defendant said "was getting off as easy as could be
                        expected under the circumstances."</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Joseph Knepper - Fornication and Bastardy, on oath of Elizabeth
                        Treber. Defendant submitted to court and received the usual sentence.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. John Swingler - Assault and Battery, on oath of Ellen Swingler.
                        Verdict guilty and sentenced to pay a fine of one cent and costs of
                        prosecution.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Harry Jones - Fornication, on oath of John Swingler. Verdict guilty
                        and sentenced to pay a fine of $10 and costs of prosecution.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Wm. Davis - Rape, on oath of Mary Snider. Verdict guilty, and
                        defendant sentenced to pay a fine of one dollar, costs of prosecution, and
                        undergo an imprisonment in the Eastern Penitentiary for twelve years. This
                        crime was committed under the most revolting circumstances, in the southern
                        portion of this county, almost five years since, but Davis has always
                        managed to escape arrest. Miss Snider was between nine and ten years of age
                        at the time this horrid offense was committed. The jury was satisfied from
                        her testimony that this man Davis was a guilty villain. When asked by the
                        court, previous to the passing of the sentence, if he had anything to say,
                        he replied "nothing." Both the verdict and the sentence were received with
                        much satisfaction by all who had been present during the trial.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. Geo. Coldsmith - Cutting and Carrying Away Timber, on oath of Wm.
                        M'Neal. Verdict not guilty, but defendant to pay costs.</p>

                    <p>Com. vs. John Smith - Larceny. Defendant plead guilty and was sentenced to
                        undergo an imprisonment in the county jail for three months. Smith is the
                        young thief who stole several articles from the house of Dr. Forest last
                        week.</p>

                    <p>In case of Wm. Williams, et. al., reported last week, Williams was sentenced
                        to pay a fine of $10 and undergo an imprisonment in the county jail of sixty
                        days, and Andrews and Bird to pay a fine of one cent and costs of
                        prosecution.</p>

                    <p>The District Attorney by leave of the court, entered a nolle prosequi in each of the following cases: Com. vs. Eli
                        Little (two bills), Com. vs. Sam'l Winger, et. al, Com. vs. James Lafferty,

                    <p>RESOLUTIONS adopted by the Democratic County Convention of Franklin county.
                        Mr. M'Lellan, as Chairman of the Committee on Resolutions, reported the
                        following:</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That the Democracy of Franklin county
                        in Convention assembled, appeal to their Conservative fellow citizens,
                        whatever may have been their party affiliations heretofore, to unite with
                        them at the approaching election and rally under the banner on which is
                        inscribed - OPPOSITION TO RADICALISM.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That the use of the power of the
                        General Government, and the high-handed outrages of the Radical leaders, to
                        force negro suffrage upon the States, against the will of the people, as
                        shown in the means employed to procure the fraudulent ratification of the
                        Fifteenth Amendment, have made manifest the deliberate purpose of the
                        Radical leaders' to put all the State of the Union (all of them more or
                        less, and some of them entirely under the domination of negroes, to
                        Africanize a large portion of the country, and degrade the white race,
                        morally and socially, as well as politically, to the low level of the
                        black." To this scheme, so discreditable to white men and so dangerous to
                        the republic, we are unalterably opposed and therefore, present to day for the suffrages of the people, a white man's
                        ticket on a white man's platform.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That the reconstruction policy adopted
                        by the radical majority in Congress has been the faithful source of woe to
                        the country. It has presented the amazing spectacle of States unrepresented
                        in Congress five years after the termination of the war. It has afforded an
                            apportunity for obscure Northern
                        adventurers to settle in the South, and, by pandering to, and associating
                        with negroes, to procure their votes to elevate them to offices of trust and
                        honor. It was enabled negroes to be elected to seats in State Legislatures
                        and has elevated one to the high position of United States Senator. Under
                        its baneful influence, anarchy reigns in North Carolina and peaceable
                        citizens have been arrested without warrant. Military officers defy the
                        processes of the Courts, and the Radical Government of that Commonwealth
                        approves of their conduct. president Grant gives his sanction to these
                        outrageous proceedings. All this has been done to overawe the Conservative
                        people and keep them from the polls, so as to insure a victory for the
                        Radical ticket at the election being held this day. Such an infamous conduct
                        deserves the severest condemnation of all who love liberty.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That the true greatness and glory of
                        this nation is promoted largely by the prosperity and progress of its
                        laboring classes and therefore we must deprecate the introduction of the
                        Chinaman as a competitor in our varied industrial pursuits, for the reason
                        that he is never likely to become an American citizen, and for the
                        additional and more important consideration that his cheap labor will tend
                        to the degredation of our own laboring man
                        and his prosperity.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That we demand as a matter of right and
                        justice, redress from the State for losses and damages sustained by the
                        citizens of the border during the progress of the late rebellion. And we
                        would urge our candidate this day selected for the Legislature, (if elected)
                        to bend all his energies, as he has done heretofore to secure this result.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That we condemn the course of the Hon.
                        John Cessna, our present Representative in Congress for this reason - among
                        many others - that he has done or attempted nothing during his Congressional
                        career looking to the reimbursement of the State or payment of our citizens
                        for losses and damages sustained during the late rebellion.</p>
