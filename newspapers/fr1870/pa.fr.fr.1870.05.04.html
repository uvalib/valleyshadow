<b>The Celebration on Tuesday</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository reports that the recent
                    celebration of the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment was marked by orderly,
                    appropriate behavior from the 'colored citizens' of the county and Republican

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The exercise held throughout the State on Tuesday of last week by the colored
                        citizens, to celebrate the adoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, were too
                        important and too instructive to be passed over without comment. In almost
                        every town in the Commonwealth, in every important town and city, these
                        exercises were held, and to the great honor of the colored citizens the
                        newspapers have not one single instance of disorderly or riotous conduct to
                        chronicle.</p>

                    <p>It is no trifling matter that in the midst of such unusual joy and rejoicing
                        as pervaded the enfranchised class on that day, they were never unmindful
                        that with the right of citizenship came also the duties of citizens. The
                        order, decorum and propriety which marked their conduct at other places were
                        also observed here. The procession of the various societies and companies
                        was dignified and becoming in all its appointments. The banners with their
                        inscriptions and mottoes were appropriate and right. There was nothing done
                        for the purpose of giving offense, and if any offense was taken by any white
                        person he must have taken special pains to be hurt. Altogether our colored
                        citizens are entitled to the highest praise for this, and for this reason;
                        Our experience does not furnish us a single instance in Chambersburg where
                        white persons, either Democratic or Republican, assembled in large numbers,
                        that the day passed off so peacefully and orderly as did this one. There is
                        no doubt that the inducements to behave well on this occasion were strong,
                        but at the same time the temptation to yield to the feeling of unrestrained
                        joy and rejoicing which they met to celebrate was great. They are entitled
                        to commendation for their good conduct, and we at least shall not withhold
                        it.</p>

                    <p>In the afternoon speeches were made in front of the Court House by both white
                        and colored speakers, and also in Repository Hall in the evening. The
                        attendance was large, both classes being well represented. Of the remarks
                        made by the white speakers we need say nothing. What the colored orators had
                        to say is of more importance as an expression of their views, sentiments and
                        feelings. What was made memorable during the long enslavement of the colored
                        race, and particularly during the war of the rebellion, was also apparent in
                        their remarks. They cherish no feeling of revenge or resentment towards
                        those who stole their labor and their liberty, who made them ignorant and
                        degraded, but they have a keen and just appreciation of all their wrongs and
                        cannot be deceived as to who were their friends and who their enemies. Those
                        were the dominant ideas pervading the remarks of each of the speakers and we
                        heard three or four. They were all Republicans, and Republican from the
                        purest and highest motives. They reasoned clearly and unerringly that their
                        interest and their duty both allied them with the Republican party. They
                        foresaw and predicted that the Democratic party were bound to make an effort
                        to secure their suffrages, but they warned them that the record they had
                        made in the past would forever destroy the confidence of the colored voters
                        in their promises in the future. We fear the Democracy derived but little
                        comfort or encouragement from what they heard.</p>

                    <p>We were pleased to see that the colored citizens provided most of the
                        speakers for this occasion from their own color. They were right in so
                        doing. We urge them to persevere in this rule. If many of them are ignorant,
                        it is because they could not be intelligent and be slaves. The whites were
                        the stronger and they chose rather to have them ignorant and slaves than
                        free and intelligent. With the natural ability they have, and the
                        earnestness and zeal to learn which they display, they need not long be
                        behind their more favored brethren since learning and paid labor are as open
                        to them as to others.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The Democratic leaders have persistently dinned into the ears of the ignorant
                        of their party that if slavery were allowed to vote they would soon occupy
                        all the places or trade and labor held by the white Democrats, and thus they
                        would be left without employment and without the means of living. These
                        leaders did not then believe that their own places were endangered by the
                        encroachments of the negro, but it seems they were. In Philadelphia the
                        headquarters of the Democracy, hallowed by the memory of years devoted to
                        the enslavement and degradation of the negro race, has been converted into a
                        negro minstrel concert room.</p>

                    <p>Tuesday of last week was a day that will long be remembered by the colored

                        the 30th of March. Nothing was left undone to make the occasion a grand one.
                        The weather was exceedingly pleasant.</p>

                    <p>The procession formed about 1 o'clock P. M., and marched through the various
                        streets of the town in charge of the following officers:</p>

                        P.M. Speeches appropriated to the occasion were made by the following
                        gentlemen: Joseph R. Winters, Wm. S. Hall, Rev. Dr. A. R. Green, of
                        Washington, D. C., and John Stewart, Esq. The speaking over, the procession

                        attending the celebration is due to the energy of Henry Monks, Chairman of

                        were pleased with the manner in which they conducted themselves, and their
                        enemies were compelled to acknowledge that there never was a public day in
                        this place attended with so little disturbance.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The colored citizens of the Southern portion of Franklin county celebrated
                        the final passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, near Greencastle, on Tuesday
                        last. Mercersburg, Greencastle, and Waynesboro were all represented. The
                        procession, after marching through the principal streets, proceeded to Moss
                        Spring. His honor Judge Rowe, being compelled to come to Chambersburg to
                        preside at court, made a short speech shortly after arriving on the grounds.
                        He made no reference to politics. His remarks were eloquent and were greeted
                        with rounds of applause. After the Judge had concluded the crowd was
                        dismissed until 1.30 p. m. An elegant dinner had been prepared and as one of
                        the guests we must say we enjoyed it.</p>

                    <p>In the afternoon addresses were delivered by S. W. Hays, Esq., Geo. W.
                        Zeigler, Esq., and Rev. Whiteman. Mr. Hays spoke for about an hour. He was
                        then followed by Mr. Zeigler, who addressed the audience in an earnest and
                        effective manner. Rev. Whiteman's remarks were peculiarly appropriate. He
                        advised the colored people not only to educate their minds, but to see it
                        that their hearts were also purified. His speech was of such a character as
                        one would be sure to hear from a Christian minister. Mr. Anderson's remarks
                        were full of good advice to his colored brethren, and were well received.</p>

                    <p>The audience dispersed about 4 p. m., and retired quietly to their homes. The
                        order on the grounds could not have been better. The colored Band of
                        Greencastle furnished good music for the occasion.</p>
