<b>History of the Constitutional Reform Movement</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository discusses constitutional reform
                    and reprints an article written by A. K. McClure, a leading advocate of the
                    movement.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>That it is necessary to say anything concerning the history of this movement
                        before Constitutional Reform has become a fixed fact, may seem unusual to
                        some under whose observation these lines may fall; but to those who have
                        been closely watching all that has been said and written concerning it in
                        the public journals, it will not seem strange or out of place. In all human
                        probability a Constitutional Convention is as sure to come as seed time and
                        harvest, and since it is assured, and so heartily encouraged by the people
                        throughout the whole State, in a word, since it is popular with the masses
                        and they demand it, the number claiming the credit of originating and
                        initiating the movement is as great as the grand army of patriots who first
                        nominated General Grant for the Presidency; and, as a rule, they are just
                        about as much entitled to the honor.</p>
                    <p>The Constitutional Reform movement began in January, 1867, immediately after
                        the election of Simon Cameron to the United States Senate, and the first
                        article which called attention to the subject appeared in the FRANKLIN
                        REPOSITORY of the 23rd of that month. It came from the hands of Col. A. K.
                        McClure, then the able editor of this journal. In justice to Mr. McClure, as
                        well as for the information of the public, we re-publish the article as it
                        appeared then.</p>
                    <p>Since the movement began, until now, when it is the engrossing political
                        topic of the State, Col. McClure has not ceased to agitate the subject, and
                        by his great ability as a writer and experience in the political affairs of
                        the State, has done more to insure its success than any other man in the
                        State:</p>. <p>LEGISLATIVE REFORM - IT MUST BE FUNDAMENTAL.</p>
                    <p>The people can no longer close their eyes to the fact that the hideous cancer
                        of legislative corruption has spread its loathsome pollution over the entire
                        body politic in Pennsylvania; and indifference must henceforth be criminal.
                        For years venality has been trenching itself in the citadel of delegated
                        power, steadily growing and widening its ramifications, until its monstrous
                        sweep has drawn a Legislature into its seething whirlpool, upon the very
                            threshhold of its official labors, and
                        bartered the choicest gift and the most responsible trust the loyal people
                        have to confer.</p>
                    <p>Nor in this crowning wrong alone do the appliances and fruits of legislative
                        degradation appear. Around it, in it, through all its channels of power, and
                        all its tributaries, the monster sits enthroned supreme. So clamorous were
                        its shameless votaries for plunder, that the important committees of the
                        popular branch, which control vital and profitable interests, had to be
                        divided and sub-divided, and even then the number almost doubled to swell
                        the chances for ill-gotten profits; and the subordinates of the two branches
                        have been increased to glut insatiate appetites until they number within
                        one-fourth of the whole Legislature. Sons, fathers and other relations of
                        legislators crowd around it in idleness, and profligacy and venality rule
                        while people have treachery and taxation as their reward.</p>
                    <p>"Reform the Legislature by the election of upright men," respond all who,
                        with the affectation of integrity, wish corruption to maintain its sway. We
                        answer it cannot be done. It has been tried, time and again, and it has
                        signally failed. We have seen, and served in, reform Legislatures, and the
                        only perceptible difference was the increased license to debauchery assumed
                        by the reformers because of their supposed standing at home. It is idle to
                        attempt reform by any such process. But few who have the stern integrity for
                        such an effort will undertake the thankless task, and supple reformers, who
                        are demoralized by the very hope of contact with peculation, are ever ready
                        to proclaim their own virtues to the people, and betray them by a double
                        fraud.</p>
                    <p>There is one simple, practical, effectual remedy; and if the People move in
                        earnest they can enforce it. The reform must be radical - it must be
                        fundamental. A Constitutional Convention, and that only, can reach the
                        terrible disease, and it is attainable at any time the Legislature shall
                        submit the question of a Convention to popular decision. It should be
                        demanded by petition, by delegations, by mass meetings, by the manly
                        utterances of an unshackled Press, until even the corruptionists themselves
                        shall bow to the thunder of their masters. Let them demand a Convention to
                        incorporate in their organic law provisions substantially as follows:</p>
                    <p>1. That the Senate shall consist of one hundred members, to be chosen by
                        single districts.</p>
                    <p>2. That the House of Representatives shall consist of four hundred members,
                        each to be elected in a single district.</p>
                    <p>3. That all legislation relating to corporation interest shall be by general
                        laws, and that no special charter or corporate privileges whatever shall be
                        granted but by the courts.</p>
                    <p>4. That there shall be no special appropriation of money from the treasury to
                        claims except upon a judicial finding.</p>
                    <p>5. That the members of the Legislature shall be paid five dollars per day,
                        for the period of sixty days; and be prohibited from appropriating to
                        themselves any additional sum for protracted sessions, or for extra or
                        adjourned sessions beyond sixty days in the year.</p>
                    <p>6. That no subordinate officers shall be appointed in either branch, or
                        receive any compensation for services, unless a bill shall have been passed
                        by both branches creating the office and defining its duties.</p>
                    <p>7. That no bill shall pass either branch without receiving a majority of the
                        whole vote on a call of the yeas and nays.</p>
                    <p>"It would be most expensive reform," answers the quibblers who, unwilling to
                        meet the issue squarely, wish to delay the day of the effectual reckoning of
                        the People. We answer that it would be vastly economical. The whole cost of
                        a Legislature consisting of five hundred members and the necessary officers,
                        under the foregoing provisions, would not be as much as our present
                        Legislature costs with but one hundred and thirty-three members, and there
                        would be the incalculable advantage of the arrest of the profligate
                        appropriation of money for any and every purpose that will pay the lobby;
                        and in addition to the advantages of saving the public treasure, it would
                        secure honest legislators for two reasons:</p>
                    <p>1. It would place the Legislature beyond the control of the lobbyists because
                        of its numbers, and would arrest the "snaking" through of bills in a slim
                        house and without a record of each man's vote. In a few of the New England
                        States each town (corresponding to our township,) sends a member of the
                        Legislature. Thus the popular branch of the Massachusetts Legislature
                        numbers several hundred, although the State has not half our population, nor
                        a tithe of our commercial, mineral or agricultural interests to foster or
                        care for. In such Legislatures corruption is unknown. The body is too large
                        for the lobby to control, and it does not blot the history of that State as
                        it does in our mighty Commonwealth, still mighty in spite of the vampyres who batten upon her in the name of
                        guardians.</p>
                    <p>2. It would bring the representative into immediate relations with, and
                        direct responsibility to, his constituents. If Franklin county elected four
                        representatives instead of half of two, each district would be composed of
                        several townships, and the people would have personal knowledge of the man
                        they elect, and he could not err in ascertaining their wishes upon any
                        question. He could not plead, as do faithless men now, that some interests
                        in a remote part of his district demanded his betrayal of other interests,
                        and thus cloak his shame. There would be direct and positive responsibility
                        from each member to his people, and they could not be deceived, nor would
                        they excuse a disregard of their wishes. It would call to our Legislature a
                        different class of men. Intelligent farmers and business men could afford to
                        go, as there would be only general legislation to enact, and the sessions
                        could rarely exceed thirty to forty days, instead of from three to four
                        months, as now, devoted to passing half a score of general laws and a
                        thousand of a private character.</p>
                    <p> - Unless the People of Pennsylvania adopt this remedy
                            they must continue to be at the mercy of corruptionists. No matter what
                            party is in power, the same disgraceful history is written. It
                        cannot be done by proposing constitutional amendments in the Legislature.
                        That would require two years even if it were possible to effect the reform
                        through that channel. But will the votaries of plunder write their own just
                        history and open their own tombs? They may profess reform, but it will come
                        with all the reservations, most plausibly covered, that the lobby desires.
                        Let the people demand a Convention. The Legislature can authorize a vote in
                        June next, adjourn to meet after the returns are officially received, and
                        provide for chosing delegates to the Convention
                        at the regular election in October next. No matter which of the two great
                        parties should carry the Convention, - substantial reform would come, for no
                        man would venture to run on any ticket in opposition to it. Admonished by
                        the People, as they would be in the overwhelming success of the most earnest
                        Reform members, the end of shameless debauchery in our places of power would
                        be triumphantly attained.</p>
                    <p> - Will the Press speak? It is the outer sentinel of popular liberty and
                        safety, and cannot be silent but by complicity with crime. Will the People
                        speak? It is their cause; it involves their interests, their honor, their
                        boasted fabric of free government, and they can be indifferent only to
                        become pitiable suicides!</p>

<b>A Story of Capture and Escape</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A man arrested for horse stealing in Mercersburg escaped while being taken
                    to jail in Chambersburg. The stranger, who stayed at the Mansion House, aroused
                    suspicion when he arrived in town. He tried to sell a horse because he had no
                    money to pay the bill. He was taken into custody, but managed to drive off the
                    buggy while his captors stopped for a break on the way to Chambersburg. When
                    they caught up to him, he jumped on the horse and detached the buggy. He later
