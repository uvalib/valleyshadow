<b>Meyers' Loyalty</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After the Repository accuses the Democratic
                    nominee for Congress of being "a friend of the Confederate cause," Benjamin F.
                    Meyers responds, calling the accusations slanderous. In this editorial, the
                        Repository attempts to prove that Meyers really
                    did sympathize with the Confederacy by reviewing some of his wartime writings.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Mr. Meyers complains in his letter published in last week's Spirit that we have been guilty of a "malignant
                        slander" in asserting that "during the rebellion he was a friend of the
                        Confederate cause, and never hesitated to manifest as much sympathy with it
                        as was consistent with personal safety." Mr. Meyers resided to Bedford
                        during the rebellion, was editor of a Democratic journal there, and we have
                        no doubt that his public declarations and acts are well known to his
                        neighbors. Instead of calling upon any of them, as would be natural, to
                        prove his loyalty, which for some reason best known to himself he has not
                        seen fit to, he calls upon a gentleman who was or at least ought to have
                        been at the front fighting the battles of his country; for during the
                        rebellion he was wearing the uniform of the defenders of his country and was
                        drawing the pay of one. More than this we are not prepared to say.</p>

                    <p>The charge we have made against Mr. Meyers is no trifling one and should not
                        be made thoughtlessly. To a truly loyal man nothing is more sacred than his
                        loyalty, and he is a malignant slanderer who
                            wilfully misrepresents him.</p>

                    <p>We propose to call Mr. Meyers upon the witness stand, and let his testimony
                        determine whether the charge we make against him or the epithet he applies
                        to us be true.</p>

                    <p>In the Bedford Gazette of the 23d of September,
                        1864, he said in an editorial:</p>

                    <p>We hear of persons leaving their homes on account of the impending draft.
                        Such a course will not protect them. They will be hunted down an
                        any rate. The best plan is to stay at home until election day and help "swap
                        off" the old draft horse, Abe Lincoln."</p>

                    <p>In the issue of same paper of the 5th of August, 1864, commenting upon an
                        alleged assault upon a Mr. Wm. Lyons by some unknown person, who threw a
                        brick at him in the night time, which passed close to his head as he was
                        entering his door, the editor says:</p>

                    <p>"This cowardly attack was doubtless prompted by political animosity. Mr.
                        Lyons' fearless and independent course in regard to the war having drawn
                        upon him the malignant hatred of some of the miserable wretches who 'live
                        and move and have their being' (like so many maggots) in the rotten carcass
                        of abolitionism. It seems that the Democrats will be compelled to arm
                        themselves in order to secure the safety of their person against the
                        assassin assaults of their political enemies."</p>

                    <p>Inasmuch as it is stated that the assailant was unknown, one can imagine how
                        excessively loyal must he be who could on such a povocation breathe out such terrible abuse and threats against
                        the whole loyal party.</p>

                    <p>But, perhaps, the writer of the following should not be charged with
                        friendship for the confederate cause during the war. It is found
                        in the Gazette of December 2nd, 1864, and is
                        part of the leading editorial, entitled, "ABOLITION REJOICING:"</p>

                    <p>"Let the Abolitionists rejoice, as they pretended to do in this place last
                        week; let them rejoice at the dark monster brought forth by infidelity and
                        abolitionism, before whose ebony throne the whole party has bent the
                        vassal's knee; let them rejoice at the prospect which a continuance of the
                        present devastation and cruel war sets before, let them rejoice that nearly
                        every house in the land has become a house of mourning, that almost every
                        cottage, however, lovely and peaceful heretofore, now contains a
                            frightful skeleton ; but the man who can lay his hand
                        upon his heart and say that he is not to blame for the ruin brought upon his
                        country, has occasion for more real joy than they. But it is natural for
                        such a party to rejoice amidst the gloom that surrounds us. Did not Nero fiddle while Rome was in a blaze? And did
                            not Abraham Lincoln call for a ribald song on the bloody fields of
                            Antietam, whilst the groans and shrieks of the wounded and dying were
                            piercing the air? Why should not they be joyful while liberty is
                        being dethroned and our country torn to pieces."</p>

                    <p>During the rebellion, it became necessary in order to keep up our armies, to
                        fill up the ranks by conscription. To enforce the conscription act was by no
                        means a pleasant duty, but the government had to accept the alternative of
                        permitting the rebellion to triumph, and destroy the Republic of our
                        fathers, or to fill our armies by draft. The whole loyal sentiment of the
                        North, being in favor of the Union, approved and sustained the draft. The
                        disloyal element, which fought our armies in the rear, denounced and
                        resisted it. Unfortunately for Mr. Meyers' hopes to day, he was found
                        working, heart and soul, among the latter class. In the Gazette of the 27th of February, 1863, just when our prospects
                        looked most critical in the field, Mr. Meyers proved his loyalty by the
                        following editorial:</p>

                    <p>"THE CONSCRIPTION BILL - We take up our pen not to condemn the measure whose
                        title forms the caption of this article, but to warn Congress and the
                        President against its passage.</p>

                    <p>"We have already denounced it as a bold infraction of the Federal
                        Constitution and a contemptuous invasion of the reserved rights of the
                        States. We have exposed its design to give the scepter of despotism into the
                        hand of the President and have sounded the alarm to the people in regard to
                        its insidious purpose toward the republic. But our duty does not cease here.
                        We owe it, if not to ourself and our fellow men, most certainly to those in
                        authority," to utter at least a word of warning to the men upon whose action
                        depends the fate of the bill. We say in Congress stay your encroaching hand,
                        let you awake the sleeping lion of Pennsylvania's pride. We say to the
                        President make not a Dionysius of yourself, for there are yet Demons among
                        the people of the North who will dare to resist any usurper! Your design
                        against the liberty of the people and the sovereignty of the States is
                        needless and wanton."</p>

                    <p>You can obtain soldiers to carry your war, by using the means which the
                        Constitution provides, and by making drafts according to State regulations
                        or where none such exist, according to the laws of Congress in such case
                        made and provided. The people know this, and therefore, regard this
                        conscription bill as an outrage upon the States and as an attempt to rob
                        them of their liberty. You have asked much of the people of the North, and
                        much have they granted. You demanded their substance and they gave of it;
                        you asked for their blood and they poured it out; and, now, after all their
                        meek submission to your exactions, after all their ineffable suffering and
                        privation, you would wrest from them what they love better than even family
                        and friends, Constitutional freedom? Do not, as you value the peace of the
                        North, the stability of the Government, nay, your very lives, imagine that
                        our people are such slaves as to submit to so great a wrong! We say to you,
                        in friendly caution, beware! The people sent their sons and brothers to die
                        for you, when you pretended to fight for the right; they will die,
                        themselves rather than yield the right, and that, too, in defiance of any
                        foe, be he perjured rebel or forsworn official."</p>

                    <p>On the 18th day of November, immediately after the re-election of Mr. Lincoln
                        to the Presidency, the following editorial appeared in the Gazette;</p>

                    <p>"'THE WAR WILL END' - The Presidential election is over and Mr. Lincoln, in
                            his "way," has been re-made President. This
                        great national calamity must be borne until it shall be God's will to remove
                        the burden from the shoulders of the people. The nation has suffered
                        terribly, but it seems that it has not yet drained the cup of misery to its
                        dregs. The crucial horrors through which it has passed, have not yet
                        sufficiently purified it and the fires of civil war must still continue to
                        burn in order to smelt the hard metal of its unimpressible heart. How long
                        the awful genius which now presides over the destinies of the American
                        people, shall retain its horrible away, no man can predict. For our own
                        part, we can scarcely hope to see the day, when the shadow of its gloomy
                        presence shall no longer darken the land."</p>

                    <p>The above extract may aid the judgment of the people in determining between
                        Mr. Meyers and the editor of the REPOSITORY. But they are only the beginning
                        of what we have in store from the same prolific storehouse. During the
                        progress of the campaign we propose to furnish others taken at random from
                        the files of the Gazette as these were, and if
                        any one remains in doubt, as to Mr. Meyers' war record when the election day
                        comes it shall not be said that it is the fault of the REPOSITORY.</p>

<b>Meyers as a Tariff Man</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>When the Democratic nominee for Congress, Benjamin F. Meyers, clarifies his
                    stance on the tariff, the Repository calls him and
                    other supporters of free trade, "unsafe and unsound public servants, and
                    dangerous to the welfare of the people." The article suggests that Meyers's plan
                    would make the consumer pay more to large manufacturers.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Mr. Meyers defined his position on the tariff in the Harrisburg Patriot last week, as follows:</p>

                    <p>"We ourselves are in favor of the freest trade we can have in every branch of
                        industry consistent with the purposes of the revenue as the theory most
                        beneficial to the general interests of the whole."</p>

                    <p>But for the purposes of revenue to meet the expenses of the government he
                        would have no tariff at all. This is the doctrine of free traders every
                        where, and we claim, proves them unsafe and unsound public servants, and
                        dangerous to the welfare of the people.</p>

                    <p>Let us illustrate how a tariff for revenue would rob the people. A tariff for
                        revenue is a tax or tariff imposed on foreign imports and not with a view to
                        discriminate against foreign manufactures in favor of those of our own
                        country, but purely to raise money for public expenses. Take for example the
                        matter of iron, largely imported to the country when not prohibited by a
                        protective tariff. Suppose the price, untaxed, for imported and domestic
                        iron be $30 per ton, and that both importers and domestic producers can make
                        it for this under a system of absolute free trade. Mr. Meyers and his free
                        trade friends claim that the iron manufacturers do not need a high duty in
                        their favor to enable them to compete with the manufacturers of the foreign
                        article. Impose a tax for revenue, say of six dollars per ton on imported
                        pig iron. This at once raises the price according to the Free Trade doctrine
                        to $36 per ton, and the increased price must be borne by the consumer. Last
                        year we imported about six hundred thousand tons of iron, and made at home
                        about eighteen hundred tons. We would then have derived from imported iron a
                        revenue of $3,600,000. But the home-made iron is enhanced as much in price
                        as the imported, and hence the price would be increased on that produced at
                        home $10,800,000.</p>

                    <p>Hence, according to Mr. Meyers' theory of a tariff for revenue from our own
                        people of $3,600,000, we would compel them to pay into the pockets of our
                        own iron makers an additional sum of $10,800,000. In other words, to pay the
                        smaller sum into the revenue, they must pay, in addition, the larger sum
                        into the hands of the iron producers. This is the practical effect of a
                        tariff for revenue on the Free Traders own basis. If this be true, the
                        government had a thousand times better raise revenue by direct taxation,
                        than take the hard earnings out of the consumers pockets in this manner.
                        That is Mr. Meyers' theory of a tariff, and such is the effect of it, if
                        carried out upon any imported commodity, which is likewise manufactured in
                        this country, because Free Traders say that whatever tax is imposed upon a
                        foreign commodity is added to the price of the same commodity produced in
                        this country. For every dollar of revenue thus raised, Mr. Meyers would have
                        the people pay three dollars to the manufacturers. If our people are in
                        favor of Congress passing such a tariff, they can do their share towards
                        securing that end by voting for the election of Mr. Meyers instead of Mr.
                        Cessna. By electing him they will defeat one of the ablest and best
                        protective tariff men in Congress, and will add one to the number of Free
                        Traders in that body, who has been candid enough to pledge himself, in
                        advance of his election, to labor for the overthrow of our manufacturing
                        interests, for the free importation of all foreign commodities to the
                        detriment and destruction of our own, and to the reduction of the price of
                        labor to the standard of England.</p>

                    <p>Let us ask our laboring population, just here, how long do they think the
                        price of wages would keep up to their present standard if the products of
                        cheap European labor be allowed to come in untaxed and to take the place of
                        the products of our high priced labor? Our German citizens who came to this
                        country because labor was adequately rewarded here, would soon find
                        themselves obliged to work for a mere pittance, as they had done at home, if
                        indeed they could get any work at all. For the effect of it would be to put
                        an end to nearly all productive labor in this country.</p>

<b>Too Late</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository argues that the Democratic
                    nominee for Congress, Benjamin F. Meyers, cannot be forgiven for his

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The pit Mr. Benjamin F. Meyers digged for himself
                        during the war, now yearns to engulph him, and he
                        piteously begs that he may be allowed to escape it. Joe Jefferson's
                        inimitable Rip Van Winkle when prevailed upon to take a drink after having
                        signed the pledge remarked, as he swallowed the tempting beverage, "this
                        time don't count." That is just what our Democratic candidate for Congress
                        wants to be allowed to say now. He asks the Republican party to agree that
                        his hatred of the war, his friendship for the leaders of the rebellion, his
                        diabolical abuse of the President, his false statements as to Union defeats
                        and rebel victories, his efforts to put obstructions in the way of filling
                        up our armies, his attempts to weaken and destroy the financial credit of
                        the Government, shall not be counted. In one sense we are sure that the
                        people are willing that this shall be done, just as they desire to forget
                        that the South arrayed itself against the Union. They are willing that Mr.
                        Meyers' iniquitous record shall be buried out of sight forever so long as he
                        does not ask reward for his sins, but only oblivion. But when he asks to be
                        elected to one of the most honorable and responsible positions in the gift
                        of the people, a representative position, then his past public and political
                        acts must be counted. We can only judge of Mr. Meyers' future by his past.
                        That has not been such as to commend him to the loyal voters of this
                        district, be they Republican or Democratic.</p>

                    <p>We appreciate his anxiety when, as in the last number of the Bedford Gazette he beseechingly says:</p>

                    <p>A scire facias under the seals of all the courts
                        in Christendom could not revive the death issues which devided the people
                        during the war. The politician who drags from the grave their festering
                            corses, is not a friend of peace, but a
                        friend who delights himself in bitterness and strife There are present
                        questions to settle. These are quite sufficient to engage the whole
                        attention of the intelligent voter. Let the dead past bury its dead. Our
                        faces are not turned backward, but forward. Let
                        us act with regard to the things that are present before us, and linger not
                        to consider the things which are behind us. Lot's wife looked back and
                        perished but Lot himself looked not back and was saved.</p>

<b>Meyers' Disinterested Work for the Payment of the Border Damages</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository rejects claims that the
                    Democratic nominee for Congress, Benjamin F. Meyers, is more concerned with
                    border raid reparations than Republican incumbent, John Cessna.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Mr. Meyers' Bedford Gazette of last week says:</p>

                    <p>Mr. Meyers is being warmly supported by the People of Adams, Franklin, and
                        Fulton, without distinction of party, because of his earnest and unflinching
                        advocacy of the bill to reimburse the sufferers of the border counties for
                        losses during the war. Cessna, while in Congress, never opened his lips in
                        favor of any measure of relief to the people of the border who lost their
                        property by rebel raids and seizure by federal troops. On the other hand Mr.
                        Meyers, last winter, in his paper, the Harrisburg Patriot, and by his personal exertions, did all in his power to
                        obtain the long looked for relief.</p>

                    <p>This Border Damage business is one that it behooves Mr. Meyers and his
                        political friends to handle tenderly, as may have been learned from our
                        ventilation of the subject last week. As yet they do not seem to have
                        learned this, though we are hopeful that they will before the campaign is
                        over. That Mr. Meyers was not quite so disinterested in his advocacy of the
                        border claims as the Spirit and the Gazette would have us believe, was proved by us
                        last week, when we showed up the consideration he was to receive for his
                        services. We thought then that no paper in the district would be imprudent
                        enough to drag this question into the campaign except the Spirit, and we gave such a statement of the true
                        secret of Meyers' support as we believed would deter it from further
                        discussion of the subject. But we did not give the whole history of it, and
                        since Mr. Meyers himself means to make capital and friends out of it through
                        the columns of his paper he must take the responsibility of his own rash
                        act. We say that in addition to the promise of support
                            from the leaders of the Franklin county Democracy for his nomination for
                            Congress, Mr. Meyers presented his bill to the Franklin County Border
                            Damage Committee for the services of the Patriot in urging the payment
                            of the border damages, and demanded payment of it.</p>

                    <p>We have no comments to make. Mr. Meyers claims to have been loyal during the
                        war, as he does to be disinterested in the matter of the border damages. He
                        seems to have been unfortunate in his manner of establishing both his
                        loyalty and his disinterestedness, but it is no fault of ours. "Let us have
                        peace."</p>

                    <p>BEDFORD, September 3, 1870.</p>

                    <p>B. F. MEYERS, Esq - Dear Sir: Understanding that
                        you are being assailed by the "Republican" press on the ground that your
                        sympathies were not with the cause of the Union in the late war, I think it
                        but justice to say that when the Union army needed soldiers you were in
                        foremost in aiding the recruiting officers of the government. I recall
                        gratefully your services in assisting to raise my company for the
                        Twenty-second Pennsylvania cavalry, by addressing the people and otherwise
                        Whilst those who now boast so loudly about their "loyalty" were sitting in
                        their offices, or by their firesides, you were active in raising troops,
                        giving freely your labor and means in the furtherance of the cause in which
                        I had the honor to serve. The Fifty-fifth Pennsylvania volunteers will
                        hardly forget your services, while in the Legislature, in obtaining them
                        shelter in comfortable quarters, when on their first return from the seat of
                        war, they were sent to camp Curtin to lodge in the mud, without tents or
                        other shelter. T. H. LYONS.<br> Late Capt. Co. D, 55th P.V., and Capt. Co.
                        I, 22d Pa Cav.</p>

                    <p>There can of course no longer be any doubt upon this question. Have we not
                        here the voluntary testimony of a soldier? proof positive that
                        Mr. Meyers was foremost in aiding recruiting officers, and laudably zealous
                        in securing comfortable quarters at Camp Curtin for the gallant captain and
                        his company. Who is this T. H. Lyons, late Capt. Co. D, 55th P. V. and Capt.
                        Co. I, 22d Pa. Cav? The inquiry reminds us, not of a little story, but a bit
                        of history. This Capt. Lyons is the military hero who telegraphed to Andrew
                        Johnson, when the House of Representatives impeached him in the spring of
                        1868, add offered to march a company of his braves to Washington
                        to drive our Congress and overthrow the government. Why his services were
                        not accepted by the august tailor we have never learned. But what of that,
                        he and he alone won the immortality of infamy by his silly telegraph.</p>

                    <p>Such testimony is conclusive. Let no man hereafter doubt the loyalty of
                        Benjamin F. Meyers. Lyons proves it, and Lyons is above suspicion. The ugly
                        part of this business appears to be that Meyers is obliged to array Lyons
                        against his own written declarations, to prove Meyers to have been a falsifyer during the war in order to prove Meyers
                        loyal.</p>

                    <p>IN the Spirit, of last week, may be seen and
                        read, a communication from the pen of Benjamin F. Meyers, Esq., a copy of
                        which he sent to the editor of this paper, with the extraordinary request
                        that he would give it a place in his columns. Mr. Meyers represents it to be
                        a reply to our allegation that, "during the rebellion he was a friend of the
                        Confederate cause, and never hesitated to manifest as much sympathy with it
                        as was consistent with personal safety." We are glad that Mr. Meyers secured
                        the use of the Spirit for the publication of his
                        article, because it would have been unfortunate if such a marvelous
                        production had failed to see the light, and we are in posession of so many still more interesting documents of Mr.
                        Meyers' than this one, that we could not afford to give this one a place at
                        the sacrifice of them. Though we could not publish it, we hope every person
                        who can get a copy of the Spirit will be sure to
                        read it. Mr. Meyers did not expect that we would give it a place in our
                        columns, else why did he not send it directly to us instead of the editor of
                        the Spirit? Again he did not expect it, because
                        he gave the Spirit a copy of it in addition to
                        the one handed to us. We never returned our's. It still remains in our
                        possession, a literary and political curiosity; but the Spirit was at no loss for a copy for publication. Still further,
                        Mr. Meyers could not expect us to champion him through the campaign, since
                        he has as many papers to vindicate his political record, in the Sixteenth
                        district, as there are to assail it, and one of them owned by himself. Nor
                        could he expect it, because a perusal of the letter will convince any one
                        that it is not a vindication of himself, from our misrepresentations, but an
                        attempt to show that however bad he may be, his political opponent, Mr.
                        Cessna is no better. Lastly, to show that we do not wish to be unfair to Mr.
                        Meyers, we make this proposition: that for every communication, by Mr.
                        Cessna, that the Spirit will admit into its
                        columns, we will admit one from Mr. Meyers.</p>

                        Since his nomination he has got so much better than that that he has written
                        a letter ot the editor of this journal to convince him that he is and always
                        has been as loyal as his Republican opponent, Hon. John Cessna. In view of

                    <p>We take his letter at its full worth. We don't believe that he was any truer
                        to the country during the war than we represented him to be, but we have no
                        doubt that, in view of the present situation, he sincerely wishes that he
                        had been. So far as his declarations in 1870, are better indices of his real
                        character from 1860 to 1865, than his public declarations and acts during
                        the latter period were, so far are we willing to accept them. Others may
                        judge him as they see fit. We have no apprehensions that they can be

                            Conservative on Both - "Let the dead past bury its dead." - As
                        the bills posted about town for several days back announced, there was a
                        meeting of the Democracy in the Court House on Saturday evening and Benjamin
                        F. Meyers, Esq., Democratic candidate for Congress in the Sixteenth District
                        was present and addressed it. The meeting was not large, but the Court House
                        was three fourths full. We observed among the audience a large number of
                        Republican citizens among those gathered to hear, doubtless attracted by the
                        desire to hear what Meyers had to say about the political issues of the day,
                        and especially to learn how he means to dispose of the mischievous ghosts of
                        his political past, which are haunting his day and night dreams. It is
                        always an encouraging sign for the Republican party if its voters are seen
                        attending in goodly numbers the political meetings of the Democracy. We
                        never had in our ranks such convincing political orators as have been
                        furnished to our hands by the Democratic party, and when we succeed in
                        getting our party to attend Democratic meetings we are almost sure to make
                        more votes for Republicanism than in any other way.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Meyers spoke for more than an hour, and his language and manner were
                        dignified, manly and temperate, and to this we desire to bear our testimony.
                        As to the matter of his speech we disapprove of it altogether as being false
                        in fact and in argument. Considerable time was devoted to a discussion of
                        the financial policy of the administration, during which he tried to make
                        his hearers believe that the party in power was extravagant, that it was
                        burdensome upon the people, that it was corrupt, and that it made false
                        statements with a view to deceive the people. He drew a comparison between
                        the expenses of Buchanan's administration in 1860, and Grant's in 1870, and
                        alleged that the former cost the people $60,000,000 a year and the latter
                        $130,000,000, a difference of $70,000,000 a year after deducting from the
                        year 1870 the interest on the Public Debt and the amount devoted to pensions
                        and back bounty. Nearly all financial statements made by Democratic orators
                        are false as to the figures, and it is difficult for the people to test them
                        at the time. On the subject of the relative expenses of the administrations
                        of Buchanan and Grant, Speaker Blaine makes the following statement in his
                        recent letter of acceptance, which we set against that of Mr. Meyers:</p>

                    <p>"Excluding the items of the interest on the National Debt and the sum paid as
                        Pensions to the scarred and disabled veterans of the late war, we find the
                        following as the sum total of our expenses for the current fiscal year:</p>

                    <p>The last Democratic administration that was in full power in this country
                        under President Buchanan spent for the objects embraced in this schedule
                        something over seventy millions per annum in gold - an equivalent in paper
                        to-day of eighty five millions of dollars. The population of the country was
                        then less than thirty millions. It is now forty millions, so that President
                        Grant would be entitled by the ratio which has always governed expenditure
                        in this country, to spend a third more in the administration of the
                        Government than was required under Buchanan, which would bring the sum total
                        to one hundred and fourteen millions of dollars when in reality it is but
                        one hundred and five millions. The details of expenditure in the two periods
                        will also show immensely in favor of President Grant's economy. Under
                        President Buchanan the army consisted of ninteen
                        regiments, the maintenance of which cost for the four years of the
                        administration an average of over twenty-one millions each year - more than
                        a million dollars per annum in gold, or about thirteen hundred thousand
                        dollars in the paper money of to-day for each regiment. The army at present
                        consists of forty regiments, yet its whole maintenance for the year costs
                        but twenty-nine millions of dollars, a trifle over seven hundred dollars in
                        paper money to each regiment."</p>

                    <p>Other statements of Mr. Meyers were not more skillfully made than this. He
                        denied that the last Congress had reduced taxation by about $80,000,000, or,
                        indeed, at all, and to prove it made the statement that the appropriations
                        made for the expenses of the present fiscal year were $290,000,000. If any
                        one is sharp enough to see how the last statement, (granting it be true,
                        which it is not,) proves the first one, we would like to have him come to
                        our office and enlighten us. He argued further that the public debt had not
                        been reduced at all by this administration, that all the monthly statements
                        were false and that the debt was s large to-day as ever. Said he, Mr.
                        Boutwell when he makes a monthly statement does not include the bonds issued
                        to the Union Pacific railroad as part of the debt, but puts it in a foot
                        note below. If he included that the debt would not show a decrease. Let us
                        see about that. When Mr. Boutwell made his first Monthly Statement he
                        excluded the railroad bonds, which merely showed that he estimated the
                        public debt the amount of the bonds less than did Mr. McCulloh. Every month since then he has reduced it below the
                        statement of the month preceding, which would be the case if he included or
                        excluded the bonds. If a man owes a sum of money, which he estimates at a
                        million of dollars, and his neighbor at two millions, he just as surely
                        reduces it by paying a hundred thousand every month, be the principal what
                        he claims it to be, or what his neighbor claims. Mr. Meyers says he does
                        not, and asks sensible people to believe him.</p>

                    <p>But we cannot pursue his financial fallacies any further. There were other
                        things he had better attended to than these. His defense of his rebel war
                        record was miserable and humiliating in the extreme. He could deny non of
                        the charges which had been made and proved, but had to content himself by
                        claiming that though this was all true, Mr. Cessna was no better than
                        himself. He declared that these were dead issues and eloquently entreated
                        the audience not to turn back among "dead mens' bones." We never saw a more
                        palpable admission of a man's own weakness. On the tariff, on which a number
                        of Democrats desired to hear him, he had only a few unsatisfactory words to
                        give. He admitted that his private convictions, but suggested that as a
                        member of Congress he would be controlled by the wishes of his district
                        which he admitted were for a protective tariff. It would be a smart trick
                        indeed for the people who favor a protective tariff to elect a free trader
                        to Congress, hoping to see him submerge his conviction on a vital question
                        like this for theirs which he believes false and hurtful, when they can find
                        a man whose personal convictions are in harmony with theirs. The Patriot, about two weeks ago, indignantly denied
                        the insinuation of a Western paper that the Democratic members from
                        Pennsylvania were against free trade, and asserted that Mr. Haldeman had
                        always voted with the free traders. That is just the way Meyers would vote
                        and work if he got to Congress.</p>

                    <p>The Democracy were discouraged and sick during the meeting. Meyers aroused no
                        enthusiasm, and he felt the chilling influence which pervaded the audiences
                        sensibly. Cessna is stronger for the meeting. We sincerely invite Mr. Meyers
                        to return.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>The first Republican meeting of the campaign, in this county, was held in the
                        Court House, on Monday evening last. The attendance was very large. The
                        meeting was called to order by Col. J. G. Elder, who nominated A. D.
                        Cauffman, Esq, for President, and Messrs. W. N. Witherspoon and D. M.
                        Leisher for Vice President.</p>

                    <p>John Stewart, Esq, first addressed the meeting in an able and eloquent
                        manner, which was received with frequent rounds of applause. He spoke
                        particularly of the effrontery of B. F. Meyers, the Democratic candidate for
                        Congress, who although he had been a rebel sympathizer and a friend of the
                        rebellion, yet came to the loyal men of this county to tell them how to rule
                        the country he did his utmost to ruin. He referred to the mendacity of the
                        same man in his statement of statistics and to his ignorance of the finances
                        of the Nation.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Stewart was followed by Hon. John Cessna, who held his audience with one
                        of the soundest and best political speeches ever made in the Court House. He
                        answered to the satisfaction of his friends all the charges made against him
                        by Meyers on Saturday. He fully established his loyalty to the Union in the
                        days of the war. He expressed himself heartily in favor of Protection, and
                        stated that in Reading, in 1858, he introduced and had carried the first
                        Tariff resolution ever brought before a Democratic Convention in this State.
                        He said in relation to the Border Raid losses, that he had never been asked
                        by petition or otherwise to introduce any bill in Congress for their
                        payment, and that if he had done so it would have put an end to a successful
                        effort before our Legislature. He further stated that he worked for the bill
                        at Harrisburg and at the earnest solicitation of Capt.
                            Skinner he had appealed to Speaker Strang, to place Skinner on the
                            Committee of Ways and Means, and that the Speaker had complied with his
                            request and as a personal favor to him placed Skinner on this
                        Committee.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Cessna spoke for about an hour and a half. As he had not the time to
                        discuss all the issues of the campaign, he promised his audience to speak
                        again on next Tuesday night in this place. We regret that we have not the
                        space to give his speech at length, for we know that those who heard it were
                        delighted with it, and, feel that those who could not find an opportunity to
                        be present have lost a rich treat.</p>

                    <p>The meeting adjourned at a late hour.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>On Thursday night the colored voters of Chambersburg celebrated the eighth
                        anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, with proper ceremonies. At
                        about 8 o'clock in the evening, they assembled and paraded in torchlight
                        procession through the principal streets of the town. Quite a large number
                        were in the procession, and their conduct and decorum during the parade were
                        unexceptionable; just what all their former public demonstrations led us to
                        believe they would be.</p>

                    <p>As this was not a political occasion, there were no political speeches made
                        at, least not in public, and we haven't heard that there were any at their
                        quarters. We may take occasion to say, however, that our colored voters are
                        thoroughly organized and are aroused for the campaign, and will cast a solid
                        vote for the whole Republican ticket at the approaching election. This is
                        the case not only with those in Chambersburg, but throughout the entire
                        county.</p>
