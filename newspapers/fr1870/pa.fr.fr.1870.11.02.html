<b>Meyers Whistles</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository denies that defeated Republican
                    congressional representative, John Cessna, has plans to contest Democrat B. F.
                    Meyers's victory. The paper suggests that Meyers's fears are a sign of weakness.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>THIS whistling to keep up one's courage is one of the oldest tricks in the
                        world, and it is amusing to see how Meyers keeps whistling in the columns of
                        his "two papers," one daily. No person has said that Hon. John Cessna means
                        to contest Meyers' seat in the next Congress. Cessna has made no such
                        announcement in the papers, he has given no person authority to say so for
                        him, he has not given Meyers notice, either official or otherwise, that he
                        intends to contest, and yet not an issue of the Patriot or the Bedford Gazette appears
                        that is not full of it. Meyers' unexpected success seems to have upset his
                        equanimity. He didn't expect to succeed, and now, that he seems to have a
                        small majority, doubtless knowing how fraudulently it was obtained, sleeping
                        or waking, he sees visions of a contest. In every issue of his papers he
                        babbles about the contest, and make ridiculous
                        threats, and tells stupendous stories, until even his friends are
                        apprehensive that his Congressional campaign has produced a little crack
                        somewhere in his organism.</p>

                    <p>We beg him, purely in charity, to preserve his soul in peace, and if possible
                        suppress his anxiety for a few days. If Cessna means to contest he can't
                        possibly do it without letting him know all about it, and giving him
                        abundant time to get up all sorts of dreadful things. But if Meyers thinks
                        to deter him from entering upon a contest by constantly publishing his silly
                        stories, he is a bigger fool than we took him for, and is making a case to
                        prove that he isn't fit for a seat in Congress, whether the people elected
                        him to the position or not.</p>

                    <p>We can assure Mr. Meyers now, that if Mr. Cessna has reason to believe that
                        the former secured his election by fraudulent votes he will be sure to
                        contest the seat, and Mr. Meyers may as well save his strength and temper
                        for the occasion.</p>
