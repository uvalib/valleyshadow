<b>The Late Elections</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository claims that the situation in
                    Congress is similar to what it was before the election of 1870 since the
                    Republicans still maintain control of the House of Representatives. The author
                    argues that Democrats, due to the passage of the 15th Amendment, gained from
                    alienated voters and "weak-kneed Republicans whose sensitive political stomachs
                    still gag when they attempt to swallow negro suffrage." The editorial calls for
                    Republican unity in 1872, concluding "for every fracture made in the Republican
                    ranks only rivets the Democratic party more closely together."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Since the date of the late elections, the 8th inst., the result has been
                        generally discussed by the journals of both political parties. Each party,
                        as is natural, has sought to make for itself the most favorable showing, and
                        each we think has claimed more than its legitimate share. What has the
                        Democratic party gained by the elections, and what has the Republican party
                        lost? The Democracy did not gain what they contended for, the political
                        control of the House of Representatives, nor has the Republican party lost
                        it. In that respect they stand as before. So far then as the Democracy
                        failed in this the great end they had in view they have suffered a defeat.
                        The House of Representatives in the Forty-second Congress will have a
                        Republican majority of not less than 45 members, a larger majority than any
                        administration ever had at its second Congressional election. In considering
                        whether the Republican party has been actually weakened by the late election
                        it is necessary to consider the circumstances of the Congressional elections
                        in 1868, and to determine from them whether the wonderful Republican
                        triumphs of that year were not the result of special causes, which arose
                        then out of the insane action of certain Southern members of the Democratic
                        party, and which did not exist before and do not exist now. It was the year
                        of the Presidential election, and at the Democratic National Convention in
                        New York, the Southern Democracy dictated a revolutionary platform for the
                        party and nominated Gen. Frank Blair for the Vice Presidency after he had
                        written a letter endorsing the sentiments of the Southern fire eaters. The Democratic party went into the
                        contest burdened by all the bad blood of the South and with the confidence
                        of the whole country in its patriotism and loyalty weakened and discouraged.
                        The people were opposed to further sectional agitation, and with reckless
                        frankness the leaders of the Democracy had assured them that they could
                        expect no quiet and no stability of government at their hands. This was the
                        situation when the Congressional elections of 1868 were held, and out of
                        this situation sprung Grant's tremendous majorities, and the overwhelming
                        Republican majority in Congress.</p>

                    <p>None of these circumstances existed in 1870. The Fifteenth Amendment had been
                        peaceably adopted and had been accepted by the Democracy, except in a single
                        belt where Democratic bigotry is unusually dense, and where the leaders
                        thought it might be the means of bringing them a temporary triumph. This was
                        the case in the border States, and was especially noticeable in the counties
                        which fringed what was once the dividing line between slavery and freedom.
                        In the late election the Democracy could reasonably expect the support of
                        the thousands of their party who had been driven into a temporary support of
                        the Republican party in 1868, and they were not disappointed. In addition to
                        this they received, in the belt already mentioned, a class of weak-kneed
                        Republicans whose sensitive political stomachs still gag when they attempt
                        to swallow negro suffrage. Beyond the return of their own, who were
                        frightened from them in 1868, and the weak-kneed Republicans, we fail to
                        perceive wherein the Democratic party have made any encroachments upon the
                        Republican party. In spite of all the tricks they adopted, as for instance,
                        declaring themselves revenue reformers when it was believed revenue reform,
                        whatever that may be, was popular, and tariff men when a protective tariff
                        was demanded by the peculiar interests of the country, and their skillful
                        efforts to create dissensions in strong Republican districts by encouraging
                        disappointed aspirants for office to run independent and then abstaining
                        from making any nominations of their own, and casting their votes for the
                        independent candidate. When the result is honestly scrutinized we fail to
                        see any Democratic gains which cannot be fully accounted for on other
                        grounds than an increase of Democratic and a decrease of Republican strength
                        among the masses. On the contrary, there are numerous instances all over the
                        country to show that where the Republican party was not divided by local and
                        personal causes, it not only held its own but actually added to its old
                        majorities.</p>

                    <p>The Democracy boast of gains in the State of New York and in Pennsylvania,
                        and of the defeat of General Schenck in Ohio. It is true these are gains so
                        far as Democratic members are substituted for Republicans, but when they are
                        scrutinized every candid mind must admit that they all grew out of transient
                        causes, and not out of the only substantial ground, a majority of Democratic
                        votes. The loss of Republican members in New York is seen to happen in
                        districts having large and unmistakable Republican majorities, and arises
                        out of the difficulties between Senators Fenton and Conkling. The same is
                        true at our own State. Morrell's defeat in the Seventeenth, Armstrong's
                        defeat in the Eighteenth, Gilfillan's defeat in the Twentieth and Donley's
                        defeat in the Twenty-fourth, are the result of Republican dissensions in the
                        State and cannot be charged to the lack of Republican voters. Each of these
                        districts has a large Republican majority to-day
                        and will prove the fact whenever nominations are made satisfactory to the
                        party. The defeat of Schenck in the Dayton district, which the Democracy
                        claim as a Free Trade victory, is no such victory at all. The district has
                        always been so close as to be called doubtful, and Schenck would have been
                            re-elected but for the disfranchisement of
                        several hundred disabled soldiers residing in a national asylum in the
                        district. Even previous to his nomination he declared his belief that if
                        these voters would be excluded he could not be elected.</p>

                    <p>In the late elections much has been learned, and the future success of the
                        Republican party, as does every success whether individual or general, will
                        depend upon the judicious use of the knowledge obtained. If wisdom reign in
                        the councils of the party her success will be no less signal and
                        overwhelming in 1872 than it was in 1868. If partisanship, factions, rings
                        and personal vanities and selfish ambitions be allowed to divide and
                        distract the party in the several states, she can expect nothing else than
                        to be ground to pieces by the united Democracy, for every fracture made in
                        the Republican ranks only rivets the Democratic party more closely together.</p>

<b>Cessna Vs. Meyers</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository defends defeated Republican
                    congressman John Cessna when he declares that he is challenging the election
                    results.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>MR. MEYERS has scarcely forgotten how we urged him to abstain from wasting
                        his really magnificent stock of indignation, his abundant supply of scorn,
                        his well preserved injured innocence, his startling invectives and his
                        withering scorn upon mere shadows, as he was doing in assailing Hon. John
                        Cessna weeks before the latter had given him any intimation that he was not
                        going to allow him to retain the seat in Congress which he had reached
                        through fraudulent votes. We prayed him to do so because we knew that like
                        other pyrotecnics, when once shot off they
                        were worthless for future use, and if Mr. Meyers had his show before the
                        spectators arrived, he could make no display when the great occasion
                        occurred. The result has fully warranted the correctness of our
                        observations. When the time came Mr. Cessna served Mr. Meyers a notice that
                        he meant to contest with him the seat in Congress from this district, and
                        the latter, having exhausted his magazine before the battle, makes only a
                        sorry fusilade in the columns of the Bedford
                            Gazette.</p>

                    <p>We are sorry for his own sake that he allows himself to make such a miserable
                        spectacle. Isn't it a contemptible soul that suggests that Mr. Cessna
                        contests for the purpose of "robbing him" of his salary as a member of
                        Congress? Mr. Meyers in his feeble way attempted to convince the people
                        previous to the election, that he was as moved to seek a seat in Congress
                        solely to advance their interest. It seems now from the way he cries out
                        that it is the fear of losing the salary which causes his tears. Then, too,
                        why does Mr. Meyers speak of the intention to "swindle" him by the aid of a
                        "packed committee and purjured witnesses?" Is it
                        not a little early in the contest when only the first step has been taken,
                        the serving of a notice, for one gentleman to employ such terms to another
                        gentleman? Is it because Meyers has all along been foolishly talking such
                        stuff in order to scare Cessna, and now, since he finds he don't scare worth
                        a cent, he is compelled to continue the use of it?</p>

                    <p>Now, in the progress of this contest we are not inclined to expect much from
                        Mr. Meyers that is either courteous or decent. If we were we would take it
                        wholly upon faith and not upon works. But however reckless he may be in the
                        use of epithets and assertions, he should at least be consistent with
                        himself. Previous to Mr. Cessna's notice, when the shadow of a contest was
                        haunting him, Mr. Meyers frequently boasted that he did not fear Mr. Cessna,
                        because in the next Congress he would not be chairman of the committee on
                        contested elections, nor would the committee be composed of the corrupt men
                        who now compose it. If he had any faith in what he said, why does he now
                        charge that Mr. Cessna "has made up his mind to rob him of his salary by a
                        dishonest attempt to swindle him out of his seat in Congress," and to add to
                        it, "we say swindle, because he has no just
                        ground of contest and cannot succeed in his scheme without the aid of a
                            packed committee and purjured witnesses." If he has any confidence in his
                        boast as to the integrity of the next committee he should have no fear that
                        he will be swindled by Mr. Cessna, even though the latter were willing to
                        undertake such a dishonest trick, out of his "salary" in the next Congress.
                        Again, no person knows better than Mr. Meyers, because the notice served on
                        him must specify the facts on which Mr. Cessna intends to contest, that when
                        he charges the latter with "founding his case on generalities and guesses,"
                        he is simply saying what is not true. Such charges and stories are merely
                        attempts to get up public sympathy, and not very rational attempts either.
                        Mr. Cessna has excellent reasons to believe not only that Mr. Meyers' small
                        majority of fifteen votes, but that fourfold as many more Democratic votes
                        were fraudulently cast at the late election, and believing so, it is his
                        duty, both to his party and to himself, to prove them so and oust Mr.
                        Meyers. If he is mistaken, Mr. Meyers will have every opportunity to prove
                        it, especially, as he himself professes the utmost confidence in the purity
                        and integrity of the next committee. In order that the whole matter may be
                        thoroughly investigated we hope the proclamation of Mr. Meyers to his
                        clansmen through the district to go to smelling up his case for him in every
                        election precinct, will be promptly obeyed, and that he will be able to make
                        the best showing before the committee his case will possibly admit of. Only
                        we beseech him to abstain as much as he can from making an ass of himself.</p>
