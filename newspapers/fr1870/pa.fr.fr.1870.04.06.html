<b>The Border Counties. Their Hospitality to the Soldiers, etc.</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In this letter, the author, Web Woodman, counters the accusation that
                    border-county men treated soldiers unfairly during the war. He describes his own
                    war experience in the militia and suggests that he was treated kindly wherever
                    he went in the border counties. He ends his letter by calling on Pennsylvanians
                    to pay back the border counties for their losses in rebel raids.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>For the Editors of the Franklin Repository:</p>

                    <p>Not a resident of the Keystone State, I see little of its politics or public
                        affairs, except what comes under my eye in your columns, and am not likely
                        to read articles on State affairs or State news as closely or regularly as
                        your Pennsylvania readers.</p>

                    <p>But to-day my eye fell on some extracts culled from
                        papers published in your own State, and quoted in an editorial of the 2d
                        inst., that made my blood boil. The following quotation, heated my blood
                        hotter, if it were possible than did the Rebel invasions of 1862-3:</p>

                    <p>It is upon record that water was sold by the
                        citizens to the parched and thirsty soldiers and that every species of
                        extortion was resorted to in the sale of provisions to them.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>One of the editors of the FRANKLIN REPOSITORY is an old and valued friend,
                        and when, a year or more since, he asked me to occasionally write a line for
                        his paper, it were a difficult matter to say to him nay. Still I think my
                            constitutional fatigue would have made it
                        such, had it not been for the pleasant memories and associations connected
                        with the place of its publications, and the country surrounding.</p>

                    <p>There was, to me, an irresistible fascination in the feeling that some eye
                        that had looked kindly on the boy militiaman might glance over my article,
                        that some one of the many hands that extended me so many kindnesses during
                        the time "I fit and bled with the bloody Fifth," might turn over the sheet
                        containing my lines, and thus, as it were, make an unperceived, yet real
                        connecting link between my present and that past, between me and those true
                        and tried, but short time friends of the past.</p>

                    <p>And thus it came about that I have now and then scribbled a few lines for the
                        FRANKLIN REPOSITORY, and thus it was I saw these slanderous
                        misrepresentations of my border county friends. I know little concerning the
                        technical quibbles of those who desire to defraud the border counties of
                        their just dues; therefore shall not touch upon them. But I should consider
                        myself a craven indeed, did I not unqualifiedly
                        testify to the losses of many, the ardent patriotism of most the generous hospitality of all. Not being suited with
                        soldiers fare (of which there was always, in my company, an abundance), and
                        regulations and discipline being rather lax, from the time we reached
                        Hagerstown until we reached Harrisburg on our return, I passed a
                        considerable portion of my time, (boy like,) in seeking what I might devour,
                        and never in a single instance was I repulsed or treated otherwise than in a
                        hospitable manner.</p>

                    <p>Kind reader, if you have ever been a college student, if you have ever been
                        father, mother, brother, or sister to one, you will readily understand how
                        it was that one glorious September morning I started off with the militia
                        with just a one dollar bill and a few shinplasters in my pocket. I offered
                        that one dollar bill on payment for every meal I ate, from the time I
                        arrived in Hagerstown until my return to Harrisburg, where I felt it would
                        not be considered an insult: yet brought it back with me and have it yet as
                        a souvenir of the hospitality of the border counties, and will be glad to
                        show it to any doubter, who was compelled to buy
                        water. If any of the militia soldiers were ill-treated by the
                        inhabitants, it never fell under my observation; and that it was owing more
                        to the indiscretion and lack of discipline in the men, than want of
                        hospitality in the residents, when it did occur; I think that the entire
                        backbone of the noble band that participated in that jolly old picnic, will bear me out in saying. I feel now, in
                        looking back, that I was but little better than a beggar myself, for there
                        was plenty to eat, (such as it was), still the
                        craving for something better was more excusable in a boy than in grown men.
                        No doubt, however, there were those who suffered from lack of provision,
                        owing usually to carelessness or incompetency in their officers. In none of
                        the places where we camped were we more hospitably treated than at
                        Chambersburg. I remember one house, built in cottage style, on the
                        outskirts, standing on a slight elevation, with trim grounds and shrubbery,
                        where I ate, as well as others, many a hearty meal, and I received many a
                        delicacy and many a favor from the genial proprietor and pleasant faced and
                        kindly voiced mistress. Their names have faded from my mind but I can see
                        the house, the cheerful dining room, and the tasteful parlor, as plain today
                        as I saw it then, and should I ever have the good fortune to meet them
                        again, I should recognize them as readily as if we had parted but yesterday.</p>

                    <p>A short way out of town there stood a large, honest built, farm house; ample
                        barns, neat outhouses, bursting granaries and plethoric stacks and ricks
                        clustered round it; lusty kine and goodly uddered cows lowed in the pasture,
                        motherly hens cackled, dandified roosters challenged, turkey gobblers
                        strutted, geese hissed, and pigeons swooped around the yards. Everything
                        spoke of good cheer, hospitality and a kindly welcome. And never did a
                        goodly outside testify to a fairer inside, as many a hungry stomach, warmed
                        and filled at the table and cheered by the kindly welcome of the good dame,
                        certified to listening comrades. And yet, must I confess it, I saw
                        soldiers--militia soldiers, without leave or license, or as much as saying
                        by your leave, Sir, shoot down a wagon load of poultry at this very house.
                        To be sure, these men were not fair samples of the militia men. No more
                        should some churl who sold a cup of water, or copperhead who welcomed the
                        rebels, be considered a fair sample of the border county men.</p>

                    <p>At Greencastle a regiment were quartered in a pretty grove not far from town,
                        and near the grove were a number of unthreshed stacks of wheat. The owner
                        came down and offered the men all the straw they wanted if they would go for
                        it to his barnyard, hardly half a mile distant. The officers forbid the men
                        using the unthreshed straw, yet every spear of it was used in preference to
                        going a little farther for threshed. If this had been done by boys, by
                        unthinking, careless students, it would not have been quite so bad. But I
                        saw two middle aged men at this business who were mill owners and certainly
                        ought to have valued grain. I also saw men I knew to be merchants, lawyers,
                        and hotel keepers at the work of destruction.</p>

                    <p>Well, as I have before told you, I left college with one dollar and a few
                        shinplasters in my pocket, and became a brave militia boy of the "Bloody
                        Fifth." We slept on the floor of the capitol at Harrisburg, and here I
                        should have soon parted with dollar and shin-plasters, had I not been
                        acquainted with some of the "beauty and fashion" of the place, who were kind
                        enough for "auld acquaintance sake" to invite me to their tables. From the
                        time we left Harrisburg until darkness covered the scene, I remember little
                        except one long line of pretty girls, waving handkerchiefs, boquets and cheers.</p>

                    <p>Just as the dawn broke, I awakened up and looking out of the car saw, as it
                        seemed to me, soldiers, camp fires and tents, on every hill-top and in every
                        valley. I asked a passerby the name of the place; Hagerstown was the reply.
                        This name roused my snoring comrades, for the last we heard of that place
                        she was occupied by rebels.</p>

                    <p>We were soon out of the car. A courier from McClellan addressed us, our
                        captain (an old Colonel of the Mexican campaign) gave us another, and off we
                        started at the head of the line, marching, oh so
                        proudly. The sun soon grew hot, it was fearfully dusty, we were
                        green, and some of us were young (now don't laugh); soon orders were given.
                        "Go it the best you can," and the best we could do was to go it lame, sore,
                        and tired, a band of stragglers.</p>

                    <p>At last we came to a church, and here we found the road blocked up with
                        militia, huddled in the fields, round the houses, and especially in the
                        graveyard and church, like so many sheep a great many of them officers and
                        men, were very much discontented, and highly displeased that they had been
                        taken out of the State; another portion anxious to snuff the battle. About
                        the middle of the afternoon, there came a roar like an army fleeing. Soon a
                        long train of six horse and six mule teams came in sight, on a full run. The
                        report was immediately passed from mouth to mouth that McClellan was whipped
                        and his army in full retreat. I never knew before how easy a matter it was
                        to start a panic. That dense crowd of men shook and trembled like a forest
                        in a gale but a trifle more and they would have been scattered like so many
                        sheep. The wagons turned out to be going to Hagerstown for more ammunition.
                        A little later in the day we were marched back to Hagerstown very much to
                        our disgust. In a driving rain we were led into a muddy field, without
                        tents, straw, or shelter of any kind, to pass the night. We should have
                        learned some of the hardships of a soldier, had it not been for the kind
                        heart of Mrs. Love, who threw open her house to us, gave us supper, lodging
                        and breakfast. Most of us had at least been brought up as gentlemen, but a
                        few, I fear, abused her hospitality. She was a noble woman. Let none whose
                        hospitality and union sentiments have never been so severely tested, sneer
                        at the patriotism of the border counties of these two States. I hope she
                        still lives to enjoy the blessings of the government she so loved, and that
                        she is blessed with an abundance of those creature comforts which she dealt
                        out to the soldier with so lavish a hand. There was a large, old fashioned
                        stone mansion opposite Mrs. Love's, and nearer the depot, where the ladies
                        were very kind.</p>

                    <p>The next day we were put on guard over the railroad depot, but received many
                        kindnesses from Mrs. Love during our entire stay. I passed one very
                        miserable night at the depot, guarding a train of sick and wounded. Their
                        groans and cries made me sick at heart. It was the night it was feared there
                        would be an effort made to capture Gov. Curtin, and that the rebel cavalry
                        would cut off communication on the railroad, consequently these poor men
                        were waiting at the depot for twelve hours.</p>

                    <p>At two o'clock on Friday morning I was ordered to take my gun and several
                        men, and start out a worthy citizen to his farm, several miles distant,
                        where it was said he had corn secreted. I have no doubt he was a fine old
                        gentleman, but was reputed slightly secesh, and, moreover, I can certify
                        that he had a will of his own. My repeated knocks brought his man at length,
                        but the citizen refused to appear, and I was finally compelled to violate
                        the sanctity of his sleeping apartment, and separate him from his bosom
                        companion at the point of the bayonet. A similar use of the bayonet
                        compelled his man to gear up a four mule team, contrary to orders from said
                        citizen, and similar persuasions induced man and master to mount with us
                        into the ample wagon. We finally succeeded, by the use of threats and
                        certain persuasions, in finding both farm and corn, and loaded our wagon
                        well. On top of the wagon we placed an immense heap of slaughtered
                        poultry--chickens, geese and turkeys alike suffered. I did not pity him
                        much, as he gave us a good deal of trouble by his perverseness. He got an
                        order on the government for his corn, and we considered that the poultry
                        only paid us for the extra trouble he made us.</p>

                    <p>On our return to quarters we found our comrades gone, and learned they had
                        been ordered to Greencastle. We roasted our chickens, &amp;c., on
                        Saturday and Sunday, and then began to think about means of transportation
                        to our company. Our first application was received with contempt by the
                        officer (a West Pointer) who told us if we wanted to play soldier to walk.
                        But a second application by one of our number, who had been a regular army
                        officer, put a different face on affairs, and we were sent on without
                        further delay. We dawdled about Greencastle for a while, then were ordered
                        to Chambersburg, where we laid a while longer. For what reason we were
                        delayed in either place I never knew. Chambersburg was so radient with pretty girls that I there spent all my
                        shinplasters for paper collars, without, I fear leaving any lasting
                        impression in return for my trouble. At Chambersburg I saw the prettiest
                        girl of the trip, save one--a lady that brought me cakes and sandwiches at
                        Carlisle, where we halted an hour or so. Either the cakes or sandwiches were
                        beyond the skill of Professor Blot, she a marvel of beauty or I marvelously
                        hungry. It is said "the nearest way to a man's heart is through his
                        stomach." She found the way to a boy's heart. What was it, hunger, cakes or
                        beauty, or all combined? Well, at last orders came for us to pick up our
                        duds and start for home, and thus ends my militia campaign, a glorious,
                        jolly, old pic-nic it was, "that and nothing
                        more." As I said before, I am not a resident of the Keystone State,
                        nevertheless I am a tax-payer in that State, and
                        it will give me pleasure, as it will every other true militiaman, to pay my
                        share towards recompensing those border county friends who made our pleasure
                        trip agreeable, and who were, I fear, in return wronged by some most
                        scandalously.</p>

                    <p>A majority of those who turned out in 1862-3 were of the noblest of the land.
                        But the lack of the discipline and order inevitable under the circumstances,
                        demoralized every one, and, aside from this, we, as a matter of course, had
                        our share of scalawags. Such men soon mated with the scalawags of the border
                        counties, and, as it is all the world over, soon got into a brawl with their
                        brother scalawags, and then to get sympathy, charged them with selling
                        water, &amp;c. Such men lived on the public at home, and went into the
                        militia with the firm resolve to live on the "border county fellows," and
                            nobly did they fulfill their resolves.
                        Military discipline and order were things unknown. Many of the privates were
                        lawyers, clergymen, doctors, merchants and farmers, and were frequently
                        commanded by men inferior to them in education, social position and natural
                        ability, chosen because they had served in the ranks and knew something of
                        the drill. Such officers, of course, possessed no moral power or control
                        over their men.</p>

                    <p>It may be said that soldiery, made up largely of men of education and
                        position, should have been a law unto themselves. History gives us no
                        account of an equally large body of men, raised on such short notice, poorly
                        officered and poorly provided for, often without tents, blankets or stores
                        of any kind, who behaved so well. But every man carries within him the germ
                        of a Gipsey, and in that short season of turmoil
                        and confusion, many a man developed a disregard for property, and meum and
                        teum that he never himself before dreamed of, and that he has since bitterly
                        repented of. I must myself confess that I enjoyed getting my meals from
                        house to house, in true vagabond style, sleeping on the ground pleasant
                        nights, and living at loose ends generally.</p>

                    <p>A little more of that life would have made me a confirmed tramp. And never to
                        this day does a tramp come to my house or barn but he gets more straw, and a
                        warmer bite for that Gipsey campaign. I feel that I
                        once belonged to the same brotherhood and I acknowledge the fascination that
                        binds him to the life.</p>

                    <p>In concluding my militia experience, I will only add, that the suffering, of
                        the border counties from the rebels is a matter of history. So too is the
                        patriotism of the great majrrity of her people,
                        and if the great and wealthy State of Pennsylvania refuses now to grant the
                        request of these, her children, for aid, it will make at least one bloted page in her history.<br> WEB WOODMAN</p>

                    <p>The question being on motion to indefinitely postpone the further
                        consideration of the bill, Capt. Skinner said:--</p>

                    <p>Mr. Speaker:--I hope this motion to postpone will
                        not prevail. As the immediate representative on this floor of a people more
                        largely interested than any other in the passage of this bill, it seems
                        proper that I should give at this time some of the reasons which induces me
                        to ask, in their behalf, indemnification for losses sustained during the war
                        of the Rebellion. Standing upon the threshold of this debate, it also seems
                        proper that I should disclaim any pecuniary interest in the bill. --Neither
                        myself nor any of those peculiarly near to me, lost anything in the shape of
                        property. If I have shown extraordinary zeal in my desire for its passage,
                        if I have persistently importuned and earnestly besought members to give it
                        their support, it is because I feel the fearful responsibility resting upon
                        me. From out  the depths of their financial distress and in
                        many cases of absolute naked penury, my people are looking up to-day to the Legislature for relief. Could you have
                        gone with me to my home at the close of each weekly session of this House,
                        and heard the anxious, almost despairing, inquiries of those whose
                        properties and whose houses are now hanging over the abyss of bankruptcy by
                        the brittle thread of this appropriation, could your eyes meet, as mine are
                        compelled to meet, each time I walk the streets of Chambersburg the ruined
                        walls of once peaceful and happy homes, whose former tenantry have not even
                        yet been able to rebuild them. Could you see as I have seen, an old man
                        bowed with age, and struggling under his load of debt, along past that
                        dwelling, of which in former years he was the happy possessor, but has now
                        passed under the auctioneer's hammer into the hands of another, and could
                        you recollect that that same old man gave his sons to your cause, and that
                        they perished on the battle field--you would
                        then little wonder that I am tremulously anxious to-day to see this bill pass. But, Mr. Speaker, it is not on the
                        ground of sympathy we base our arguments in favor of its passage. There are
                        better, weightier and higher reasons why these claims should be paid. Law,
                        right, justice, the duty of the State to the people--demand that they should
                        be paid.</p>

                    <p>What is the history of these claims? It is a part of the history of that
                        long, dark and terrible war which came upon the land, the details of which
                        are so fresh in the minds of all that I need hardly recur to them. I was yet
                        a boy when the first faint specks of that disastrous struggle appeared above
                        the Southern horizon, but my remembrance of the time is most vivid. I did
                        not then know what war was. I had read of great armies going forth to
                        battle, of dire conflicts in which thousands went down to death and
                        thousands more were borne away horribly mangled and mutilated. I believed it
                        to be a mere contest of arms, and that men sought "the tented field" to win
                        glory and renown. The picture went no further with me then. I did not
                        realize that the struggle at that time in spending involved destruction of
                        property and houses; that it would entail misery and ruin wherever its
                        monster tread would fall, and that a nation's people were to be plunged into
                        a huge debt. An experience common to us all has taught me these sterner
                        realities. I now profess to know what was in all its horrible details, and,
                        sir, I profess to have some proper conception of what are the duties of the
                        survivors of such a war as that through which we have just passed. The dead
                        have done their work, and done it well. Their mission ended when the fatal
                        bullet laid them low. Ours is yet in part to be performed. We are to see
                        that the fruits of the nation's victory over treason are secured; that the
                        families of those who died in our stead are cared for; that those who went
                        forth in the strength and vigor of manhood and came back to us mere
                        shattered wrecks of their former selves are sustained and comforted; that
                        the nation's plighted faith is not broken, and above
                            all, sir, that the excessive burdens of the few be borne by the
                        many.</p>

                    <p>My appeal then, gentlemen representatives, is not to your sympathies, but to
                        your sense of duty. I ask not charity, but justice for my people. They are a part of yourselves--a part of the
                        great loyal North and the only people of any of the Northern States upon
                        whom the scourge of war fell, with any great effect. Living upon the Border,
                        with no natural defense save the narrow, shallow Potomac, we were from the
                        very first subject to the invasions of that enemy which had sprung up just
                        over beyond us. Harpers Ferry and all the surrounding region had early been
                        seized by Virginia troops. The Nation stood still as if paralyzed by some
                        sudden fright. As soon as she recovered from the shock, she began to
                        concentrate forces in the vicinity of Chambersburg in order to guard that
                        avenue to the Capitol of this State. The Seventh, Eighth and Tenth regiments
                        of three months Pennsylvania Volunteers were the first to come. Afterward
                        this force was augmented to twenty-five thousand men--all of whom were
                        quartered upon us for weeks, and at a time, too, when our harvests were
                        ripening for the sickle. Spreading as their encampments did, over the most
                        fertile portion of our lands, it is not difficult to conceive how great must
                        have been the injury done. Our people did not complain of this however, but
                        were only too glad to have them come among us for our security and better
                        safety. This is the history of the Summer of 1861--briefly told.</p>

                    <p>Again in the fall of 1862 were large bodies of our own troops quartered upon
                        us. Hagerstown, and all the adjacent territory lying as far North as the
                        Pennsylvania and Maryland line was in the occupancy of Gen. Longstreet's
                        corps. Our whole State was in imminent danger of invasion. The necessity was
                        great and men were crowded to the front. They came without tents and but
                        scantily rationed. Our people threw open their houses and larders in order
                        that they might be properly subsisted and made comfortable. Fences were
                        thrown down and the fields of husbandmen again overrun. An unmounted body of
                        cavalry known as the Anderson troop were in need of horses, and our farmers
                        were compelled to throw open their stables in order that they might be
                        supplied to meet the then pressing exigencies of the service. Few, if any,
                        of these horses were ever returned and none of them ever paid for. All these
                        and still greater losses my people were called upon to endure, and even yet
                        they did not complain. Injuries sustained at the hands of our own troops
                        would have been cheerfully borne. Had this been all, they would not be here
                            to-day asking indemnification. But sir they
                        were to be overrun with another class of soldiery. The enemy were lying in
                        wait upon our borders ready to effect their first invasion of Northern soil.
                        They soon came. In October, 1862, we saw the first of them in the presence
                        of Gen. Stuart's cavalry corps. This very considerable body swept over
                        portions of the counties of Franklin and Adams, destroying much property and
                        leading away all the horses they could lay their hands upon. The losses up
                        to this period constitute the first class and were adjudicated by a Board of
                        Commissioners appointed by the Courts of Dauphin county under the act of the
                        Legislature, approved April 22d, 1863.</p>

                    <p>In the summer of 1863 came the invasions of Lee's whole army. Almost all of
                        the counties of Franklin and Adams, and a very considerable portion of the
                        counties of Cumberland, York, Fulton and Bedford were overrun by this large
                        force. Illy provided for, hungry and almost naked, these men on their
                        departure left little or nothing in the shape of provisions and live stock. After that invasion there was hardly
                        a farmer in my county that did not find himself in a state of feeble
                        helplessness. His stock all gone--his implements of agriculture broken
                        up--his granaries empty and his harvest trodden to the earth--his condition
                        was indeed pitiable in the extreme. It may be, too, and was often the case,
                        that he was nothing more than a tenant of those lands and had all he
                        possessed in the world invested in just such property as was suited to the
                        demands of the enemy. Mr. Speaker, these are not idle stories I am telling
                        you. They are truths. I have not allowed my fancy to paint the picture in
                        deeper colors, than the bare facts would warrant. In truth, sir, I can give
                        you no adequate conception of what the losses by that invasion were. Suffice
                        it to say that in the rural districts they have not even yet recovered from
                        that wholesale devastation of their property and I doubt very much if they
                        ever recover, unless this Legislature magnanimously comes to their
                        assistance.</p>

                    <p>But, Mr. Speaker, the loss by the invasion of Lee's army, was small indeed in
                        comparison with what our people suffered by the subsequent invasion of
                        McCausland. The burning of Chambersburg is the darkest chapter in the
                        history of our sufferings. In one single hour of disaster that beautiful
                        town was laid in ashes. By its destruction two hundred and sixty-six
                        families were robbed of their houses and turned out upon the world in
                        condition little short of pauperism. It would be hard indeed to estimate the
                        actual loss by that conflagration. 537 buildings of various kinds were
                        reduced to ashes. I believe sir I can safely say that a million and a half
                        dollars would not have restored the buildings burned, and as much more would
                        not cover the loss of such personal property as money could replace.</p>

                    <p>Such, Mr. Speaker, is a brief and cursory history of the origin of these
                        claims. Thrice invaded and robbed by the enemy continuously drawn upon by
                        our troops, and living for years in constant apprehension and danger, what
                        estimate would you place upon their losses? Has any member upon this floor
                        the hardihood and courage to say that the amount asked for, together with
                        the $600,000 already received, is too much? Any member who would say it is
                        too much or anything near enough, knows nothing about those losses common to
                        the wake of large armies. Now these things and more we have suffered in
                        addition to what fell to the common lot of all. These misfortunes came upon
                        us while our borders were unprotected by any force of our troops, and while
                        our natural defenders were absent fighting in the trenches of Virginia and
                        Georgia. While the red flames of the invader were licking up our dwellings,
                        they were standing like a wall of fire between portions of that same foe and
                        homes of others. They were forming a part of that grand cordon of defense,
                        which saved the western frontier of our own State, together with the State
                        and National Capitol from the same ruthless hands which were razing our
                        beautiful town to its foundations. We were told by these destroyers of our
                        homes that it was a retaliatory measure--that we were to expiate, the wanton
                        destruction of property by Genl. Hunter's troops in the valley of Virginia.
                        Surely if it was a retaliatory measure, retaliation for crimes committed in
                        the name of the Federal Government by one of its highest officials, and we
                        should not be made to pay the penalty.</p>

                    <p>We paid without complaint our share of taxes for the support of the
                        government, and gave our full quota to the army of the union. As many sons of the border counties sleep to day in the selpulchre
                        of the nation as any other section of the North can boast of. On every
                        battlefield of the war our representatives could be found lying with their
                        feet to the foe and their faces to the sky. It was my fortune to belong to
                            one of the gallant regiments which Franklin
                        county sent out to aid our armies in the West. And sir it is somewhat
                        remarkable that when the stars for the first time at night looked upon the
                        charred and blackened ruins of Chambersburg, they were also glimmering upon
                        the pallid faces of a score of that regiment's best and bravest where they
                        lay cold in death on one of the battlefields of Georgia. I also say it
                        without fear of any imputations of self commendation, that I shared with the
                        gallant men of that regiment in every battle and skirmish in which they were
                        engaged. I know how courageously each man bore himself. I saw many of them
                        die where the battle raged fiercest. I brought home the remains of a
                        company, which had buried forty-nine of its members including its first and
                        second commanders. And sir it is first in party by such titles as these I
                        claim the right this day to plead the cause of those whom my dead comrades
                        left behind them. Full many a Franklin county boy sealed his devotion to his
                        country with his heart's blood. When the cry of the government for men to
                        sustain her imperiled flag was raised, Democrats and Republicans alike
                        rushed to her support. Shoulder to shoulder they kept step to the music of
                        the Union, and side by side they lay in death after the battle was over.
                        There was no politics in their death, just as there had been none in their
                        lives after they once realized their country's great peril. Nor did they ask
                        when they went forth, whether their property and homes would be protected.
                        These were secondary considerations. The only question with them was "does
                        my country need my services?" Many a one of them did not live to know that
                        the home of his wife and children had been mercilessly consumed by the foe.
                        I might speak in this connection of other regiments and other organizations
                        which my county and the other counties of the Border sent
                        forth--organizations equally as gallant and deserving of mention as the one
                        to which I have referred, but the nearness of the hour of adjournment
                        admonishes me to hasten on.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Speaker, I have not adverted to these mournful realities for the purpose
                        of exciting feelings of sympathy, but to show, sir, that my people were not
                        derelict in the performance of their duties to their government. They owed
                        allegiance and they gave it, fully and freely, but failed to receive in turn
                        that protection due them. They fulfilled their share of the great original
                        contract between the government and the people, and now, inasmuch as they
                        suffered great loss by reason of non-protection--their borders having been
                        left open to the foe--they come to you to ask restitution. Will you afford
                        it to them, or will you say to them, as they have been told before, "Go to
                        the General Government. The State has no right to pay these claims. We admit
                        they are just and right, but do not recognize their binding force on the
                        State Government." Now, Mr. Speaker, it is folly for men to argue thus. How
                        are we going to approach the General Government? We can only command the
                        influence and support of a single member of Congress, while the State, if
                        she were to assume the payment of these claims, could instruct her
                        Congressional delegation to demand payment of the General Government. This
                        delegation being a power at Washington could easily secure such payment. I
                        hold this to be the proper method for the State to adopt. I am credibly
                        informed that after Gen. Morgan's raids through the States of Indiana and
                        Ohio, the Legislatures of those States assumed the payment of all damages
                        sustained by their citizens. We have precedents established by the
                        Legislature of this State for the payment of these claims. In 1864 an
                        appropriation of $100,000 was made to the people of Chambersburg, which was
                        barely enough to supply the immediate necessities of her thousands of
                        homeless penniless sufferers. Again in 1866 a further appropriation of
                        $500,000 was made for their relief. This is all they have ever received--all
                        that has ever been returned them by a great and powerful State in lieu of
                        the millions in money and the hundreds of precious lives they gave to that
                        cause so near to their hearts. As a still further precedent, I find by
                        reference to the Auditor General's report for last year, that within the
                        year $11,000 has been paid to citizens of Philadelphia and to various
                        Agricultural Associations throughout the State for damages sustained from
                        the encampment of troops on their premises.</p>

                    <p>The State can pay these claims and then very properly ask the General
                        Government to reimburse her. I will tell you why, and I want gentlemen here
                        to pay strict attention to the fact, because I believe it to be a very
                        strong argument in favor of the State paying the claims, and becoming the
                        owner of them, as against the General Government. Shortly after the nation
                        became involved in her great struggle with treason, Pennsylvania, fearing an
                        invasion of her soil, organized, armed and equipped at an expense to herself
                        of over $3,000,000 a splendid body of men known as the Pennsylvania Reserve
                        Corps, a corps whose gallantry and brilliant deeds on many a hotly contested
                        field, afterwards gained for it the appellation of "The Old Guard" of our
                        armies. This corps was organized expressly for State defense, and had it
                        been placed upon our Southern borders and allowed to remain there, no rebel
                        soldier would ever have cursed Pennsylvania soil with his tread. The quick
                        and steady eye of the Reserve man would have marred him for a bloody grave
                        ere he had even looked upon our pleasant habitations. But, sir, Bull Run and
                        all its long train of fearful disasters to the Union army came. The nation
                        was reduced to one of its severest straits, and the State Government,
                        realizing the great need of the General Government, tendered these troops to
                        her service. The consequence of this was that they were ever after retained
                        in such service. Now, sir, my position is this--having made this loan of
                        thoroughly equipped troops to the Government--troops equipped at our
                        expense, we can with a very fair grace go to her and say "we have
                        adjudicated and paid claims which you should have adjudicated and paid, and
                        we now demand that you reimburse the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for moneys
                        thus paid out. Such a demand coming in such a shape could hardly fail to be
                        recognized.</p>

                    <p>When the war broke out all parties in the commonwealth assumed the ground
                        that the State was in duty bound to protect every
                        citizen within her borders. The motto was that the
                            shield of the State was not only to be a safeguard in Peace, but
                        also in war. On this ground the war loan was created and the Reserve corps
                        brought into existence. Pennsylvania stands between us and the General
                        Government. She is our alma mater and with true
                        filial regard we come to her this day, and laying our heads upon her lap,
                        ask her inasmuch as we have been loyal sons and daughters, to the generous
                        and just--to equalize the great burden which fell upon us while defending
                        the maternal hearthstone against those who sought
                        to invade its sacred precincts. Had that foe crossed yonder river and coming
                        up here laid this Capitol in ashes, think you this Legislature would
                        hesitate long in deciding who should repair the loss? Would they not decide
                        it should be paid out of the common treasury--in other words that your
                        people and mine should contribute the means? We are bound for the losses of
                        the State and when she fails in her duties to us, why should she not be
                        bound for ours. What is the use of having a state government if we are to
                        derive no benefit therefrom--if we are to contribute to its support and take
                        care of ourselves at the same time. No, no, gentlemen the relationship
                        existing between us and the State involves certain reciprocal duties--the
                        plainest of which is protection on the part of the State. Failing in this
                        duty, there is a resulting obligation to make good all losses which her
                        inability or negligence may have occasioned. I have used the word "State,"
                        in this connection, instead of "General Government," because under our
                        double Government, it seems to me this obligation rests more directly with
                        the State. She is our nearest source of protection and it is to her we first
                        fly for relief, and for redress of injuries. She should meditate in our
                        behalf, by assuming the burden which a few of her citzens are now toiling under. I am no lawyer. I have but a
                        slight knowledge of the technicalities of the law, but it does seem to me
                        that these claims, if once paid by the State, would assume the force of law
                        against the General Government.</p>

                    <p>Granting that the liability of the General Government is questionable, and
                        that collection from that source is an experiment yet to be tried, which is
                        in the better condition to try the experiment--the State or the people of
                        the Border Counties? Why, sir, the State. Let her pay these claims and then
                        test the experiment. If she fails she is able to stand it, and it would be
                        but just and right, under such circumstances, that she should stand it. We
                        as individuals, besides being less capable than the State to engage in such
                        work, could not afford to try the experiment and fail. We dare not throw the
                        little we have left after that which has already gone, by incurring the
                        expense of sending Committees to Washington for the purpose of pressing this
                        matter upon the intention of Congress.</p>

                    <p>It is said there is a great amount of money involved in this bill--that it is
                        too much for the State to pay. I submit, Mr. Speaker, whether this be an
                        argument against it, and if it is not rather an argument in favor of it. If
                        it is too much for the State to pay, I ask you gentlemen, is it not too much
                        for my people to lose, constituting as they do a very small proportion of
                        the inhabitants of this great Commonwealth. No, no! Mr. Speaker, that poor paltry subterfuge will not avail the
                        opponents of this bill. It is no argument. Pennsylvania, with her untold
                        millions of wealth and all her vast resources, is fully able to pay these
                        claims. The amount asked for would be but as a drop in the bucket of her
                        great wealth. She would never feel it, while my people would be raised to
                        their feet again and enabled to pursue their business avocations without the
                        hindrance which the want of capital imposes. It is not proposed by this bill
                        to make a heavy draft upon the Treasury immediately. It provides that no
                        more than claims under $100, and the fractional part under that sum of other
                        claims shall be paid in cash. The bulk of these claims is to be paid by
                        certificates of indebtedness, and the revenues of the Border Counties are to
                        be set aside for the payment of interest on, and the ultimate redemption of
                        these certificates. Could anything be fairer? Could anything be more just
                        than the appropriation of our own revenues to the payment of our own losses?
                        The State must either admit her liability for losses incurred in the manner
                        these have been incurred, or she must admit that she has no claim whatever
                        upon these people for revenues. It is contrary to the spirit of our
                        institutions that any people should sustain a government which does not
                        admit their right to claim its protection. Must we go on contributing to the
                        support of the Government, and derive no benefit therefrom? Must we pay our
                        taxes and when war and invasion come provide for our own defense and pay our
                        own losses? This would be too manifestly unjust. Let any Government attempt
                        to carry out a principle of this kind and she will find it as impossible to
                        stand as the spacious temple, when the pillars that support it have been
                        torn away.</p>

                    <p>Again, it is said a large amount of money is being used to secure the passage
                        of this bill. Prominent and influential newspapers in the States have made
                        the charge boldly, that these claims have been parted with by their original
                        owners for mere nominal prices, and that they have drifted into the hands of
                        a few speculators, who are now here organizing a gigantic raid on the
                        Treasury. In answer to these charges, Mr. Speaker, I have this to say. I
                        know of no corrupt means having been used, nor do I know of a single claim
                        having been sold or transferred for a consideration. The delegations from
                        the Border Counties have been here, I do not deny. I know that such
                        delegations have been here in the interest of this bill, and I hold that
                        they have a right to be here. Why sir, I venture to say that within the
                        recollection of the oldest representative on the floor, no important measure
                        of any kind has been up for the action of the Legislature, but what has had
                        its advocates in the shape of committees here. Mr. Speaker, we do not
                        complain of the action of the opponents of the bill so long as they engage
                        in honorable and manly warfare, but we do complain of those who would
                        condemn our cause before it is heard. We complain of those who wilfully
                        misrepresent us, and fling broadcast the charge that we are a set of
                        "thieves and robbers" come here to pillage the Treasury of the people. I
                        confess I can not understand these attacks of the press. What have my people
                        done that they should be made the object of so much sneering abuse and such
                        vile misrepresentations? Is it because when the nation was struggling in the
                        throes of a mighty revolution, they clung by her aide and shared her great
                        peril? Is it because they sent their strong man to guard the homes of
                        others, and left their own open to the ravages of a merciless foe, who came
                        and despoiled them of almost everything? Is it because when bankruptcy and
                        ruin come staring them in the faces they dare to come here and claim what
                        they believe to be just and right? I know no other reasons for such attacks
                        on the part of the newspaper press of the State. Such articles are in
                        strange contrast with stirring appeals which were wont in the dark days of
                        the war to summon our young men from their quiet, peaceful homes to the
                        field of conflict and death. Certainly no fair and honorable newspaper could
                        be guilty of such base ingratitude. As well might its Editor cleave the arm
                        of some faithful friend when raised in his defence, as to utter insulting
                        charges against those who periled their fortunes and their lives in a common
                        cause.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Speaker, I have already spoken longer than I had intended. A word, or two
                        more and I am done. I have tried to do my whole duty to my constituency in
                        reference to this bill. All here will bear me witness that from the earliest
                        hour of the session I have labored constantly in its behalf. I am about to
                        resign its fate into your hands. If I have spoken with more than my usual
                        earnestness to-day--if I have shown some feeling
                        while narrating the history of my people in the dark days of their
                        sufferings and losses, it is because I feel that I am pleading the cause of
                        those who have had great wrongs--"wrongs enough to stir a fever in the blood
                        of age and make the infant sinews strong as steel." I wish I had the ability
                        to make such as plea in behalf of my people as has been made my former
                        representatives from my district on this floor. Could I do this, I know a
                        majority of the House would not leave this Hall without giving this measure
                        their support. I can hardly believe that a majority will do so at any
                        rate--standing as these claims do on the broad foundation of their own
                        intrinsic merit. I wish each one of you could visit Chambersburg, as some of
                        you I know have done within a few months. You could see there such evidences
                        and traces of rebel vandalism, as would convince you of the great extent of
                        the misfortunes of my people. The stagnation of trade in her business
                        marts--the noise of the auctioneer's hammer and the dismantled walls of once
                        bright and pleasant homes, would plead more eloquently and convince more
                        forcibly than words of mine or any other friend of this bill. Vote for the
                        bill, gentlemen, and I do not believe any of you will ever regret it. Vote
                        for it, and if ever in the mutation of time, a common enemy should reach the
                        threshold of your dwelling and lay the home of your family in ashes, my
                        prayer, and the prayer of my people will be, that you shall meet with a just
                        recompense at the hands of the Legislature of your State.</p>

                    <p>Let these claims be paid now. Do not postpone payment any longer. If you do
                        it will soon be too late to do justice. Already are strangers stepping in
                        and usurping the places of those who are unable longer, by reason of
                        financial distress, to retain their homes and conduct their business. I
                        could stand it to see this bill detested, but I tell you my people can not
                        stand it. In the cases of many of them, their all is at stake, and if this
                        relief is denied them, bankruptcy and ruin are inevitable. Let me ask you
                        then in conclusion, gentlemen representatives, these simple questions, are
                        you going to allow this people to be unjustly dealt with? Are you going to
                        allow them to bear this great burden alone, and then expect them to be as
                        loyal to your government in the future as in the past? Are you going to deny
                        them this relief and still continue to collect your tithes of taxes out of
                        the sweat and blood of their faces--out of their broken hearts and dying
                        bodies. Do it if you can, gentlemen; as for myself I shall take no part or
                        lot in such an unjust deed. Here upon this spot, at this hour I shift the
                        responsibility of the defeat of this bill, if such is to be its fate, to
                        your shoulders.</p>
