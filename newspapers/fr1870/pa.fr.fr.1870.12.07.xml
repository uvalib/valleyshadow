                    spoke in "Sunshine, or the Search of a Happy Life." The talk centered on the
                    importance of optimism, happiness, and geniality that he termed the "sunshine of
                    the heart." The paper attributes the small attendance from the lingering effects
                    of Olive Logan's "inspipid twaddle" at the most recent high-profile lecture.</summary>

                <summary>Isaac Snively of Chambersburg died last Tuesday in Greencastle of
                    consumption. He was 29 years old and had been living in Pittsburgh since 1860.
                    He worked as agent for the Adams Express Company and route agent for the Union
                    Express Company. During the war, he served as a soldier in the 126th
                    Pennsylvania Regiment. Three years ago, he made a trip to Europe with Mr.
                    William Bingham, but his health only briefly improved. "While his friend and
                    companion, Mr. Bingham, sleeps under the waves of the North Channel, Snively has
                    been laid to rest in the churchyard of his native village."</summary>

                        showing this, and the increase in each over the population in 1860. The
                        increase in ten years is not as great as it was thought to be. The census of
                        1860 gave us a population of 42,122 the present is 45,383, an increase in
                        ten years of 3,261.</p>

                <summary>The first annual reunion of the regiment will be held on December 13th. A
                    large attendance is expected. "Many of them have since the war wandered to
                    different States of the Union and made new homes and formed new associations,
                    and of these a goodly proportion have promised to make the reunion the occasion
                    of a visit to their old homes. But much the largest number still reside in this
                    and the adjoining counties, and nearly all of them may be expected to be
                    present." The citizens of Chambersburg, who have a warm affection for the
                    regiment, will give the veterans a hospitable welcome. Excusrion tickets will be
                    issued by the Cumberland Valley Railroad.</summary>
