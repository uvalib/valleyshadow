<b>Our Ticket</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository praises the Republican ticket
                    and reports the histories and qualifications of the candidates for office.<br>(Names in announcement:  John Huber,  Jacob Strickler,  John Cressler,  William H. Mackey,  Thad M. Mahon,  I. H. M'Cauley,  W. S. Stenger)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>In our issue of last week we had time barely to mention the ticket which the
                        County Convention put in nomination. The names of those upon whom the choice
                        fell have been canvassed for a week, and we are able to speak, with some
                            confideace of the feeling whith which the nominations have been received by the Republican
                        party in the county.</p>

                    <p>To say that the nominations made for the county offices were received with
                        satisfaction would be short of the truth. There were most decided
                        manifestations of approval at the excellent selections made by the
                        convention. Republicans congratulated each other, and Democrats did not
                        hesitate to say that so good a ticket had not been put in the field by
                        either party for a long time. We do not pretend to say that we have put
                        better men in nomination than ever before, but there were reasons why this
                        convention should make a county ticket which would meet with a more
                        unanimous approval than any other we have had. The delegates represented the
                        people purely, and did not seek to come to the convention in the interest of
                        any particular person or candidate. This has rarely been the case before.
                        Their minds were unbiased and they were prepared to choose the best men. It
                        also gave us a convention composed of first rate men. Indeed we have never
                        seen a county convention which contained such a large proportion of the best
                        Republicans as this one. There were no appeals made by interested candidates
                        to their friends to try and be chosen delegates for the purpose of
                        nominating them to office. There were no candidates. The people were
                        earnestly urged to choose only those for delegates who would make the best
                        ticket and suffer every man to stay at home who wanted to be a delegate.
                        This seems to have been the rule adopted, and the result was a convention
                        composed of superior men.</p>

                    <p>John Huber of Chambersburg was nominated for County Commissioner. He is well
                            know over the whole county. Few men in private
                        life are known so well. As a man he is without enemies and as a Republican
                        without exception. He did not want the nomination but when strongly urged to
                        accept it, the day before the convention met he agreed to do so if it were
                        offered without solicitation. He is regarded by both political parties as an
                        unusually strong man. He will receive the united vote of his party, and many
                        Democrats will support him. They will do so for two reasons. One is the
                        unblemished character of the man for integrity and honesty, and the other is
                        that the people of our county have become disgusted at the outrageous and
                        corrupt management of the Commissioners' office since it is under the
                        control of Democratic Commissioners. Democrats see, as well as Republicans,
                        that in one year their party has been seriously damaged by the notorious
                        corruption and the blundering inefficiency of the present Democratic
                        Commissioners. Judge Huber's election will be guarantee for the faithful
                        performance of the responsible duties belonging to the Commissioners'
                        office.</p>

                    <p>For Director of Poor, the Convention nominated Jacob Strickler, of Guilford.
                        He was not even aware that his name would be used in connection with this
                        nomination, but since he has been chosen he has cheerfully consented to
                        accept it and intend to concern himself actively for the election of the
                        ticket. We believe no better nomination could have been made. Mr. Strickler
                        is a substantial farmer, well known in the county and highly esteemed. If
                        elected, and we have no doubt that he will be, there will be much
                        encouragement to hope that the well founded complaints about the
                        mismanagement of the Poor House will cease.</p>

                    <p>John Cressler, Esq., of Southampton, was nominated for Auditor. Mr.
                        Cressler's business experience qualified him well for this place, and he
                        accepts the nomination, as the others did, not that they care for these
                        offices which bring them neither honor nor profit, but because the interests
                        of the people demand of good men these sacrifices and as good citizens they
                        are bound to obey. The people of the Republican party emphatically made
                        these nominations and not the politicians and the people mean to elect the
                        nominees.</p>

                    <p>For Jury Commissioner, Wm. H. Mackey, Esq., of Fannett, was nominated. This
                        is a position of little trouble and little pay, still it is important to
                        fill it with good men, because the character of the juries drawn depends
                        somewhat upon the men who select them. Mr. Mackey will do this well, as he
                        would perform the duties of a much more responsible place well.</p>

                    <p>Our candidate for Assembly is Thad. M. Mahon, Esq., of Chambersburg. Mr.
                        Mahon and L. H. M'Cauley, Esq., were both mentioned as candidates before the
                        convention for this nomination, but we believe that neither did more than to
                        announce himself and allow the convention to select which ever they saw
                        proper. Mr. Mahon was the choice of a majority of the delegates. He is a
                        young man, a member of the Chambersburg Bar and has always been devoutly
                        devoted to the principles of, and an active member of the Republican party.
                        After his return home at the close of the war, in which he served faithfully
                        and honorably several years and received wounds, he was elected Clerk of the
                        Courts and won much praise for the satisfactory performance of its duties
                        from persons of all parties. He was a candidate for re-nomination at the close of the term and though another
                        soldier disabled by the loss of an arm was nominated, his popularity and
                        great fitness for the office were such that he was within two or three votes
                        of being selected the second time. A significant acknowledgment of his
                        character and ability was made at that time by W. S. Stenger, Esq., editor
                        of the Spirit, in his journal, in the following
                        words:</p>

                    <p>Mr Thaddeus M. Mahon, the incumbent of the office of Clerk of the Courts, is
                        a gentleman who has performed the duties of his office in a way which has
                        won for him the commendation of every member of the Bar. Owing to our close
                        official relations with him, we can speak from personal knowledge of his
                        ability, and we can have no hesitation in saying, in simple justice to him,
                        that we believe that not a single blunder during his whole term of office
                        can be traced to his hands. Always prompt in the execution of the orders of
                        the Court, ever courteous in his demeanor towards the members of the Bar and
                        scrupulously careful of the rights and interests of litigants, he is indeed
                        a model officer. A most egregious blunder did the Convention commit when it
                        set his claims aside.</p>

                    <p>We have no doubt that the same qualities which won for him such praise from
                        his political opponents, when Clerk of the Courts, will bring him similar
                        commendations in the Legislature. If elected he will be a safe and judicious
                            law-maker and his pains-taking, careful habits of business so warmly commended by
                        Mr. Stenger will be invaluable in a body too much given to loose and unwise
                        legislation. We may have more to say of Mr. Mahon during the progress of the
                        campaign.</p>

<b>Democratic Frauds</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository touts the success of Republican
                    financial policies and accuses the Democrats of misrepresenting facts.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>FACTS we are told are stubborn things. And so they are. A thousand impulses
                        may move the thoughts and actions of men, but they are powerless to move
                        them to believe or act contrary to established facts if they can perceive
                        the facts. No matter what our inclinations or prejudices or sympathies or
                        interests may be, we are constrained by the laws of nature to believe what
                        we can see, and to shape our actions by the light we receive from our
                        observations. Nothing that we can think of would so help the Democratic
                        party, would so strengthen its feebleness, and revive hope in the breasts of
                        its leaders as the fact, if it were a fact, that the national debt were
                        growing greater instead of smaller under Republican power. The disaster
                        which such a condition of things would necessarily bring upon the whole
                        country, would be greeted with joy and gladness if it but proved that the
                        Republican party were powerless to rescue the country from the weight of
                        debt piled upon it by the disloyal Democracy. Such is the desperation of the
                        Democracy that, though they fully comprehend how fearful it would be if the
                        government were unable to reduce the debt, as a means of placing the reins
                        of the government in the hands of their party they would contemplate the
                        fact with rejoicing. As it is, with large reductions of the principal of the
                        debt every month, Democratic leaders and journalists do not hesitate to
                        falsify and misrepresent the facts. They do not dare to deny directly the
                        truth of the monthly statements issued from the Treasury Department, but
                        they attempt to throw discredit upon them in a variety of ways. They talk
                        mysteriously about extravagance in the departments of the government and
                        complain about the growing burdens of taxation always striving to cover up
                        and conceal from the observation of the people the facts which prove their
                        statements to be false. They express doubt as to the power of the government
                        ever to extinguish the debt, and insinuate that the Republican party only
                        seeks to deceive the people with the delusion of an ultimate escape from
                        indebtedness and taxation, while it really wishes to continue both as
                        affording it the opportunity of unlimited plunder.</p>

                    <p>But all the time the ugly facts stare them in the face, and would cover them
                        with confusion and shame if brazen effrontery, the accumulation of years of
                        political duplicity and perfidy, had not rendered them insensibly both to
                        shame and conclusion. The fact that the expenses of the government have been
                        greatly reduced under the administration of President Grant meets them which
                        ever way they turn, and confronts them in all their ingeniously devised
                        attempts to deceive the people. The fact that the taxes have been reduced on
                        almost everything since the war, and on many articles abolished altogether
                        is in the knowledge of so many of the people that years of misrepresentation
                        have not deceived them. The fact that collections have been honestly made
                        under the Republican party, and strict economy consulted in all branches of
                        the government, is so fully demonstrated by the increased revenue over the
                        years of Johnson's misrule, and that from a reduced rate of taxation too,
                        and from the monstrous sums monthly paid on the principal of the public
                        debt, that no one is deceived if he wants to know the truth.</p>

                    <p>Yet on all these questions the Democracy deliberately work to build up false
                        impressions in the minds of the people. They play the part of demagogues.
                        They do not admit the facts and go before the people on them; they
                        misrepresent the facts, and ask the people to take their distorted
                        statements as true. The means employed show clearly the end they seek. It is
                        not the good of the country but the success of the Democracy. They care not
                        how the people fare, but they do love to have the machinery of the
                        government that they may have power and abuse it.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to the intelligence and the strong American common sense of the
                        people, all attempts to win success based upon fraud and deceit must fail as
                        it has failed heretofore. The people will not throw away such splendid
                        results as those which the seventeen months of Grant's administration have
                        wrought for an empty and specious theory, however skillfully it may be
                        presented. They can understand what the reduction of the debt by one hundred
                        millions during the first year of Grant's administration means, and they
                        know that that cannot be a corrupt administration which accomplishes such
                        results. They know that the prosperity of the country and the interests of
                        labor and industry are safe in the care of a party which has reduced the
                        debt by sixty-nine millions in the last five months. They know that an
                        average monthly reduction of the debt at the rate of nearly fourteen
                        millions of dollars per month as has been the case for 1870, will in a few
                        years wipe out the debt; and they know further, that there is nothing in the
                        history or experience of the Democratic party to encourage the hope or
                        belief that such brilliant results would be continued a day or a month after
                        they came to power. The wisdom of the people in the past is a sufficient
                        guaranty for the exercise of the same quality in the future.</p>

                        Republicans of the country in making every honorable effort to return him to
                        Congress.</p>

                    <p>We doubt if there was a single delegate in the convention who did not feel
                        that in the short time Mr. Cessna represented this district in Congress he
                        had honestly won the praise and commendation bestowed in the resolution. He
                        has been faithful to the great Republican party and alive to the wants and
                        interests of his constituents, whether they were Republicans or Democrats.
                        Hardworking every one who is acquainted with him knows him to be, and
                        Congress has freely acknowledged his great abilities and admitted his right
                        to be classed among the foremost men in that body.</p>

                    <p>We now ask the Democracy to nominate their best and ablest man as his
                        competitor. We deprecate a one-sided campaign in which Mr. Cessna's
                        opposition can reach no higher dignity than is attained in calling vile
                        names and howling epithets. Mr. Cessna's course in Congress is unmistakable
                        and fearless. If Republican policy and principles are vulnerable then Mr.
                        Cessna is vulnerable. If the Democracy of the Sixteenth District favor a
                        White Mans' party, and are opposed to protecting the labor and industry, and
                        encouraging the manufactures of this country, against the free-traders in
                        Europe, we can assure them that the Republicans are not, and that their
                        candidate for Congress fully represents their sentiments. By all means make
                        the issue plain and unmistakable so that there can be no dodging.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

                    <p>Our Democratic friends held their County Convention in the Court House, on
                        Thursday last, the 4th inst., to nominate a county ticket. Col. B. F. Winger
                        was chosen to preside. Wm. Logue and John C. Tritle were made Vice
                        Presidents, and John Russel and Andrew Burgess Secretaries.</p>

                    <p>The delegates presented their credentials and took their seats in the
                        convention, which then adjourned to one o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

                    <p>After the convention reassembled, Capt. Geo W. Skinner was nominated for
                        Assembly by acclamation.</p>

                    <p>The convention then proceeded to the nomination of a candidate for County
                        Commissioner. Samuel M. Worley, Dr. John Montgomery, N. Frank Need, Jacob
                        Brand and Martin L. Hammond were named. On the second ballot Mr. Worley was
                        nominated, having received 50 votes.</p>

                    <p>The nomination for Director of the Poor followed. Jacob J. Miller, Wm Brand,
                        Jacob Hefflefinger, Solomon Brake, Peter M'Ferren and Peter Brindle were
                        named. On the second ballot Peter M'Ferren of Guilford, received 49 votes
                        and was declared nominated.</p>

                    <p>For Jury Commissioner Elias Patton received 40 votes on the second ballot and
                        was declared nominated.</p>

                    <p>For Auditor John A. Sellers received 45 votes on first ballot and was
                        nominated.</p>

                    <p>The nomination for the county ticket being completed, Col. B. F. Winger, W. S
                        Stenger and John R. Orr were, on motion, chosen Congressional Conferees,
                        without instruction. It is known, however, that Winger and Orr are favorable
                        to the nomination of B. F. Myers, of Bedford for
                        Congress, and though he has not been Stenger's choice, it is probable that
                        he will support his in the conference also.</p>

                    <p>The principal work done the convention drifted into speeches. Our ancient,
                        quaint and venerable friend, Wm M'Lellan, disenterred several very interesting antideluvian fossils and exhibited them to the audience. Being
                        scarcely inferior to Agassiz as a naturalist, he proceeded to construct the
                        coming man, using the fossils to illustrate his remarks and establish his
                        theory. The coming man according to this illustrious 
                            Savan
                         will be of a light olive or copper color, the last condition of his
                        coming having been accomplished when the right of suffrage was secured to
                        the negro.</p>

                    <p>Stenger seized the occasion of the convention to again assure his friends
                        that he was actually the superior of the colored man, appearances to the
                        contrary notwithstanding. He asserted it with great vehemence, and as he had
                        it pretty much his own way in that body he nearly succeeded in convincing
                        some of them.</p>

                    <p>What we think of the ticket nominated, and the resolutions will be matter for
                        future consideration.</p>
