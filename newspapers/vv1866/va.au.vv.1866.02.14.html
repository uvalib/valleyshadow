<b>Admiral Semmes</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper publishes part of a letter in which Confederate Admiral Semmes
                    writes to President Johnson to demand restoration of his rights. He includes a
                    vindication of the South and its actions, asserting that "whatever else may be
                    said of me, I have at least brought no discredit upon the American name and
                    character."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Admiral Semmes has written a bold, manly and eloquent letter to President
                        Johnson, demanding his rights under the parole given by Sherman, at
                        Greensboro, N. C.</p>
                    <p>Frank, fearless and able as is this letter in all its parts, it is the
                        concluding paragraph which will linger longest in the thoughts of most men.
                        Right bravely and worthily does the proud old Admiral, speaking as an
                        American citizen to the Chief Magistrate of the American Republic, say:</p>
                    <p>"We live in times of high party excitement, when men, unfortunately, are but
                        too prone to take counsel of their passions; but passions die, and men die
                        with them, and after death comes history. In the future, Mr. President,
                            when America shall have a history, my record
                        and that of a gallant Southern people will be engrafted upon and become a
                        part of your history, the pages of which you are now acting; and the prayer
                        of this petition is, that you will not permit the honor of the American name
                        to be tarnished by a perfidy on those pages. In this paper I have stood
                        strictly upon legal defenses; but should those barriers be beaten down,
                        conscious of the rectitude of my conduct throughout a checkered and eventful
                        career, when the commerce of half a world was at my mercy, and when the
                        passions of men, North and South, were tossed into a whirlwind by the
                        current of events of the most bloody and terrific war that the human race
                        had ever seen, I shall hope to justify and defend myself against any and all
                        charges affecting the honour and reputation of a man and a soldier. Whatever
                        else may be said of me, I have at least brought no discredit upon the
                        American name and character."</p>

<b>Unknown</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints an excerpt from an article in the Jackson, Mississippi,
                    Standard memorializing the unknown Confederate dead.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The following, which we take from the Jackson (Mississippi) Standard, of the 13th Jan., deserves a place in the
                        standard books for reading for the young--aye, and for the middle aged and
                        the old.</p>
                    <p>In the Vicksburg Herald, of the 11th inst., we
                        find the following couplet said to be an inscription over the grave of a
                        Confederate soldier in Alexandria cemetery:</p>
                    <p>"Unknown," is all the epitaph can tell;<br> If Jesus knew thee, all is well.</p>
                    <p>Those touching and simple lines are suggestive of many sorrowful reflections.
                        They bring up from the mighty past thronging memories of the thousands of
                        noble and ardent soldiers of the South, who went forth with flashing eyes
                        and springing steps in defence of their native land, but who never more will
                        return to gladden the hearts of their kindred. Some of them sealed their
                        devotion to liberty with the blood of their young and gallant hearts.
                        Others, toiling through the scorching rays of summer and shivering in the
                        cold blasts of winter, without food or adequate clothing, yielding to
                        privation and disease, and finally perished on the terrible march, in a land
                        of strangers, with no gentle hand to alleviate the agencies of death.
                        Others, taken captives on the red field of battle, were immured in Northern
                        dungeons, and, like caged eagles, dropped and died.</p>
                    <p>All over this broad Southern land are hundreds and thousands of little mounds
                        of earth, beneath which moulder the remains of our gallant defenders, with
                        no stone or monument to designate the pale sleepers. We know they are
                        soldiers' graves--we know nothing more. Many of the nameless dead were
                        volunteers from other States; and in many cases the very mothers who nursed
                        them in infancy are ignorant of their fate. Perchance, even yet, at many
                        distant homesteads, mothers and fathers and sisters, sustained by illusive
                        hope, peer through the gloom of twilight, trusting that they may hear
                        returning footsteps, destined never more to be heard in the walks of men.
                        The little hillocks which mark the resting place of the "unknown" soldiers
                        of liberty will soon be levelled and obliterated. Over their remains the
                        buzzing multitude will tread. The memory of themselves and their deeds of
                        valor, and their terrible suffering and sacrifices, will fade from all
                        minds, and oblivion will add their names to those of the innumerable
                        multitude of Adam's sons who have thus perished and been forgotten. In the
                        language of the epitaph which heads this article, we reverently say:</p>
                    <p>"If Jesus knew thee, all is well."</p>

                    the Valley. The truth of the matter is, state the editors, that "since the
                    soldiers have been removed from the Valley, peace and quiet have prevailed."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We had the pleasure of meeting two respectable gentlemen from New York, last
                        week, who were here on a visit to see the Country and make investments if
                        possible. They told us that the people North, who wished to settle in the
                        Valley, were deterred from doing so, by reports of the unsettled condition
                        of the Country, and the danger of being killed by "blood-thirsty rebels."
                        They left convinced that these stories were all false--and expect to come
                        back and settle in the Valley. We pronounce all such stories false. Since
                        the soldiers have been removed from the Valley, peace and quiet have
                        prevailed. We want the right sort of immigration and a heap of it. Our
                        people will give to them "an old Virginia welcome," and a glance at the
                        "Land Directory" we publish, will show settlers, from the North, the chances
                        for fortunes, and good homes offered.</p>

                    come, unless our town authorities take steps at once, to remove the last four

                        They raised and taught us all that we know, as carpenters, blacksmiths,
                        stone and brick masons, painters, &amp;c., including working on the
                        farm, driving &amp;c., and were not ashamed or backward in performing
                        this service. And why should it be considered a disgrace to make a living at
                        this business in the South? We make our living out of the people here, and,
                        therefore, we think it our duty to spend our money with those who sustained
                        and took care of us.</p>
                    <p>The United States Government and your State Convention gave us our freedom,
                        and we prefer you to any other to have the money derived from our daily
                        labor for teaching our children. If you all stand back, strangers will come
                        in and take the money from your hands and carry it away to build up their
                        own country. They are not ashamed to make money
                        from any class of men.</p>
