                    article states that cholera had been present along the southern coast all
                    winter, and wants but warm weather to bring it to "every filthy locality in the
                    country." It also lists symptoms and preventatives.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Of the many criticisms passed upon the report of the Reconstruction
                        Committee, that of the New York <emph rend="italic">World</emph> is the most
                        scathing and severe which has yet fallen under our observation. After
                        showing that the whole object in view by the committee is to prevent the
                        possibility of reunion, it remarks:</p>
                    <p>Who is so demented as to suppose that the Southern people will accept of a
                        hollow mockery like this? Representation is what the Southern people demand,
                        and the committee say they may have representatives if they will renounce
                        their right to choose them! if they will allow them to be chosen by the
                        insignificant portion of the Southern people who had no participation in,
                        and gave no countenance to, the rebellion.</p>
                    <p>It is notorious that in some of the States, the citizens answering to this
                        description are so few that there cannot be found among them enough to take
                        the test oath and fill the federal offices. Secretary McCulloch has been
                        obliged to appoint tax collectors, and Postmaster-General Dennison,
                        postmasters who have, as yet, received no pay, because they are unable to
                        swear that they gave no aid to the rebellion. It would be a burlesque on
                        representative government to allow the few Southerners who lent no
                        countenance to the rebellion to choose the members of Congress in their
                        respective districts, and the Presidential Electors in their several States.
                        Who could such members represent? Not the people of their districts; for not
                        one man in a thousand would participate in their election.</p>
                    <p>* * * * *</p>
                    <p>It may be said that the disfranchisement only extends to the year 1870. True;
                        but how can they be any worse off, than they are now by its rejection? What
                        would they gain by its ratification? Why, the insulting mockery of having
                        representatives they are not permitted to choose. You might as well offer an
                        inducement to a separated husband to live with his wife that somebody else
                        should beget his children for him. This is reconstruction with a witness!
                        This comparison does not come up to the absurdity of the proposal; for a man
                        whose children are begotten for him by another may govern as well as support
                        them, while to make the suggested parallel perfect, it should be stipulated
                        that they should govern him.</p>
                    <p>It is not more certain that a self-respecting husband would, in the face of
                        such an offer, prefer that his wife should have no children, than it is that
                        proud and high communities will not deign to accept such bastard
                        representatives. You might as well say to the insulted husband, in the
                        parallel case, that the arrangement we designed to last only until the year
                        1870.</p>
                    <p>This is plain language, but does not state the case too strongly. The
                        Radicals desire to perpetuate their power and get their man in the
                        Presidential chair in 1868, hence their present action.</p>

                <summary>The paper prints an article criticizing the Congressional Reconstruction
                    Committee. They say it prevents reunion, and makes a mockery of democracy by
                    allowing a small minority to do all the voting and office holding in the South.</summary>

                    <p>They fell devoted, but undying;<lb/> The very gale their name seems
                        sighing;<lb/> Their spirits wrap the dusky mountain,<lb/> Their memory
                        sparkles o'er the fountain;<lb/> The meanest rill, the mightiest river,<lb/>
                        Rolls mingling with their fame forever.</p>
                    <p>As we predicted in our last issue the appeal of the Ladies' Cemetery
                        Committee was not in vain; Old Augusta proved that her people were not
                        ungrateful to those who had fallen in her defence. On Wednesday flowers and
                        evergreens began to arrive; the ladies of the Mountain west of us,
                        contributed a car load, which were brought in by Capt. John Woodward.
                        Wednesday night the fair women of Staunton were busy wreathing garlands to
                        deck the graves of our loved ones. The energetic and untiring President, of
                        the Cemetery Committee, had completed the arrangements for the ceremonies of
                        Thursday.</p>
                    <p>The fears that some of the sacred duties of the day, would be interfered with
                        by rain, were most agreeably dispelled, for though the Mountains around us
                        were hung with mourning clouds the sun shone bright overhead. At 10 o'clock
                        the procession was formed at the Lutheran Church, by Chief Marshall, Col.
                        Chas. T. O'Ferrall and his able assistants, Capts. Hotchkiss and J. L. Opie.
                        First came the Stonewall Band, next the Clergy and Press, then the ladies
                        and gentlemen who had kindly volunteered to sing on the occasion; then the
                        surviving soldiers of our Armies, then the ladie citizens and various
                        schools. From the Lutheran Church the procession proceeded to the Methodist
                        Church, the Band playing a funeral dirge and the bells of the various
                        Churches tolling at intervals. Looking back the procession presented a most
                        attractive appearance, and the streets seemed one mass of flowers and
                        evergreens. Arriving at the Methodist Church, the ceremonies were opened
                        with prayer by the Rev. Mr. Busey; and then a Quartette, "Hark the Solemn
                        Bell." Col. James H. Skinner delivered the opening address, replete with
                        that eloquence which he alone can command. Eloquent and able addresses were
                        also delivered by Capt. James Bumgardner, Howe Y. Peyton, Esq., Capt. Powell
                        Harrison and Capt. Bolivar Christian. After each speaker, appropriate songs
                        were sung, in a manner that did credit to the ladies and gentlemen who
                        participated. The speeches were listened to by the immense audience with
                        respectful attention, and the deep interest due to them and the occasion.
                        From the gallery of the Church, the body of it had the appearance of an
                        immense flower garden, with fair women of the county as attendants. At the
                        conclusion of the addresses, the procession was re-formed and marched to the
                        Cemetery. Col. O'Ferrall and his Aids had arranged every thing so admirably
                        that no confusion occurred, and to the solemn music of the band, the same
                        dirge played at the funeral of the immortal Jackson, the graves of our
                        heroes were decked with flowers.</p>
                    <p>We went to the graves of our dead,<lb/> Oh, the sad and mournful way;<lb/>
                        Where we laid them down in their last long sleep,<lb/> That never forgotten
                        day.</p>
                    <p>We wept at the graves of our dead,<lb/> As we knelt on their place of
                        rest;<lb/> For we know, alas! We should meet them no more,<lb/> Till we meet
                        in the home of the blest.</p>
                    <p>We covered the graves of our dead<lb/> With wreaths, and flowers, and
                        tears;<lb/> And we thought how blithely they went to the war,<lb/> And our
                        gloomy sadness and fears.</p>
                    <p>We prayed at the graves of our dead,<lb/> As we bowed 'neath the setting
                        sun;<lb/> "Thou givest, oh Lord, and Thou takest away,<lb/> Thy Holy will be
                        done."</p>
                    <p>We came from the graves of our dead--<lb/> We came to life's toil and
                        care;<lb/> And we ask, oh Lord, for the sake of our dead,<lb/> Thou will
                        help us life's toil to bear.</p>
                    <p>For the sake of these precious dead,<lb/> We will live, and strive, and
                        fight!<lb/> Assured that we will meet them in God's own time,<lb/> In realms
                        of eternal light.</p>
                    <p>Nor were the Federal soldiers lying near them neglected. Every grave was
                        decorated, and feelings of bitterness seemed lost in the presence of the
                        dead.</p>
                    <p>The 10th of May is now consecrated and forever it will be devoted to this
                        solemn service. The notice was too short to reach all of our people, but as
                        short as it was over 3,000 turned out to join in honoring the "unreturning
                        brave." To the Ladies' Cemetery Committee, the friends of the dead owe an
                        eternal debt of gratitude and the celebration on Thursday, was but an
                        earnest of what they and our people intend to do. The stores of the town
                        were all closed, and every one seemed to appreciate the sacredness of the
                        day.</p>
                    <p>We noticed that the graves of our boys from Staunton were most beautifully
                        decorated, especially the monument over the remains of the first glorious
                        martyr in the cause, William E. Woodward. At the gate of the Cemetery a
                        beautiful arch was erected, under which the procession passed.</p>
                    <p>We can not, in our limited space, pretend to do justice to the commemorative
                        services of the day. To fully appreciate them, they must have been witnessed
                        and participated in. The sad and impressive duty has been performed by
                        grateful hearts and willing hands. Our neglected heroes have received the
                        only reward and tribute we can pay them on earth, for one day at least; but
                        all is not done. The ladies have further duties to perform, and the living
                        men must assist them. The work of enclosing and sodding the graves has been
                        commenced, and, by the next anniversary, the Soldiers' Cemetery, by liberal
                        encouragement from all, will be an honor to Old Augusta. Those who did not
                        contribute on Thursday, can do so now. The amount asked is small. Remember
                        the fallen brave and give generously.</p>

                <summary>The paper reports that the Covington and Ohio Railroad has been let to a
                    New York based company who will complete the line in the coming three years.
                    This development will allow the Valley Railroad to be built. The editors
                    encourage the Valley residents to act immediately and invest in the road: "We
                    all know and feel the necessity of having this road built, but many were so
                    terribly devastated by the war, and we are so poor and needy, that all fear to
                    invest in anything, no matter how promising of good." The article seeks to
                    dispel those fears by pointing out the value of Valley farm land. "Look at the
                    facts, farmers of the Valley, and if necessary to gain this great object, pledge
                    your lands to it. You can do this, if every man will do his part, and from a
                    poor and needy people, a few years will see you, as of old, with riches and
                    plenty."</summary>

                    <p>Below we give "that petition" and a list of its signers. It seems a petition
                        similar to the one sworn to by Todd, was also sworn to by Dews, one month
                        later. We believe, with our contemporaries, that many of the signers were
                        fooled into signing the infamous falsehoods contained in the petition, and
                        we forbear further comment, until they have time to place themselves in
                        their true position before our slandered people.</p>

                        breasts spontaneously broke forth on the occasion, and all seemed to be
                        animated by a common impulse, and exalted by the remembrance of common
                        sufferings, sacrifices, toils, and dangers in the fearful ordeal of civil
                        war.</p>
                    <p>Although but two days were allowed for preparation, the ladies of Mt. Jackson
                        and New Market and their vicinities, went to work with a zeal and energy
                        which evinced that their hearts were in the cause, and in a short time more
                        than three hundred beautiful wreaths and crosses tastefully decorated with
                        the rarest and delicately tinted flowers came from beneath their fair hands.
                        Nature bounteously furnished a rich profusion of flowers and evergreens,
                        typical of love and memory, and Providence seemed to smile on the enterprise
                        with delightful weather and a serene sky, which invited the people to
                        participate in the solemn and imposing exercises of the day. The farmer left
                        his plow, the artisan his shop, the merchant his store, and all places of
                        business were closed in honor of the occasion, and the silence and solemnity
                        of the Sabbath seemed to rest on the face of Nature.</p>
                    <p>The 10th day of May is indeed the Sabbath of the South--the Sabbath of
                        patriotism, of gratitude and love--for it is ever consecrated by the sainted
                        piety and precious blood of JACKSON.</p>
                    <p>At two o'clock, P. M., in accordance with previous arrangements, the
                        concourse of people who had come to witness and participate in the
                        ceremonies assembled in the Lutheran Church, in Mt. Jackson, where the
                        following exercises took place:</p>
                    <p>1st, An affecting and earnest prayer was offered up by the Rev. Mr. Sweeny.</p>
                    <p>2d, An appropriate oration was delivered by Capt. M. M. Sibert.</p>
                    <p>After these proceedings a procession was formed under the orders of John C.
                        Smith and Lemuel Rinker, Esqr's., the Marshals of the day, in the following
                        order:</p>
                    <p>1st. The Orators, Ministers and Marshals.</p>
                    <p>2d. The children bearing baskets of flowers.</p>
                    <p>3d. The ladies, bearing wreaths and crosses.</p>
                    <p>4th. The surviving veterans of our army.</p>
                    <p>5th. All other persons.</p>
                    <p>The procession thus formed then marched, during the tolling of the bell, to
                            "<emph rend="italic">Our Soldiers Cemetery</emph>," about a mile
                        distant. Arrived on the ground, "<emph rend="italic">Our Soldiers
                        Cemetery</emph>" was consecrated by Rev. Mr. Snyder with solemn and
                        impressive dedicatory services, after which the ladies silently deposited
                        the fragrant wreaths and crosses upon the hallowed graves of our comrades
                        and brothers, and the children strewed upon them their offerings of flowers.</p>
                    <p>An address was then delivered by the Rev. Mr. Sweeny, and the ceremonies were
                        concluded by Rev. Mr. Snyder in an imposing prayer and benediction.
                        Everything was done in a creditable and acceptable manner, and the whole
                        proceeding passed off without the slightest confusion or disturbance.</p>
                    <p>Too much praise cannot be given to the ladies for this ovation of blended
                        religion, patriotism and love, and those only who were present on the
                        occasion can perfectly appreciate the extent of their labor or their
                        exquisite taste in arranging all the proceedings.</p>
                    <p>The effect of this spontaneous outpouring of gratitude and love will be to
                        tighten the links of the sacred chain which binds the living to the dead, to
                        exalt and intensify the noblest impulses of the soul, and to pour into the
                        bleeding and lacerated hearts of the relatives of the "loved and lost," upon
                        whose graves our fragrant offerings were made, the sweet consolation of
                        condolence and sympathy. W. W. B.</p>

                    Alexandria, the dispatch says; were 'startled by the call of the assessors to
                    furnish the required statements, and are no little surprised that the rations
                    they received in the Confederate Army, are estimated at 40 cents.' And well they

                    <p>The Richmond Examiner says, "They have a Stonewall Band in Staunton," which
                        might give the impression that it was a new concern. The Stonewall Band
                        takes its title from services rendered with the Brigade during the whole
                        war. The members were privates in that command and served faithfully with
                        the wounded on the field, after they were detailed as musicians. They have
                        their parole from Appomattox and the instruments they carried through the
                        war. A more high-toned and gentlemanly set of men cannot be found or more
                        liberal ones to all charitable purposes. When they give you a concert in
                        Richmond you will see they are Lee's veterans and good performers.</p>

                    in 1850." This should be an impetus for investment in the Valley Railroad.</summary>

                    a pro-Johnson meeting in St. Louis in which he stated that England or France
                    "would be proud to accept as equal citizens all men who acted so nobly and
                    gallantly as the Southern people. He says that those nations would be happy to
                    claim as their own, men like Lee and Johnston," and urges the nation to honor
                    the memory of "that illustrious throng of the dead, led by Stonewall Jackson."
                    "Mr. Blair does himself honor by such sentiments," the paper exclaims.</summary>
