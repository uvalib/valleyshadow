<b>The Spirit of the Thing</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This excerpt takes issue with a New York News article that criticized the
                    Southern delegates to the Philadelphia Convention, "accusing them of a want of
                    manliness and of not upholding the Southern character." "We can assure the news
                    that our women are willing to trust the men who fought for them during the war,"

<b>The Situation--Especially the Valley Rail Road</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors apprise readers of the situation in several areas. They are
                    encouraged by President Johnson's speaking tour in the North, hope that peace in
                    Europe will lead to investment in Virginia, and, by pointing out the value of
                    Augusta lands, attempt to convince residents to accept a tax to pay for the
                    Valley Railroad.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Our news, local, and other columns, give our readers a very good idea of the
                        "situation," generally, in this mundane sphere. It is improving, and our
                        people may well be cheerful over the reports of the President's progress
                        through the North and the great West. Next week we will publish the gist of
                        his great speeches, and it is only necessary to say now, that he fully
                        maintains his great constitutional position, and more forcibly than ever,
                        reiterates his determination to stand by the platform of the Philadelphia
                        Convention. It is cheering to notice the dismay of the Radicals at the
                        enthusiastic reception he meets with from the people. It gives us more hope
                        for the future and the right than we have entertained for many a day.</p>
                    <p>From Europe we have news of permanent peace, and that encourages us to
                        believe the reports of the companies that have undertaken to build the
                        Virginia and Kanawha canal and the Covington and Ohio Railroad. They report
                        that with peace in Europe, they can raise the funds to complete these great
                        works, and we believe them. By peace, millions of capital will be thrown
                        into our glorious old State; and with that, willing hands and stout hearts,
                        our future need not be despaired of. A little time, patience and hard work,
                        and we will yet be a free, prosperous, and independent people.</p>
                    <p>But what has all this to do with the great Valley Railroad. Everything, for
                        "now is the accepted time" for our people to strike a blow that will secure
                        to us and our children the untold blessings to be derived from the
                        completion of this great work. How to do it is the question? Some of our
                        people have subscribed liberally, but the great desideratum is the county
                        subscriptions. Looking at the taxes we have to pay, some are scared at the
                        idea of a $200,000 subscription, and they never look at what we are worth as
                        a people. Now for a few facts--and we have always found this the only way to
                        convince a people like ours about anything requiring money.</p>
                    <p>The grand total of the value of real and personal estate in Augusta,
                        including solvent bonds not taxed, and Staunton, is $13,883,868. The
                        assessed value of land for this year is $9,573,883; of personal property, is
                        $1,554,247; value of solvent bonds, not taxed, $1,628,475; value of real and
                        personal property in Staunton, $1,127,263. Now, taking the value of land
                        alone in the county--which we take from the assessor's books--at $9,573,883,
                        the tax to be paid to meet the subscription of $200,000 to the Valley
                        Railroad, (two per cent to be paid on call--$4,000; and 13 per cent. in
                        three years--$26,000; total $30,000;) is $30,000, which is one-third of one
                        per cent for three years, and one-ninth (1-9) of one per cent, or one mill
                        and one-ninth on the dollar for each year.</p>
                    <p>Look at the facts and figures, people of Augusta, and say whether you can pay
                            one mill and one-ninth, each year, on the
                        dollar, for this great road. And by this you realize at least 50 per cent.
                        on the increase of your property in value; you invest in good stock; you
                        raise your county to wealth and independence; you benefit all classes and
                        conditions among you, and your glorious Valley will become, in fact and in
                        truth, the garden spot of the world.</p>
