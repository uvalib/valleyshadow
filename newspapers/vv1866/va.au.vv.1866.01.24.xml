                <head>Times Down in Mississippi--What one of Lee's Veterans Thinks</head>

                    <p>We take the liberty of making some extracts from a private letter from one of
                        the most gallant soldiers of the A. N. Va. His letter is dated Meridian,
                        Miss., Dec. 19th 1865. He arrived there May 20th, "weary, foot sore and
                        disgusted," but like all of Lee's veterans, he went to work. He will excuse
                        us for "putting him in print," for what he says we know to be true, and,
                        some of it, too good to be lost.</p>
                    <p>"I am desirous of moving to Virginia; is there any thing out there by which I
                        could make a living? This country is totally demoralized, the first men in
                        it, ('so-called') have been called, and with truth, cotton thieves. Nearly
                        all have been engaged in that most lucrative trade, cotton stealing, and
                        many who before the war were the poorest of the poor, are now rich, and
                        those who owned lands and negroes in abundance, are now reduced to want.
                        Property has changed hands.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately for me I was too honest and conscientious to steal cotton, and
                        hence am still, as I was before the war, poor, but this will not always be
                        so. We have a garrison of as nice <emph rend="italic">Colored troops</emph>
                        as ever wore the blue uniform, and the talk is they intend to possess
                        themselves of everything in the country, or at least have an equal division
                        about next week, <emph rend="italic">perhaps</emph>; I will get my part
                        then.</p>
                    <p>The importation this fall of "Yankee School Marms," has been "larger than for
                        any season for the last four years." They are real vivandiers, wearing good
                        clothes, and teaching the freed-people how to read and write, &amp;c.
                        Nice clever people they are. They kiss their students too, (thats more than
                        you used to do, out in Scarborough's neighborhood;) and hence, have full
                        school rooms; principally boys from eighteen to sixty years of age. This
                        certainly is a desirable country now. I heard that cotton would sell next
                        fall, for one dollar, at least, per pound, if so, and I still live, I think
                        I'll sear my conscience, and steal a few bales. It is too cheap now, only
                        sells for forty cents to fifty cents in Mobile, and it wont pay to steal and
                        handle it at that price. I heard that you were Editing the "Valley
                        Virginian," if so send me a copy occasionally.</p>
                    <p>P. S. I want to marry. Court some pretty Virginia girl for me, and I'll abide
                        the consequences."</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The following beautiful extract is from a speech delivered by the Hon.
                        Alexander White, in the Alabama State Convention:</p>
                    <p>The Bonnie Blue Flag no longer reflects the light of the morning sunbeam, or
                        kisses with its silken folds the genial breeze of our Southern clime. The
                        hands that waved it along the fiery crest of a hundred battle-fields, and
                        the hearts that, for the love they bore it, so often defied danger and
                        death, no longer rally around it. Another banner waves in triumph over its
                        closed and prostrate folds, but proud memories and glorious recollections
                        cluster around it. Sir, I will refrain. The South needs no eulogy. The
                        faithful record of her achievements will encircle her brow with glory bright
                        and enduring as the diadem that crowns the night of her cloudless skies. The
                        scenes of Marathon and Platae have been re-enacted in the New World without
                        the beneficent results which flow from those battle fields of freedom, and
                        our country lies prostrate at the feet of the conquerer.</p>
                    <p>But dearer to me is she in this hour of her humiliation than was she in the
                        day and hour of her pride and her power. Each blood-stained field, each
                        track of devastation, each new made grave of her sons fallen in her defence,
                        each mutilated form of the Confederate soldier--her widow's tear, her
                        orphan's cry--are but so many cords that bind me to her in the midst of her
                        desolation, and draw my affections closer around my stricken country. When I
                        raise my voice or lift my hand against her, may thunders rive me where I
                        stand. Though I be false in all else, I will be true to her. Though all
                        others may prove faithless, I will be faithful still. And when, in obedience
                        to the great command, "Dust to dust," my heart shall return to that earth
                        from whence it sprung, it shall sink into her bosom with the proud
                        consciousness that it never knew one beat not in unison with the honor, the
                        interests, the glory of my country.</p>

                    <p>The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Whig</emph> in noticing the movement of the
                        Valley people in favor of the Great Valley Railroad, speaks of it as "<emph
                            rend="italic">in the interest of the City</emph> OF BALTIMORE." We
                        imagined that we were working for the Valley and for Virginia, and we cant
                        see the policy of stirring up prejudice against an enterprise, of such vital
                        importance, by making it appear that it is a Baltimore matter entirely. All
                        the Valley asks is a chance to develope her great resources and if
                        Baltimore, a city whose name brings up nothing but the memory of kind and
                        generous acts, is willing to build the road for us, is it asking too much of
                        our brethren in the east to allow Baltimore to do it?</p>
                    <p>The people of the Valley have been, for years, aiding Eastern Virginia in the
                        vain attempt to 'make water run up hill,' <emph rend="italic">i.e.</emph> to
                        concentrate trade in Richmond and Norfolk. We have been devastated by the
                        war and cant afford to amuse ourselves at that game any longer. The leading
                        men of the Va. C. R. R. are in favor of the Valley Railroad, as they see
                        that it will, in the end, benefit their road and Richmond too. We appeal to
                        the East to give us a chance and we warn the Legislature that if the
                        building of this road is defeated, by the stupidity or prejudice of any
                        section, that a question, as to the boundary will arise here, to which,
                        Boreman's little Government will be nothing.</p>
                    <p>The numbers and character of the public meeting held in this town Monday, and
                        its earnest expression in favor of the early completion of the Valley
                        Railroad and the Covington and Ohio Railroad, must convince every one that
                        our people are in earnest about the matter. The proceedings will be found in
                        our paper. Mr. Fultz wanted a resolution introduced to go to Western
                        Virginia, if the East refused us this road, but the sentiment in favor of
                        appealing to the sense of justice and right of our brothers East was so
                        strong, that the resolutions were withdrawn. Loyal to the Old Commonwealth,
                        we ask simple justice from her, and we feel confident that her
                        representatives will give it to us. All we ask is a calm, unprejudiced,
                        discussion of this great enterprise by the Legislature, and we believe it
                        can be proved that the people of the Valley are working for the interest of
                        the whole State--God bless her.</p>

                <summary>The paper takes the editors of the Richmond Whig to task for asserting that
                    the Valley Railroad would benefit Baltimore at Richmond's expense. The Valley
                    Virginian defends the Railroad, and argues that the war left Valley communities
                    too devastated to continue to support attempts to center trade in Richmond and

                    <p>At a Meeting of the people of Augusta County, in their Court House, on the
                        22nd January: Hon. A. H. H. Stuart was appointed Chairman, and R. Mauzy, W.
                        H. H. Lynn and A. M. Garber, Jr., Secretaries.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart explaining that the object of the meeting was to urge the building
                        of Railroads throughout the Valley of Virginia, and the completion of the
                        Central line to the Ohio River, dwelt at length and with great force, upon
                        the advantages to the people of the whole State to be derived from these
                        improvements.</p>
                    <p>Bolivar Christian, Esqr., moved the appointment of a Committee to prepare
                        resolutions to express the purposes of the meeting, and Messrs. Bolivar
                        Christian, H. M. Bell, Hugh W. Sheffey, David Fultz, A. Koiner, J. M. McCue
                        and H. L. Gallaher were appointed.</p>
                    <p>David Fultz and J. B. Watts, Esqrs., addressed the meeting in earnest
                        advocacy of the prompt construction of the proposed Railroads.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Christian from the Committee submitted the following resolutions:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fultz proposed a substitute for the Committee's report.</p>
                    <p>[Owing to the length of the substitute we are compelled to omit it. Ed.
                        Valley Virginian.]</p>
                    <p>The people of Augusta, in sympathy with the people of the whole Valley so
                        long the highway of contending armies, and regarding it as vital to their
                        interest, in order to rebuild their ruined homes and desolated lands, (1st)
                        to introduce foreign capital for want of which we are so utterly crippled,
                        (2d) to induce immigration with the means to purchase our surplus lands and
                        the labor to develope our yet untested resources, and (3d) in order to do
                        this, to construct railroads to connect us with the teeming traffic of the
                        West and North; will introduce from the plaster deposits of the Southwest
                        that fertilizer so necessary to restore the waste of our limestone lands;
                        and Eastward will give to our products the cheapest and speediest access to
                        the markets of our seaboard cities;</p>
                    <p>But while thus inviting capital from abroad we so appreciate the exhaustless
                        value of the resources of our Valley as to hold it but right to require of
                        this capital as a recompense, such terms and conditions of its investment
                        here as will prevent any invidious discrimination against Virginia
                        investments, but will leave our local traffic and trade free to go wherever
                        interest or affection may invite;</p>
                    <p>And remembering thirty years ago when "foreign" capital tempted the Valley
                        with the magnificent proffer of railways throughout all her limits to the
                        Ohio and Tennessee lines, not only without any taxation, but with actually a
                        perpetual bonus to the State Treasury for the privilege, the people of the
                        Valley in a spirit of patriotism postponed their private interest to an
                        appeal from Eastern Virginia--to await for facilities to "better markets in
                        Virginia." We have waited in vain until a generation has passed away, and
                        many of our most enterprising citizens in despair have sought more favored
                        lands--but now that the Virginia treasury and tax-payers are so hopelessly
                        unable to provide us the facilities so indispensable to our
                        resuscitation--we ask, in simple justice, to be permitted to look elsewhere
                        for that aid so needed to drive the genius of despair from the ashes of our
                        desolated homes. Therefore, Resolved:</p>
                    <p>1. That the construction of a railroad under a continuous charter, or by the
                        extension and connection of existing improvements, throughout the Valley of
                        Virginia from Winchester to Salem is of vital importance to the people of
                        the Valley.</p>
                    <p>2. That the development of the resources of the bounteous Valley, is to that
                        extent the development of the resources of Virginia, and we repudiate the
                        policy which opposes all improvements that do not point to the same
                        particular section regardless of the interests of other sections, as a
                        policy which prostrates the energies of the people, dwarfs the resources and
                        in the end retards the development of the whole Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>3. That the right of the people of the Valley to choose their markets is just
                        as incontestable as their right to raise surplus products; and this right
                        should not be sacrificed to the interest of any particular market or
                        locality.</p>
                    <p>4. That it is the duty of the Government to provide its citizens with every
                        facility to market, and when a people are forced to trade with any
                        particular market against their natural interests, it is a tax upon them to
                        the extent of the difference in favor of the other markets, is unjust and
                        oppressive, and should not be tolerated.</p>
                    <p>5. That the completion of the Covington and Ohio Railroad to the Ohio River,
                        is a work of incalculable and indispensable importance to the interests of
                        the whole Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>6. That we claim the right to demand the privilege of having these great
                        improvements promptly undertaken, and completed as they may now be, without
                        cost or charge to the public treasury, and that our Representatives in the
                        General Assembly are hereby requested to use every exertion to secure the
                        construction of those improvements.</p>
                    <p>(N. B.--the 3rd and 4th resolutions are from the substitute of Mr. Fultz.)</p>
                    <p>The substitute was advocated by Mr. Fultz and earnestly opposed by Messrs.
                        Christian, Sheffey and Bell, when the 3rd and 4th resolutions of the
                        substitute were accepted as part of the Committee's report, and Mr. Fultz
                        withdrew the remainder of his substitute.</p>
                    <p>On the motion of T. J. Michie Esq., the meeting adjourned, with a request
                        that its proceedings be published in the papers of the Valley and of
                        Richmond.<lb/> A. H. H. Stuart, Chairman.<lb/> R. Mauzy, W. H. H. Lynn, A.

                <summary>The paper prints the proceedings of a public meeting held in Staunton that
                    advocated the construction of a Valley Railroad. The Committee issued
                    resolutions declaring that the influx of foreign capital and increased trade
                    resulting from a railroad would help pull the Valley out of the wreckage of war.</summary>

                    <p>"I have recently visited the Episcopal Female Institute at Staunton, and am
                        happy to be able to report that our diocesan school is in a flourishing
                        condition for the times. There are sixty young ladies in the school, about
                        one half of whom are boarders. The buildings so far as occupied, have been
                        newly furnished and fitted up in the best of style.</p>
                    <p>One of the distinguishing features of the Institute has been its high
                        character in a <emph rend="italic">social</emph> point of view, both as
                        regards the pupils and the general associations of the school; this
                        character it still sustains, while its religious and educational advantages
                        are two well known to demand even a passing notice."</p>

                        members of the old Stonewall Brigade and its friends, to subscribe enough to
                        raise a "plain monument" over his grave. The surviving members are asked to
                        give $1,50 each, and friends as much as they can. Any contribution to this
                        noble object, sent to this office, will be properly disposed of.</p>

                    <p>The U. S. troops have left the whole Valley. The quiet and peace that reigns
                        now makes our country look like old times. The wisdom of the President's
                        policy can be seen by any "radical" who will take a trip up this way and see
                        how smoothly and quietly everything goes on. We are glad to notice the
                        disappearance of the crowds of negroes from our streets and to learn they
                        are generally going to work by the year.</p>

                        Shenandoah Valley, and were given to the public shortly thereafter, through
                        the columns of the Illustrated News, in Richmond, during the war:</p>
                    <p>Come men, stack arms! pile on the rails--<lb/> Stir up the camp fire
                        bright,<lb/> No matter if the canteen fails,<lb/> We'll make a roaring
                        night.<lb/> Here Shenandoah crawls along,<lb/> Here burly Blue Ridge echoes
                        strong,<lb/> To swell the brigade's rousing song,<lb/> Of "Stonewall
                        jackson's way."</p>
                    <p>We see him now--the old slouched hat,<lb/> Cocked o'er his eye askew--<lb/>
                        The shrewd dry smile--the speech so pat,<lb/> So calm, so blunt, so
                        true.<lb/> The "Blue Light Elder" knows 'em well;<lb/> Says he, "that's
                        Banks, he's fond of shell,<lb/> Lord save his soul! we'll give him--"
                        well<lb/> That's "Stonewall Jackson's way."</p>
                    <p>Silence! ground arms: knell all! caps off!<lb/> Old "Blue Light's" going to
                        pray;<lb/> Strangle the fool that dares to scoff!<lb/> Attention! it's his
                        way!<lb/> Appealing from his native sod,<lb/> "Hear us, Almighty God!<lb/>
                        Lay bare thine arm, stretch forth thy rod,<lb/> Amen!" That's Stonewall
                        Jackson's way.</p>
                    <p>He's in the saddle now! Fall in!<lb/> Steady! The whole brigade!<lb/> Hill's
                        at the ford, cut off; we'll win<lb/> His way out, ball and blade.<lb/> What
                        matter if our shoes are worn?<lb/> What matter if our feet are torn?<lb/>
                        Quick step! we're with him before dawn!<lb/> That's Stonewall Jackson's way!</p>
                    <p>The sun's bright lances rout the mists<lb/> Of morning--and, by George!<lb/>
                        Here's Longstreet, struggling in the lists,<lb/> Hemmed in an ugly
                        gorge.<lb/> Pope and his Yankees, whipped before;<lb/> "Bayonets and grape!"
                        hear Stonewall roar,<lb/> "Charge, Stuart! pay off Ashby's score,<lb/> In
                        Stonewall Jackson's way!"</p>
                    <p>Ah! maiden, wait, and watch, and yearn,<lb/> For news of Stonewall's
                        band!<lb/> Ah! widow, read with eyes that burn--<lb/> That ring upon thy
                        hand!<lb/> Ah! wife, sew on, pray on, hope on!<lb/> Thy life shall not be
                        all forlorn--<lb/> The foe had better ne'er been born.<lb/> That gets in
