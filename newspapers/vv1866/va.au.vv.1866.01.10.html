<b>Letter from General Early</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Virginian reprints a letter by Confederate General Jubal Early
                    recounting the history of the military campaigns of 1864 and 1865. He discusses
                    in particular the battle of the Wilderness and his own Valley campaigns, and
                    stresses the numerical superiority of Union armies. "These statements will serve
                    to give some idea of the disparities existing in other lines," asserts Early. "I
                    now ask which has retired from the contest with more true glory, the heroic band
                    of Confederates who so long withstood the tremendous armies and resources of the
                    United States, or that 'Grand Army of the Union,' which, while being recruited
                    from all the world, was enabled, by 'continuous hammering,' to so exhaust its
                    opponent 'by mere attrition' as to compel a surrender? The world has never
                    witnessed so great a political crime as that committed in the destruction of the
                    Confederate Government by armed force." Early hopes that "on behalf of my
                    down-trodden country" his efforts will prevent "the further injustice of
                    receiving the history of this struggle from the mouths and pens of our enemies,"
                    and asks that all "who were in a condition to know the character of the contest,
                    put in a tangible form to be preserved for the use of the future historian, such
                    facts and materials for that history as are in their knowledge or possession."<br>

<b>Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper comes out in favor of completion of the Valley Railroad. Since
                    the State does not have the resources to finish it, the project should be opened
                    to private investment, the editors argue. They also urge the people of Staunton
                    to hold a public demonstration in support of the plan.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are crises in the history of States as in the lives of individuals;
                        periods when the character of the future perhaps for a century is to be
                        determined by the action of the present. These crises come unbidden, and the
                        responsibilities they bring are not to be put aside. They demand action, and the failure to act is oftentimes as
                        decisive as the contrary course. In these cases opportunities lost are
                        opportunities destroyed. Upon such a time have we fallen in Virginia. Amid
                        the ruins of our former civilization we are to lay the foundations of a new
                        structure. Our people and Legislature are now shaping the destiny of the
                        State, most probably for generations. History will hold them to account for
                        the manner in which they perform their duties.</p>
                    <p>Amid the duties of the present there are none more important than those which
                        tend to the development of our resources, the increase of material wealth.
                        Our public improvements, as a main agent in this matter, should be pushed
                        forward with all energy. The completion of the Canal and our great Central
                        railway line would in ten years transform the State. The trade and travel
                        that would pour from the [unclear] of these, the most direct lines, to the
                        sea board, would build up our cities, and infuse new life into our
                        commercial interests. The state is too much crippled now to finish these
                        works herself, but it is possible to negotiate with capital elsewhere to
                        effect it. No better investment could be made than to give the State's
                        interest in many of her unfinished public works to any parties who would
                        undertake to complete them. Some of our public works offer such inducements
                        for the investment of capital that parties are to be found willing to
                        complete them. Some of our public works offer such inducements for the
                        investment of capital that parties are to be found willing to complete them,
                        if the mere permission to do so be given. This is the case with the great
                        scheme in which our section is specially interested; viz: a Valley Railroad.
                        We are glad to see so much interest manifested, from the Potomac to the
                        Tennessee road on the subject of this improvement. A generation has been
                        frittered away in attempts to harmonize contending interests, and in feeble
                        efforts to do that, which, if it had been done thirty years ago, would
                        to-day have made us five-fold more rich and prosperous than we now are. We
                        hope this is to be the case no longer; that the Valley is no longer to be
                        sacrificed to petty interests of some Eastern Virginia Railroad, or to the
                        effete notions of some driveller in regard to concentrating trade in our own
                        cities. We have now the opportunity of having a road made from Winchester to
                        Salem, of having the magnificent agricultural and mineral resources of the
                        finest portion of the State opened up. We can have from five to ten millions
                        of dollars brought into and distributed in the Valley, in the next three
                        years. All that is needed is to give the Baltimore and Ohio Company the
                        right of way. The charter can be so guarded as to prevent discrimination in
                        favor of Baltimore, and when the road is done three-fourths of this
                        productive region will be from fifty to one hundred miles nearer Richmond,
                        by canal and rail, than to Baltimore. Nothing but a prejudice, proof against
                        intelligence, can see in such a work any danger to Richmond, or to any other
                        interests in Eastern Virginia. Its largest benefits would accrue to those
                        very interests it is supposed to endanger; while to the Valley it would
                        bring speedy resuscitation. The very money that would be spent among us in
                        its construction, would go forward, relieving the pressing necessity that
                        may cripple our energies, and the [unclear] would open a new era in our
                        [unclear] city. We see that the neighboring [unclear]. At Lexington a public
                        meeting is to be held on the subject. This example should be followed here.
                        We should have a mass meeting of such character and numbers as would give an
                        unmistakable indication of public feeling. Let the hands of our Senators and
                        Delegates be strengthened by an expression of sentiment from the people. Let
                        us convince our friends beyond the Ridge that we are in earnest. Could we not have such a meeting at the January
                    Court?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In a conversation I once held with an eminent minister of the church, he made
                        this fine observation: 'We will say nothing of the way in which that sex
                        usually conduct an argument; but the intuitive
                            judgements of women are often more to be relied upon than the
                        conclusions which we reach by an elaborate process of reasoning. No man that
                        has an intelligent wife, or is accustomed to the society of educated women,
                        will dispute this. Times without number you must have known them to decide
                        questions on the instant, and with unerring accuracy, which you have been
                        poring over for hours, perhaps with no other result than to find yourself
                        getting deeper and deeper into the tangled maze of difficulties. It were
                        hardly generous to allege that they achieve these feats less by reasoning
                        than a sort of sagacity which approximates to the sure instincts of the
                        animal races; and yet there seems to be some ground for the remark of a
                        witty French writer: that when a man has toiled, step by step, up a flight
                        of stairs, he will be sure to find a woman at the top; but she will not be
                        able to tell how she got there. How she got there, however, is of little
                        moment. If the conclusions a woman has reached are sound, that is all that
                        concerns us. And that they are very apt to be sound on the practical matters
                        of domestic and secular life, nothing but prudence or self conceit can
                        prevent us from acknowledging. The inference, therefor, is unavoidable, that
                        the man who thinks it beneath his dignity to take counsel with an
                        intelligent wife stands in his own light, and betrays that lack of judgement
                        which he tacitly attributes her.</p>

<b>Jews</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reprints an excerpt calling attention to the intellectual
                    achievements of people of Jewish faith.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>From a long and suggestive article in the Chicago Republican, concerning the Jews, we extract the following:</p>
                    <p>The Jews rise gradually above the average of mankind whenever their immense
                        mental resources and their formidable intensity of purpose are consecrated
                        to religion, to humanity, to liberty, to letters, or art. Then they become
                        prophets, reformers and composers, and the moral and intellectual and
                        artistic teachers of the world, producing Mendelsohns, Spinizas, Reanders,
                        Bernes, Heines, Rachels and Meyerbeers. Among the German political reformers
                        of the present day there are a great number of young men of Jewish
                        parentage, who are the most ardent champions of liberty. France possesses in
                        Cremieux, the Jew, one of her most unflinching Republicans. And so there are
                        in every country Jews who show that as soon as they devote their great power
                        to some ennobling purpose they exact as much in the higher walks of thought
                        and life as the bulk of their fellow religionaries in the lower.</p>
