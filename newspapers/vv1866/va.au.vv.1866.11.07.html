<b>Advantages of Northern Capitalists</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article argues that study of the North can instruct the South about
                    capital investment and growth, and gives examples.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One of the wonders of this century is the rapid increase of Northern
                        capital--a subject which may afford a study to us in the South, and from
                        which we may learn valuable lessons. Enterprise, ingenuity, and industry,
                        may account for it in part, but there are two circumstances besides which
                        play an important part in producing the result. The first is the innumerable
                        channels of prompt and profitable investment of surplus income. With the
                        opportunity of reinvesting every ninety days, or oftener, and the legal rate
                        of interest being seven per cent., we can readily see how a young man, with
                        a start of $10,000 may, without any other business, become possessed at the
                        age of seventy of one-third of a million. The difference between investing
                        the original capital at seven per cent. every ninety days, and investing it
                        at six per cent. every year, is amazing. Hence we see how it is, the joint
                        stock companies of New York have become possessed of such enormous wealth.
                        In the case of a company with fifteen millions, the difference is upwards of
                        two hundred thousand dollars per annum. Need we wonder at the princely
                        dividends made by these chartered establishments, and the fact that the
                        stock of companies managed in this way is never seen at the stock boards and
                        never quoted on the bulletins. They are too valuable to be seen in market.
                        They descend in families like the crowned jewels in a royal household.</p>
                    <p>The second circumstance is the rapid and incredible increase of property
                        values in a city rapidly extending its business limits. Examples are not
                        rare in which a piece of property in New York has changed hands several
                        times in the course of a few years, giving to each owner a handsome sum from
                        the increase of its value in market. Thus a successful merchant, who owns
                        his business stand, after making a fortune in business, finds he has a
                        princely income from the immense increase in the value of his property.</p>
                    <p>Here, again, we see how the mammoth joint stock companies of New York, as
                        well as her wealthy merchants and other capitalists, have amassed such
                        enormous wealth. By the exercise of sound judgement in the purchase of real
                        estate, it often quadruples itself in a few years, and lays the foundation
                        of fortunes almost beyond our comprehension.</p>
                    <p>We are starting afresh in the pursuit of wealth. What use we may make of
                        these institutions--how we may ultimately avail ourselves and our families
                        of some of these dividends--and what lessons we may learn from this method
                        of managing capital, may well be asked by the anxious minds of our perplexed
                        people at this time.</p>

<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article summarizes current political developments. The editors comment
                    on controversy in Maryland over appointment of police commissioners, the
                    treatment of the imprisoned Jefferson Davis, and international affairs.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The situation is in such a muddled and mixed-up condition that we forbear
                        comment, until further developments, and only give facts as they reach us up
                        to going to press.</p>
                    <p>The Baltimore trouble can be summed up in a few words. Gov. Swann, under the
                        law of Maryland, appointed new Police Commissioners, and the old ones had
                        them put in jail. Gen. Grant, acting for Gov. Swann, on the 5th, was trying
                        to compromise matters, but the Radicals are playing the game boldly.
                        Yesterday's elections will show who will succeed. In the meantime the South
                        can only wait, watch and work.</p>
                    <p>Jefferson Davis has had his parole extended and his guards withdrawn. This
                        boon is granted when his is barely able to enjoy it, from the effects of his
                        brutal imprisonment, but we should be thankful for even such "small
                        favors"--and pray for his release before he dies.</p>
                    <p>The Conservatives have some hopes of carrying New York and have made a good
                        fight, but it is best not to be hopeful. We must rely on ourselves. General
                        markets are unchanged. News from Europe foreshadows another war. Gold in New
                        York 147 1/2. The South is quiet.</p>
                    <p>Since writing the above, we find the following important news in the
                        Baltimore Evening Transcript of the 5th inst.</p>
                    <p>A compromise has been effected by which all the old Judges are dismissed and
                        two Radicals and one Conservative Judge, each to be worth $10,000 real
                        estate, sufficient to assure an honest discharge of their duties, are
                        appointed in such precinct.</p>
                    <p>They are also to be appointed one Conservative and one Radical clerk in each
                        precinct.</p>
                    <p>By this means a Conservative triumph is assured.</p>

                    <p>The demand of the extremists of the Radical party--that the Southern people
                        shall manifest no sorrow for their own dead--is one of the most
                        extraordinary that the maddest fanaticism ever made. If the people of the
                        South weep over the remains of their own flesh and blood, if they contribute
                        their humble means and efforts to afford them the rites of decent sepulture,
                        they are denounced as deficient in loyalty and traitors to their country!
                        Was ever such extravagance of tyranny heard of? Can they suppose it possible
                        that human nature in the South is so different from human nature in the
                        North and human nature everywhere else, that it can look with composure upon
                        the graves of kindred and friends and treat them with a neglect and
                        indifference unknown to barbarians? What would they make of the Southern
                        people, but the vilest hypocrites on the face of the earth, when they would
                        compel them to shed no tears over the memory of their dead sons and
                        brothers? Would such people be worth reconstructing? Would any decent despot
                        have such recreants to humanity for his slaves?</p>

                    <p>We find the following in the Clarke Journal, of the 2nd inst., from a lady
                        correspondent. She says:</p>
                    <p>"I have been so struck in perusing your paper, with its staunch loyalty and
                        devotion to our old State, that I am tempted to enclose you this testimonial
                        to its brave sons, all the more valuable from being wrested from your
                        enemies during the times (Oh)! too surely gone,) when daily they were made
                        to feel the might of Virginia's sons could wield in the cause of right. The
                        Valley, Jackson's Valley, certainly deserves these praises most; it is the
                        desire to see them in a Valley paper that has prompted me to enclose them to

                    <p>THE VIRGINIAN--The Washington Republican thus praises the Virginian. It says:
                        "If there has been any decadence of the manly virtues in the Old Dominion,
                        it is not because the present generation has proved itself either weak or
                        cowardly, or unequal to the greatest emergencies. No people, with so few
                        numbers, ever put into the field, and kept there so long, troops more
                        numerous or more efficient, or produced generals of more merit, in all the
                        kinds and grades of military talent. It is not worn-out and effete race
                        which has produced Lee, Johnson, Jackson, Ashby, and Stuart. It is not worn
                        out and effete race which, for eighteen months, has defended its capital
                        against the approach of an enemy close upon their borders, and outnumbering
                        them thirty to one. It is not worn-out and effete race which has preserved
                        substantial popular unity under all the strain and pressure and sacrifices
                        of this unprecedented war. "Let history," as was said of another race,
                        "which records their unhappy fate as a people, do justice to their rude
                        virtues as men." They are fighting madly in a bad cause, but they are
                        fighting bravely. They have few cowards and no
                        traitors. The hardships of war are endured without a murmur by all
                        classes, and the dangers of war without flinching, by the newest conscripts,
                        while their gentry, the offshoot of their peculiar social system, have
                        thrown themselves into camp and field with all the dash and high spirit of
                        the European noblese of the middle ages, risking, without apparent concern,
                        upon a desperate adventure, all that men value, and after a generation of
                        peace and repose, and security, which had not emasculated them, presenting
                        to their enemies a trained and intrepid front, as of men born and bred to

                    Council to be put back into the hands of Chief of Police for collection." A
                    committee consisting of Mayor, Recorder and Clerk was appointed to "report an
                    ordinance which will provide for the sale of real estate for taxes." A petition
                    from Jedediah Hotchkiss asking for water privileges for his lots on Stuart's
                    Hill was discussed. A petition from M. P. Funkhouser and others requesting two
                    additional lamp-posts on the west end of town was also discussed. Messrs. Peck,
                    Evans and Bickle were appointed to list the people who receive town charity, and
                    report on the amount of money spent. George E. Bunch, Overseer of the Poor,
                    presented a report. A petition of Pike Powers requesting that a hydrant be put
                    up and a pipe leak repaired free of charge was also discussed. The Water
                    Committee presented the report of the Superintendent of the Water Works. The
                    Clerk served a copy of a resolution, in regard to paupers, upon R. H. Fisher,
                    one of the Overseers of the Poor. An ordinance was passed forbidding the
                    election of any member of the Council to a position to which pay is attached.
                    The Fire Co. reported on an engine and hose received, which the Chief of Police
                    directed to be sold. The Treasurer was directed not to issue a check to any
                    delinquent tax-payer. The Water Committee returned accounts for work done
                    amounting to $75.10 for the month of October. An ordinance was passed requiring
                    the Superintendent of the Water Works to collect pay for work done or cut off
                    the water if not paid. A fine of $5 to $20 for turning on water before paid was
                    established. The Superintendent of Water Works was directed to procure rope and
                    repair the town clock. The Chief of Police was directed to enforce the market
                    ordinance in regard to the meat market. C. H. Saupe was relieved from having to
                    pay his barber license for inability to pay. The editors lament that "not a
                    word" was spoken "about the most important question to our people--the
                    cleanliness and health of the town."<br>(Names in announcement: Mayor  Trout,  B. F. Points,  Jedediah Hotchkiss,  M. P. Funkhouser,   Peck,   Evans,   Bickle,  George E. Bunch,  Pike Powers,  R. H. Fisher,  C. H. Saupe)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At a meeting of the Ladies' Memorial Association of the county of Montgomery,
                        at the White Sulphur Springs, on the 16th of August, where the people had
                        assembled to restore and decorate the graves of the Confederate soldiers who
                        died at the hospital at that place, during the war, Col. William Munford
                        delivered the following verses:</p>
                    <p>As o'er the past the widowed mother weeps,<br> And at the desolated
                        hearthstone keeps<br> Her lonely vigils;--when December's<br> Breath
                        lights up the dying embers,<br> Who is it then most dearly she
                        remembers,<br> All back among the graves, through all her grief<br> The
                        spirit wanders, seeking some relief?</p>
                    <p>Is it the stout and buoyant-hearted boy,<br> Who grasped Life's flashing
                        blade with eager joy,<br> And onward pressed with right good will,<br> And
                        on, and upward sped, until<br> He flung his banner out on some proud
                        hill;<br> Does he come back in all his buried splendor,<br> To fill her
                        heart with thoughts most dearly tender?</p>
                    <p>Or rather he, the feeble one, who burned<br> To mount as high, and for the
                        struggle yearned,<br> But faint and weak,--not all her care<br> Could keep
                        that eager spirit there,<br> That mounted far beyond the reach of
                        prayer;<br> Does he not rather come through all those years,<br> To loose
                        the sacred fountain of her tears?</p>
                    <p>'Tis thus Virginia, at her spoiled hearth,<br> Remembers these,--with all her buried worth.<br> Forbidden yet by Power's
                        lust<br> To recognize their sacred dust,<br> Devoted daughters have
                        assumed the trust,<br> Until the grand old mother, freed of bonds,<br>
                        Shall come to write her love in stone or bronze.</p>
                    <p>Then here to-day, in view of all that band<br> Of southern martyrs, in the
                        spirit land:<br> These starry clusters, we may see<br> Now circling o'er
                        us, born to be<br> A shining system round the sun-like sea!<br> We come to
                        bow before these nameless ones,<br> Who died so well--so far from all the
                        guns.</p>
                    <p>Ah yes! 'tis these who would have died for Right,<br> As grandly as the
                        foremost in the fight,<br> But fainted by the way. 'Tis these<br> Who
                        fought that other King, Disease;<br> We come to honor on our bended
                        knees,<br> With all our holy women standing near,<br> To bless each lowly
                        one with many a tear.</p>
                    <p>And while they weep among those lonely graves,<br> We dare proclaim as loyal
                        men--not slaves!<br> Nor power, nor force, nor human laws<br> Can bind our
                        people with a clause,<br> That "traitors" make of martyrs in our
                        cause.<br> For though they sleep beneath a nameless sod,<br> They're
                        patriot heroes in the sight of God.</p>
