<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors report a feeling of despair across the South as a result of the
                    likely triumph of the Radical Republicans and their policies. The possibility of
                    a "civil war North, and a servile war South" is hurting business. The paper
                    urges citizens to hold out hope, develop southern resources, and "manage the
                    freedmen," and all will be well.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Recent events in the political world, and more especially the success of the
                        Radicals in Maine and Vermont, have cast a gloom over our people and caused
                        a feeling of doubt and uncertainty about the future, such as was never
                        experienced before, even in the darkest hours of the late war. Men anxiously
                        ask each other "What of the times?" and the answer is invariably desponding.</p>
                    <p>Many feel that the Radical Jacobins of the North will carry the day, and that
                        even the great mind of Andrew Johnson will not be able to resist the
                        pressure that will then be brought against him. This feeling affects and
                        permeates through every transaction of a business character in the South.
                        Sober-sided bank officers, in solemn council, after reviewing their
                        correspondence from all parts of the country decide that, financially,
                        business must be conducted in a view of a "civil war North and a servile war
                        South." Old men talk about it, and mothers clasp their children closer to
                        their hearts as they think of the future. Veterans of four years bloody work
                        look to the future with no pleasant thoughts, and ask, "Is it for this we
                        surrendered?--is this the return for a faithful discharge of all the
                        humiliating conditions put upon us?--is there to be no end to these petty
                        tyrannies, and is our confidence in the pledged word of Gen. Grant and the
                        amnesty of Andrew Johnson to be rewarded by the extermination, confiscation,
                        or worse still, the rule of the vile crew, called "loyal men of the South?"
                        Business is deranged by this feeling and the condition of affairs in the
                        extreme South is reported worse.</p>
                    <p>All this is bad, but there is something to hope for yet. Like the man at the
                        bottom of the well, any change must be for the better for us. It would be
                        well for our people to look hopefully to the future and never despond. When
                        the worse comes, we can meet it like men, but there is no sense in
                        anticipating troubles. If we are true to ourselves; if we are the men
                        history shows us to have been in the past, we certainly have a future before
                        us that is not all dark. The Radical Jacobins must run their course. Andrew
                        Johnson and the Conservative North may be overwhelmed; another war may be
                        inaugurated North, but for us there is one plain duty, and that is to be
                        cheerful, to work hard, to manage the freedmen so that they will be our
                        friends; to fully develope every resource of our glorious country; to raise
                        up our children so that they will excel in every business, and especially in
                        the mechanic arts--and, come what may, in a few years, we can defy the
                        Radicals, the devil, and all his imps.</p>

<b>What has the War Settled?</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial asserts that the war did not settle any principles, it only
                    confirmed the strength of overwhelming numbers. Reconstruction, on the other

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Abraham Lincoln, in one of his speeches, delivered on his route from
                        Springfield to Washington city, said, in substance that a civil war would
                        settle no principle; that after blood had been shed and lives sacrificed,
                        the same principles would still exist. Did the war settle any principle? We think not. It simply confirmed what
                        every body knew, that five men were stronger than one. It affirmed
                        Napoleon's declaration that Providence was on the side of the strongest
                        army. It has developed the fact, says the Register, that this government cannot exist, as a
                        Republic, unless it is administered upon the doctrine of the reserved rights
                        of the States--or the sovereignty of the States--and the restricted powers
                        of the Federal Government--departing from this cardinal idea, it must either
                        run into a military despotism or wild anarchy. It has exposed the purposes and natural tendency of the Radical party,
                        and proven to the world that the true supporters of the essential principles of the Federal Constitution, were those
                        who sympathized with and participated in the struggle of the South; or, if
                        more acceptable, those who approved the principle of the Democratic party.
                        It is compelling history to repeat itself. It is fighting the battles of the
                        Colonies over again. It is Andrew Johnson leading the column of
                        Constitutional Freedom against the power of Radical Tyranny, as George
                        Washington and the Colonists resisted the oppression, outrage and despotism
                        of King George the Third. It has established the conclusion that Radicalism
                        must be crushed and the Constitution vindicated, or this Republican
                        Government, springing from the people, and designed for the good of the
                        people, must go down in a furious sea of blood, never again to be vitalized,
                        strangling in its dying throes the hopes of Freedom throughout the Christian
                        world.</p>

<b>Danger to the Republic</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article argues that Reconstruction threatens to undermine the American

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Some of the most sober and reflecting minds of our country, says the Transcript, are settling down into the mournful
                        conviction that our Republican experiment is a failure, and that the United
                        States, like all the other free governments of history, will end up at last
                        in a monarchy. Up to a comparatively recent period, little significance was
                        attached by the unthinking to the following solemn words of Washington's
                        Farewell Address, but read by the portentous lights which are now blazing
                        around us, their almost prophetic tone must impress every mind.</p>
                    <p>"I have already intimated to you," says the Father of his country, in his
                        last words to the American people, "the danger of parties in the State with
                        particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discrimination.
                        Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you, in the most solemn
                        manner, against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.</p>
                    <p>"This spirit, unfortunately, is irrepressible from our nature, having its
                        root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different
                        shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled or repressed;
                        but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness, and is
                        truly their worst enemy.</p>
                    <p>"The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the
                        spirit of revenge, natural to party dissensions, which, in different ages
                        and countries, has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a
                        frightful despotism. But this leads, at length, to a
                            more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which
                            result, gradually incline the mind of men to such security and repose in
                            the absolute powers of an individual; and sooner or later, the chief of
                            some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his
                            competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own election
                            or the ruins of public liberty."</p>

                    <p>This gentleman has written an able letter to the Richmond Examiner, in answer to the strictures of the press upon his
                        first one. While differing from Mr. Baldwin in his views, we give him credit
                        for his known honesty, and heartily endorse the concluding position. He
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"The progress of the political canvass now going on at the North renders the
                        complete success of the Radicals a result by no means improbable. In such
                        and event the people of the South will have need of all the calm courage and
                        patient endurance that can be opposed to a dominant and overwhelming
                        majority of number and of wealth, bent upon our humiliation and destruction.
                        Against hostile legislation, the Presidential veto, which on several
                        occasions has been so magnanimously interposed for our protection, will no
                        longer prove a barrier, and we must expect and be prepared for every outrage
                        upon our rights and feelings that greed and hate can suggest. There is,
                        however, one wrong which can only be fastened upon us by our own consent.
                        The proposed Constitutional Amendment cannot be adopted if the States and
                        people of the South are true to themselves, and are united and firm in
                        determination, that come what may, they will oppose to this outrage a calm
                        and steady, and persistent negative; and will not consent upon any pretext

                        has, perhaps, more bone and muscle and enterprise than any town of its size
                        in Virginia. In fact, it assumes all the airs of a city, and stands asking
                        tribute and extending protection and thrift to the great Valley of Virginia.
                        The secret of success is community of exertion. While a few in other places

                    is repulsive to the Caucasian, and we know that the vast majority of whites on
                    this coast, of all conditions of life, are desirous to return 'home' as soon as
                    they can," reported the Examiner.<br>

                    <p>We see it stated, says the Rockingham Register of
                        Thursday, that the Rev. D. Stuart, of Staunton, now in England as the agent
                        of Washington College, to secure donations for the Lee Endowment, has
                        procured 60,000 pounds; and also that the agent in France is doing well, and
                        the agent along the Mississippi River has obtained $50,000, with the
                        prospect of a large increase after the cotton crop has been gathered. All
                        this in addition to the $100,000 in hand.</p>
                    <p>It is not generally known that Col. M. G. Harman, of Augusta county, gave the
                        initiatory subscription to this magnificent enterprise. The project of an
                        Endowment originated with Gen. Lee himself. Last fall he addressed a letter
                        to Col. Harman, suggesting that he would be a proper person to commence the
                        work. The succeeding court day, after the receipt of the letter, Col. Harman
                        called a meeting of the citizens of Augusta, and headed the subscription
                        with $1,000. From this the subscription commenced, and although the original
                        idea only contemplated a fund of $100,000, it has reached the large sum of
                        over half million of dollars! and the prospect is
                        that it will, before the close of the year, be swelled to the amount of at
                        least a million of dollars.</p>
                    <p>Col. Harman is entitled to the credit of giving to the proposition of
                        Endowment shape and substance, and to have first suggested the designation
                        of "The Lee Endowment."</p>

<b>County Court--September Term</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper gives the proceedings of the County Court. The Hunting Law,
                    passed by the last legislature, was voted into effect, 19 in favor and 5
                    opposed: "No person shall hunt, shoot, range, fish or fowl on the lands or water
                    courses, without the consent of the owner of said land. The penalty for
                    violating this law is a fine of five dollars; double that amount if committed in
                    the night or on Sunday." Rev. Park P. Flournoy, of the Presbyterian Church, and
