                    <p>Women, as a general rule, are not usefully educated in this country. They are
                        chiefly taught those accomplishments which the experience of their mothers
                        has proven to be best calculated to attract young men, and, consequently, to
                        insure husbands. Music, Dancing, French and Italian, are considered
                        indispensable to the "finish" of any young lady, in these degenerate days,
                        but the more solid qualities which, in the olden time, were esteemed so
                        necessary in the female catalogue of charms in the "good old times," are out
                        of date. In sooth, they are pronounced in elegant society, de trop, and
                        stigmatized as vulgar. The women who, not many years ago, was a
                        nonproficient in the culinary art, and inexpert with her needle, was deemed
                        an unfit candidate for matrimony. If she could not make a rare pie, dish up
                        a meal in a peculiarly attractive style, turn out a superior loaf of bread,
                        knit a pair of stockings with taste, and sew up garments with exemplary
                        celerity, she was shunned by the male sex, and pitied by her own, as sadly
                        defective. But now, tout, cela est change! The woman dextrous in such
                        performances demonstrates her own unfitness for position in the world of
                        fashion. Husbands are supposed to live upon the sound of a piano, and to be
                        ready, in the most distressing moments, to go off into harmonic ecstasies at
                        the first intimation of a brilliant duet. They are presumed to be totally
                        indifferent in respect to what they eat or wear,--to have a noble contempt
                        for such vulgar things as shirt buttons--to contemplate a woman too
                        imaginatively to suspect her culpable of a knowledge of anything but the
                        toilette and belles lettres.</p>
                    <p>With this ideal conception of the character of a husband in their minds,
                        young ladies necessarily aim only at the acquisition of corresponding
                        qualifications. They aim at sentimentality and romance, in stead of common
                        sense, and permanent information! The result is an exuberance of
                        satisfaction during the halcyon days of courtship, and the saccharine hours
                        of the honeymoon; but, when the 'angel of a wife' subsides, in time, into
                        the incapable domestic partner, and the love of a husband degenerates into
                        the satiated master of the house, then comes the season of remorse, of
                        melancholy, of mutual recrimination and mutual animosity. Should fate make
                        such a helpless wife a widow and necessity throw her upon her own resources
                        for the support of herself and family, unhappy indeed must she be in her
                        destitution. Her expensive accomplishments will neither provide bread for
                        her children nor consolation for herself. Music will not silence the cry of
                        hunger; dancing will not exercise the gaunt fiend we call Want. Sorrow
                        refuses to submit to the syren song of an affected mirth. Seldom can one of
                        the wasted talents be turned, in such a dilemma, to available account; and
                        all the precious years invested in the accumulation of those showy nothings,
                        present themselves like so many ghosts of misspent moments, but to chide the
                        past for its extravagance, and fill the future with apprehensions.</p>
                    <p>Who has not seen the instances of just such calamity? Whose experience is not
                        fraught with some such scenes of anguish? And yet, how slight an element of
                        hope would alter the picture--how small a knowledge of the business
                        relations of life--how little an acquaintance of those homely arts which
                        enable the feblest by their industry, spirit, taste, or enterprise
                        remunerative to completely change the view, cheer up the despondent, add a
                        silver lining to the cloud of grief, and produce a vision of comfort, if not
                        of independence! Why not, then, O mothers of America! educate your daughters
                        to a familiarity with things useful as well as ornamental? Why not--oh! why
                        not--make them practical as well as interesting members of society?</p>

                    <p>Is improving for our side and that's all most people care for. The crops have
                        turned out better than anybody expected, much to the disappointment of the
                        "I told you so" people. And there is no danger of starving, but a good
                        prospect for a small surplus ahead in the Fall. We begin to see daylight.
                        Everybody seems encouraged by the crop prospects and nobody, except people
                        who can't help it, ever talk politics. That's a good sign, for it shows that
                        our people have realized the fact that Old Mother Earth is their best friend
                        and out of her, by hard knocks, is to come wealth and all we desire.</p>
                    <p>The call for a National Convention of all the Conservative element of the
                        country, to meet at Philadelphia, is an important feature in "the situation"
                        but, as yet, it has caused no commotion in the South, the general feeling
                        being that it remains for the Conservatives North to do their part and lay
                        down a platform; for they know that if it is Constitutional, and right, we
                        will support it, if we are allowed to. It is a good sign, though, that we
                        are asking to go into such a Convention, even represented by "loyal men."
                        Somebody in the North and West has an "axe to grind;" the tariff question is
                        pinching Western toes and they want Southern votes to defeat the Radicals.
                        Certainly things are working well and we can afford to watch and wait.</p>
                    <p>Looking across the waters "the situation" is getting more and more
                        interesting to lookers on; 1,500,000 men are about to engage in the
                        delightful work of cutting each others throats, and all in a space not
                        larger than the Valley, from Staunton to Harper's Ferry, but as thickly
                        settled as our towns. Long articles are written as to the merits of war; as
                        to who is right and who is wrong, but the only benefit we can see to the
                        South, is that it will give the "Universal Yankee Nation" a new sensation; a
                        new and richer field for speculation and draw their attention from
                        tormenting and robbing our poor people for awhile. The situation over there
                        is decidedly mixed, and the above is all the "sugar" we see in it.</p>
                    <p>That "the situation" in the South is improving is shown in every hand. Our
                        people are working; the negroes are beginning to understand who are their
                        best friends, and are doing well--better than could be expected. The
                        prospect of the cotton and tobacco crops ensure money, in spite of the
                        "infernal revenue," and provisions will be cheap and plenty. The same kind
                        and protecting Providence that watched over us while it dealt so hardly, as
                        we thought, is now helping us in a thousand ways, and in spite of the
                        Radicals; in spite of not being represented now; in spite of taxation, the
                        South is destined to be the controlling element in this Country. The
                        Radicals see it and fear it, and hence their frantic and devilish measures
                        to retain power. A good time is coming; the "situation" is improving; let us
                        all stick together, all work, be patient and not make fools of ourselves,
                        and the game is ours.</p>

                    <p>In another column we publish the appeal of the Democratic members of Congress
                        to the people, to unite in sending delegates to the Convention at
                        Philadelphia. We cannot better express our views than we find them in the
                        Rockingham Register. The South can do no good in the Convention, and might
                        do harm, but if delegates are sent let them organize separately and wait the
                        action of the Northern members of the body. If favorable, go in; if
                        unfavorable, come home. The Register truly says:</p>
                    <p>"The recent call issued from Washington for a Convention to assemble in
                        Philadelphia on the 11th of August next, to be composed of delegates from
                        all the States and Territories of the United States, representing the
                        Conservative sentiment and interests of the country, seems to meet with
                        conflicting favor and disfavor from the Conservative press. While not
                        disposed to be captious, or to throw anything in the way of the inauguration
                        of a movement designed to thwart the Radical party, yet we would be untrue
                        to our convictions did we not express our belief that the policy of the
                        South, in her present anomalous condition, is to remain passive. The
                        position of the seceded States is well known. They are a unit in sentiment
                        in regard to the outrages that are being perpetrated against them. They are
                        heavily taxed by the Federal Government, but are refused representation.
                        Legislation, vitally affecting their best interests, is being enacted,
                        without their having a voice in its discussion. Armies are quartered among
                        them without their consent--in fact, in the face of their protest. They are
                        virtually bound hand and foot, without the power to strike off the manacles.
                        Under such circumstances, we deem that it would be a compromise of that
                        reserved dignity which has characterized the people of the South, for them
                        to be catching at an implied invitation to meet in an irregular body those,
                        many of whom have not only sanctioned, but have been active participants in
                        imposing these wrongs and restrictions. The views and position of the South
                        are well known. Any steps that may be taken, founded upon broad and
                        comprehensive grounds, and contemplating justice to the seceded States and
                        the restoration of the government to its original relations with the States,
                        will find no opposition, but a hearty endorsement in the South. It is for
                        the Democrats and Conservatives of the North to lay down the platform upon
                        which they intend to stand and make battle. If it is catholic and national
                        in its aims, and addresses itself to the people of the South as practical,
                        there will be no doubt or difficulty as to the course they will pursue."</p>

                    <p>At the request of members of the Masonic fraternity, who knew Col. William H.
                        Harman, as we did, but to love him, we publish the following beautiful
                        tribute to his memory, extracted from the address of Dr. Clem R. Harris, of
                        Staunton, delivered before the Eureka Lodge, No. 195 of Ancient Free Masons
                        at Bridgewater, Va., June 24th, 1866.</p>
                    <p>Brethren, Amidst our rejoicings over the unexampled prosperity of our time
                        honored Institution, let us remember that we are all travelling upon the
                        level of time to that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller
                        e'er returns, and that the coffin has lately received the earthly remains of
                        some of our beloved brethren.</p>
                    <p>Among those who have gone from their labors on earth, and who have fallen in
                        defense of State and country, allow me to make mention of our much esteemed
                        and faithful brother, Wm. H. Harman, Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of
                        Virginia. I can proudly say of our brother that a warmer heart never beat in
                        human breast. I knew him from boyhood. Years ago a warm personal friendship
                        commenced between us, which ended only with his life. As men belonging to
                        the public, we were thrown together with many kindred tastes, sentiments and
                        views, and became naturally personally attached to each other. I cannot
                        therefore let this occasion pass without a public tribute to his memory. I
                        can proudly say for the memory of my friend and Brother that, no man ever
                        possessed a more hopeful disposition, or more untiring energy of purpose.
                        His heart was as open as his hand, and I do not believe that a spark of
                        malice ever tenanted his bosom for a moment. He loved Masonry and labored
                        zealously for its promotion. As a husband and father he was more than loved;
                        he was almost adored.</p>
                    <p>He leaves a bereaved widow and children to mourn his loss. May the widow's
                        God and the Father of the fathers, comfort, support and protect them in
                        their great affliction.</p>

                    <p>Dangers threaten. The Constitution--the citadel of our liberties--is directly
                        assailed. The future is dark, unless the people will come to the rescue.</p>
                    <p>In this hour of peril National Union should be the watchword of every true
                        man.</p>
                    <p>As essential to National Union we must maintain unimpaired the rights, the
                        dignity, and the equality of the States, including the right of each State
                        to control its own domestic concerns, subject only to the Constitution of
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>After a uniform construction of the Constitution for more than half a
                        century, the assumption of new and arbitrary powers in the Federal
                        Government is subversive of our system and destructive of liberty.</p>
                    <p>A free interchange of opinion and kind feeling between the citizens of all
                        the States is necessary to the perpetuity of the Union. At present eleven
                        States are excluded from the National Council. For seven long months the
                        present Congress has persistently denied any right of representation to the
                        people of these States. Laws, affecting their highest and dearest interests,
                        have been passed without their consent, and in disregard of the fundamental
                        principle of free government. This denial of representation has been made to
                        all the members from a State, although the State, in the language of the
                        President, "presents itself, not only in an attitude of loyalty and harmony,
                        but in the persons of representatives whose loyalty cannot be questioned
                        under any existing constitutional or legal test." The representatives of
                        nearly one third of the States have not been consulted with reference to the
                        great questions of the day, there has been no nationality surrounding the
                        present Congress. There has been no intercourse between the representatives
                        of the two sections, producing mutual confidence and respect. In the
                        language of the distinguished Lieutenant General, "It is to be regretted
                        that, at this time, there cannot be a greater commingling between the
                        citizens of the two sections, and particularly those entrusted with the law
                        making power." This state of things should be removed at once and forever.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, to preserve the National Union, to vindicate the sufficiency of
                        our admirable Constitution, to guard the States from covert attempts to
                        deprive them of their true position in the Union, and to bring together
                        those who are unnaturally severed, and for these great national purposes
                        only, we cordially approve the call for a National Union Convention, to be
                        held at the city of Philadelphia, on the second Tuesday (14th) of August
                        next, and endorse the principles therein set forth.</p>
                    <p>We, therefore, respectfully, but earnestly, urge upon our fellow-citizens in
                        each State, and Territory, and Congressional district in the United States,
                        in the interest of Union and in a spirit of harmony, and with direct
                        reference to the principles contained in said call, to act promptly in the
                        selection of wise, moderate, and conservative men to represent them in said
                        Convention, to the end that <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the States shall
                        at once be restored to their practical relations to the Union, the
                        Constitution be maintained, and peace bless the whole country.</p>

                    <p>Staunton has more life and more enterprise than any interior town in the
                        State, but it wants many things to make it all it should be. With our narrow
                        streets we need all the room possible, and who ever heard of a city whose
                        streets and pavements are obstructed by store boxes, rotten cellar doors,
                        great stone steps and porches? Let them all be removed and the pavements
                        widened. Then the streets will not be "too narrow for shade trees" and
                        Staunton will be the most beautiful town in the State. Can't the Council
                        look to this matter? It is worthy of investigation, especially the cellar
                        doors.</p>

                <summary>The paper gives the proceedings of the Town Council. Mr. Kayser finalized a
                    contract with Robert Knightly for cleaning out Lewis Creek. The monthly report
                    of R. W. Smith, Superintendent of Water Works, was received. R. W. Smith
                    tendered his resignation at the same time, which was accepted. Mr. Bickle moved
                    for acceptance of the $15 per annum contributed to the Augusta Law Library. On
                    the motion of Mr. Evans, it was ordered that the Clerk of the Council prepare
                    proper forms and Recognizance for the use of the Mayor, Recorder, and Alderman
                    of the town. On motion of Mr. Evans, a $50 tax on land agents was added to the
                    existing code. On motion of Mr. Bickle it was resolved that 3 Council members
                    and 2 citizens be appointed to investigate the possibility of bringing water to
                    Staunton through iron pipes from Gum Spring or other locations to help solve a
                    town water shortage. Kayser, Trout and Bickle were appointed from the Council,
                    and E. M Taylor and James H. Skinner for the citizens. On motion of Mr. Bickle,
                    the Commissioner of Streets was authorized to repair the side walks from the old
                    National Hotel to the west corner of Central Bank and from Valley Bank to Lewis
                    Street, upon the two-fifth and three-fifth principle. On motion of Mr. Hope, the
                    Commissioner of Streets was authorized to purchase plank to enclose the Market
                    House with a fence. On motion of Mr. Evans, the Street Commissioner was
                    authorized to purchase plank to repair the bridges in town. On motion of Mr.
                    Bickle, the Street Commissioner was authorized to have lamp posts repaired so
