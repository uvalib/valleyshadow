                    <p>The position taken by Gen. Tilson, the head of the Freedmen's Bureau in
                        Georgia, "if negroes will not make contracts we will make contracts for
                        them, and what is better, compel them to work," has had a good effect. The
                        freedmen inclined to be idle, finding out that they have got to work any

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The wise man tells us "there is nothing new under the sun." But if there is
                        nothing absolutely new, there are certainly some things remarkably
                        strange--things, we suppose, which are to be seen only once in a life-time.
                        Not a few examples of this sort are exhibited in the events of the day and
                        in the circumstances by which we are surrounded. Let us proceed to enumerate
                        some of them:</p>
                    <p>1. We have waged a sanguinary war for four years to keep the Southern States
                        in the Union; and now that the war is over we proclaim that they are out of
                        the Union and look about for modes of restoration and reconstruction! We
                        have consequently sacrificed three billions of dollars and half a million of
                        human beings for nought!</p>
                    <p>2. We proclaim that we have conquered the South, but, alas, it seems the
                        South has conquered us. They have, at least, achieved their purpose, while ours has failed
                        and miscarried!</p>
                    <p>3. We have proclaimed that the doctrine of secession was false in theory and
                        impossible in practice. But what do we behold? We see this very doctrine
                        fulfilled, accomplished, demonstrated. It is no longer an abstraction, a
                        myth, but an "accomplished fact!"</p>
                    <p>4. We proclaim Tennessee out of the Union, and that she has forfeited all
                        right to representation in the councils of the nation. Yet we behold one of her citizens filling the Executive chair and
                        wielding the sceptre of authority over the entire country!</p>
                    <p>5. We deny the Representative of Tennessee a seat in the Senate. But we
                        behold the same individual domiciled in the White House, and his wife doing
                        the honors of reception to the nation's guests!"</p>
                    <p>6. We profess to love the Union, and pride ourselves upon the sacrifices we
                        have made in its behalf, and yet we throw every obstacle in the way of its
                        complete restoration and permanent establishment!</p>
                    <p>7. We proclaim eleven States out of the Union; and
                        yet when we would amend the Constitution we call upon those very States to say yea or nay, and we count their votes as
                        if they were integral parts and co-equal members of the Confederacy!</p>
                    <p>8. We proclaim the doctrine that taxation without representation is tyranny
                        and despotism, even justifying revolutionary resistance; and yet we practice
                        the very tyranny thus repudiated by imposing taxes upon the people of this
                        District!</p>
                    <p>9. We profess to believe that the majority should rule, and that the will of
                        the people is the supreme law; yet we contradict that belief by forcing
                        negro suffrage upon a people who have unanimously voted against it!</p>
                    <p>10. We profess to be actuated by the great principles of right and justice,
                        in legislating day after day and weak after weak upon a single topic, and
                        yet continually do violence to those principles upon almost every other
                        subject!</p>
                    <p>11. We denounce disunionists as rebels and traitors; and yet we are guilty
                        ourselves of disunionism in rejecting all overtures for a prompt and
                        constitutional reconstruction!</p>
                    <p>12. We proclaim that the elective franchise is an essential right of manhood,
                        black or white, and yet we deny that essential right to foreigners for
                        several years at least!</p>
                    <p>13. We proclaim that the privilege of voting for those who make our laws is
                        essential to self-protection; and yet we deny that privilege to the citizens
                        of this District and to women throughout the entire country.</p>
                    <p>14. We refuse to concede the elective franchise to the negro in the States
                        where it would be a reality, and yet we grant it to him in this District,
                        where it is a farce and a mockery.</p>
                    <p>These are a few of the inconsistencies and contradictions of the day.</p>

<b>"That Petition" Again</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors protest against William J. Dew's petition which calls for the
                    return of Federal troops to Augusta. The paper explains that it was brought
                    because Union men claimed that they were not being afforded fair trial, and that
                    they feared conflict between ex-Confederates and returning Union supporters. The
                    editors assert that this is not the case, and no Union men even tested the
                    court's fairness before petitioning. They oppose any attempt to "saddle upon our
                    people a new batch of officials and soldiers, without a fair hearing from all
                    parties."<br>(Names in announcement:  William J. Dews)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Wm. J. Dews, in a communication to this paper acknowledges the correctness of
                        our assertion as to his assuming all the responsibility for getting up "that
                        petition." Who ever the so-called "unreconstructed" gentlemen, alluded to by
                        Dews, is it remains for him to answer what is said. President Johnson says
                        we are all "reconstructed" and back in the United States--but great men will
                        differ! We are authorized to state upon the authority of Mr. Dews and of a
                        soldier of the U. S. A. who is circulating the petition, that it amounts to
                        this: The "so-called" unconditional Union men, thinking they could not get
                        their rights in our civil courts, on account of the supposed prejudice
                        against them, petition Congress to transfer their cases to another tribunal,
                        Military of the Freedmen's Court. They also petition that enough U. S.
                        soldiers be sent here to enforce a summons and keep down disturbances they
                        fear will arise between refugee Union men and Confederate soldiers.</p>
                    <p>The petition was not shown to us, Mr. Dews saying other Union men objected to
                        it, but he assured us the above was the substance.</p>
                    <p>Assuming that "that petition" amounts to this much we would like to know why
                        some one of their unconditional and persecuted Union men have not brought a
                        case before our civil courts and tested the matter? Why is this petition
                        sprung upon us, when no effort has been made to have a trial before a civil
                        court? We protest against this petition and demand that our civil courts be
                        applied to before we are inflicted with a new tribunal, which must
                        necessarily be opposed to our people. If the men who have, or may sign it,
                        are honest in their desire to promote harmony and good will let them come
                        out and appeal to the civil authority and let us have no more of these
                        endeavors to saddle upon our people a new batch of officials and soldiers,
                        without a fair hearing from all parties. "That petition" amounts to very
                        little and we have already devoted too much space to it. It can amount to
                        nothing more than has already been done, and we simply notice it to let the
                        people see what is going on.</p>

<b>The Freedmen's Bureau Bill</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper comes out against the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, and lists reasons
                    why it should be considered unconstitutional.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The new Freedmen's Bureau Bill meets with opposition every where out of
                        Congress. The President is opposed to it and all conservative men North, as
                        well as the entire people of the South. We suppose it will become law and we
                        cannot better express our views about it than Mr. Davis, of Ky., does in his
                        speech in the U. S. Senate against it. It is well to note here that the bill
                        does not apply to the North. Poor whites and negroes there are not included
                        in this grand scheme for the "benefit of the human race."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Davis, of Ky., said in opposition to the bill, that he objected to it
                        because the majority of the Senate excluded the Senators from 11 States from
                        their seats in the Senate for the purpose of securing the passage of this
                        and other measures; because the measure was unconstitutional in proposing to
                        invest the Freedmen's Bureau with judicial power; because it authorized the
                        President to assign to any army officer the exercise of judicial power;
                        because it broke down the partition of the power of the Government made by
                        the Constitution; because it deprived the citizen of the right of trial by
                        jury in civil courts; because it was a scheme devised to practice injustice
                        and oppression upon the white people of the late slave States for the
                        benefit of the freed negroes, and to engender strife between the two races;
                        because it involved a profligate, wasteful, and unnecessary expenditure of
                        public treasure, and because it was one of the reckless and unconstitutional
                        series of measures devised by the radical party to enable it to hold power
                        and place.</p>

                    <p>
                        To the Editor of the "Valley Virginian."
                    </p>
                    <p>I acknowledge the correctness of your assertion in regard to my assuming all
                        the responsibility of getting up "that Petition." It can scarcely be
                        regarded as being of a very mysterious character,
                        inasmuch as it has been exhibited to many, who were supposed to be desirous
                        of signing it. Besides a gentleman of the "unreconstructed" persuasion
                        approached me with the alleged intention of signing it in company with a
                        Union man. Said "unreconstructed," after seeing it, fled, "while no man
                        pursued," as the Devil is presumed to flee from holy water; which fact of
                        itself should be taken as an indication of the just and correct character of
                        "that Petition." In the meantime should the spectre of "that petition"
                        disturb the slumbers of any person, it is advised that such person take
                        small doses of "Mrs. Wilson's Soothing Syrup," or diluted Chloroform,
                        besides bathing their feet in warm water, adding half tea-cup full of pure
                        Mustard, "well shaken before taken." A blister might also be applied to the
                        nape of the neck, with a Confederate note attached, with the view of drawing from the brain any false impressions, in
                        regard to "that petition," which may have lodged there. I am happy to
                        observe that you have not secured the services of the "reliable gentleman"
                        to commune with your paper.<br> Respectfully,<br> William J. Dews</p>

                        lie asleep on honor's bed--<br> Young Freedom's martyred band--<br> For
                        all that's dear to man they bled--<br> For God and native land!</p>
                    <p>Weep not for Jackson, who laid down<br> His life in fullest fame;<br> Who
                        always wore the victor's crown,<br> Now wears a deathless name!<br> Oh!
