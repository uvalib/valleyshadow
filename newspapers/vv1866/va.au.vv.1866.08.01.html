<b>A Conversation with President Johnson</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reprints an article from the Boston Evening Commercial outlining
                    President Johnson's developing views on Reconstruction. He expresses his faith
                    that more moderate men will be elected to Congress and that the white South will
                    receive better treatment as a result. He expounds upon the future of the
                    Freedmen and the economy, and reaffirms his belief that the South should be
                    allowed easy re-entry into the Union.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A gentleman who had a free conversation with President Johnson, a short time
                        since, informs us that he found him hopeful, in good spirits and
                        unhesitating in the expression of his views. He does not anticipate anything
                        like a Democratic majority in the next House of Representatives, though the
                        number of representatives from that party will doubtless be considerably
                        increased. But he does count confidently on the return of a majority of
                        moderate men, who will be prepared to deal with the people of the South as
                        all honorable and high-minded nations deal with their antagonists after
                        having beaten and disarmed them. And in districts and States where the
                        Republican party fail to nominate such men he thinks Democratic candidates
                        will be likely in a majority of cases to be elected over Radicals.</p>
                    <p>The President is unhesitatingly of the opinion that the only safety of the
                        nation lies in a generous and expansive plan of conciliation, and the longer
                        this is delayed the more difficult it will be to bring the North and South
                        into harmony. If the suspicious, tyranical policy is too long pursued, the
                        population of the South will become as hostile to the North as the people of
                        Ireland are towards England, adding to this evil of hereditary and growing
                        animosity an ability for revenge a hundred fold greater than Ireland
                        possesses.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the blacks, the President says they will find work enough, and
                        for many years to come probably better remuneration than any other class of
                        agricultural laborers in the country. The competition of capitalists and
                        land-owners will insure good treatment and good pay from the planters. That
                        there will be much disorder, is to be expected; but there will be no more
                        than they would be at the North were the number of black laborers
                        sufficiently numerous to enter into serious rivalry with the white laborers.</p>
                    <p>The President is confident that nothing can be safely and permanently done in
                        regard to restoring the currency, diminishing taxation and establishing the
                        prosperity of the country on a sound and enduring basis until
                        representatives from all the States are present in Congress. The idea of
                        legislating for one third of the population of the country, and passing
                        constitutional amendments without allowing them any voice in the matter, or
                        paying any attention to their wishes, is full of danger to the future peace
                        and wellfare of the nation. They cannot be treated as a subjugated people or
                        as vassal colonies without a germ of hatred being introduced, which will
                        some day or other, though the time may be distant, develope mischief of the
                        most serious character.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the basis of representation, he denounces this as a mere
                        bugbear. It cannot and it will not be permanently settled until all the
                        States are represented, and no increase in the number of representatives in
                        consequence of the emancipation of slaves, can in any event occur until the
                        census of 1870 is taken, until which time, of course, the three-fifths
                        provision is in force under the last census. There is, therefore, ample time
                        to settle this matter between now and 1870, and it is unwise to agitate it
                        until other matters which cannot be delayed were settled.</p>
                    <p>The President does not admit that he has been inconsistent. He is as much
                        opposed to treason and traitors as he ever was, and for punishing them
                        severely. But there is no treason and no traitors now. The enemy has fully
                        and fairly surrendered and is powerless, and a foe thus situated should be
                        magnanimously treated. A generous and self-reliant warrior always restores
                        his disarmed officer his sword and trusts his parole of honor.</p>
                    <p>The idea of muzzling the press and tying the tongues of the people of the
                        South, after the manner of the suspicious tyrants and the Holy Inquisition
                        of the Old World, he denounces as absurd. A people should be allowed to
                        grumble who have suffered so much, and they would be unworthy of the name of
                        men if they did not respect the brave officers who have suffered with them,
                        and honor the memory of their gallant dead who sleep on a hundred
                        battle-fields and their homes.--Boston Evening
                            Commercial, July 21.</p>

                        something sublime and beautiful in it. The practice is as old as the Church

                        Joseph Bixio celebrated a solemn High Mass for the benefit of the souls of
                        the Confederate dead, at St. Frances Church, in this place. The church was

                        occasions. The services were very imposing and solemn. We witnessed many a
                        moist eye during the few appropriate and impressive remarks of the Rev.

                    <p>Deserters who now swear they never took the oath to the U. S., but glided
                        through the lines in some mysterious manner, should be careful not to leave
                        their papers lying around loose on the streets. Our devil picked up a
                        certificate, dated "New Creek, Va., August 31, 1863," signed by "Geo. A
                        Bragoner, P. M.," which says that "W. H. T., Rockingham county, Va., a
                        deserter from the Rebel Army, has this day appeared and taken the oath of
                        Allegiance to the U. S." By paying Dumb George, our colored devil, the cost
                        of this notice, the party interested, whoever he is, can recover this
                        valuable document. It will be a relick to hand down to future generations,
                        and George will sell it very cheap.</p>

                    <p>By the Author of Southrons</p>
                    <p>Yes, we have failed! That iron word<br> Drove never home its bolt of
                        fate<br> More ruthlessly than when it barred<br> All egress from the
                        prison gate<br> And left us powerless--in the dark,<br> A world's
                        reproach--a nation's mark.</p>
                    <p>Failed? Aye, so grievously that pain<br> Is put aside in pure amaze<br> As,
                        at our weary length of chain,<br> And steel girt path, we stand agaze<br>
                        With dark distrust of coming days,<br> And marvel if we be the same<br>
                        Who lit the christian world to flame.</p>
                    <p>The same who owned this lovely land<br> Now lying waste--a tyrant's
                        spoil,<br> And saw its stately dwellings stand<br> Mid waving fields of
                        fertile grain<br> Enriched by swarthy sons of toil,<br> The princes of a
                        proud estate<br> Now stricken, sterile, desolate!</p>
                    <p>The same! Where be our legions now<br> Where stand our homes so fair and
                        proud?<br> Where rings each step--where beams each brow,<br> Of those we
                        loved, our martyred crowd<br> To home and country nobly vowed,<br> Of sons
                        and brothers--where the hope<br> That wreathed our splendid horoscope?</p>
                    <p>And where the banner, which on high<br> We flung with all the pride of
                        race<br> An emblem from our Southern sky<br> Snatched from its sovereign
                        dwelling place<br> Our deeds of arms to gild and grace,<br> The flag our
                        breezes loved to toss--<br> Our ark of strength, our Southern Cross.</p>
                    <p>All buried in one common grave,<br> Are these the glories of the past,<br>
                        Let the swamp cypress o'er it wave<br> The bittern sail--the eagle
                        rave,<br> The simoon sweep--the midnight blast<br> Make requiem meet; the
                        die is cast.<br> And we, who counted ill the cost,<br> Who ventured all,
                        have stacked and lost.</p>
                    <p>What marvel, then, if in the burst<br> Of an [unclear] despair.<br> When
                        fate has seemed to do its worst,<br> And all proves false that seemed so
                        fair,<br> Such words as these should mock the air,<br> And that,
                        mistrusting fate and fame,<br> We question, "Are we still the same?"</p>
                    <p>Oh, morbid doubt! Oh, words of wind!<br> I cast ye forth as little
                        worth,<br> Forgive them, Omnipresent mind!<br> Forgive them, brothers,
                        bound on earth,<br> To one poor heritage of dearth,<br> And hear
                        conviction's voice proclaim<br> The potent truth, "We are the same!"</p>
                    <p>The same who faced the Northern hosts<br> With dauntless hearts and shining
                        spears;<br> The same who laughed to scorn their boasts,<br> And proved the
                        few the many's peers,<br> And did in days the work of years;<br>
                        O'erwhelmed--not conquered--overrun,<br> And desolated, and undone!</p>
                    <p>Yet still the same, the very same,<br> Believe it, tremble and believe,<br>
                        Oh, tyrants, who, with sword and flame,<br> ADVANCED to slaughter and
                        bereave,<br> Then STATED to torture and deceive,<br> And we, who with a
                        faith sublime,<br> Endure our fate--abide our time!</p>
                    <p>Beechmoore, June 1, 1866</p>
