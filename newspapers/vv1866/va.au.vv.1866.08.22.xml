                <head>Important Truths for Wives</head>
                <origin/>

                <transcript>
                    <p>In domestic happiness, the wife's influence is much greater than the
                        husband's; for the one, the first cause--mutual love and confidence--being
                        granted, the whole comfort of the household depends upon trifles more
                        immediately under her jurisdiction. By her management of small sums her
                        husband's respectability and credit are created or destroyed. No fortune can
                        stand the constant leakages of extravagance and mismanagement; and more is
                        spent in trifles than woman would easily believe. The one great expense,
                        whatever it may be, is turned over and carefully reflected on ere incurred;
                        the income is prepared for it; but it is pennies imperceptibly sliding away
                        that do the mischief; and this the wife alone can stop, for it does not come
                        within a man's province. There is often an unsuspected trifle to be saved in
                        every household. It is not in economy alone that the wife's attention is so
                        necessary, but in those little niceties which mark a well regulated
                        household. An unfurnished cruet stand, a missing key, a buttonless shirt, a
                        soiled tablecloth, mustard pot with its old contents sticking hard and brown
                        about it, are severally nothing; but each can raise an angry word and cause
                        discomfort. Depend on it, there's a great deal of domestic happiness in a
                        well-dressed mutton chop or a tidy breakfast-table. Men grow sated of
                        beauty, tired of music and often too wearied for conversation, (however
                        intellectual;) but they can always appreciate a well spent hearth and
                        smiling comfort. A woman may love her husband devotedly--may sacrifice
                        fortune, friends, family and country for him--she may have the genius of a
                        Sappho, the enchanting beauties of an Armida; but--melancholy fact--if with
                        these she fail to make his home comfortable, his heart will inevitably
                        escape her. And women live so entirely in their affections that without love
                        there existence is a void. Better submit, then, to household tasks, however
                        repugnant they may be to your tastes, than doom yourself to a loveless home.
                        Women of a higher order of mind will not run this risk; they know that they
                        are feminine, their domestic are their first duties.</p>

                    <p>The National Union Convention has met and adjourned, after a most harmonious
                        session of four days. Though some things in the proceedings of the
                        Convention, and in the platform which was adopted, may be distasteful to the
                        South, yet upon the whole, it was practically a political success, beyond
                        the expectations of its most sanguine well-wisher. The ludicrous humbug of
                        the delegations from South Carolina and Massachusetts entering the
                        Convention arm and arm, will excite a smile of contempt throughout the
                        South, where humbugs and buncomb are at a discount; but we have seen too
                        much of the bogus sentimentalism of our northern brethren not to believe
                        that their gushing and impressible natures will be moved, not only to
                        admiration, <emph rend="italic">but to [unclear]</emph> by the beautiful
                        idea, so touchingly typified, of the two extremes of the lately warring
                        sections, locked in fraternal and [unclear] embrace, with all the world as
                        smiling or tearful spectators. But if South Carolina wants to hug
                        Massachusetts, it is their own business, not ours.</p>
                    <p>While acquiescing in and sustaining this great movement, so far as we can
                        consistently, there are other and far more important matters for the
                        Southern people to attend to. As far as the so-called National politics of
                        the country are concerned, we have no business dabbling in them, only in so
                        far as to let our Conservative friends North know, as we have just done,
                        that we are with them, heart and soul, in their efforts to overthrow the
                        worst enemies a country ever had, the Radicals. As to the best means to
                        accomplish that much desired object, the Conservatives North have decided
                        upon them in this Convention, and as they make the [unclear] it is as little
                        [unclear] their hands. The prosperity of the whole country now is to be
                        based upon the defeat of the Radical party. The only hope we [section

                        turned toward commerce, and the recuperation of our county shows the result.
                        The battle between Conservatism and Radicalism, between free government and
                        despotism, is to be waged on Northern soil. We are but lookers on, and our
                        only duty is to work at home; to develop every home interest; to make the
                        negroes see we are their best friends, by our consideration, good judgement

                    <p>On the 14th, this Convention met in the grand Wigwam at Philadelphia. Every
                        State and Territory was represented and the utmost harmony prevailed. It was
                        the most immense gathering of people ever seen in Philadelphia and
                        everything passed off harmoniously, contrary to the expectations and some of
                        the hopes of the radicals.</p>
                    <p>The Convention adjourned on Thursday last after adopting unanimously the
                        following declaration of principles, of which our people are fully competent
                        to judge for themselves. The rest of the proceedings, the speeches, the
                        address, the buzzing for the Union, "Dixie" &amp;c. the South Carolina
                        and Massachusetts delegates walking into the Convention arm in arm, and all
                        the stuff and tomfoolery usually attendant on such occasions, amount to so
                        little that we do not care to bore our readers with it.</p>
                    <p>Here are the principles which comprise all we should care about.</p>
                    <p>DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.</p>
                    <p>The National Union Convention, now assembled in the City of Philadelphia,
                        composed of delegates from every State and Territory in the Union,
                        admonished by the solemn lessons which for the last five years it has
                        pleased the Supreme Ruler of the Universe to give the American people,
                        profoundly grateful for the return of peace, desirous as are a large
                        majority of their countrymen in all sincerity to forget and forgive the
                        past, revering the Constitution as it comes to us from our ancestors,
                        regarding the Union in its restoration as more sacred than ever, looking
                        with deep anxiety into the future of instant and continuing trial, hereby
                        issues and proclaims the following declaration, principles and purposes, on
                        which they have, with perfect unanimity, agreed:</p>
                    <p>1st: We hail with gratitude to Almighty God the end of the war and the return
                        of peace to an afflicted and beloved land.</p>
                    <p>2d: The war just elected has maintained the authority of the Constitution,
                        with all the powers which it confers, and all the restrictions which it
                        imposes upon the General Government, unabridged and unaltered, and it has
                        preserved the Union with the equal rights, dignity and authority of the
                        States perfect and unimpaired.</p>
                    <p>3d: Representation in the Congress of the United States and the Electoral
                        College is a right recognized by the Constitution as abiding in every State,
                        and a duty imposed upon its people--fundamental in its nature and essential
                        to the existence of our republican institutions, and neither Congress nor
                        the General Government has any authority or power to deny this right to any
                        State or withhold its enjoyment under the Constitution for the people
                        thereof.</p>
                    <p>4th: We call upon the people of the United States to elect to Congress, as
                        members thereof, none but men who admit fundamental right of representation,
                        and who will receive to seats therein loyal representatives from every State
                        in allegiance to the United States, subject to the Constitutional right of
                        each House to judge of the election returns, and qualifications of its own
                        members.</p>
                    <p>5th: The Constitution of the United States, and the laws made in pursuance
                        thereof, are "the supreme law of the land anything in the constitution or
                        laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." All the power not
                        conferred by the Constitution upon the General Government, nor prohibited by
                        the State is "reserved to the States or to the people thereof," and among
                        the rights thus reserved to the States is the right to prescribe
                        qualifications for the elective franchise therein, with which right Congress
                        can interfere. No State or combination of States has the right to withdraw
                        from the Union or to exclude, through their action in Congress or otherwise,
                        any other State or States from the Union. The Union of these States is

                        [unclear] out by its provisions; and in [unclear] such amendments, whether

                    <p>7th: Slavery is abolished and forever prohibited, and [section unclear]. or

                        States of the Union should receive in common with all their inhabitants
                        equal protection of every right of person and property.</p>
                    <p>8th. Which we regard as utterly invalid and never to be assumed or made a
                        binding force any obligation incurred or undertaken in making war against
                        the United States, we hold the debt of the nation to be sacred and
                        inviolable; and we proclaim our purpose, in discharging this, as in
                        pertaining all other national obligations to maintain, unimpaired, and

                    <p>9th: It is the duty of the National Government to recognize the sacrifices of
                        the Federal soldier and sailors in the contest just closed, by meeting
                        promptly and fully their just and righteous claims to the services they have
                        rendered the nation, and by extending to those of them who have survived,
                        and to the widows and orphans of those who have fallen, the most generous
                        and considerate care.</p>
                    <p>10th: In Andrew Johnson, President of the United States who, in his great
                        office, has proved steadfast in his devotion to the Constitution, the laws
                        and interests of his country, unmoved by persecution and undeserved
                        reproach--having faith unassailable in the people and in the principle of
                        free government--we recognize a Chief Magistrate worthy of the nation and
                        equal to the great crisis upon which his lot is cast, and we tender to him,
                        in the discharge of his high and responsible duties, our profound respect
                        and assurance of our cordial and sincere support.</p>
                    <p>When the secretary read the section declaring that the war left all the
                        rights of the States "perfect and unimpaired," the entire convention rose to
                        its feet and spent some time in cheering the sentiment. The allusion to
                        President Johnson was also received with loud and continued applause.</p>
                    <p>The vote was then taken on the adoption of the resolution as read, and they
                        were unanimously adopted.</p>

                    support the policies of Andrew Johnson. The Convention declared that the war had
                    ended and that slavery was forever abolished, but the rights of the states
                    remained unchanged. The delegates call for Congress to admit Southern
                    representatives immediately.The Convention refuses to support payment of
