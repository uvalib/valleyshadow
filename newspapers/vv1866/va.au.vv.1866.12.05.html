                    <p>The Baltimore Transcript, of November 22d,
                        expresses some sensible views on a subject heretofore commented on by the
                        Valley Virginian. In speaking about the colored
                        people, it says:</p>
                    <p>"There are one or two matters apparently trivial, but really important, to
                        which we beg to call the attention of the Southern employer. The colored
                        race in this country have a fixed aversion to being called "negroes" and
                        particularly "damn negroes." When we devote a little reflection to this
                        subject, it really seems a trifling thing to haggle upon a point like this.
                        It is hardly worth any gentleman's or lady's while to hurt the feelings of a
                        dependant. If, therefore, they prefer to be called "servants," or "colored
                        people," for Heaven's sake let them so be styled! This appears to be a small
                        matter, but those familiar with African peculiarities, know that it is one
                        of considerable moment.</p>
                    <p>With regard to extending the right of suffrage to the colored population,
                        they might as well know now, once for all, that the South is fixedly opposed
                        to it, and will never yield except upon compulsion.</p>
                    <p>We are opposed to extending this franchise 1st, Because the North is
                        insolently, unconstitutionally and unjustly endeavoring to force it upon us.
                        It is our affair and not theirs. We are opposed to it secondly because we do
                        not think that the colored men are fit to exercise the right of suffrage.
                        Many of us believe that there are many white men who are not fit to vote and
                        that allowing them to do so has been demonstrated to be a profound mistake
                        that we are not willing to repeat on such an extended scale. There [section
                        unclear].</p>
                    <p>If the South is compelled by the North to yield in this particular,
                        intelligent colored men can readily understand that this privilege of
                        voting, obtained by these means, will bring about the speedy ruin of their
                        people. Then will [section unclear]. Rather than have a hostile population
                        in their midst, the Southern proprietors of land, the employers of the
                        colored race, will speedily obtain from abroad the requisite supply of labor
                        and the African will disappear from this continent as surely and more
                        suddenly than the Indian. The places that know him now will know him no
                        more, and he will become a thing of the past, "a school boy's dream, the
                        wonder of an hour."</p>

<b>Our New Volume</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 19th of September, 1865, there was put forth a modest announcement,
                        stating that "The Valley Virginian would be published every Wednesday in the
                        town of Staunton, and be devoted to the best interests of the Valley of
                        Virginia," and that "every exertion would be used to make it a medium of
                        communication between the different portions of Augusta and the Valley.
                        Particular attention would be paid to the local department, and no effort
                        would be wanting to render the Valley Virginian worthy of the generous
                        support of our people."</p>
                    <p>How far our endeavors to fulfill these promises have been successful, a
                        subscription list, double that we started with, and a full share of Job work
                        and advertising shows, and we can assure the generous friends, who have
                        sustained us for the past year, that we appreciate their efforts in our
                        behalf; and that we shall not weary in trying to make our paper all it
                        should be, to merit such a support.</p>
                    <p>With grateful hearts we acknowledge our many obligations to the generous
                        people of our native Country and of the entire Valley. If, as we said in our
                        first number, "four years of service in our native Valley, taught us to love
                        it more and more, and to appreciate the high qualities of its people as they
                        should be," what can we say in their praise now, that we have seen them
                        during a year that has certainly "tried men's souls?" We can only say they
                        have made a desolated country "blossom as the rose," and that they have
                        proved themselves worthy of the past. We can only acknowledge their generous
                        support of our enterprise, and re-echo the voice of the thousand recipients
                        of her bounty, now scattered over the Southern States, in saying "God bless
                        her! God bless her! God favor the Valley of Virginia."</p>
                    <p>The experience of the past year justifies us in announcing to our friends and
                        the public that the VALLEY VIRGINIAN is an established institution of the
                        Valley; to rise or fall with the fortunes of the people, as a just and
                        merciful Providence may decree. It has struggled through difficulties that
                        would have swamped other papers, (but then we had true soldiers for printers,) and while not boasting of its age, or
                        its venerable appearance, it is proud, in its infancy, to be acknowledged
                        among the first weekly journals of the interior.</p>
                    <p>In commencing a new volume, we have no further pledges to offer. We will
                        continue to make the Valley Virginian all its
                        name claims, as a local paper, and, as for politics, while expressing our
                        views fully, we expect to "throw them to the dogs," and continue to devote
                        our exertions to the development of the material resources of our loved
                        Valley and of Virginia. We have made arrangements to add greatly to the
                        interest of the columns of our paper, and "new improvements will be
                        constantly introduced." In consideration of the liberal local patronage
                        bestowed upon us, we have reduced the rates of transient advertising, as
                        will be seen by our general card on the first page; and, whenever justified
                        by our business, we expect to make a further reduction--purely as a business
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>To our brethren of the press, especially of Staunton and the Valley, we
                        desire to return our sincere acknowledgements for many favors and delicate
                        attentions which have only to be received to be properly appreciated. In
                        breasting up against the troubles and trials of a new year, we could ask no
                        better fortune than that our intercourse with our brothers, in the great
                        work of restoring the country to its pristine prosperity and happiness,
                        shall be as pleasant as it has been in the past. May all our efforts--all
                        our labors--tend to promote harmony among our people; to dignify our
                        profession and make it in fact and in truth, not only the "fourth estate,"
                        but the "first in the realm," of honesty, virtue, and true greatness.</p>

<b>A Cheerful View of the Situation</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There are many of the belief that the future of Virginia was never so bright
                        as now. Of this opinion were some of the accomplished and distinguished
                        agriculturalists who recently represented the Virginia State Agricultural
                        Society in this city. We sincerely hope that the encouraging peep which
                        these gentlemen seem to have had behind the curtain of futurity has
                        disclosed sights and events which, when they come within the range of other
                        men's eyes, will confirm their impressions and predictions. We are not given
                        to despondency, and we swallow with joyous avidity any hopes which are
                        thrown to us from any quarter. We believe in hope--we look upon it as the poet did<br> "Hope! of all the ills
                        that men endure,<br> The only cheap and universal cure,<br> Thou captive's
                        freedom and thou sick man's health:<br> Thou lover's victory and thou
                        beggar's wealth."</p>
                    <p>There is a vitality in hope which is hard to destroy. The Radicals cannot
                        "confiscate" it, nor can they exclude it from our hearts by a constitutional
                        amendment. We are very rich in hope, and we can increase our wealth in this
                        respect whenever we please. And the most hopeful sign which we have seen is
                        the fact that so many of our best politicians are turning their attention to
                        agriculture, which is the only lever after all that can lift us out of the
                        pit of woe and misfortune into which we have been cast by the unsuccessful
                        results of our attempts to exercise the right of self government.</p>
                    <p>It is a subject of congratulation that so many of our late soldiers and
                        statesmen are imitating CINCINNATUS--not through choice, perhaps, but from
                        constraint of circumstances. But so their zeal, energy, talents and example
                        are secured, no matter how, in developing the most important of all the
                        natural resources of a State, the desired result will be accomplished. What
                        we want now is the creation and accumulation of wealth, and the speediest
                        and surest way to get it will be to dig and plow the earth. Money is said to
                        be "the root of all evil," but the want of the "root" is working more evil
                        in this commonwealth than the possession of it would be.</p>
                    <p>Most of the indignity, persecution and oppression which we now receive at the
                        hands of the ruling faction of the North arise because of our present
                        poverty and helplessness. We are like poor relations, objects to be snubbed
                        and put upon. But let us once begin to be prosperous; let it be generally
                        known that we are getting rich, that we have "corn for sale," and
                        straight-way our friends will become as numerous as locusts, and their
                        affections will be most touching. If we shall then be indifferent about
                        taking our seats in Congress, they will be ready to drag us in by force.</p>
                    <p>It is a prodigious thing to have money; it is "treason" to be poor. Wealth
                        adds to a man's respectability and "loyalty;" poverty keeps him out of his
                        seat in Congress and proves conclusively that he is a "rebel." The way to
                        get justice and power and friends is to get rich, and we can do so through
                        the aid of agriculture, because our staple products are worth now more than
                        they ever were before. Every man who has a field has a gold mine--let him
                        dig it. Politics pay nothing at present, and it is hoped that every
                        politician will become a plowman; and if that does not suit him let him turn
                        his wood sawyer and chop sticks instead of logic. When we have retrieved our
                        fortunes, then we will try and set the country to rights; meantime, let the
                        Radicals run their machine to Hades if they wish it. Richmond Times.</p>

                    <p>Staunton, Nov. 23, 1866.</p>
                    <p>This place, always one of the most healthful and attractive towns of
                        Virginia, has recuperated more rapidly from the exhaustion of the late war,
                        than almost any other town in Virginia. The work of renovation and building
                        is something remarkable, and the old families of the place in bygone days,
                        would hardly recognize the dear old spot, in its renewed youth, and wide
                        awake aspect. It is difficult to keep pace here with the demand for new
                        buildings, caused by the increase of business, and the attractions as a
                        residence, held forth by this "mountain city," nestled in the lap of these
                        grand old hills, and having a population remarkable for refinement and
                        intelligence not less than public spirit and enterprise.</p>
                    <p>The community is greatly interested in the Valley railroad, an interest
                        which, it is to be presumed, Baltimore shares in largely, it being a much
                        more important matter to her than it can be to the people of the Valley. The
                        survey of this road, under Major Randolph and his efficient corps, has just
                        been completed. The entire length of the survey made is said to be about one
                        hundred and twenty-three miles, from Harrisonburg to Salem. It is roughly
                        estimated that the road can be built for thirty thousand dollars per mile.
                        The report of Maj. Randolph to his company is looked for here with great
                        interest. The road is one of the most important to the commerce and trade of
                        Baltimore that was ever built, and will render the most fertile part of
                        Virginia tributary to her wealth, as well as the rich and inexhaustible
                        Southwest.</p>
                    <p>The Circuit Court, Judge Sheffey presiding, is now in session here. One of
                        the most important cases, and involving a larger amount of money than any
                        ever tried here, came up on Monday last, and is not yet ended. It is the
                        case of Brown, Lanigan &amp; Co. vs. Forrer and others, involving some
                        $250,000 furnace property. There is a very able array of counsel on both
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>It would puzzle the most uncharitable enemy of the South, if such a man could
                        be induced to examine it personally for himself, to discover any grounds for
                        a charge of disloyalty against the people in the "Old Stonewall District" of
                        Virginia. Originally opposed to disunion, they are a good deal more "loyal"
                        at this moment, than many of those in other States who profess to be the
                        exclusive champions of the Union, and who are showing their championship by
                        knocking the breath out of its body. The people here, like the masses of the
                        people everywhere throughout the South, are most anxious to resume their
                        relations to the government, and have faithfully performed, and intend to
                        perform all the duties and obligations of law abiding citizens.</p>
                    <p>The Western Lunatic Asylum situated in Staunton, is a proud monument to the
                        humanity of Virginia, and the pre-eminent skill and qualifications for the
                        post of its Superintendent Dr. Francis T. Stribling, who for more than a
                        quarter of a century has presided over this institution, and who seems to me
                        one of those men whom Providence raised up to meet a great want of society,
                        and whose enlightened and benevolent ministrations to suffering mankind,
                        entitle them to a higher place in the veneration of the race than the most
                        renowned heroes of war and destruction. The blended wisdom and benignity,
                        and the rare tact and judgement exercised by Dr. Stribling in the discharge
                        of his arduous and delicate responsibilities, rank him among the greatest of
                        public benefactors. I was glad to find that the institution had so rapidly
                        recovered from the collapse in which its treasury was left at the conclusion
                        of the war, and, in this connection, too much praise cannot be awarded to
                        Governor Pierpont, who exerted himself promptly to supply its pressing
                        wants, and responded at once to all drafts for money which reached him with
                        the sanction of the board. There were in the Asylum at the commencement of
                        the year three hundred and seven insane persons--males 177, females
                        130--since admitted 63--now in the institution, 374. I have been surprised
                        to learn that no increase of insanity has resulted from the war, and the
                        troubles of the times, except among blacks, who were formerly remarkably
                        exempt from this affliction, but amongst whom insanity has so increased
                        since their liberation, that it is found necessary to call upon the
                        legislature to make additional provisions for their relief.</p>
                    <p>Another of the admirable benevolent State institutions at Staunton is the
                        "Institution for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind," of which that thoroughly
                        competent and accomplished gentleman, Mr. J. C. Covell, M. A., is Principal.
                        The proficiency which these unfortunate persons exhibit in education is
                        something wonderful, and is the best proof of the high ability and energy of
                        the superintendent. The number of pupils at present is eighty. This is in
                        fact the leading institution of the kind in the Southern States, and the
                        fact that the Ohio Institution, at Columbus, has ordered its books from it
                        is a striking illustration of its general reputation. The Chapel of the
                        Institute will seat six hundred persons, and the organ is the second in the
                        States. Two of the assistant teachers in the deaf and dumb department, Mr.
                        Turner and Mr. Bear, are deaf mutes, and more efficient and competent
                        teachers it would be difficult to find. It is worth a visit to Staunton to
                        hear the music of the blind especially in the combination of the organ and
                        other instrumental music, with the sweet voices of the singers. The
                        buildings of this Institution and of the Insane are on a very large scale,
                        simply supplied with all the modern appliances of comfort, and are among the
                        architectural ornaments of the State.</p>
