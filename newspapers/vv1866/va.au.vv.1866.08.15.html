<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article from the Rockingham Register asserts that "our want of a
                    Railroad will be sadly felt by our people this Fall, when the immense corn crop
                    which now covers the face of the county all over, begins to mature. The crop
                    will be so immense that our people will hardly know what to do with it.
                    Thousands of dollars will be lost because there are no adequate means for its
                    transportation beyond the limits of the county. How long we are to suffer and to

                    <p>Staunton is fast resuming the energy and industry which were leading
                        characteristics of its business population before general adversity fell
                        upon all parts of the country. In no department is this more discernible
                        than in its fine and capacious hotels. Travelers, once partaking of the
                        excellent fare and delightful quarters they receive here, go on their
                        journey more than pleased. The old and well known Virginia Hotel is one of
                        the most complete establishments in the country. The Messrs. PEYTON, in
                        reopening its ample accommodations, have spared no expense in giving
                        convenience, style and elegance to the apartments and the outfit in every
                        particular. With their own is given the polite attention of the

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is certainly very gratifying to a dweller in our lovely Valley, to note
                        the rapid progress our people are making in restoring our war-stricken
                        country to its former thrifty appearance. The changes are apparent to the
                        eye of a stranger, but to one that, with a sad heart, saw Sheridan's
                        ruthless devastation and witnessed the destruction, as it went on, of four
                        years of vandalism, and can tell when each scar was made that so marred the
                        features of this loveliest of lands, these changes for the better are
                        eloquent in speaking of the past and cheering for the present and the
                        future.</p>
                    <p>It is needless to speak of the improvements in Staunton, they are "not done
                        in a corner," the town is filling up and spreading out, as far as the water pipes will let
                        it, especially is the town creeping down the Valley Turnpike, where the
                        houses, some very good ones, have already topped the hill, the fences have
                        resumed their old places and near the little chopping mill on Fanny's Run,
                        Col. Harman's fine new Merchant mill, running like clock-work, first
                        attracts attention after getting into the country--and it is well worth a
                        visit, if for no other purpose, to see how well everything has been done
                        there. I am sure a good roll would taste all the
                        better if the eater knew the flour had been ground in so neat a mill. The
                        fine crops, the fences, the improvements that have been made to houses and
                        barns, speak well for the industry of the farmers, as we go towards the
                        Augusta Church, and there the fine new building that is nearly completed for
                        the school of the Messrs. Bowman and the New Cemetery that is nearly
                        enclosed and is to be neatly and tastefully laid out and ornamented, speak
                        well for the public spirit that is still alive in the old land. Mt. Sidney
                        gives few signs of life we are sorry to say: the hotel has a new sign and
                        the smoke rises from the oven of the pottery, but the end has fallen out of
                        the school house and the weeds grow in the streets, even the toll gatherer
                        was "non est." As we near Burke's Mill two steam
                        saw mills give an active look to the little Valley of the West Branch of
                        Naked Creek, and Capt. Burke's new mill looks as though Sheridan's crow
                        might replenish his haversack there, provided--well, we're
                        reconstructed--The whole place is alive from the steam mill to the stage
                        stables. Pleasant Grove Academy is sadly in need of a tenant, but the huge
                        new barn of Mr. Roller near by proclaims that that fine region has not been
                        sold for taxes yet. Mt. Crawford looks very well, except the church, which
                        always had a forward look, the reservoir in front
                        is more than ever a scar on the body politic, or the corporation, (for all
                        the towns in Rockingham, such as Mt. Crawford, Bridgewater, Dayton,
                        &amp;c., are incorporated.) It speaks well for the place that they are
                        fixing to use the fine water power of Cook's Creek at one end of the town,
                        and are making crocks from the marsh at the other end. The hand of steady
                        industry is apparent all the way from Mt. Crawford to Harrisonburg, this
                        portion of the country was made very desolate, but one could hardly tell
                        that anything had ever happened to it, surely no one ever saw finer crops of
                        corn, or such fields of grass, so many new fences, to say nothing of the new
                        houses and new finger boards. The big spring even had a new look, as though
                        it had recuperated after resting from the many calls of the many.</p>
                    <p>Harrisonburg does not give many external proofs of
                        prosperity, but the town appears, upon closer acquaintance, to be getting
                        along very well. The Female Seminary is said to be very flourishing, but the
                        outside of it looks as though it were in a state of siege: it needs a little
                        paint and some trees. The new bank will be a very nice building, but the
                        head gear of it looks too much like an old fashioned lady's high-topped
                        comb. General Jones has improved the outside of the old stone church, and
                        the lots of tools he has stowed away inside when they get into the hands of
                        the farmers will do much to improve the country. The Collector of the U. S.
                        taxes goes into the old bank, where he will, no doubt, have more deposits
                        than the new one. The Register office looks much the same as of yore, but it
                        has a fine power press that beats all our Staunton new mills, but the
                        establishment reminded us of Imboden's big mule and little cannon that came
                        down to help us fight the battle of Port Republic. The "boys" all thought
                        the mule was too big for the gun, and we thought the press was too big for
                        the room it had, we don't mean anything more, for we venture that in a short
                        time they will have "the thing" going by steam. The Register is "an
                        institution" still in Rockingham, and its Senior evidently enjoys, (and who
                        would not?) the crowd of the old and young, male and female, that at an
                        early hour on the day of publication crowds his Sanctum eager for the
                        appearance of the paper. It always does us good to see people enjoy
                        themselves as the editor and his subscribers seemed to enjoy themselves. We
                        can't say much for the hotels, and, as for merchants the "Mammoth Store"
                        seems to have swallowed all the others, and surely a store that took in ninety thousand pounds of butter in one
                        year ought to swallow well. The lawyers appear to have taken Harrisonburg as
                        the Doctors have Staunton--and lest you should weary and say we have taken
                        too many notes we will stop.</p>
                    <p>Yours, &amp;c.<br> Z.</p>
