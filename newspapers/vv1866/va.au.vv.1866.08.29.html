<b>The Situation</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors apprise readers of developments upon several topics. They argue
                    that the Philadelphia Convention, while not changing much, could be a harbinger
                    of Conservative triumph in the North. The Valley Railroad is still in need of
                    subscribers, and the editors urge citizens to contribute. In the area of race
                    relations, the editors admonish people to address the freedmen with more

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Every one has had their say about the Philadelphia Convention, pro and con.,
                        and the world still moves along in the same old way, much to the surprise of
                        some people. It is gratifying to notice how cooly the people of the South
                        take the whole matter, and the good sense shown by the press generally, in
                        "accepting the situation." In the North, where the battle is to be fought,
                        there are cheering indications of the triumph of Conservatism over the
                        Radicals, and we can only bid our people--be of good heart, work, and trust
                        to God for the ultimate triumph of those principles of free government, for
                        which they have sacrificed, and are still enduring, so much.</p>
                    <p>From Europe, by the Cable, comes news of peace between the great Powers, and
                        with it a marked improvement in commercial and financial circles. They have
                        butchered thousands over there, and a heap of stuff is sent over the wires
                        about "rectifying boundaries," and all that; but our only interest in the
                        matter is that it will enable the capitalists who have undertaken to build
                        our great canal and railroad to the Ohio, to raise the funds necessary. We
                        have a great admiration for the wonderful things done in the short war in
                        Europe, but we will feel much better when the Covington and Ohio railroad is
                        built.</p>
                    <p>In our columns will be found the proceedings of the Valley Rail Road Meeting,
                        Monday, and the order of the Court, for a vote to be taken on the
                        proposition for the county to subscribe $200,000 to this great work. The
                        meeting was large and respectable, and how our people will vote upon the
                        subscription is of more importance to us than all the politics and all the
                        wars in the world.</p>
                    <p>The people of Augusta now have a chance to show again, as they have often
                        done, their public spirit, their liberality, and their devotion to all the
                        interests of the great Valley. Two hundred thousand dollars, to be
                        subscribed by the Court, looks like an awful sum, but the same was said
                        about the subscription to the Central railroad years ago--and who felt it?
                        Augusta must set an example to her daughters by voting for this
                        subscription, and every friend of the road should work to accomplish that
                        object. This is a matter of such vital importance; a matter upon which hangs
                        so many present and future benefits to us and our children, that before it
                        all other questions sink into nothingness. The destiny of our loved Valley
                        and our people depend upon our building this road. Vote for the
                        subscription, and it will be built. Then we will be rich and
                        independent--not before.</p>
                    <p>Our people should recollect that in the changed position of the colored
                        people we have duties to perform of equal importance to those imposed upon
                        the freedmen. Little things go a great way in this world, and, in our
                        present situation, good sense and sound judgement are required more than
                        ever. One little thing, the word "nigger," is too often used, and it wounds
                        the feelings of the colored people. "Nigger," to them, means everything mean
                        and low in their race, just as "Yankee" expresses everything low and mean in
                        the white. Remember this, and it will do a world of good.</p>

<b>The President's Speech</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints excerpts from a speech by Andrew Johnson taking
                    Congressional Republicans to task, and pledging to uphold the Constitution.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 18th August, Andrew Johnson made a speech in Washington about the
                        Philadelphia platform. In it he bravely defends himself, and shows up the
                        destructive course of the mob, called Congress. Here is the gist of the
                        whole speech, and it will do. He said:</p>
                    <p>"But as the work progressed, as reconciliation seemed to be taking place, and
                        the country becoming united, we found a disturbing and warring element in
                        opposition. In alluding to that element, I shall go further than did your
                        convention and the distinguished gentleman who has delivered to me the
                        report of you proceedings. I shall make no reference to it. That I do not
                        believe the time and occasion justify. We have witnessed in one department
                        of the government every effort, as it were, to prevent the restoration of
                        peace, or harmony, and of the Union. We have seen hanging upon the verge of
                        the government, as it were, a body called, or which assumed to be, the
                        Congress of the United States, but in fact a Congress of only part of the
                        States. We have seen this Congress assume and pretend to be for the Union,
                        when its every step and act tended to perpetuate disunion, and make a
                        disruption permanent.</p>
                    <p>Instead of promoting reconciliation and harmony, its legislation has partaken
                        of the character of penalties, retaliation and revenge. This has been the
                        course and the policy of one department of your government. The humble
                        individual who is now addressing you stands the representative of another
                        department of the government. The manner in which he was called upon to
                        occupy that position I shall not allude to on this occasion; suffice it to
                        say that he is here under the constitution of the country; and being here by
                        virtue of its provisions, he takes his stand upon that charter of our
                        liberties as the great rampart of civil and religious liberty. [Prolonged
                        cheering.] Having been taught in my early life to hold it sacred, and having
                        practiced upon it during my public career, I shall ever continue to
                        reverence the constitution of my fathers, and to make it my guide."</p>

                    <p>A Staunton correspondent of the Abingdon Virginian, in speaking of Staunton,
                        says:</p>
                    <p>"In regard to Staunton, I can tell you nothing with which you are not
                        familiar. The characteristic of Staunton is that it is emphatically a
                        "business place." It is the central point of the trade in this great Valley.
                        Farmers, traders and producers of all kinds, from this and adjacent
                        counties, empty their products here. The main street is often crowded with
                        wagons small and great, in which may be seen everything common among the
                        producers of the country. Merchants chiefly are the buyers, and the citizens

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In Camp, Cold Harbor,<br> June 10, 1864.</p>
                    <p>This battery entered the service at Harper's Ferry, under the command of
                        Captain (now General) John D. Imboden, and has been in all the engagements
                        with the A. N. Va. since--distinguishing itself in each. On Tuesday, May the
                        10th, at Spotsylvania, it was in position near the head-quarters of the
                        Commanding General, when a company of artillery was forced, fighting
                        gallantly, to leave their guns. Capt. Garber was then called on by Gen. Lee
                        to take his men and work the guns, when they were retaken, which order was
                        complied with and the guns kept vomiting out their deadly contents, under a
                        most terrific fire of the enemy's infantry, until the close of the
                        contest--the officers and men receiving, for their gallantry and
                        extraordinary heroism, the compliments of Generals Lee, Gordon, and Long.
                        During the night the guns of the Staunton Artillery were brought up to the
                        position, and held it on the terrible "12th of May."</p>
                    <p>When the enemy broke through our lines on the morning of the 12th, the guns
                        of this battery were turned to the right upon him, and, firing over the
                        heads of our own men, checked his advance until relief came from other parts
                        of our line, when the lost works were retaken and our lines reformed.
                        Captain Garber then advanced a part of his men and worked three of our
                        re-captured guns of another battalion, with a spirit and success which again
                        elicited the praises of general officers.</p>
                    <p>A simple statement of these facts is sufficient to show the character of both
                        officers and men, and the importance of the work accomplished is evident.</p>
                    <p>The battery was also engaged on the 18th of May, when the enemy were repulsed
                        by artillery fire alone. On the 2d of June a section of the battery repulsed
                        a column of the enemy, when our infantry had been flanked and left it
                        exposed to capture.</p>
                    <p>The casualties show how the company has suffered, and this statement of its
                        conduct is but a simple act of justice to its officers and men.</p>
                    <p>Major Cutshaw, commanding the battalion of which the Staunton battery is a
                        part is one of the most gallant officers in the service, and on the
                        occasions above referred to, acted with distinguished valor and intrepidity,
                        and though his brave command has been sadly reduced in numbers, it is still
                        able to hold its own in the front ranks.</p>
                    <p>In making this statement, it is not intended to detract from other batteries,
                        nearly all of which have received favorable mention in the papers, but
                        simply to let the "old folks at home," in old Augusta, know that their battery still retains its well earned
                        reputation, and has added fresh laurels to those previously obtained.</p>

                        of flowers on it, the tribute of the fair and gentle women of the Valley to
                        the brave and honored dead.</p>

                    recovering more rapidly from the war than any area in the South. The paper
                    attributes that to "ready adaptation of its soil to any system of labor," the
                    "small number of freedmen," and the spirit and energy of the population.<br>

                    is arrested and lodged in jail, but something less than a thousand worthless

                    ago we saw this man in the mountains of Virginia and he boldly proclaimed the
                    most extreme Southern doctrines and boasted of his services at the first battle
