                <summary>M. D. Gearhart, Julia Painter, and George Greaver, Sr. were indicted for
                    petit larceny. The following qualified as Justices: J. Marshall McVae, Chesley

                    Brownsburg Turnpike was taken over by the county from the company, and the court
                    issued an order directing road commissioner J. M. Lidey to divide the road into
                    precincts and "assign hands to work it." A. W. Greaver was remanded to Circuit
                    Court for trial on felony charges.</summary>

                    <p>Some time ago we alluded to a model in plaster of a bust of Stonewall Jackson
                        by our young friend, William Donovan, a private in the celebrated Staunton
                        Artillery and a worthy member of that company. He has finished the model and
                        it is pronounced a good likeness of General Jackson by members of his staff.
                        It is the intention of Mr. Donovan to carve it in the finest marble and
                        place it on exhibition in Baltimore. Taking into consideration the fact that
                        Mr. Donovan has had no opportunity to improve himself for the last five
                        years, this great work shows remarkable genius, and it should be cultivated.
                        Soldiers who served under Jackson are invited to call at Marquis and
                        Kelley's and see the likeness of their beloved leader.</p>

                    <p>The Charlottesville Chronicle says: "The most impertinent thing of the
                        session is the late resolution of the Conservative Senator Stewart, of
                        Nevada, for universal suffrage and universal amnesty as a compromise. We may
                        save our necks and get into Congress by universal negro suffrage; this from
                        a Conservative Republican. We suppose the Radical ground is, suffrage to the
                        negroes in the South, and to nobody else. Senator Stewart offers this as an
                        olive-branch to the South, for the consideration of each State.</p>
                    <p>This reminds us of two negroes who got into a fight, and the big one beat the
                        little one almost to death, who hallooed "nuff." They got upon their feet,
                        when Caesar seized Pompey (the little nigger) firmly by the collar, and
                        addressed him thus: "Now, Pomp, I don't want any bad feelings atwixt us, and
                        I pose to comp'mise--just take off you shirt, old fellar, and I'll hit you.
                        Pomp. 150 lashes--and then you can put on your shirt again and go about your
                        business--and no questions axed--I offer you, Pomp, <emph rend="italic">a

                    <p>It is not mine to bind thy brow<lb/> With laurels of undying fame;<lb/> To
                        get on Glory's pinnacle,<lb/> In living characters, thy name.<lb/> Not mine
                        to strike the lofty song<lb/> That [unclear] the deathless [unclear]<lb/>
                        And yet a hero's child may lay<lb/> A flower upon a hero's grave.</p>
                    <p>I knew him well. A starnger came<lb/> Just quietly, and took his place,<lb/>
                        And did you wish to respect the man,<lb/> You need but look on his
                        face,<lb/> The forehead [unclear]--the calm, clear eye<lb/> That marked the
                        true and steadfast soul,<lb/> And every [unclear]<lb/> A will, that
                        [unclear]</p>
                    <p>I knew him when the [unclear]<lb/> That hallowed all his future
                        [unclear]<lb/> And when the lady of his love<lb/> Became the happy,
                        cherished wife,<lb/> One year of joy, and hope, and peace,<lb/> And she,
                        awhile was the bride,<lb/> Lay in her last and dreamless sleep,<lb/> A
                        lifeless infant at her side.</p>
                    <p>"Have you seen Ellie," I had shrunk<lb/> With fainting heart and quickened
                        breath,<lb/> From this strange blending at one stroke,<lb/> Of health with
                        sickness, life with death.<lb/> But at his will I went; and while<lb/> I
                        trembled with mysterious awe,<lb/> I thought it then, and still it
                        seems<lb/> The saddest sight I ever saw.</p>
                    <p>The sunlight [unclear] on her hair,<lb/> Her cheek, [unclear], looked the
                        same;<lb/> And the sad tone was in my ear,<lb/> That often to my memory
                        came;<lb/> "Have you seen Ellie?" Oh! the crush<lb/> Of early love and manly
                        pride;<lb/> And, if it were the will of God,<lb/> This night I'd lie down by
                        her side.</p>
                    <p>Not yet--not yet! 'Twas his to strike,<lb/> With living fire, the hearts of
                        men;<lb/> To lead them through the battle storm,<lb/> As though it were a
                        summer rain,<lb/> To make his name the rallying cry,<lb/> That bore our
                        hosts to victory on<lb/> A household word in foreign lands<lb/> Wherever
                        Freedom's throb is known.</p>
                    <p>"Not yet--not yet!" A little child,<lb/> In simple and implicit faith,<lb/>
                        'Twas his to be the world-renowned--<lb/> Sublime in life, sublime in
                        death.<lb/> Not yet. 'Twas his from vanquished foes,<lb/> To wrest a tribute
                        to his worth;<lb/> Then, at God's will, to lay aside<lb/> The highest honors
                        known to earth.</p>
                    <p>S. H. S.<lb/> V. M. I., January, 1866.</p>
