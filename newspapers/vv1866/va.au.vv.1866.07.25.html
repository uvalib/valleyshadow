<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This editorial comes out in favor of the goals of the Philadelphia
                    convention, which involve uniting all conservative politicians against the

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Great National Union Convention called to meet at Philadelphia on the
                        14th of August, is exciting profound interest and much comment throughout
                        the country, North and South. The general policy of the Southern States in
                        the coming political struggles, is, we think, so plain that they cannot go
                        amiss. But two political parties at present divide the nation, and the South
                        must choose between them. One, the Radical disunion faction which threatens
                        the utter destruction of the country, and the establishment of a hideous
                        irresponsible mob despotism upon the ruins of a free Constitutional
                        Republic; the other is composed of all those who are opposed to the
                        destructive policy of this faction, and it is the object, as we understand
                        it, of the Philadelphia Convention to mould and shape into one powerful
                        organization all these, at present, scattered and disjointed elements of
                        conservatism. Such an object must meet with the cordial approval of every
                        well-wisher of the country, and especially is it the duty as well as the
                        interest of the Southern people to forward by every means in their power a
                        "consummation" so "devoutly to be wished for."</p>
                    <p>The advantage to the country of the consolidation of all the conservative
                        elements North, is beyond doubt. The only question for us, is how can WE
                        best advance that end. Taking this view of the matter, we very much doubt
                        the propriety and sound policy of sending a formal delegation to represent
                        us on the floor of that convention. To send men (and if representative men,
                        of such this delegation must be composed) who a little more than twelve
                        months ago, were, in the current cant of the day, rebels of the deepest dye;
                        who fought and labored for the success of the Southern cause and the
                        disruption of the Federal Union; who yet protest the purity of their
                        motives, and see no reason to doubt the righteousness of the cause for which
                        they suffered, and the loss of which they mourn--to meet in council and
                        debate, northern men, the majority of whom, no matter how conservative, no
                        matter how willing to "let the dead past bury its dead," still believe and
                        assert that we have been conscious Rebels, warring against "the best
                        government the sun ever shone upon," and only reinstated to the rights of
                        citizenship by the pardoning power of the President--any attempt to unite in
                        council and debate such irreconcilable elements is fraught with imminent
                        danger to the ends for which we all hope and labor. It is next to impossible
                        that gentlemen differing so radically as to the stirring and all absorbing
                        events of the last five years can meet in political debate without heated
                        and angry crimination and recrimination, which would most probably end in
                        the disruption of the Convention and the consequent failure or at least
                        postponement of the movement for which it was convened. It is hardly
                        probably that moderate Republicans and war Democrats will listen with
                        patience to the enunciation of the Southern idea of the causes of the war,
                        the rights of the States, and the utter and scornful
                            repudiation by the disfranchised States of the right of Congress or any
                            other existing body to proscribe extra constitutional test oaths as the
                            condition precedent to the admission of representatives, and it
                        is absolutely certain that Southern gentlemen could never sit mute under the
                        torrent of tom-foolery about Union, loyalty and treason which must be jabbered by any politician who hopes to
                        catch the ear of the Northern people.</p>
                    <p>For these and other reasons grave doubts present themselves to our mind as to
                        the policy of our sending a formal delegation to
                        Philadelphia. But as the call for the assembling of that convention
                        unfortunately, in our opinion, includes the Southern States, it is incumbent
                        upon us to respond in such a manner as will assure the Conservatives of the
                        North of our earnest co-operation in any movement which has for its object
                        the final settlement of the difficulties between the sections and the
                        restoration, or rather re-establishment of the government on a firm
                        constitutional basis; for the radical despotism now enthroned at Washington
                        can hardly be termed more than a miserable burlesque on constitutional
                        Republicanism.</p>
                    <p>In view of all the difficulties and perplexities of the question, we would
                        earnestly endorse the suggestion of many of the ablest of our exchanges,
                        that instead of sending delegates to the floor of the Convention we should
                        content ourselves with commissioning a few of our best representative men to
                        attend the Convention as a corps of observation, to assure our friends there
                        of our sympathy in the movement, and cordial co-operation in any action
                        which may be initiated on a sound, constitutional platform.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The predictions of a civil war in the North soon to be inaugurated, come upon
                        us thick and fast, and from some of the most prominent politicians of that
                        section. The remarks of Mr. Raymond, says the Lynchburg News of the 21st, copied yesterday, tell us, in so many words,
                        that in the event of a Radical triumph this Fall, such a war is inevitable.
                        Mr. Blair also raises the voice of warning, and foreshadows the impending
                        contest. In addressing the students of Yale College last week, General
                        Sherman said, "I tell you that before you pass from the
                            stage there will be fighting in comparison with which mine will seem
                            slight, and I have had enough."</p>
                    <p>When the contest commences it will be no mere sectional war like that between
                        the North and South, but will be strictly and truly a "civil war." The
                        battle will be among Northern men, neighbors, friends, brothers and
                        relatives, and will be waged with all the intensity of hate, and all the
                        unrelenting ferocity, which ever characterized such internecine strifes. On
                        one side will be arrayed all the elements of Radicalism, all the cohorts of
                        Jacobinism--on the other the friends of the Constitution, of law, and of
                        order. It will not be difficult for the South to decide what part she will
                        take in such a contest.</p>
                    <p>The "signs of the times" at the North--the warnings of her prominent public
                        men--the mad fanaticism which rules the hour--the unconstitutional,
                        illiberal, unjust and aggressive spirit, which pervades the Jacobin majority
                        in Congress, and to a large extent the popular mind of the North, all tend
                        to force upon us the conclusion that this country is fast drifting into
                        chaos of anarchy, and is destined to add another to the long list of
                        examples, which history furnishes, both in ancient and modern times, that
                        republics are short lived. Let us hope that it may be otherwise. Let us hope
                        that the returning good sense of the people of the North, will avert the
                        impending calamity, and save the country from a scene of bloodshed and
                        carnage, unparalleled in the annals of the world.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Speaking of the conduct of the women of the South during the war, Forney thus
                        shows up their iniquities: "Between the roar of the first gun and shriek of
                        the last victim they displayed an indomitable energy, a fertility of
                        resource, a boundless enthusiasm, a contempt for danger, a hatred to the
                        North and a devotion to the South which found no parallel among the sternest
                        who mounted the deadly breach or aimed the deadlier shot. If a political
                        meeting was called and only three attended, one was a woman; if praises,
                        prayers and blessings were required, women performed the pleasing duty, with
                        a feeling and pathos that were exceeded in fervor only by the curses they
                        showered upon their opponents and faint-hearted countrymen; from the
                        beardless youth to the gray-haired sire, there was none able to resist their
                        graciousness, their charms, their smiles, their tears, their love, but above
                        all their scorns, sarcasm and contempt."</p>
                    <p>It never has been the habit of the women of the South to attend political
                        meetings, and we have never heard that they did so during the war. But the
                        other charges brought against them are true--to their immortal honor be it
                        said. The fervent love of country, the devotion to principle, the unaffected
                        piety, the generous self-sacrifice, the calm courage, the womanly
                        tenderness, the unflinching fortitude they exhibited whenever circumstances
                        provoked their exercise, which this man Forney imputes as crimes to the
                        women of the South, will form their crown of glory in ages to come. And
                        long, long after Forney shall have gone down</p>

<b>A Hard Case</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>

                    <p>The Radicals talk a great deal about making "treason odious and loyalty
                        respectable" and Gen. Logan of Illinois, says that such men as Sherman
                        should be made more respectable "morally, politically and socially" than Lee
                        and others. It ain't in the "power of the die" to accomplish that object,
                        even by a Constitutional amendment. Its hard on the Yankees, but some men
                        will be gentlemen and be respected, while others will not.</p>

                    <p>A good man--an humble and consistent Christian, full of years, and conscious
                        of duties well and faithfully performed, has passed from among us. On the
                        28th day of June 1866, Nelson Shelton, a freedman, formerly the servant of
                        Thomas J. Michie, but for many years indulged in the practical enjoyment of
                        his freedom, departed this life at the residence of his former master in
                        Staunton, leaving an affectionate wife, and numerous descendants to mourn
                        his loss. No man in any station could have acted out his part with more
                        fidelity than did the subject of this notice. Kind and affectionate to those
                        around him, honest and upright in all his dealings, a faithful and trusted
                        servant, a loving and indulgent husband and father, he added to all these
                        graces, that of an humble Christian, having a full trust in the merits of a
                        crucified Saviour, and died in perfect peace.</p>
                    <p>His old master who had known him well for forty years and was a witness of
                        his excellencies, renders this tribute to his honored memory.</p>
