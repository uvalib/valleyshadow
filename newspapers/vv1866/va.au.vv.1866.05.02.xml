                    <p>The red-cross flag is set in night--<lb/> Its brief career is o'er;<lb/> And
                        Jackson's sword that flashed in fight<lb/> Shall gleam in war no more.<lb/>
                        His soul has bade the world farewell,<lb/> But long shall page of history
                        tell,<lb/> Of each eventful day;<lb/> When in the light of morn
                        displayed,<lb/> The banner of Stonewall's brigade<lb/> Waved in its proud
                        array.</p>
                    <p>And now the stranger's musing eye,<lb/> Sees on each well fought field,<lb/>
                        Where Jackson's men knew how to die,<lb/> But knew not how to yield;<lb/>
                        The verdant grass luxuriant waves<lb/> In freshness o'er the soldiers'
                        graves,<lb/> And vernal flowrets gay,<lb/> By nature's hand profusely
                        shed,<lb/> Deck where the gallant heroes bled,<lb/> In Stonewall Jackson's
                        way.</p>
                    <p>Oh, gentle be each warrior's sleep;<lb/> And hallowed be his rest,<lb/> Where
                        softest dews of evening weep<lb/> O'er every dauntless breast.<lb/> Each
                        sweet toned warbler carols there<lb/> A requiem on the stilly air,<lb/> At
                        morn and close of day;<lb/> And [unclear] grandsires come to tell<lb/> Their
                        children's sons of those that fell<lb/> In Stonewall Jackson's way.</p>

                    that an "educated" and "respectable" African American made an address to "his
                    colored friends, which some of them lacked the good sense to appreciate." The
                    man said that they should not expect equality with whites, and that he had been
                    discriminated against in his travels all over the world, including on New York
                    street cars. He asserted that the Southern, not the Northern, whites were the
                    best friends of the race. "This black educated man is a native of Kentucky, and
                    in his boyhood was in the family of one of the Breckinridges, who assisted and
                    encouraged him to acquire an education."</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Why is ex-President Davis not released on his parole? Does not President
                        Johnson know that his illustrious prisoner's word would bind him more
                        securely than his prison walls and sentinels, to appear at any place or at
                        any time to answer any charges which might be brought against him? For more
                        than a year--a long dreary year--this great man has been punished; deprived
                        of God's blessings of light, air and liberty; of communion with those
                        nearest and dearest to him, and for what? Certainly not for any crime he has
                        committed, for had he been guilty of any of the base acts which have been
                        charged against him by his enemies; surely in this long time the bloody
                        minded radical majority in Congress, would have easily overcome all
                        obstacles to a trial, and satiated their vengeance by bringing him to an
                        ignominious death. Every man in this country is presumed innocent until
                        after a fair trial he is proven guilty, and when a trial cannot be had it is
                        usual to release the accused on sufficient bail, until such time as he can
                        be brought to trial. Such is the course in ordinary cases, and in this case
                        where the head of a once mighty Confederacy of Sovereign States, is the
                        subject of trial, why is it that our Government shows so little magnanimity?
                        Why if Jefferson Davis cannot be liberated, as others on his parole, is he
                        not released upon bail? Why do not the eleven Sovereign States, which placed
                        him at their head, offer through their Governors and Legislatures to be his
                        bail--pledging "their lives, their property and their sacred honor," for his
                        appearance to answer all and every charge which may be brought against him.
                        Should not the people in every State hold primary assemblies and offer the
                        same? Every effort should be used to wipe off this disgrace to the country,
                        this violation of the laws and Constitution, in keeping this great and
                        unfortunate man in perpetual imprisonment without a trial.</p>
                    <p>Great interest has been taken in "reconstruction," and President Johnson
                        deserves the gratitude of the South for the brave stand he has taken for the
                        Constitution and the right. Our people spare no effort, hold meetings, fill
                        columns of newspapers on reconstruction and the reconstruction committee,
                        negro suffrage, civil rights bills, Freedman's Bureau, <emph rend="italic"
                            >et cetra</emph>; all of which is natural and right, but the greatest
                        wrong inflicted on the Southern people--in the continued martyrdom of their
                        honored and beloved Chieftain--excites but little comment in comparison.
                        While we are attending to other matters he lies languishing in a loathsome
                        prison.</p>

                <summary>The paper challenges the administration's decision to hold Jefferson Davis
                    as a prisoner. The editors argue that since he has not been convicted of a
                    crime, he should be released on bail until a trial might take place. His word
                    should be sufficient, but the Governors of the South could pledge "their lives,
                    their property, and their sacred honor," for his good behavior on parole.</summary>

                        29th ult., between the negroes and the whites, in which fifteen negroes were

                        workings of the "Civil Rights Bill."</p>
                    <p>We warn our people to be prepared for each and every emergency. The negroes,

                    <p>We were pleased to observe, on a recent trip down the Valley, the spirit of
                        industry manifested by each and every farmer. They have been, and are still
                        at work in earnest in "reconstructing" their farms. As a general thing, we
                        believe they have put out a large crop of corn as was customary before the
                        war. The wheat crop looks very promising, and we have no doubt it will make
                        an average crop.</p>
                    <p>We passed a fortnight in Mt. Jackson, (a place noted for its pretty women,)
                        and whilst there, visited the Soldier's Cemetery, North of the village, and
                        were much pleased to see, that those who survived the ordeal which we have
                        just past through, still cherish the kindest remembrance of the last resting
                        place of our honored dead.</p>
                    <p>They sleep, but their deeds of devotion and heroism, will ever live in the
                        hearts of their countrymen.</p>
                    <p>The Cemetery has been enclosed with a beautiful fence, leaving a space of
                        twenty feet square in front, where it is the intention of the Committee to
                        erect a suitable monument to their memory.</p>
                    <p>The gentlemen superintending the work, (T. H. Harris, Walton Farra and F. S.
                        Pennybacker,) deserve much praise for their untiring energy. They were in
                        "Stonewall" Jackson's foot Cavalry, where they learned, "where there was a
                        will there was a way."</p>
                    <p>We believe it is the intention of the ladies, to observe annually, the 2nd
                        day of May, to decorate the graves of our departed comrades, with flowers.</p>
                    <p>The "Virginian" is quite a favorite with the people, and is looked for with
                        much interest. More Anon. R.</p>
