<b>John w. Geary and the Soldiers of the Mexican War</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Though the preliminary reports regarding John W. Geary performance during
                    the Mexican War cast the Republican gubernatorial nominee in a glowing light,
                    this image was tarnished, according to the article, when soldiers from the
                    Commonwealth returned home. Once back in Pennsylvania, Geary was heavily
                    criticized by the men who had served under him. As a testament to their
                    displeasure, a group of returning soldiers drafted a series of resolutions
                    expressing "their deep and abiding indignation of the conduct" of Geary while he
                    commanded the 2nd Pennsylvania Regiment in Mexico.<br>

<b>Who Has Changed</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Quoting from editorials published a year earlier in the Repository that
                    illustrate the Republican journal's approval of Johnson's initial restoration
                    policies, the Spirit's editor charges his rival with hypocrisy for reversing the
                    newspaper's stand.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Veto of the Colorado Bill</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial applauds the veto of the Colorado Bill by President Johnson,
                    who remarked that "great caution should be exercised in the admission of new
                    States, while eleven of the old States remain unrepresented in Congress."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Issue--Negro Suffrage</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite their attempts to obfuscate the party's stand on the issue,
                    Republican leaders in Pennsylvania, states the article, can no longer deny their
                    support for black suffrage. As proof, the writer points to the bill recently
                    passed in Congress, over the objections of the Democrats, mandating universal
                    male suffrage in the territories.<br>
