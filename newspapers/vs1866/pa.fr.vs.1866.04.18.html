<b>The Civil Rights Bill</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Radicals may appear to have triumphed in their effort to pass the Civil
                    Rights Bill, admits the editorial, but, it maintains, their struggle will
                    ultimately prove futile since they have no control over the actual execution of
                    the law. That task belongs to the Judiciary, a branch of the federal government
                    which is not functioning in the former rebel states. It is up to the Radicals,
                    therefore, as to which course they shall choose to pursue-either they must admit
                    the former rebel states back into the Union and grant them full equality or they
                    must "take further and final steps toward degrading the States into
                    Territories."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Facts Worth Remembering</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite having a pro-Southern sentiment prior to the sectional conflict,
                    says the editorial, Harper's Weekly did an about-face following the outbreak of
                    the war, portraying the secessionists in a villainous light. As a result of the
                    journal's apparent decision to become a propaganda organ for the Abolitionists,
                    the piece reports, its popularity among Southerners has plummeted, an outcome
                    the Spirit's editor finds particularly appropriate.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Adjournment of the Legislature</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A brief piece announcing the adjournment of the Legislature, a proclamation
                    the editor relishes since it means that the body is "now powerless" to conduct
                    any "further mischief."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Democratic Meeting</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on the Democratic meeting held on April 10th in the Court House,
                    which the article characterizes as "one of the largest and most enthusiastic
                    political meetings ever held in that building."<br>(Names in announcement:  William Boyd,  Fred K. Smith,  John C. Brake,  Jacob Cook,  William Reber,  Andrew Burgess,  Joseph M. Doyle,  J. L. P. Datrich, Judge  Kimmel,  McD. Sharpe,  W. S. Stenger,  G. W. Brewer)</blockquote>
<b>Wholesome Truth</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article rails against the notion of granting blacks suffrage because,
                    the author argues, they are incapable of handling the responsibilities that come
                    with the franchise. Should they obtain the ballot, he warns, the consequences
                    would surely be detrimental to the South's post-war recovery..<br>

<b>Truth From The Record of 1864</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Using an extract from a debate that occurred in the Senate in 1864, the
                    Spirit strives to convince readers of the Republicans' disregard for the
                    returning soldiers' welfare.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>

<b>County Superintendent</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A letter endorsing the candidacy of Philip M. Shoemaker for County
                    Superintendent, a man, the writer contends, whose election to the post would
                    "give universal satisfaction."<br>(Names in announcement:  Philip M. Shoemaker)</blockquote>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the Richmond Whig, members of that city's "colored
                    aristocracy" showed considerable disdain for the procession of "common niggers"
                    that paraded through Richmond's streets on April 3rd.<br>
