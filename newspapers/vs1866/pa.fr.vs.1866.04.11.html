<b>The Democratic Platform</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A recap of the Democrats' platform for the upcoming election.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>A Revolutionary Congress</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After vilifying the Republican majority in Congress, the article predicts
                    that "conflict is imminent" should the legislative body continue to exceed its
                    constitutionally mandated powers.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Plottings of the Traitors</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>There can be no doubt, announces the article, that the aim of the Radicals
                    is to secure a "sufficient majority in the fragmentary Congress to impeach, try,
                    and depose in disgrace the President." Rather than sit idly by, however, the
                    writer of the piece urges the President to challenge his detractors because
                    their actions threaten to destroy "all the guarantees of the Constitution."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Patriot &amp; Union</blockquote>
<b>Legal Effect of the Proclamation</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With hostilities over, the war can no longer serve as the basis for
                    continued government repression, says the editorial. All of the war-time
                    provisions occasioned by the exigencies of the conflict, including Congress'
                    decision to exclude the rebel states from participating in the Presidential
                    election, must therefore be abandoned.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York World</blockquote>
<b>Negro Suffrage in Pennsylvania</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article notes that, although they supported the measure to grant blacks
                    the vote in the District of Columbia, Republicans in Pennsylvania were less
                    vigilant in promoting the same right for their own state during the last
                    election.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Pottsville Standard</blockquote>
<b>Important Decision by the Supreme Court</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on the decision by the Supreme Court to strike down the ruling that
                    let stand the suspension of habeus corpus for three men from Indiana who were
                    convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to death. The opinion of the court in the
                    three cases will be read during the next term.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Hero of Snickersville</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Having heard that Gen. Geary is running for Governor, the editor of the
                    True Index expresses his sympathy for the people of Pennsylvania. After mocking
                    the Republican's candidacy, the writer explains to his neighbors to the north
                    that, should Geary succeed, the Democrats still have one last "patent way for
                    disposing of their incubus." According to the article, the mere mention of
                    Stonewall Jackson's name will surely send Geary in flight, as it did during the
                    war.<br>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>

                    the President's camp in opposing the Civil Rights Bill.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York Herald</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"The New York Herald, a Republican paper, but now supporting President
                    Johnson in his struggle with the Disunionists, thus forcibly epitomizes the
                    vetoed Civil Rights Bill."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A brief piece declaring the writer's opposition to Gen. O. O. Howard's
                    request to appropriate $11,500,000 for the Freedmen's Bureau, $1,500,000 of
                    which, he maintains, would come from Pennsylvanians alone.<br>
