                        would have had his wants looked after by Generals, medical bureaus and

<b>The Constitutional Amendment</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Contains a copy of the message sent to Congress by the President
                    criticizing that body's vote in favor of the Constitutional Amendment.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Friday last, the President sent to the House of Representatives a
                        communication in response to a resolution of that body, requesting the
                        Executive to transmit the constitutional amendment, recently adopted to the
                        several States for ratification. He announces that the amendment was
                        transmitted to thirty-six States on the 16th
                        inst., but wishes it to be distinctly understood that he does not commit
                        himself to its approval. He thinks it improper that such a radical change should be made in the organic law,
                        while eleven States are unrepresented in Congress and when the Legislatures
                        of the other Sates were not elected with any reference to the questions at
                        issue. </p>
                    <p>The document is considered as a pretty strong protest against the action of
                        Congress, as a matter of course excited the indignation of the Radicals.</p>
                    <p>The following is the President's message: To the Senate
                            and House of Representatives: I submit to Congress a report of
                        the Secretary of State, to whom was referred the concurrent resolution of
                        the 13th inst., respecting a submission to the Legislature of the State of
                        an additional article to the Constitution of the United States. It will be
                        seen from this report the Secretary of State had on the 16th inst.,
                        transmitted to the Governors of the several States certified copies of the
                        joint resolution passed on the 13th inst., proposing an amendment to the
                        Constitution. Even in ordinary times any question of amending the
                        Constitution must be justly regarded as of paramount importance. </p>
                    <p>This importance is at the present time enhanced by the fact that the joint
                        resolution was not submitted by the two Houses for the thirty-six States
                        which constitute the Union, eleven are excluded from representation in
                        either House of Congress, although with the single exception of Texas, they
                        have been entirely restored to all their functions as States, in conformity
                        with the organic law of the land, and have appeared at the National Capitol
                        by Senators and Representatives who have applied for and have been refused
                        admission to the vacant seats. Nor have the sovereign people of the nation
                        been afforded an opportunity of expressing their views upon the important
                        question which the amendment involves.--Grave doubts may therefore naturally
                        and justly arise as to whether the action of Congress is in harmony with the
                        sentiments of the people, and whether State Legislatures elected without
                        reference to such an issue should be called upon by Congress to decide
                        respecting the ratification of the proposed amendment. Waiving the question
                        as to the constitutional validity of the proceedings of Congress upon the
                        joint resolution proposing the amendment, or as to the merits of the article
                        when it submits through the Executive Department to the Legislatures of the
                        States, I deem it proper to state that the steps taken by the Secretary of
                        State, as detailed in the accompanying report, are to be considered as
                        purely ministerial, and in no sense whatever committing the Executive to an
                        approval or a recommendation of the amendment to the State Legislatures or
                        the people.</p>
                    <p>On the contrary, a proper application of the letter and spirit of the
                        Constitution, as well as of the interests of national order, harmony and
                        union, and a due deference for an enlightened public judgement, may at this
                        time well suggest a doubt whether any amendment to the Constitution ought to
                        be proposed by Congress and pressed upon the Legislatures of the several
                        States for final decision until after the admission of such loyal Senators
                        and Representatives of the now unrepresented States as have been or as may
                        hereafter be chosen in conformity with the Constitution and Laws of the
                        United States,</p>

<b>The "Deserter" Case</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

                    which disfranchised deserters, unconstitutional.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Supreme Court of this State at the sittings at Wilkesbarre, on Wednesday
                        last announced a decision in the case of Huber vs. Reilly taken up from this
                        county. The decision in this case pretty effectually settles the validity
                        and vitality of the Act of Congress of March 3d 1864, passed for the purpose
                        of disfranchising deserters from the military service and non-reporting
                        drafted men, and also that of the act of our State Legislature, recently
                        signed by the Governor. In fact squelches the life out of both acts and they
                        are to all intents and purposes as dead as if they had never been enacted.</p>
                    <p>The constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Pennsylvania,
                        both, emphatically deny the right of Congress and the state Legislature to
                        pass and enforce ex post facie laws. Both of
                        these acts were clearly of this class as they were retro-active and
                        undertook to punish in a new mode crimes previously committed. So careless
                        of the dearest rights of citizens were the authors of these enactments that
                        no provision was engrafted in either, for the trial of accused persons
                        previous to the infliction of the penalties; and hence in that they were in
                        conflict with both Constitutions, which are perfectly clear in demanding
                        that a fair and impartial trial and conviction of
                        crime shall precede the infliction of punishment or penalties. </p>
                    <p>This decision settles the question, that a citizen of Pennsylvania cannot be
                        deprived of his dearest rights without due process of law, and without
                        having it established by trial and conviction, that he has forfeited them.</p>
                    <p>So far as this decision affects either party in the number of votes gained or
                        lost, it is a small matter. It was a question of right and party politics, or party success had properly nothing to
                        do with it either one way or the other. It has been estimated that there are
                        in the State thirty thousand voters of the class affected. Whether this is
                        so or not we have no means of knowing, but if even it does reach that
                        number, we doubt if either party has gained or lost, one thousand votes. Let
                        the number of citizens who were to have been deprived of their political
                        rights without trial--upon the mere clerical record of a partisan provost
                        marshal's clerk--be great or small, the importance of the decision of the
                        Supreme Court is of none the less consequence, and the thanks of every right
                        minded, unbiased, and law-abiding man should be tendered to the Judges who
                        made the decision--Justices Woodward, Thompson and Strong, for they are
                        eminently deserving of the noble title--Defenders of the Constitution. </p>

<b>Duncan vs. McConaughy</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With the State Supreme Court's decision to invalidate the law banning
                    deserters from voting, the editor assumes that McConaughy, "the pretended
                    Senator from this district," will step down in favor of his Democratic
                    challenger, Calvin Duncan.<br>

                    <p>The law of Congress disfranchising alleged deserters and non reporting
                        drafted men having been declared unconstiutional by the Supreme Court of
                        Pennsylvania, we presume, as a matter of course, Mr McConaughy, the
                        pretended Senator from this district, will resign his seat at once, so that
                        his successor may be elected at the approaching fall election. We take it
                        for granted that Mr. McConaughy, being a lawyer and "loyal" law abiding
                        citizen. will not persist in holding a seat in defiance of the law, as
                        expounded by the highest Judicial Tribunal in the State. The Supreme Court
                        has decided that the seat rightfully belongs to Mr. Duncan. Mr. McConaughy
                        held it during the last session of the Legislature in ignorance, we must
                        charitably suppose, of the law. This may excuse him for the past, but the
                        law having now been defined by the only competent authority in the State,
                        this excuse will no longer avail him. If he continues to claim it he will be
                        acting the part of a usurper and transgressor of the law. Mr. Duncan does
                        not claim the seat by virtue of last fall's election, though he might
                        properly do so. He and his friends simply demand that the question be
                        referred back to the people for decision in October next. Will Mr.
                        McConaughy have the manly honor to resign and permit the question to be so
                        referred? We ask the Gettysburg Star, his home
                        organ, for an explanation as to the course he intends to pursue. In the name
                        of a majority of the legal voters of this
                        Senatorial district, we make the inquiry.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 4th inst., the disunion faction in Congress succeeded in getting
                        through by a two-thirds vote of what now constitutes that body, the
                        so-called amendment to the Federal Constitution, they have been hatching up
                        for some months past. Scarcely was the fact announced, until the miserable
                        tool who acts as Governor of Pennsylvania--sent a circular letter to the
                        Governor of the other Northern States, requesting the immediate convening of
                        their Legislatures in extra session to ratify and make binding the same.
                        That his letter will be responded to we have not the least doubt, and that
                        negroes will be invested with the right to vote, through the action of the
                        Legislatures now under the control of abolitionism, there is scarcely room
                        to disbelief. Although such actions would be in direct violation of the
                        spirit of the Constitution, and a most flagrant outrage upon the rights of
                        the people and of the States, yet what does abolitionism care for this. If
                        it can make negroes voters, and thus perpetuate its own power, without
                        asking the consent of the white race of our country, it will do it. It
                        scruples at no crime, it heeds no consequences, it regards no interest but
                        that which promises plunder, place and power to itself.</p>
                    <p>As to the illegality of these proceedings, that are to fasten negro suffrage
                        upon the people of Pennsylvania and other States, there can be no question.
                        There is no one foolish enough to assert that representatives in Congress
                        from Massachusetts, from New York or Ohio, have anything at all to do with
                        the qualifications of electors in Pennsylvania. The privilege of designating
                        who shall enjoy the right of franchise, is a privilege which above all
                        others belongs to the people of the different
                        States, and in their State Constitutions the qualifications are laid down.
                        The Constitution of the Federal Government, has no more right to say who
                        shall and who shall not vote in Pennsylvania, that it has to say who shall
                        be Governor, or what his qualifications or pay shall be. It has no more
                        right to force the white voters of our State to march to the ballot box with
                        the negro, than it has to compel him to walk up to the altar and marry a
                        wench. </p>
                    <p>But even admitting that the Constitutions of the United States could be so
                        amended as to make the qualifications f electors in any State, where is the
                        legality of the amendments now proposed to be adopted. Two thirds of both
                        houses of Congress did not propose amendments,
                        for fifty-eight representatives and twenty-two Senators were excluded from
                        voting, and only a bare two thirds of that
                        faction that did vote recommended them. The House
                        of Representatives is composed of two hundred and forty two members, of
                        these, less than 104 supported the "amendment." The Senate is composed of 78
                        [UNCLEAR] members, of these, less than 34 supported them. Can anyone
                        manufacture "two thirds of both houses" as the Constitution requires out of
                        this number? And yet this is the basis upon which abolitionism attempts to
                        commit this fearful wrong upon the people. </p>
                    <p>Did the Constitution of our country need amendments, it would be time enough
                        to make them, when the passions and prejudices of the people, excited by the
                        terrible war through which we have just past, had cooled down--when all the
                        States were filling their proper places in the Union, and peace and harmony
                        again prevailed. It is no mere partisan document, calculated to be alterated
                        and amended to suit every whim of public opinion, neither was it adopted to
                        be patched and pieced, by men who regard not its provisions nor recognize
                        its doctrines.</p>
                    <p>If, however it must be amended--if the action of the thieves, plunderers,
                        wench-worshippers and prostitute keepers, that are acting in the capacity of
                        Congress now, is to be recognized as legal, let the voters or the States
                        have an opportunity of approving or condemning it at the polls. There is no
                        necessity for Andrew G. Curtin calling an extra session of the Legislature
                        of Pennsylvania, at an expense of over two hundred thousand dollars to the
                        tax payers of the State, to ratify these proceedings of Congress. It will be
                        time enough to do that after new representatives are elected upon the issues
                        which the questions produce. But abolitionism, will allow the people no such
                        opportunity of approving or condemning its acts. It fears their verdict, and
                        will move Heaven and earth to forestall their opinion.</p>
                    <p>What will be the consequence of the determination of the party in power to
                        force upon the country at all hazards, its hideous doctrines of negro
                        equality and amalgamation, no one can tell. That it will be a done there is
                        no room to doubt. Already proclamations are written by the "loyal" Governors
                        of the Northern States, convening extra sessions of the Legislatures, to
                        ratify these so-called amendments--and ere the fall elections come around,
                        so far as abolitionism will be able accomplish it, the odious principle will
                        be engrafted into our Constitution. If there be no other result, it cannot
                        fail to open the eyes of the voting masses to the real aims of those who are asking their support for John W.
                        Geary.--He is the representative of the party that is now attempting to
                        foist negro equality upon them against their wishes and consent.--Bellefonte Watchman</p>
