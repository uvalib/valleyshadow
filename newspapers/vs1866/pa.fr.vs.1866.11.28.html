<b>The Political Dead-Lock--Its Outcome</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Despite the Republicans' success in the late Congressional elections, it is
					the Democrats, says the article, who hold the power to release the country from
					the present dead-lock in Washington. Once the Republicans come to understand
					this fact, it continues, the impasse will finally be broken.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>New York World</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Democratic party North and South hold the key of the political
						situation.--They are conscious of their strength, of their responsibility,
						and their duty. The political dead-lock will be terminated by the Democratic
						party, not by Congress, not by the Republican party, not by the North. The
						North is able to exclude the South from representation in Congress. Its is
						impotent to govern the South after its own desires. Nothing but
						self-government is possible in these United States: and for the North to
						govern the South, whether military domination, by territorial rule, or
						indirectly through the imposition of constitutional amendments, is ruin to
						the party that undertakes it. The Republican party has been victorious in
						the late elections in most of the Northern States. But how does its victory
						advantage it? It is able to keep the Thirty-ninth Congress a Rump and the
						Fortieth. It is able to override vetoes. It can legislate to its heart's
						content. But with what result? It can accomplish everything--except what it
						desires; to bend the South to its will by protracted denial of their
						representative rights, or by changes in the federal Constitution. That way
						its own ruin lies, this way it its path is hedged by thirteen States, more
						than one-fourth the number ever likely to form the Union. The Republican
						party control the machinery by which States may be lawlessly excluded from
						Congress, and every hour that exclusion is prolonged undermines their own
						strength. The Democratic party control the machinery by which constitutional
						amendments are defeated. Besides the ten excluded States which led by
						Georgia, will refuse assent to the Rump's amendments, and alone suffice to
						defeat them, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware. States always loyal, will
						join in giving them their coup de grace. </p>
					<p>The political situation is therefore a complete dead-lock. This dead-lock, we
						repeat, cannot be terminated by the North, nor by the South, nor by the
						Republican party.--Sections are impotent, and sectional parties are impotent
						in a situation like this. The dead-lock will be terminated by a political
						party, for it is a political struggle; by a national party, for the contest
						includes all parts of the nation; by the Democratic party North and South,
						which is the only national party; by means of a compromise founded on mutual
						concessions, since each of the forces at dead-lock has a complete check-mate
						upon the other; by a compromise proposed by the South, because the
						one-sided, unguaranteed, partisan proposal of the North has been, or will be
						rejected by nearly one-half of the people of the North and all of the people
						of the South; by a compromise acceptable to a majority of the people of the
						South and to a majority of the people of the North the Democratic party,
						namely, which will then and then, as the only national party, as the only
						Union party, as the free-trade, sound currency, and state-rights party,
						recover its natural majority throughout the United States.</p>
					<p>That the Democratic party of the North and South must hold the key to the
						political situation is perceived by their lately victorious opponents. It is
						betrayed, in their absurdly clamorous cries, reiterated after every failure
						to materially diminish its formidable strength at the North, that the
						Democratic party is "shattered to pieces," is "without a mission," is
						"dead." It is disclosed, in their own failure to cohere about anything save
						the fading passions of civil war: it is confessed, this consciousness that
						peace and union can be given to the nation only by the Democratic party of
						the North and South; is proclaimed even, by the organs of the Republican
						party, in their vigilance to watch and their haste to discuss, sometimes to
						misrepresent, the tenatives put forth by the organs of the Democratic
						opinion, North and South, in ascertaining, expressing organizing, in
						ascertaining, expressing, organizing, and moulding the satisfactory and
						final plan for this political pacification.</p>
					<p>A Western Democratic journal, the Chicago Times,
						and an Eastern, the Boston Post, have recently
						discussed this matter tentatively rather than positively, by negatives
						rather than affirmatives. Whereupon follows a chorus of hullabaloos from all
						the Republican press, as if the Democratic party had exploded to atoms and
						were chrystalizing about some novel heresy. But what is it that our Western
						contemporary said: "Will the people in the several States preserve to
						themselves their constitutional right to prescribe the qualification of
						electors and the eligibility of persons to hold office," (both proposed to
						be taken away from the people of the several States and given to Congress,
						and by the Rump amendments, "a power they have rightfully exercised from the
						origin of the government to the present item, or will they yield up that
						power to the possession of a centralized oligarchy in the national capital?
						These are the opposing propositions from which there is no escape. There is
						no other alternative." </p>
					<p>The people of Massachusetts have ever steadfastly refused to allow the
						Southern and Western States to regulate, or in any way to interfere with
						their local institutions and policies. They established impartial suffrage
						when the people in every other State were almost unanimously opposed to it.
						They had the right to do so, and, in exercising that right, neither the
						people in any other State nor the general government had any right to
						interfere. This right the people of Massachusetts will never peacefully
						yield. It is a right which belongs equally to the people of Illinois, of
						South Carolina and of every other State of the Republic. It is this right
						which the Radical advocates of centralization propose to take away from the
						people of the States and transfer to the central government, and in that
						respect, changing our government system from a republic of States to
						centralized despotism."</p>
					<p>We fail to perceive here a political apocalypse. Unless we dream, this
						cardinal constitutional, democratic doctrine; a terse reiteration of the
						argument with which Mr. Curtis opened the late campaign in this State, and
						dealt one of the heaviest blows to the Rump amendments, which amendments
						assail this doctrine on every side.</p>
					<p>The Chicago Times goes on to recommend a State
						Convention in Illinois, for the establishment of impartial suffrage there
						"by the highest and only authority which has a right to establish it--the
						people of the State; thus giving a practical exemplification of its sound
						State-rights doctrine. </p>
					<p>The Times expresses the further opinion that
						"there is no other way in which the people of the several States can avert
						this blow, aimed at their dearest rights, but by proceeding without delay to
						exercise these rights Massachusetts has done, by the establishment of
						impartial suffrage. The opinion of the Times,
						however, is subject to its own remark in a preceding paragraph: "The
						representatives of South Carolina or of Massachusetts may understand, the
						wants and interests of the people in their own State better than the
						representatives of Illinois or California understand them; and is subject
						also to the criticism that neither New York, nor South Carolina, nor
						Georgia, nor Illinois has to fear or to avert any blow from any quarter
						against the State right to control suffrage whilst thirteen is more than
						one-fourth of fifty-one. </p>
					<p>When Dogberry commanded his constables to comprehend "all vagrom men," it was
						asked him, "How if they will not stop," and the reply of Dogberry was, "Then
						let them go in God's name." However, judged not harshly as the expedient of
						political cowardice to save State rights by voluntary surrender of them, but
						judged fairly as a proposition of sound political reform to the homogeneous
						and enlightened people of a noble State, this recommendation of impartial
						suffrage to people of Illinois seems to us sagacious and prudent and in the
						direction of democratic freedom and equality; but of that the people of
						Illinois will judge for themselves.</p>
					<p>The Boston Post, too, which has perceived the
						benefits of impartial suffrage in Massachusetts, "based on citizenship,
						taxation, and a certain degree of intelligence, would be glad to see it
						adopted by every State in the Union;" "because, "a rule of that sort is too
						firmly fixed in justice and equality to be shaken," </p>
					<p>"But adoption is another matter from enforcement. We are at perfect liberty
						to discuss this matter within those limits by which our own political power
						is bounded; and we may set forth as noble illustration of our convictions as
						a local example will admit; but it is not allowed us to combine in Congress
						and compel either States to follow that example
						though it were the perfection of reason in itself and the ne puls ultra of justice and morality." </p>
					<p>Had the Republican press, before the elections, only given currency, as we
						repeatedly, and in vain challenged them to do, to such arguments as these
						for the Democratic doctrine of a State's right to control its suffrage, such
						arguments as these against the Rump's amendments, which propose to bribe and
						bully and control the States in their exercise of this right, such
						illustrations as these of fidelity to the spirit as well a the letter of our
						constitutional obligations, one toward another, then, possibly, to see
						elections might have had a different result. It is fortunate that they now
						circulate widely and in such unwanted places, both because it is a leaven of
						truth among the Republican masses, and because it prepares the way for the
						final plan of pacification, which they help to form, and with which the
						Democratic party will unclose our political dead-lock, and open our
						political future.</p>
					<p>We desire to be excused for adducing further evidence that the Democratic
						party North and South, hold the key to the political future, in the manner
						in which our own contributions to the result have been received by the
						Republican press. They have not, indeed, been welcomed with joyful
						acclamations such as salute the birth or the entrance of an heir-apparent
						upon the sovereignty of his dominions; nor heralded as the preliminary
						fissures of a coming cataclysm; they seem rather to have won their way to
						general assent.</p>
					<p>Last week we remarked: "When the Southern States have all rejected the
						amendment--as they certainly will--and have thereby demonstrated that they
						are masters of the situation so far as that
						measure is concerned, we trust they will, by some method
							of joint action, make a counter proposition. The possibility of
						their doing this could in no way be so completely frustrated as by the
						blustering, threatening tone of the Times and
							Evening Post which kept telling the people of
						the South that if they do not ratify the pending amendment they will be
						forced to submit to something a great deal worse * * * Concessions may be
						offered which could never be extorted; and we hope that instead of intruding
						further impertinent advice, backed by insolent and irritating threats, the
						Republicans may temper their barren victory with moderation and allow the
						South a litle interval for calm reflection and spontaneous action." </p>
					<p>We need point to no stronger proof of the position of the Democratic party
						than the fact that the New York Times now has ceased its minatory language, contemplates now
						the summary rejection of the constitutional amendment, and so far from
						threatening the South with "something a great deal worse," awaits its
						"counter proposition" with respectful patience. It says: To escape
						misapprehension, however, the South should not content itself with a summary
						and somewhat sullen rejection of the constitutional amendment. If the terms proposed are unacceptable it should suggest
							others." </p>
					<p>Presently the Republican party will learn that neither the State right of
						self-government, nor the right of representation in Congress, will the
						Democratic party of the South or the North permit to be regarded as anything
						less than a right, or suffer to be made the subject matter of any trade,
						negotiation, compromise, or concession whatever. What can be compromised and what can be
						conceded it will be time enough to state when the Rump Congress perceives
						the present dead-lock, and desires release from it.--N.

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Constitutional Union</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>There is a deep and solemn calm manifest throughout the country, evidently
						produced by the threatening state of affairs which will require a most
						deliberate and most scrutinizing investigation on the part of the ablest men
						to prevent the storm which is apparent, if the counsel of the Radical
						leaders shall prevail. No reflecting mind can survey the situation of the
						country without beholding in the future a state of affairs, unless calmed by
						moderation, that is truly alarming, should a conflict take place for the
						supremacy of the Constitution and the principles which gave vitality to the
						nation. Every individual, who is conversant with the history of the
						convention which framed the Constitution, must be aware that it required
						moderation and forbearance in the accomplishment of the grand idea of
						establishing a constitutional government that would meet the wants and
						wishes of the people--not a party--but the whole people. The doctrine of the
						Radicals is that the majority is the nation, and that the minority has no
						rights except those which may be granted, not as a right, but by sufferance,
						which is repugnant to the Constitution and its elementary principles. The
						wise men who framed the Constitution kept in view the rights of the States
						and their political equality, and clearly defined the powers of the
						co-ordinate branches.</p>
					<p>In the division of power, they were particular in establishing the right of
						Representation in the Senate upon the broad principle of equality, which
						gave the same power to Delaware and Rhode Island as were conferred upon New
						York; but the Radical doctrine is the absorption of all power in the hands
						of Congress, which, if carried out, would establish a Legislative oligarchy,
						whose edicts would be the supreme law, thus overriding the Constitution,
						compelling the President to be the mere instrument in their hands for the
						execution of their edicts. Why was the veto power conferred upon the
						President? It was conferred for the express purpose of checking hasty
						legislation, which has always resulted from partisan leaders whose ulterior
						objects were self-aggrandizement, rather than the public good. The treaty
						making power was conferred by the Constitution upon the Executive Department
						of the Government and not the Legislative, which clearly defines the
						principle of the independence of each to the other in the exercise of their
						respective functions. Congress can declare war with the approval of the
						President, but the President and the Senate can make a treaty of peace
						independent of the Legislature, which establishes the fact beyond
						controversy that the Executive Department of the Government is independent
						of the Legislative; but Congress now claims the right to impeach the
						President for the exercise of his constitutional prerogative in checking a
						system of legislation which is not only repugnant to the Constitution, but
						which, if persisted in, will involve the country in an internecine war, the horrors of which cannot be foretold. </p>
					<p>The impeachment of the President for partisan purposes will not be tolerated,
						and the Radical Congress may just as well understand the fact. Whenever it
						shall be attempted, it will be looked upon as an usurpation of the entire
						Government and a declaration of war, which would call millions of men to
						arms in vindication of the Constitution. It would be a war of Constitutionists against Destructives, and, in that war one portion of the country would
						be a unit whose fighting qualities are now the admiration of the civilized
						world, while the other portion would be nearly balanced as to numbers, and
						the fighting material in favor of the
						Constitution would predominate. </p>
					<p>We are in favor, as we have always been, of the peace and quiet of the
						country, that we may move onward in our career of power and greatness; and
						we would as strenuously oppose the Executive Department, if it were to
						undertake to control the Legislative Department, as we do the attempt of the
						Legislative to absorb the whole power of the Government by an attempt to
						impeach a worthy and patriotic President, who is the admiration of the whole
						civilized world, and whose goodness of heart, in attempting to heal the
						wounds of a distracted country, is a proud monument of human wisdom; and,
						when he retires to private life, he can emphatically say, in the language of
						Cyrus, "Bis vincit, qui se vincit in victoria:--that is, "He conquers twice,
						who restrains himself in victory!" It may be truly said that Andrew Johnson
						is this day a living monument of greatness, for he has conquered twice by
							restraining himself in the hour of victory:
						and all he has now to do is to stand by the Constitution and he may rest
						assured, if the Radicals attempt to impeach him, the watch-fires for Constitutional Liberty will illumine his path,
						and he will be victorious.--Constitutional Union.

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>On the 18th instant, the American colonization ship Golconda, sailed from
						Charleston South Carolina, with six hundred and fifty colored immigrants for
						Liberia, in Africa. The emigrants were principally from Georgia and South
						Carolina. They were given free passage, and will be supplied by the society
						for six months after their arrival in Liberia, with provisions and houses to
						live in. From five to ten acres of land (according to the size of the
						family,) are also granted to them.</p>
					<p>Emigration to Liberia would go on most extensively were it not for the
						constant agitation of the negro suffrage and equality question in this
						country by the Radicals and the false hopes of influence and political power
						which are held out to the blacks by truculent and ambitious demagogues. If
						political parties could be induced, with one accord, to drop the negro race
						as an available election lever with which to lift political platforms and
						their damaged freight of plundering demagogues into power, it would be
						vastly better for the black man in every respect. Then all good men could
						unite to better his condition and elevate him, if possible, to a sphere of
						social usefulness. No class nor party of white men desire to keep down or
						crush the black race, however much they may object to the social and
						political equality, and detest miscegenation.</p>
					<p>It is pretty generally admitted that the great majority of the blacks are
						unfitted, through ignorance and lack of intellectual endowment or
						development, for the exercise of the franchise (citing no other reason,) and
						that, if allowed political privileges, they must naturally become the tools
						of designing politicians. The extension of political rights to them would
						therefore prove a positive injury. Without independence or intelligence
						sufficient to combine and sell or use their power, their votes would be a
						constant bone of contention between political leaders and capitalists, and
						between them the negro would be crushed instead of being lifted up.</p>
					<p>Without political rights, however, the negro would not excite the jealousy or
						hatred of any party, and hence much could be done for his material welfare
						that is now neglected or refused. Employment would be furnished him; schools
						would be opened and maintained for his development, and thousands of busy
						brains would devise ways and means to lighten his burden and smooth his
						pathway. Not only this, but colonization schemes would be devised and
						fostered, by which all the colored people in America could eventually be
						transferred to their original African home and established as sovereigns of
						a free and independent Black Republic. This would be infinitely better for
						both the white and black races, and, if we desire peace, prosperity and
						power for the Great Republic, in the future, colonization must be made the
						solution of the negro question.--Patriot &amp;
