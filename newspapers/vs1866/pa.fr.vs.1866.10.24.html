<b>The Proposed Contitutional Amendment--A Letter From Governor Sharkey</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With their representatives barred from participating in the debates over
					the proposed amendment, the public in Mississippi has been denied an opportunity
					to hear where their officials stand on the issue. In an effort to remedy the
					situation, Governor Sharkey has issued an open letter in which he voices his
					many concerns with the amendment and challenges the legitimacy of the proposed
					vote.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>WASHINGTON, CITY, Sept. 17, 1866.</p>
					<p>His Excellency B. G. Humpheys, Governor of
						Mississippi: </p>
					<p>DEAR SIR--The public prints inform me that our Legislature is to be convened
						in extra session on the 15th of October. The proposed amendment to the
						Constitution of the United States as a 14th article, may possibly be
						submitted to the Legislature for its adoption or rejection, and as our State
						has had no opportunity of being heard through her Representatives on this
						interesting subject, and as the people of the State have a right to know the
						opinions of their representatives on a question so vitally important, I
						adopt this method--the only one left me--of giving very briefly the outline
						of the opinion which I entertain in regard to this proposed amendment. No
						doubt the good sense of the Legislature will guide that body to a correct
						conclusion, but the interest I feel for the welfare and dignity of the State
						demand that I should not remain silent, when both are so deeply involved.</p>
					<p>In the first place, I do not believe the amendment was recommended by
						two-thirds of the Congress of the United States. The constitutional House of
						Representatives consists of members chosen "by the people of the several
						States," and the Senate consists of "two Senators from each State." It is
						very clear that a body not so composed, or, in other words, where a
						considerable number of the States are excluded from representation in both
						branches, is not the Congress of the United States. Each State has a right
						to know that all claiming to be members possess the constitutional
						requisites. Mississippi does not and cannot know that the members who
						recommend this amendment were constitutional members of Congress. Nearly
						one-third of the States were excluded from representation in both Houses by
						a majority of members who assumed to be the Congress. If a majority may thus
						exclude States from representation, it is easy to perceive that it may go on
						in the work of declaring States disloyal and in the exclusion of minorities,
						until Congress shall be made to consist only of a few members from a few of
						the larger States with all others excluded. For instance New York and
						Pennsylvania may so manage as to control a majority, and begin by excluding
						first one small State and then another and so on, until all the legislative
						power of the nation is usurped and controlled by these two States, and
						ultimately even by the largest of them.</p>
					<p>When the Southern States adopted the amendment abolishing slavery, the state
						of things was very different; they had not elected or sent members to
						Congress which recommended that amendment. But when this amendment was proposed, they had elected members who appeared
						at the proper time and demanded to be admitted, but were rejected. We are
						not, therefore, to be told that we have recognized this as a constitutional
						Congress. </p>
					<p>But again: The President is a component part of the Legislative Department,
						and the Constitution declares that "Every order, resolution or vote to which
						the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary
						(except on a question of adjournment), shall be presented to the President,"
						&amp;c. Nothing can take effect or be completed until so presented.--And
						the case is not altered because a two-thirds vote is required on amendments
						proposed; such resolution is not a complete legislative act until so
						presented. In no other way, except through the President can such resolution
						be communicated to the States. As the proposed amendment was not submitted
						to the President, it does not amount to a recommendation. It is a nullity.</p>
					<p>But let us look, for a moment, at the provisions of the proposed amendment.</p>
					<p>The first section declares that "all persons born or naturalized in the
						United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the
						United States and of the State wherein they reside." It then proceeds to
						prohibit the States from making or enforcing any law "which shall abridge
						the privileges or immunities of citizens." It does not say what are
						privileges and immunities; that is left for the next Congress to provide in
						virtue of the last section, which declares "that Congress shall have power
						to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article." We
						may find Congress conferring "privileges and immunities" on one class to the
						exclusion of another class; or we may find Congress assuming absolute
						control over all the people of a State and their domestic concerns, and this
						virtually abolishes the State. Perhaps any State that has so little
						self-respect as to adopt the amendment, deserves no better fate.</p>
					<p>The second edition, if my construction of it be right, would probably exclude
						one State from representation in Congress, as I suppose the number of male
						negroes over twenty-one to be nearly equal to the number of white males. It
						is, therefo,e, a mere effort to force negro suffrage upon us, whether we are
						willing or not. Either do this or you shall have no representation. It is
						presumed that our intelligent people would not hesitate long in making their
						choice.</p>
					<p>The third section provides that no person shall hold any office who may have
						heretofore taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United States,
						and who afterward engaged in the rebellion, or who gave aid and comfort to
						those who did engage in it. This is a sweeping act of disfranchisement,
						which would embrace, perhaps, a majority of our citizens; for there are
						probably few who have not, in some way or other, taken an oath to support
						the Constitution.</p>
					<p>Even those who opposed secession, and engaged in the war only under
						compulsion, would be embraced by this provision, as well as the man who had
						given to the hungry soldier a meal's victuals or a piece of bread; and also
						those who, in charity, had given an article of clothing to a suffering
						friend or relative in the army. Such a provision would be so contrary to the
						theory of our government, and so oppressive toward a very large population
						of the Southern States, that it cannot be supposed that those who proposed
						it could have entertained a hope that it would be accepted. They ought to
						have known, too, that such a provision was calculated to endanger the
						existence of the government, as revolutions may always be expected, sooner
						or later, from acts which disfranchised the enfranchised class. If the
						people can not exclude unworthy or undeserving men from office by the
						instrumentality of the ballot-box, then they are unfit for self-government,
						and the sooner they abandon the experiment the better.</p>
					<p>I need say nothing of the fourth section, but the fifth is the Trojan horse
						abounding in mischief. It provides that "Congress shall have power to
						enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provision of this article," which
						may be construed to authorize Congress to do whatever it may desire to
						do.--Under this same provision, attached to the emancipation amendment, you
						have the Civil Rights Bill and the Freedman's Bureau Bill. It was considered
						in the Senate, just as I admonished many members of the Legislature it would
						be, to authorize these odious measures. We should profit by the experience
						it has furnished us.</p>
					<p>I might have greatly extended by argument in support of the many objections
						to this amendment, but have deemed it sufficient very briefly to express my
						opinions, and to leave the subject for the reflection of all who may feel an
						interest in it. I will only add, that should this amendment become part of
						the Constitution, we shall have a very different Government from that which
						we inherited from our ancestors.</p>
					<p>Very respectfully,</p>
					<p>Your obedient servant,</p>
					<p>W. L. SHARKEY</p>

					<p>ELIZABETH CADY STANTON FOR CONGRESS.</p>
					<p>To the Electors of the Eighth Congressional
						District: </p>
					<p>Although, by the Constitution of the State of New York, woman is denied the
						elective franchise, yet she is eligible to office: therefore I present
						myself to you as a candidate for Representative to Congress. Belonging to a
						disfranchised class, I have no political antecedents to recommend me to your
						support, but my creed is free speech, free press, free men and
							free trade--the cardinal points of Democracy.
						Viewing all things from the stand-point of principle rather than expediency,
						there is a fixed uniform law, as yet unrecognized by either of the leading
						parties, governing alike the social and political life of men and nations.
						The republican party has occasionally a clear vision of personal rights,
						while in its protective policy it seems wholly blind to the rights of
						property and interests in commerce; while it recognizes the duty of
						benevolence between man and man, it teaches the narrowest selfishness in
						trade between nations. The Democrats, and on the contrary, while holding
						sound and liberal principles in trade and commerce, have ever in their
						political affiliations maintained the idea of class and caste among men, an
						idea wholly at variance with the genius of our free institutions, and fatal
						to a high civilization. One party fills at one point, and one at another. In
						asking your suffrages--believing alike in free men and free trade--I could
						not represent either party as now constituted. </p>
					<p>Nevertheless, as an independent candidate, I desire an election at this time
						as a rebuke to the dominant party for its regressive legislation in so
						amending the Constitution to make invidious distinctions on the ground of
						sex.</p>
					<p>That instrument recognizes as persons all citizens who obey the laws and
						support the State, and if the constitutions of the several States were
						brought into harmony with the broad principles of the Federal Constitution,
						the women of the nation would no longer be taxed without representation, or
						governed without their consent. One word should not be added to that great
						charter of rights to the insult or injury of the humblest of our citizens. I
						would gladly have a voice and a vote in the Fortieth Congress to demand
						universal suffrage, that thiu a republican form of government might be
						secured to every State in the Union.</p>
					<p>If the party now in ascendancy makes its demand for "negro suffrage" in good
						faith on the ground of natural right, and because the highest good of the
						state demands that the Republican idea be vindicated, on on principal of
						justice or safety can the women of the nation be ignored.</p>
					<p>In view of the fact that the freedmen of the South and the millions of
						foreigners now crowding our Western shores--most of whom represent neither
						property, education, or civilization, are all, in the progress of events, to
						be enfranchised, the best interests of the nation demand that we outweigh
						this incoming pauperism, ignorance, and degradation, with the wealth,
						education, and refinement of the women of the republic. On the high ground
						of safety to the bastion and justice to its citizens. I ask your support in
						the coming election.</p>
					<p>ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.</p>
					<p>New York, October 10, 1866.</p>

<b>Home and Mother</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Home--where father and mother, brothers and sisters, have a unity of
						interest, and sympathy and affection--becomes in mature life the most sacred
						picture</p>
					<p>"That hangs on memory's walls."</p>
					<p>In after years when the destroying angel has crossed the household and
						silenced its familiar voices in their death, when the band of changeling
						time has torn town the woodbines that climbed above its portals and its
						windows, and when its paths echo only the tread of the strangers feet; how
						often does remembrance lead us back to its sacred precincts, and make us
						realize that the home of childhood is the brightest spot, the fairest oasis
						on the desert of life. It is during these moments of retrospection that the
						religious instructions of youth flow back upon the soul. It is then that we
						kneel by the side of her,</p>
					<p>"Whose breast with gentle billow</p>
					<p>Rocked to rest our infant woes."</p>
					<p>And lisp over the prayers she taught us. Poetry has encircled the name of
						"mother" with halos of beauty, but its language will never be adequate to
						measure her influence. To her the first years of our lives belong, and it is
						then in her power to plant seeds of virtue that will bud and blossom in the
						soul when age has pillowed deep furrows in our pale cheeks. The prayers of a
						pious mother are a priceless legacy. They are like the down of heaven, which
						first ascend from the earth to the skies, and then descend to bless and
						revive the unfolding plant. Infidelity may array itself against the Bible,
						and its clamors may be loud among the assemblies of men, but it has not the
						courage to enter the sanctuary of a religious home, and there listen to the
						earnest prayers of a holy mother as she points her children to the throne of
						God.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Radical orators and organs have talked so flippantly of impeaching the
						President, have turned the most solemn and important duty devolving upon
						Congress, the Senate, and the Chief Justice, into such a commonplace affair
						that many people seem to think the business can be hastened over with the
						same facility as a law suit in a county court or a discussion in a country
						debating society. They forget that the Constitution carefully points out the
						routine to be followed when a man elected by the people of the united States
						to represent them and the power and dignity of the nation at home and
						abroad, is to be tried for the willful abandonment of his duty. They
						overlook the fact that all the details of such a trial are presented with a
						minuteness and accuracy that forbids those engaged in it from straying from
						the legal and constitutional path. The bill of indictment must be drawn by a
						certain specified form. The trial must take place before a different body.
						The Chief Justice of the United States must preside, and the Senators must
						be sworn as jurors to act on the momentous occasion, not as politicians, not
						as men eager for an excuse to depose a President by means of the 'block and
						the ax," in order to hold the reins of political power and thus be enabled
						to fill the different situations with their friends and tools, but as honest
						men, as patriots with an eye single to the welfare of the whole people, the
						unity of the States, and the prosperity of the nation.</p>
					<p>The same care taken by the framers of the Constitution in hedging a trial of
						the Chief Magistrate of the nation with due forms and safeguards, extends to
						the specification of the bodies which are to participate in the solemn
						business. The House of Representatives is to prefer the charges.--The 2d
						section, article 1 of the Constitution thus sets forth the manner in which
						this Grand Jury to find a bill of impeachment against the President is to be
						drawn from the nation:</p>
					<p>The House of Representatives shall be composed of
						members chosen every second year by the people and the
							several states, and the electors in each
							State shall have the qualification for electors of the most
						numerous branch of the State Legislature. </p>
					<p>It will be observed that by the provisions of the Constitution's House of
						Representatives, to prefer charges against the President, "shall be"
						composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the "several
						States." Now, will it be contended that a Congress in which ten States of
						the Union are unrepresented, not from compulsion, is such a Congress as the
						Constitution contemplated to bring charges against the President, and send
						them to the Senate? If the ten States mentioned neglected to send delegates
						to Congress; if they voluntarily refused to participate in the legislative
						affairs of the nation; if they surrendered their rights by a free will
						choice, the case would be different. But they are now asking to have their
						members of Congress admitted. That request has been refused, and a sectional
						majority has deprived Congress of power, under the Constitution, to prefer
						charges against the President, because that body is not composed of members
						chosen by the people comprising the "several State" of the Federal Union.</p>
					<p>But if the charges could be preferred, is the Senate of the United States
						such a body as can be constituted a court to try and sentence the President?
						Article 1, section 3 of the Constitution thus declares what shall constitute
						a legal Senate:</p>
					<p>The Senate of the United States shall be composed
						of two Senators from each State, chosen by the
						Legislature thereof, for six years, and each
						Senator shall have one vote. </p>
					<p>Senators are now absent from ten States of the Union. They have been elected
						and have presented their credentials and claims for admission under the
						Constitution. But a sectional majority has refused their application. Under
						such a state of facts will any reasonable, fair man contend that the Senate
						is composed of two Senators from "each State?" If it is not, then it cannot
						try the President; for the Constitution not only declares that the trial
						shall take place before the Senate, but also specifies how the Senate shall
						be constituted. The jury must consist of two members from "each State" of
						the Union. A less number, unless absent from neglect on the part of the
						people of the several States is fatal to the validity and legality of the
						proceedings.--It would not be contended for a moment that, if a majority of
						the Senators from the Northern States were to say that Maine and New York
						and Ohio should not be represented in the Senate, then the remainder of the
						Senators could proceed in the matter of the impeachment of the President.
						And yet this is a parallel case with that of refusing Senators from the
						Southern States, so far as the constitutional right of a sectional Senate to
						proceed in an impeachment case is concerned.</p>
					<p>It will thus be seen that it is not so easy a [UNCLEAR] to impeach the
						President as the Radical leaders would make a portion of the people to
						believe. The Chief Magistrate has rights which the Constitution guards, as
						well as the people. The Radicals, however, in order to destroy those rights
						and to obtain possession of the office from the moment when the summons for
						the President to appear had been issued, assume the position that the law
						deprives the Chief Magistrate of all the powers and functions of his office
						pending the trial. This is false in law, against all precedent, and
						dangerous in a high degree to the safety and welfare of the nation. If this
						course be endorsed, a political party may prefer articles of impeachment
						against a President at the beginning of his term; the Senate may deprive him
						of the functions of his office, and then refuse to proceed with the trial
						until the end of the term for which he was chosen, thus virtually making the
						election of a President a farce and merging the executive into the
						legislative branch of the nation.--But such is not the law or practice in
						impeachment cases. An officer summoned to appear and answer to an
						impeachment, may make his selection from three alternatives. He may appear
						in person, by his counsel, or he may decline to appear at all, and take the
						consequences as a defendant does in a civil suit. In the case of Justice
						Samuel Chase, of the United States Supreme Court impeached in 1805, the
						Senate, after organizing as a high court of impeachment, adopted the
						following as one of its rules of proceedings:</p>
					<p>10. The person impeached shall then be called to appear and answer the
						articles of impeachment exhibited against him. If he appears, or any person
						for him, the appearance shall be recorded, stating particularly if by
						himself or if by agent or attorney; naming the person appearing, and the
						capacity in which he appears. If he does not appear, either personally or by
						agent or attorney, the same shall be recorded.</p>
					<p>This rule is founded both upon the law and the reason of the case, and should
						govern all future impeachment trials before the Senate of the United States.
						The President may appear in person, by counsel, or he may not appear at all;
						but in no case can he be deprived of the functions of his office until a
						fair trial has been had before such a Senate as the Constitution of the
						United States declares shall try impeachment cases. There can be no mock
						proceedings, no bringing the representative of the people of the United
						States to the "block and the ax," in open violation of all constitutional
						rights and legal precedents. This may be accepted as a fact.</p>
					<p>There are all these obstacles in the revolutionary path which the Radicals
						have marked out. They hope to depose the President and usurp supreme power
						in this country. But it cannot be done by carrying out the Butler
						impeachment programme. The Constitution forbids such an outrage as that
						contemplated, and the President is sworn to uphold and defend the
						Constitution by all the means placed at his disposal. If the Radicals wish
						to rebel against the law, let them make the attempt. Punishment will
						speedily follow any overt acts.--In the meantime, the common sense of the
						country will ponder such facts as those presented, and public opinion will
						see danger in over leaping the barriers of the Constitution in order to
						perpetuate partisan power.--Age</p>

					<p>It is very questionable whether American Radicalism in politics will
						accomplish more for the rights of the citizen and the peace of society, and
						the unity of the country than similar radical reformation doctrines
						accomplished in the religious world, and upon monarchies and other
						republican governments that rose and fell in the past. The doctrines of the
						numerous sects and churches advocated by the adherents of each particular
						persuasion, either prove or disprove the wisdom of their schism from the
						mother church. It is sufficient that many of the most intelligent and
						influential bodies of Christians are reaching the hand to span the chasm
						that separates them from Rome, to prove their desire for re-union. And the
						fate of Rome, of Greece, of France, of the islands--Jamaica and St. Domingo,
						and of Mexico ought to admonish the American people of the imminent danger
						of hastily and inconsiderately changing or altering the Constitution of the
						country. It is controvertible that progress always succeeds "changes of
						laws" and altered regulations of society. The finger mark of human progress
						and peace is frequently turned backward upon the dial of time after wars and
						revolutions. "There is nothing new under the sun but what has been," are the
						words of the wise man, and we vainly suppose that which rises before our
						vision in the vista of time has never had an existence.</p>
					<p>We believe all governments are of God, and they that resist the Government or
						constituted authority, resisteth the ordinance of God, and will bring upon
						themselves swift destruction, either as individuals or as nations.</p>
					<p>It can only be in cases where the rights of the subject or citizen are most
						frequently outraged and the government administered in reverse of the moral
						law of right that revolution can be justifiable, except in the forms
						prescribed by law. American radicalism means revolution, not by peaceable
						means, according to the forms of the Constitution of the country or the laws
						of the States, but proposes to enforce its behests by the sword, fire and
						the surveyor's compass. The little seed was planted in New England and has
						grown a great tree, and we are now eating the fruit thereof. The spirit that
						was formerly clothed with the humility and meekness of the Lamb, has thrown
						off its mask and the full fledged Hyena stands forth demanding carnage and
						blood to satiate its voracity, It can be recollected by men now living that
						the Radical party contains in its organization all the discordant and
						violent factions that have existed in the Republic for nearly half a
						century. The Whig party, Anti-Mason, Know-Nothing, Native American, Church
						Burners, Pings, the People's Party, or all opposed to Democratic rule, and
						now the Radical Republican Party. During the years of war in suppressing the
						insurrection and rebellion of one part of the Union against the National
						Government, and its authority, this party, by craftiness, hypocrisy,
						mystifications and fraud, has coiled itself around the American people,
						almost crushing the life of the Republic itself.</p>
					<p>The charm by which their leaders bind the people will be dispelled, their
						masks torn off, their power broken. They cried loyalty, war for the Union,
						imposed upon the credulity of the people to gain power. and are now become
						Disunionists by denying representation, and revolutionists and anarchists
						and negro-suffrageites. That certainly is a progressive party. The
						principles they advocate to-day they repudiate tomorrow for more ultra
						measures. The last constitutional amendments are not to be a finality of
						their demands. They clamor for the abrogation of the Southern States, for
						Congress to pass their laws; to put down the white citizen and elevate the
						negro over them, and place the political institutions of those States in
						their control. They also clamor for the suspension or impeachment of the
						President. Again we see them calling upon Northern States to interfere in
						Maryland politics, and by force of arms retain a set of unscrupulous Police
						Commissioners, who practically disfranchised the State of Maryland, and
						recently excluded twenty-nine thousand voters in the city of Baltimore, and
						thus placed the city under Radical rule.</p>
					<p>Police Commissioners, it seems, are appointed or elected by the Legislature
						of Maryland, and are responsible to the Legislature of the Governor of the
						State for their official conduct. These Commissioners appoint the Judges of
						Elections, and as is alleged, they have been guilty of gross official
						misconduct, and will therefore be removed by the Governor, the only person
						that has authority conferred upon him by the Legislature to remove them in
						the absence of the Legislative session. Forney sees the end of Radical rule.
						He endorses resistance unto blook; would excite an insurrection in Maryland,
						and if Governor Swan should prove unable to restore order and maintain the
						law, and should call upon the President for aid to restore order and
						suppress the insurrection, then Pennsylvania and the whole North are to take
						sides and prevent the President from doing Constitutional duty.</p>
					<p>Forney uses his usual sophistry to mislead the people into error. He argues
						that neither the Governor nor the Legislature has the right to remove the
						Commissioners without trial before a Court to convict them of official
						misconduct. He errs greatly.--Those Commissioners are only amenable to the
						power that appoints, that is the Legislature and the Governor. Suppose those
						Commissioners were to be tried and convicted by the Court, before the
						Legislature could revoke their appointment; and suppose the Court would
						sustain the Commission--what then? Why the Legislature could never remove
						them without the consent of the Court. Away with such nonsense, the power
						that appoints had the power to revoke, or else the sovereign power of the
						Legislature would be superceded by that of the Court.</p>
					<p>This last dodge of Forney, the generalissimo of the Radical forces, to
						inaugurate civil war, and drag into the conflict the other States of the
						Union, for a purpose merely selfish and political, (for this is a State
						broil in their own borders, which we are not warranted by the Constitution
						to interfere,) much reminds me of Lucifer the fallen angel, that drew the
						third part of heaven in rebellion, from the celestial abode to the pit
						prepared for them. The Democratic party is the only party of constitutional
						law, and Andrew Johnson the defender of the Constitution and the
						Union.--When the Democratic party falls the Constitution falls; when the
						Constitution falls, the Union; When the Union falls, the last hope of
						Democratic Republican Liberty will be extinguished on earth.</p>
