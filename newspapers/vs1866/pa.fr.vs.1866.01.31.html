<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The President, if rumor may be believed, is about to change a large portion
						of the material of his cabinet. In other words, it is said that the
						Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. McCulloch, and the Postmaster General, Mr.
						Denison, are the only gentlemen among his present "constitutional advisers"
						whom President Johnson desires to retain in his administration, and that
						Messrs. Seward, Stanton, Welles, Harian and Speed, will have to give place
						shortly to statesmen more in accord politically when the views of executive.
						This movement is significant. It looks as if the President, who is a shrewd
						politician as well as an honest and resolute man, were disposed to promptly
						prepare for the war upon him about to be commenced by the radicals. He is
						not deceived by the shallow pretence of their newspaper organs that it is
						quite an easy thing to reconcile his sense of day with the ultra course of
						policy demanded of him by Messrs. Stevens, Sumner, Wilson &amp; Co. He
						perceives, as every calm and unbiased mind mist perceived, that their object
						is wholly partisan, no patriotic. He is conscious that the whole object of
						their solicitude is to perpetuate the radical rule, and that they propose to
						use an inordinate anxiety for the welfare of the negro merely to conceal
						that object. It is obvious to them that his reconstruction policy is not one
						, therefore, that can possibly be accepted by these gentleman, because his wish is to advance the interests of the Union,
						and their wish is to secure in power their
						political sympathisers. There is between him and them an "irrepressible
						conflict" in prospect, to meet which they are rallying all their energies
						and all their resources. To counteract their machinations he must surround
						harmony with his own. He must have neither open nor secret abettors of much
						disorganising men and principles in his confidence, and hence the old timber
						in his cabinet must give way to new; the used up material must be replaced
						by something fresh, strong, vigorous, and active--something equal to the
						emergency and to the opposition. </p>
					<p>Whoever may compose the new cabinet, (and we have faith enough in the
						President to feel assured that they will be men of probity and ability,) the
						mass of the American people will not weep any, it is manifest over the
						dismissal from authority of some of the present incumbents. Secretary Seward
						and his "little hell" will long be remembered, we fancy, by those who object
						to verbose diplomacy and despotic rule in a republic. Secretary Stanton will
						never be forgotten as the imperious dictator and vindictive public officer.
						If the anathemas of the widow and orphan exercise any effect )as it is
						supposed they do,) of the anti-soporific kind, Mr. Stanton might
						appropriately become a "sentinel on the watch-tower of liberty," for his
						sleeplessness ought to be marvelous. Secretary Welles, on the other hand,
						will be dismissed with a universal "good night!" to his Rip Van Winkelism by
						the nation, for all parties unite in [unclear]promoting[unclear] him too
						[unclear]moutnolently[unclear] imbecile to merit even hostility. Like a
						helpless innocent, he left his official duties entirely to the care of
						Assistant Secretary Fox, who used his power not only to amass wealth, but to
						persecute every naval officer who could not stoop to play the sycophant. His
						entire record is one of arrogance and ignorance, oppression and wrong, from
						the initial line to the end of the chapter. There will be a jubilee over the
						removal of Secretary Welles, if only in the general hope of getting rid of
						his more than other self his Fox-y Assistant. Secretary Harlan and Attorney
						General Speed are only known as the convenient representatives of the
						radical interest in the Cabinet, and as heads of departments ready as any
						time to sacrifices all other considerations in order to exemplarily carry
						out his behest of their partisan superiors. Their dispossession will be a
						relief to the entire community. In sooth, the gentlemen whom the President
						proposes to retain are the only ones in whom the people at large
						irrespective of party affiliations, place implicit confidence.</p>
					<p>But whether the President shall, or shall not, re-construct his Cabinet,
						(though we do not clearly perceive how, in view of current events, he can
						well avoid it,) it is impossible for him and his radical opponents in
						Congress to maintain much longer even the appearance of their present
						cordiality. One or the other must yield. He is not the mass to surrender a
						conscientious opinion at the demand of a political faction, and Messrs.
						Stevens, Sumner &amp; Co., cannot abandon their position without a
						sacrifice of party strength almost equal to political suicide. As it stands,
						Thaddeus Stevens may be said to have coerced or cajoled a very large
						proportion of the Republican majority in both Houses of Congress, into the
						adoption of his programme for making ex-Secretary Chase, no Chief Justice of
						the United States Supreme Court, the next President. That programme
						especially excludes the reconstructed Southern States from all
						representation in Congress until they consent to bestow the elective
						franchise on their late slaves. The President denies the right of Congress
						to dictate to any state its principle of local suffrage, and insists on
						recognizing the right of every State to congressional representation as soon
						as, by its acts, it has established its loyalty to the federal constitution.
						The difference between these two programmes is vital and irreconcilable.
						Hence the radicals cannot pretend to carry our their programme much farther
						without placing themselves in an attitude of direct hostility to both the
						President and General Grant. In that case the President would naturally
						decline to bestow office on his opponents, and the fight would become at
						once, earnest and uncompromising.</p>
					<p>The Republicans, as a party, are hardly willing, it may safely be affirmed,
						to transfer, the man they themselves elected to his place at the had of the
						nation, to the arms of the Democrats. And yet, should it come to an open
						breach between the radicals and the Administration that will be the
						inevitable result.--Allentown Democrat</p>

					<p>COL. A. K. McCLURE, in the Franklin Repository,
						charges that the Union men in Congress agreed with Coffroth, the Democratic
						representative in Congress form the 16th District, if he voted for the
						Constitutional amendment abolishing slavery, they would support him against
						Koonta, the Republican, contestant for Coffroth's seat. FI this is true, it
						is equally disgraceful on both sides, because it disfranchises a people of a
						district. Will Col. McClure make the facts public?--Harrisburg Telegraph.</p>
					<p>No, we think not. He has'nt any facts.</p>
					<p>It would be hard to find a Government as excellent in all its forms and
						detail as our own. It is no idle boast, so long as the principles upon which
						our Government is founded are abhored to that it is the best the world ever
						saw; on the sun ever shone upon. It deserves all the praises for the
						excellence that it receives. It has been tried, and, when the Constitution
						has been regarded, it has faithfully fulfilled its part towards protecting
						the rights and liberties of the citizen. Indeed, all invasions of these
						rights have sprung from a departure from the Constitution.</p>
					<p>We have had to feel that a charter of right is of itself but a dead
						instrument unless, its provisions are regarded. We find that not only wise
						and good men are necessary to frame the instrument, but men equally wise and
						good are needed to carry it out.</p>
					<p>The rejection of the Southern members of Congress striked us as the most
						glaring departure from the spirit of the Constitution, and it is worse,
						because a technical use of the power of Congress over the matter prevents
						any remedy. When the power of judging the qualifications of its member was
						granted, no one supposed that use could or would be made of it to exclude
						the members from one-third of the States. There is more involved than the
						treacherous consequences of an exclusion. It violates the vital principle
						upon which the Constitution is built, and under which the Government itself
						exists. That is that taxation and representation go together. Now if those
						States are not represented, it is out of the question that they should be
						taxed. The Government, however does not recognise this principle. The system
						of taxation is pushed on a firmly as if there was a full representation from
						the Southern States.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Some jackass (it is not worth while to look up his name) has introduced in
						Congress's bill to make counterfeiting a crime punishable with death. At
						least these radicals are consistent; the programs for which they labor and
						sweat is generally such as this--a violent shoving back of the slow moving
						hands on the dial-plate of civilization.</p>
					<p>The Washington Chronicle is the appropriate
						advocate of this last legislative absurdity: </p>
					<p>"The crime of counterfeiting the national currency justifies the punishment
						of death. The national credit is at stake. The perpetuity of the government
						is at stake. The life of the nation is paramount to all other
						considerations.</p>
					<p>"Such is the perfection to which the arts have attained in the present day
						that it is impossible to guard against the skill of the counterfeiter. This
						arch enemy of credit is assisted in his diabolical
							schemes by the god of day, and photography becomes his willing
						slave. No limit can be made to his dominion, and his victims are
						spread all over a continent. Widows and orphans, the artisans and the
						merchant, swell the number of those sacrificed at the shrine of his avarice.
						Such a crime as this, therefore, cannot be pardoned or slightly treated; it
						must be expiated by the life of the perpetrator. </p>
					<p>"Is treason the highest crime? Then is this also, for it is the quintessence
						of treason, and works the same destructive results."</p>
					<p>Here is the same old major premise: "the life of the nation," which
						Republicans found so handy in counterfeiting argument with, for the last
						four years. Major: The the life of the nation is
						paramount to all other considerations. Minor:
						Doubting the divinity of Stanton, no voting the Republican ticket; anything
						the administration or any of its friends happened to want is essential to
						the life of the nation; ergo, some new violation
						of the supreme law, and everybody is a traitor who hinders. </p>
					<p>These poor creatures are so in the habit of reasoning after the above
						fashion, of rushing at once into extremities, that we are not surprised to
						see one of them preparing to put out the light of the infamous "god of day,"
						and to stretch the necks of all photographers. They have become so crazed
						with the habit of identifying their own notions and wills with all
						patriotism and all morality, that they actually can't conceive of disparity
						between the crimes or the punishments of murder and counterfeiting, and must
						measure everything with a gallows-rope, at a period when, year by year, the
						use of the scaffold is becoming rarer in every civilized country.</p>
					<p>Just for humanity's sake we advise these fellows not to stretch the
						definition of "treason." Counterfeiting may not peril "the life of the
						nation," but it is a hurtful crime; and if too many people are persuaded
						that crimes of such a measure full up the guilt of treason, then, despite
						all our efforts to limit their punishment to prison-fare and stone-breaking,
						the law-breakers and the cotton-thieves and the shoddy contractors may come
						to untimely dangling.--N. Y. World.</p>

					<p>Correspondence of the VALLEY SPIRIT.</p>
					<p>HARRISBURG, January 27, 1866.</p>
					<p>A bill for the relief of the citizens of Chambersburg who lost their property
						by the burning of the town by the rebels on the 30th of July, 1864, was read
						in place in the House by Col. Stumbaugh on Monday last. I have not seen the
						bill but understand that it appropriates five hundred thousand dollars of
						the unappropriated funds in the State Treasury for that purpose; the losses
						to be probably ascertained and the fund thus appropriated to be distributed
							pro rata among the sufferers by commissioners
						to be appointed by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. What
						prospect there is for the passage of this bill, it is difficult to
						determine. There seems to be, however, a better disposition manifested
						towards this project, on the part of members of the Legislature and others,
						than there was a year ago. The unwarranted and ill-grounded prejudice
						against the people of the border which then existed, seem to be somewhat
						abated. Quite a number of the leading newspapers of the State which, a year
						ago, were opposed to the remuneration have recently spoken out unequivocally
						in favor of it. The leading papers of Philadelphia and Pittsburg, and some
						in other parts of the State, no urge it upon the Legislature as a duty to
						afford substantial, relief to the citizens of Chambersburg who, form
						accident of location, were made to receive the blow that was aimed at the
						whole State. This is the just view of the case, and if these papers in any
						degree reflect the temper and disposition of the members from their
						respective sections, then your people may reasonably hope that at least
						something will be done during the present session to aid them in re-building
						their homes and re-establishing themselves in business. But until the bill
						comes regularly before the House for its action, when the temper of the
						majority can be more surely ascertained, its fate must remain a matter of
						considerable doubt. </p>
					<p>Resolutions were introduced in the Senate in the early part of the week, by
						Senator Landon, of Bradfor,d endorsing the action of the lower House of
						Congress in passing the negro suffrage bill for the District of Columbia and
						instructing our senators to vote for the same when it comes up before the U.
						S. Senate for its action. This radical pill was a little too bitter and
						black for the delicate stomachs of several of the weaker brethren on the
						Republican side of the chamber. Householder, of Bedford, and Ridgeway, of
						Philadelphia, both dodged on the first and second reading of the resolution.
						They both refused to answer to the call of their names though they were both
						in their seats at the time. But hey will have to toe the mark, under the
						influences of the party lash; when the resolution comes up for final
						passage. Negro suffrage is now one of the declared dogmas of the Republican
						party, and no one henceforth can retain his standing in the party and go
						against the measure.</p>
					<p>These resolutions were to have come up for discussion and final action on
						Thursday but some of the other brethren, in the mean time, having felt
						symptoms of weakness about the knees, on motion of harry White their further
						consideration was postponed until the 31st inst. It has been suggested that
						the postponement was made with the view of getting further instructions form
						their master, Simon Cameron, why owns the Republican members of the present
						legislature--body, soul and breeches. But I have no doubt of their passage
						in the end by a solid Republican vote. Let them go one, they are dong and
						excellent work for the Democracy. "Whom the gods wish to destroy they first
						make mad," and such a shaking of dry bones among the negro-maniacs as there
						will be when Andrew Johnson [unclear], will be a warning to all future
						fanatical demagogues.</p>
					<p>The redoubtable McConaughy, I am told, gave a free supper at the "Lochial"
						one evening this week to his co-conspirators who helped him to a seat in the
						Senate to which he was notelected, at which Simon
						Cameron presided and the voluble, rudite, profoun d, sublime and wonderfully
							modest Bigham made a speech. Whatever the
						subject may have been on which the eloquent Senator expatiated on this great
						occasion, taking his efforts in the Senate as specimens of this powers as a
						logician, I risk nothing in asserting that his arguments were as clear as
						the water in a mud puddle when well stirred with a pole, and as intelligible
						to the understanding as the chattering of an ape. Whether the subject of
							forged election returns entered into the
						discussions of this convivial assembly of hoary headed shoddyites and
						saintly hypocrites, your corresponded did not learn. </p>
					<p>Governor Curtin is much improved in health and is busily engaged in preparing
						his annual message. He expect to have it ready to send into the Legislature
						by next Tuesday, after which it may be reasonably hoped the Legislature will
						got to work energetically and dispose of such matters of legislation as the
						interests of the people of the State may demand. Thus far they have done but
						little that would commend itself to the intelligent judgement of the people.</p>
					<p>As the absorbing matter of interest to your people is the indemnity bill, I
						will endeavor to keep them posted as to its chances for passage as the
						session wears along. Nothing very definite can be known until the subject
						comes up for discussion in the House. The temper of the majority who control
						its action, will very soon manifest itself.</p>

						Treasury not or Bank bill you send, also to write your name yourself, upon one corner of the back of each to
							avoid suspicion, and prevent the return of
						your money and order, dishonored. Be sure and write nothing you do not wish
						the "Trustee" to read, as I have to open all letters received before them,
						and they, finding the DATE and money correct, will send you a "Receipt" that
						will secure to you the "Prize Money" your tickets has drawn. </p>
					<p>You will return this letter to me by mail, as soon as you have received the
						"Prize Money," and much oblige.</p>
					<p>Yours Confidentially, </p>
					<p>LYMAN H. DAVIS <br></p>
					<p>This letter is well calculated to deceive, and is copied and sent out by
						every villain belonging to the infernal gang, each in his own name, whether
						real or fictitious, we do not know.</p>
					<p>Another copy of this letter has been brought to our notice, and is signed
						James P. Dewolfe.</p>
					<p>Thousands of persons have been induced to risk money in this foremost of all
						swindling concerns, but have never heard from it, and of course, never will</p>
					<p>Not satisfied with one mode of swindling, these sharpers turn their attention
						to robbing soldiers' widows, and soldiers' orphans.</p>
					<p>They state by their cards that they are "Bounty, Claim and Pension Agents,"
						and "refer by permission to Hon. James H Colfax, and N. H. H. Haws, of
						Pensions Office, Washington, D. C.</p>
					<p>Having obtained the necessary papers from parties having claims against the
						government, they procure the money through their emissaries, in Washington,
						thereby robbing soldiers, widows, and orphans of the very means of their
						existence.</p>
					<p>These swindlers and robbers have their head-quarters in Connecticut and New
						Hampshire, some having their letters addressed to Newington Junction,
						Hartford County, Ct., and others to West Andover, Merrimac County, New
						Hampshire. Their printed Circulars are headed, "Vernon, Conn.," and some of
						their letters are mailed at Vernon. Inquiries concerning this Swindling
						operation have been directed to the Post Master at the latter place, but he
						remains silent. </p>
					<p>Why do the authorities at Washington allow the people to be swindled and
						robbed by the perpetration of such lawless acts?</p>
					<p>We understand that certain private parties offer a reward of $1,000 for the
						arrest of any one connected with the detestible gang.</p>
					<p>Let the press take hold of the matter, and the country will soon be rid of
						these infamous scoundrels.--Tyrone
