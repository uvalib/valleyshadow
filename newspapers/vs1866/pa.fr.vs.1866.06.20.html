<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>THE extent of the swindle which it was proposed to play on the people of
                        Pennsylvania by certain lordling British financiers is best shown in the
                        fact that the engineer corps which was tramping over the mountains of the
                        central part of the State making surveys in the name of the Atlantic and
                        Great Western Railroad, have not been, and are not likely to be paid for
                        their services. A subordinate in one of the corps informs us that he had
                        resolved no money for months, and that others of his associates were in the
                        same plight. He also states it as a singular fact, that the Englishmen
                        connected with the survey were paid in full.--These are the significant
                        facts, and we hope the lesson which they convey will prove salutary
                        hereafter in protecting the American people from the speculating schemes of
                            foreigners.--Harrisburg Telegraph</p>

<b>Final Passage of the Obstruction Amendment</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In highly critical terms, the article denounces the passage of the
                    Obstruction Bill, describing it as a political maneuver designed to "deceive the
                    people and postpone the admission of the Southern States until after the next
                    election."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Constitutional Amendment intended to keep the Union divided and the
                        Republican party in power, as amended by the Senate, has been passed by both
                        Houses by the requisite two-thirds vote. It now goes to the Legislature of
                        the several States for ratification, requiring the ascent of three-fourths
                        of the same before it can be valid as a part of the Constitution. This
                        assent it can never receive, as is well known by the authors of the scheme,
                        but they have adopted it simply as a political platform, hoping therewith to
                        deceive the people and postpone the admission of the Southern States until
                        after the next presidential election. But the people understand their game,
                        and in October and November next they will have a
                        word to say on this question. If the present indications of the drift of
                        public sentiment can be relied on these negro-suffrage, disunion, Jacobin
                        conspirators against the peace and welfare of the country will then receive
                        a warning whidh they will do well to heed. The people are in earnest in this
                        matter and they do not intend that the fruits of the war shall be lost in
                        order that a rotten, corrupt political party may be retained in power. </p>
                    <p>We need but refer to the closing speech of Mr. Stevens on this Amendment to
                        see the revolutionary purpose of the dominant party in Congress. They are
                        boldly avowed. He says that in his manhood and old age he had hoped to have
                        "all our institutions remodeled," whenever "any fortunate changes should have broken up for a time the
                        foundation of our institutions, and released us from obligations the most
                        tyrannical that were ever imposed in the name of freedom." </p>
                    <p>See the boldness with which the old sinner avows his purpose to revolutionize
                        the Government of our fathers--"remodel our institutions," and the utter
                        contempt he expresses for the work of WASHINGTON, HAMILTON, FRANKLIN and
                        MADISON. He looks upon the blood and carnage of the last five years as a
                            "fortunate" opportunity, for which he had
                        long hoped, to enable him and his party to overthrow the Constitution, break
                        up the foundations of our institutions, and release the country form the
                            "tyrannical obligations" imposed upon it by
                        the founders of the Government. such is the infamous purpose of Thaddeus
                        Stevens, the acknowledged leader of the Republican party, as avowed by
                        himself, with unblushing boldness on the floor of Congress, during the past
                        week. Let the people arise in the majesty of their strength, and [UNCLEAR]
                        from the power of the demagogues and [UNCLEAR] who are seeking to perpetuate
                        their own rule by the subversion of the government itself, and the total
                        destruction of the rights and liberties of the people.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The central Lutheran Synod of Pennsylvania held its annual session recently
                        at Blair, Perry county. Rev. W. H. Diven [UNCLEAR] presided, and Rev. M. L.
                        Cller acted as Secretary. During the sitting of the synod the President
                        appointed a committee of five to report resolutions expressive of the
                        sentiments of the synod on the state of the country, of which our friend,
                        Capt. D. L. Trendler [UNCLEAR], was chairman. It is gratifying to observe
                        the true spirit of patriotism and Christian charity pervading the
                        resolutions. They do credit to the heads and hearts of the members of the
                        "Central Synod," and are in striking contrast with the spirit of bigotry and
                        political fanaticism which of late years has been so shamelessly manifested
                        in our churches and ecclesiastical bodies. We hope this may be the beginning
                        of a better era, when politics will be discarded from the pulpit and
                        synodical convention--when ministers will again preach "Christ and Him
                        Crucified," with all meekness and forbearance, inculcating the precepts of
                        Him who spake as never men spake, instead of the doctrine of men.</p>
                    <p>The following resolutions are the last two of the series unanimously passed
                        by the synod:</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That whereas several pominent causes of
                        estrangement between the States lately in conflict have been removed forever
                        by the arbitrament of the sword, it is our duty now, as country loving
                        citizens, to labor to unite the bleeding sections of the national heart,
                        that our legal Union may be strengthened by moral bonds, and that thus,
                        forgetting the bitterness of the past and remembering only its important
                        teachings, we may be more closely and inseparably united ever hereafter. </p>
                    <p>Resolved, That in this momentous period of our
                        Country's history we look with earnest solicitude to Andrew Johnson,
                        President of the United States, whose patriotism stood the severest test of
                        times that tried men's souls, and that we invoke upon him the blessing and
                        guidance of Almighty God, that, forgetting not the just dignity of the
                        government he entertain "charity for all and malice
                            toward none."</p>

                        understood its meaning, and if it was designed, as is now claimed, not only
                        to give freedom to the blacks but to make political and social equals of
                        them, it is passing strange that he neglected to communicate that fact to
                        his own negroes, but continued to hold them as slaves to his dying day. Will
                        the radical editors who are in the habit of printing windy and ridiculous
                        interpretations of the Declaration be kind enough to explain this queer
