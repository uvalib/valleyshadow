                    <p>HARRISBURG, Feb. 9, 1866</p>
                    <p>
                        To the Democracy of Pennsylvania:
                    </p>
                    <p>The events of the last political canvas are yet fresh in your minds.</p>
                    <p>You announced your unequivocal endorsement of the restoration policy of
                        President Johnson, and denounced the doctrine of negro suffrage.</p>
                    <p>Your opponents affirmed their support of the President, and evaded the issue
                        upon the question of suffrage.</p>
                    <p>A powerful organization, large official patronage and an unscrupulous use of
                        money, secured to them the victory.</p>
                    <p>The record of the past month stripe the weak from the face of the victors.</p>
                    <p>They treat with derision the declared policy of the president. They have
                        placed the Government of the Constitution in abeyance, and its legislative
                        and executive functions are usurped by a cabal of men, who in obedience to
                        caucus, govern the nation through the forms of a directory.</p>
                    <p>The right of each State to regulate the qualifications of the electors is
                        denied; the will of the people of the District of Columbia to overridden,
                        and by an almost unanimous vote. The Republican party in Congress and the
                        State Legislature accord to the negro equal political rights with the white
                        man.</p>
                    <p>The initial step toward a war of races has been taken, and a consolidated
                        government looms up in the distance.</p>
                    <p>The tents of the President upon these points are our cardinal doctrines. In
                        sustaining him we vindicate them.</p>
                    <p>Organize in every nook and corner of the Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>Organize to maintain the President, to maintain your principles, to restore
                        the Union, to vindicate the supremacy of your race, and to bring in
                        political oblivion the men who have been false to the Union, false to their
                        pledges, false to the instincts of their blood, and true alone to the
                        madness that rules the hour.</p>
                    <p>By the order of the Democratic State Central Committee.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Quite a number of Constitutional amendments to regulate the basis of
                        representation in Congress, has been proposed in that body. All of them are
                        crude and not likely to obtain the end aimed at. The most stupid is that of
                        Hon. John M. Broomall of this State which is as follows:</p>
                    <p>"That representation and direct taxation shall be apportioned among the
                        States which shall be in the Union according to their numbers, counting the
                        whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed;
                        Provided, whenever the elective franchise shall be denied by the
                        Constitution or laws of any State to any portion of their male citizens
                        above the age of twenty-one years, the same proportion shall be excluded
                        from the basis of representation."</p>
                    <p>The effect of this amendment would be directly the reverse of the object
                        which these men seek--to compel the Southern States to give the right to
                        vote to the freedmen, or else lose members of Congress in proportion to the
                        whole colored population. Mr. Broomall's amendment will not effect this
                        object, but will give the Southern States an increased number of representatives. Thus in South Carolina the late
                        slave population numbered in 1860 over 400,000, which, at the present ratio,
                        of representation, would give three members of Congress for that portion of
                        her population. Now if South Carolina will not confer the right of suffrage
                        on about eighty thousand males old enough to vote, that number under Mr.
                        Broomall's proportion, will be excluded from the basis of representation.
                        Under the present representation of three-fifths
                        this 400,000 is counted only as 240,000, and if the 80,000 males were
                        excluded, it would leave 320,000 who would all be counted and the
                        represented portion would be increased to four-fifths. </p>
                    <p>The mode of compelling the Southern States to give
                        the right to vote to the negroes, would seem to us not to be very
                        objectionable, and we think those States should not be very much averse to
                        it, as instead of losing members, they will gain, and their representation
                        in Congress be increased thereby. Let these Constitution tinkers go on; give
                        them plenty of rope and they will undoubtedly hang themselves.</p>

<b>The Freedmen's Bureau</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>

                    lazy negroes in idleness." Additionally, charges the author of the piece, the
                    legislation would "paralyze the industry of the South" and "retard the sorely
                    needed development of its resources."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Senate has passed the "bill to enlarge the powers of the Freedmen's
                        Bureau."</p>
                    <p>Its provisions cover all the lately seceded States. All this vast area it
                        divides into "districts," these districts, again, are divided into
                        sub-districts, containing a county each, and furnished each with a local
                        agent. This local agent is to receive a yearly salary of $1,500. And, as
                        there are to be nearly a thousand of these new office-holders, the cost of
                        keeping them would considerably exceed a million dollars a year; which in
                        addition to the people's already enormous taxes is, however, by no means the
                        worst feature of this Freedmen's Bureau bill. It aims to throw the whole
                        burden of the support and care of an immense mass of the Southern negroes
                        upon the government.</p>
                    <p>The plan, stated in plain, truthful terms is exactly this: A plan to
                        establish a vast Government Almshouse for
                        negroes; and to provide a thousand more office-seekers with fat and
                        lazy offices. </p>
                    <p>By the provisions of the bill, the Secretary of War is authorized to "issue
                        provisions, clothing, fuel, and other supplies, including medical stores and
                        transportation, as may be deemed needful."</p>
                    <p>That this would practically establish a gigantic Government Poor-house for
                        the negroes, is beyond dispute or denial. Naturally lazy, the Southern negro
                        would at once avail himself of this offer of Government care and support. He
                        has been told by the Abolition emissaries connected with the present
                        establishment that he need have no care for the future; and he believes it.
                        He has been taught to believe that "the Government" would soon seize and
                        parcel out to the negroes the farms and plantations of the South, stock
                        them, and furnish them with all the necessary appliances for easy and
                        comfortable living. General Grant discovered the influence of these
                        mischievous tales among the negroes of every portion of the south; the
                        negroes believe they are to be supported by the government, the fact is
                        abundantly confirmed from all quarters. This measure which has passed the
                        Senate carries out their idea in practice. It would cost the people not less
                        than Fifteen Millions a year, in addition to their present taxes; and its
                        only effect would be to maintain an army of greedy office-holders, and a
                        million or more of lazy negroes in idleness, while its tendency would be
                        directly to override the inhabitants and paralyze the industry of the South,
                        and to retard the sorely needed development of its resources.</p>
                    <p>It is amazing that a measure to force upon the Government the care and
                        support of a million lazy negroes could have passed the Senate even in these
                        crazy times. It can hardly be supposed that such a measure meets any favor
                        from the President. Indeed it seems calculated directly to interfere with
                        and embarrass his policy of Restoration. But it has passed the Senate, and
                        what hope is there that it will be defeated in the House?</p>

                    <p>Of course the resolution was tabled instantly. The Rump Congress finds it

                        varied very much both in merit and interest; as all public efforts will
                        which are for the most part extemporaneous in their character,--at one time
                        full of spirit and enthusiasm, and at another dragging heavily their slow
                        length along. But undoubtedly the main feature of the Association has been
                        its series of Lectures. Here the sustained interest marked the high measure
                        of success. All the lecturers were taken from our own county, and the supply
                        has not been exhausted. As a whole, we have no hesitation in saying, the
                        lectures were of a very high order. To this we can scarcely think of a
                        single exception. Nothing was more evident than the intellectual stimulus
                        which the occasion afforded to many comparatively unaccustomed to such
                        exercise. And such stimulus will not unfrequently bring out a man more than
                        a casual observer would ever suppose to be in him, and more than he ever
                        reckoned on himself. Here is then one of the more decided advantages of such
                        an institution, the opportunity it affords for self improvement, and the
                        salutary necessity of intellectual effort it lays upon some who are gifted
                        for it, and who yet would not put it forth without such a stimulus. Many a
                        man who has figured largely on the broadest arena of the world has been
                        roused to the conciousness of his powers, by some such apparently
                        insignificant occasion. And as a general rule the audience will be
                        interested and profited in proportion to the advantage which accrues to the
                        lecturer himself. The habitually large audiences which have assembled attest
                        that there is really a disposition among us to appreciate intellectual
                        effort. We hope that such an association will be one of the standing facts
                        at least of our winter months."</p>
