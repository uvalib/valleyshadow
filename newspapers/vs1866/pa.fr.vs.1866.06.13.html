					<p>In the New York Times , of the 21st ult., we find
						the following statistics. We furnish them in the language of the Times  correspondent: </p>
					<p>I have collected some interesting facts yet wrapt up in red tape of the War
						Office. I give the totals of the different States, paid into the United
						States Treasury as commutation money during the war. According to the great
						table, the great State of Illinois paid the least, while that of
						Pennsylvania paid the largest sum--the difference being $8,613,400! It is
						difficult to account for this vast difference on any hypothesis which will
						apply alike to all sections. The following amounts were paid by the people
						of the different States for commutation during the war:</p>
					
						
							Main
							$ 640,200
						
						
							New Hampshire
							288,500
						
						
							Vermont
							503,400

							22,500
						
						
							Minnesota
							316,800
						
						
							Total
							$ 26,366,316
						
					
					<p>This sum was collected by the Provost Marshal's bureau, at an expense of less
						than seven-tenths of one per cent., and without the loss of a dollar through
						neglect, accident, fraud or otherwise. It has been disposed of as follows:</p>
					
						
							Disbursed on account of enrollment, draft, substitutes,
								&amp;c.
							$ 16,976,211
						
						
							Balance in the United States Treasury
							9,300,105
						
					
					<p>Certainly it would be impossible to indict an epistle without a reference to
						the "darkey," so I give herewith some facts respecting colored troops.</p>
					<p>The recruitment of men of color by draft and substitution, was exclusively
						under the control of the Provost Marshal General's bureau; but their
						recruitment as volunteers was mainly under the "bureau for colored troops,"
						especially established for that purpose. To present together the entire
						results of these operations, which, however, were produced in the main by
						the action of the bureau for colored troops, the following extract is made
						form the report of the chief of that bureau:</p>
					<p>On the 15th of July, 1865, the date on which the last organization of colored
						troops was mustered in, there were in the service of the United States 120
						regiments of infantry, 12 of heavy artillery, 10 companies of light
						artillery, and 7 regiments of cavalry--in all as follows:</p>
					
						
							Infantry
							96,938
						
						
							Heavy Artillery
							15,662
						
						
							Light Artillery
							1,311
						
						
							Cavalry
							7,245
						
						
							Total
							123,156
						
					
					<p>The foregoing is the largest number of colored troops in service at one time
						during the war. The entire number of troops commissioned and enlisted in
						this branch of service during the war is 186,017, divided as follows among
						the States:</p>

					vehicle to promote the failing fortunes of Geary and the Republicans.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>A bogus Soldiers Convention was held in the city of Pittsburgh, on the 5th
						inst., in pursuance of a call issued by Major General Hartranft, an
						abolition office holder of this State. That this was intended to be mere a
						gathering of abolition fanatics to bolster the failing fortunes of "no
						prefix" Geary was apparent enough from the first. The fact that the call was
						published, paid for, in the abolition papers of the States, while it was
						carefully excluded from Democratic journals was proof sufficient on the
						point.</p>
					<p>But if anything had been wanting to show the utter partisan character of the
						movement, the action of the Convention supplied the deficiency and dispelled
						all doubt on the subject. It was in all respects a packed Convention, gotten
						up to advance the election of General Geary to the Gubernatorial chair of
						Pennsylvania. No difference of political opinion was tolerated in the
						Convention. When a soldier from Berks county, a regularly elected delegate,
						expressed himself in favor of Heister Clymer for Governor, he was
						immediately and summarily ejected from the Convention. Whole delegations
						from several counties were denied admission because they were known to
						entertain sentiments opposed to the disunion programme of Stephens, Geary
						&amp; Co. Such was the character of this gathering, which it would be a
						slander on the brave veterans of Pennsylvania, who periled life and all in
						defence of the Union, to delegate a "Soldier's Convention."</p>
					<p>The resolutions adopted were of the most radical, disunion stamp, denouncing
						President Johnson, Hiester Clymer, the Democratic party and conservative
						Republicans, in language modeled after the vituperative harangues of
						Thaddeus Stevens. The declared the "war a failure," against a restoration of
						the union and in favor of disunion and despotism on the plan of Thad.
						Stevens' "irresponsible Central Directory."--Who will say that these are the
						sentiments of the soldiers of Pennsylvania? It is an infamous libel upon
						their fair name and fame, which they will not fail to resent at the proper
						time and place.</p>
					<p>To show how the soldiers were represented in this Convention, we need but
						refer to the manner in which delegates were elected in our own county. A few
						seedy politicians about town met together in a side room and resolved to
						appoint themselves delegates, and did. There were just as many present, we are
						informed as were required to make a full delegation from this county. The
						meeting, therefore, came fully up to the expectations of its friends. It was
						regarded as a most decided success, which it undoubtedly was, so far as the
						parties present were concerned. But will say one have the effrontery to say
						that the five self-elected delegates from this county in the Pittsburgh
						Convention were in any proper sense, representatives of the five hundred or
						one thousand of honorably discharged soldiers in the county who had no voice
						in the selection? We trow not. Yet these unrepresented soldiers are the real, bona
						fide soldiers of the county--the rank and file who did the fighting. </p>
					<p>And what is true of this county is true of perhaps every county in the State.
						In Cumberland county, where the same game was attempted, the conservative
						and Union-loving soldiers of the county, hearing of the trick, turned out,
							en masse and voted down the disunion
						tricksters by a vote of 150 to 20. The indignant twenty then seceded from the Convention, organized a side meeting of
						their own and elected five of their number as delegates to Pittsburgh, who
						were admitted, as a matter of course.--Here then, we find twenty bolters
						represented in the Pittsburgh Convention, while the one
							hundred and fifty who controlled the regular Convention at
						Carlisle, are refused a hearing. Do you call that
						a soldiers' Convention, where twenty are preferred over one hundred and
						fifty. Oh, shame!</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>CHARLESTOWN, JEFF. CO., VA., June 8, 1866</p>
					<p>MESSRS. EDITORS: The people south of the Mason &amp; Dixon's line have a
						great many annoyances not known to the people north of it. The registry law
						is one of the worst, and promises to be the fruitful source of lasting
						enmity between the two classes.--In this part of West Virginia, just about
						nine-tenths of the former resident voters are excluded, the few voters are
						mainly men from the northern States--army followers--who found a lodgment
						among us after the war. The counties are divided off into townships, and
						each township has its registrar whose business it is to register the voters.
						If these officials were men of known respectability and capacity, the evils
						and injustice attending it would be sufficient, but when they are composed
						as a rule, of the refuse of society, it becomes a nuisance of the greatest
						enormity. The idea for instance of the most intelligent men in the country
						going before a registrar who perhaps cannot spell his own name! To give your
						readers some notion of the workings of this registry law I will state that
						no man is allowed to register if he is known to be of character and
						property; or if he does register he is obliged to prove his loyalty.</p>
					<p>I will mention several names known to many of your readers as staunch and
						unflinching friends of the Union, when it cost something to be such, whose
						property, life and liberty were more than once in jeopardy for their
						adhesion to the old flag--who are required to prove their loyalty--Dr.
						Magruder, A. W. McCleary, William Dorsey, &amp;c, Now I don't know a
						single instance where men of this stamp are not inanited and sought to be
						deprived of citizenship. These were the men who gave character to the Union
						cause in this country--who upheld it in its darkest days. At an election in
						Martinsburg the supervisors of the election, required an oath from Dr.
						Pendleton and one of them gave as a reason that he was an aristocrat. Any
						one at all acquainted in Martinsburg, knows that the last named individual
						has always been known as a Union man of the straightest sect. His brother
						Edmund Pendleton a distinguished lawyer and a member of the convention that
						passed the ordinance of secession, was the only member from this entire
						region, who persistently refused to sigh that fell instrument, was
						imprisoned during the election through fear that he would use his influence
						for the conservative candidates. Is this not a hopeful state of things? If
						we are ever to have peace and prosperity, a different order of things must
						be inaugurated. As it is our country is a pretty good
							chunk of a hell. </p>
					<p>Enough of this, as it is sufficient to fret the gizzard of an army chaplain
						to think of it.</p>
					<p>The wheat here, as a general rule, looks badly, owing chiefly to the freezing
						weather in March and the fact that blue grass had got too great a start. A
						great many farms are almost covered with blue grass--the land not being
						worked during the war. Very large crops of corn have been put out and should
						it be seasonable, we will have an abundance of this great staple. It is now
						exactly twelve years since your humble correspondent left the Keystone State
						for the Valley of Virginia--and this day and hour twelve years ago I indited
						my first letter to your paper.</p>
					<p>Mr. Editor this is my home, but while life lasts I shall never cease to whish
						well for my native State; and should harm threaten her shall be found
						ministering to her necessities like a dutch Uncle to a sick pig!</p>
					<p>OGLETHORPE.</p>
					<p>P. S.--We are watching with breathless anxiety the progress of the political
						contest going on in your State. How will it go? The cause of the Democracy
						is the cause of the entire South. Let every democrat be at his post and the
						most damning defeat ever experienced will be the lot of the negro
						worshippers this fall.</p>
