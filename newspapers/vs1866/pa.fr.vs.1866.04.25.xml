                <summary>During the war, explains the editorial, the government placed severe curbs
                    on the civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution in an attempt to check all
                    treasonous or seditious behavior. And while the measures affected all citizens,
                    they proved particularly onerous for the supporters of the Democratic Party, who
                    were targeted, even persecuted, for their political beliefs. Yet, as difficult
                    as "was the strain upon our free institutions during the progress of the
                    rebellion," asserts the piece's author, "it is harder now" because the Radicals
                    are "subverting the fundamental law of the land, and changing the whole
                    character of our government."</summary>

                <summary>Recently, it is reported, a bill was passed by Pennsylvania's Legislature
                    "prohibiting city passenger railways from refusing to carry passengers on
                    account of their color or race." The vote to approve the measure was split along
                    party lines, with all 43 Republicans in favor and all 31 Democrats opposed.</summary>

                <excerpt>"The leaders of the Disunion party in Pennsylvania want the word "white"

                <summary>Using deceptive tactics, the article predicts, the Republicans hope to
                    secure a majority in the Legislature so that they can implement their radical
                    agenda and grant blacks suffrage. According to the State Constitution,
                    amendments can only be made every five years, which means that following the
                    soldiers' amendment in 1864, nothing can be enacted until 1869. During this
                    time, alleges the author of the piece, the Radicals will entrench themselves,
                    staying as mute as possible on the question of civil rights for the freedmen, so
                    that they can contain all opposition to their plans.</summary>

                <summary>Using a clipping taken from the Patriot and Union that details the
                    situation of a black boy who was taken North by a Union officer and then
                    abandoned to fend for himself, the author of the article castigates the false
                    sympathy of these so-called "humanitarians" who cry out for "free suffrage and
                    social equality," but are, in reality, "the bitterest enemies of the African."</summary>

                <summary>"As the peculiar friends of the negro," contends the article, the
                    Republicans "nullified the plain provisions of the organic law, and violated
                    laws enacted under its requirements." Now, they have violated the "elementary
                    principles of the Constitution, and refuse representation to people who are true
                    to the laws and faithful to the government." "They were against the Union at the
                    beginning," the piece declares, "and they are but consistent in opposing it
                    now."</summary>

                <summary>Suggesting that the current debate on the future of the freedmen may all be
                    for naught, the article refers to a statement made by Gov. Sharkey of
                    Mississippi who, in detailing the present condition of blacks in his state,
                    noted that there are half as many currently there than before the war, a fact he
                    believes illustrates that they are "destined to extinction beyond a doubt."</summary>

                <summary>Claiming that the event was the consequence of abolitionist teaching, the
                    article chronicles the story of a white woman who eloped with her black lover,
                    with the intention of getting married in Harrisburg. The couple's plans were
                    derailed, however, when the girl's father discovered her absence and telegraphed
                    the police in a town along their intended route. The reporter finds the story
                    particularly scintillating because the girl's father is known for his vehement
                    support of the Abolitionists, and had been heard to say that he believed "a
                    negro was plenty good enough for a poor white girl."</summary>
