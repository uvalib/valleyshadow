                <summary>There can be no doubt, announces the article, that the aim of the Radicals
                    is to secure a "sufficient majority in the fragmentary Congress to impeach, try,
                    and depose in disgrace the President." Rather than sit idly by, however, the
                    writer of the piece urges the President to challenge his detractors because
                    their actions threaten to destroy "all the guarantees of the Constitution."</summary>

                <summary>With hostilities over, the war can no longer serve as the basis for
                    continued government repression, says the editorial. All of the war-time
                    provisions occasioned by the exigencies of the conflict, including Congress'
                    decision to exclude the rebel states from participating in the Presidential
                    election, must therefore be abandoned.</summary>

                <summary>Having heard that Gen. Geary is running for Governor, the editor of the
                    True Index expresses his sympathy for the people of Pennsylvania. After mocking
                    the Republican's candidacy, the writer explains to his neighbors to the north
                    that, should Geary succeed, the Democrats still have one last "patent way for
                    disposing of their incubus." According to the article, the mere mention of
                    Stonewall Jackson's name will surely send Geary in flight, as it did during the
                    war.</summary>
