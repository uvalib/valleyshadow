                    eloquent appeal to the magnanimity and patriotism of the North to sustain the

                <transcript>
                    <p>Remember the past glorious history of the South, which for more than a
                        century before the Union and since the union, has illustrated the highest
                        virtues of humanity. The South has given to the nation the peerless
                        Washington, the matchless Henry, the immortal Jefferson, the accomplished
                        Madison, the high souled Clay and the chivalrous Calhoun. Remember that
                        heroism of the sons of the South has made the history of the nation shine
                        with such names as Marion and Sumter and Greene and Jackson--the glorious
                        hero of the Hermitage and the champion of the Union in the days of
                        nullification. If the Union protected and developed the South, nobly did the
                        South pay the Union by the fame of her sons and the virtue of her women. If
                        the South fought against you of the North for four years, she fought for you
                        against the French and Indians, against the British and Mexicans, in all for
                        more than a century.</p>
                    <p>Will not a hundred years of toil and glory in a common cause more than
                        overbalance four years of rebellion--even admitted we were in rebellion? But
                        we were not in rebellion. We attempted to secede, but did not rebel. It was
                        a great social schism, but six millions people could not be rebels, traitors
                        all. We honestly struggled for what we believed to be right. You did the
                        same. You were honest as well as we. The valor of our men, the blood of our
                        slain, and the graves of our dead, all proclaim our honesty in the fearful
                        struggle. We were foemen worthy of your steel. We gave you a fight which
                        illustrated the sublimity of human valor, and the extremity of human
                        endurance. Of all the elements of mankind, of all the virtues which import
                        dignity to man, of all the characteristics of the Christen soldier the sun
                        never shone upon a nobler specimen than Robert E. Lee. A purer patriot never
                        lived than Stonewall Jackson or Leonidas Polk; and their names will be
                        cherished by our children's children, to the latest generation. We refer to
                        these men, not to stir up strife, but to appeal to the people, a <emph
                            rend="italic">great people</emph>, who can afford to be magnanimous to
                        those who have evoked the most herculean efforts which the world has ever
                        seen. We gave you a fight as no other people could have given you--a fight,
                        grand in its dimensions and sublime in its terrible magnitude--and your
                        names are in terror with nations. suppose you unite our Lee with your Grant,
                        our Johnston with your Sherman, our Forrest with your Wilson, would you not
                        be invincible? Suppose you say, they are countrymen, erring they may have
                        been, but we will not spurn them, for none but our countrymen could have
                        fought such battles as Manasses, Shiloh and the Wilderness. Better we
                        welcome you in perfect confidence to a common brotherhood and a common
                        destiny. Such language as this would bring back the life's blood to the
                        sickened Southern heart, and fill the nation with joy. Why attempt to gain
                        us to you by bayonets, when you could unite us so much more firmly by
                        interest and noble bearing? </p>
                    <p>Our fight was such as you may be proud to acknowledge was never fought except
                        by Americans; our surrender so honorable and thorough, has challenged
                        parallel in history and has gained the admiration of the world. Look at Lee
                        and Johnston, and Forrest and Beauregard. What an example they have set;
                        what monuments have they erected for themselves--monuments whose splendor,
                        undimmed by the cloud of fanaticism shines on both hemispheres, and shall
                        continue to grow brighter during the lapse of ages! We have fought the
                        greatest battles in the world, and we have failed, and thoroughly accept the
                        results of the war. By our countless dead, by our desolated homes by our
                        chivalrous men and our noble women, we entreat you, let us have peace. The
                        South is tired of war. Not a man in it desires a renewal of the fight. We
                        have fought to the last man and the last ditch. Do not be afraid of us; we
                        are disinclined to evil, and all powerful for good. WE have statesmen as
                        pure as ever graced a Senate, warriors as brave as ever drew a sword, and
                        citizens as virtuous as ever illustrated civilization; and we offer all to a
                        restored Union. Suppose we could make such an offer to Her Majesty Victoria,
                        or to the Emperior [sic] Napoleon, with what eager grasp they would seize
                        our hands, and with what a cordial welcome they would receive us. But we are
                        not monarchists. The shades of Washington forbid it, and the bones of
                        Jackson would turn in their coffin. No, we have been born and nursed and
                        cradled in the hand of liberty--in it we hope to live and die. We are not
                        going to Mexico or to Brazil; but here by the side of the Father of Waters
                        we shall live and die, battling for the restoration of our native South.</p>

                    party in power white slaves."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>There is to-day in this broad land, says a contemporary, many an earnest,
                        honest working man. breasting the waves of adversity, his stout heart
                        clinging to the picture he sees sway of in the far future, of a home of his
                        own, purchased with savings of his weekly toil. To be sure, to-day he has no
                        savings; the great war debts, with its taxes upon him, eats up all his
                        little surplus. The enhanced price of the necessaries of life, growing out
                        of the paper currency--the financial shinplaster curse upon him and his--he
                        has to stagger under. He has no surplus now; but he hopes on and hopes ever.
                        He sees the little home, and the school house, and the church, and his
                        weekly news journal, and a decent wardrobe, and three good meals a day for
                        him and his--a beautiful dream away off in the distant future. For the
                        present, all is dark and gloomy, and if it were not for hope his heart would
                        sink within him. He struggles on in poverty and self-denial; his children
                        are ragged and ignorant; he works and earns his ten or twelve dollars per
                        week , but the landlord and the butcher, the baker and the coal dealer take
                        all his money--for are they not taxed, doubly taxed, trebly taxed, and he
                        has to foot the bill. He realizes that he, as a consumer, must suffer
                        through these taxes, that the people must bleed at every pore, but for what?
                        Let the complaining taxpayer, who cannot educate his children and feed and
                        clothe them as formerly, read and judge for himself.</p>
                    <p>The Negro Bureau wants, according to the bill reported by Mr. Stevens
                        $11,584,500, for Negro necessities down South for the coming fiscal year.
                        What a sum!--almost equal to the entire cost of supporting the government of
                        the United States thirty years ago! Negro commissioners, $47,500; negro
                        clerks, $12,800; negro printing and paper, $63,000; negro fuel, $15,000;
                        negro wardrobe, $1,750,000; negro food $4,106,250; negro doctoring,
                        $300,000; negro rail road riding, $1,980,000; negro school marms, $21,000;
                        negro school houses, $300,000; negro telegraphing, $18,000, etc, etc.</p>
                    <p>Working white men of the North your families are made by the present party in
                        power white slaves. Your task is placed before you, and it is so plain that
                        you cannot mistake it. You are to toil and sweat so that the negro may have
                        $11,584,500 in comforts, though you and yours die on the [UNCLEAR] through
                        the labor which alone gives this vast sum to the lazy, worthless black race
                        of the South. You need not memorialize the State Legislature for an eight
                        hour a day law. It will be in vain for you to expect higher returns for your
                        labor. You will be compelled to work long and take less pay per day than
                        ever, in order that four millions of indolent, good for nothing negroes may
                        be maintained in idleness at your expense.</p>
                    <p>Since the formation of the Government up to the present hour, the work of the
                        Democrats has always been to repair the political and social damage the old
                        Federal or Tory factionists, whenever they got into power, have uniformly
                        perpetrated. Democratic administrations have always righted the abuses which
                        the innate corruptions of their political enemies, when by accident or
                        chicanery they obtained the reins of government always committed. The great
                        reform we trust, will commence with the present year; but the job in the
                        Augean Stables in former times was child's play to the work now on hand.
                        While the blunders financial, moral and political, disgrace the whole
                        country and are bringing ruin in their train, the true reformers should not
                        be disheartened, but should put their shoulders manfully to the work, and
                        again, as in time past and gone, endeavor to get the old Ship of State once
                        more on the right track with a Democratic pilot at the helm and a Democratic
                        crew on board.</p>

                    <p>The Democratic convention of Somerset county having nominated Gen. A. H.
                        Coffroth, the present member, for re-election to the next Congress, it may
                        be as well for us to announce the fact that Franklin county intends urging
                        her claim to the nomination for that position. She will present before the
                        congressional conference the name of J. McDowell Sharpe, Esq., of this
                        place, and ask his nomination with earnestness, is the full confidence that
                        her superior claims will not be overlooked. Against the propriety of our
                        Somerset friends expressing a preference for Gen. Coffroth for that position
                        we have nothing to say, it is all right and proper that they should do so,
                        but we scarcely think that it is intended by them <emph rend="italic"
                            >seriously</emph> to urge his nomination in the face of the fact, that
                        they had already had the candidate two terms. </p>
                    <p>Since ht formation of the district Franklin county has presented no candidate
                        for Congress, and has acquiesced in the choice of Somerset and yielded him
                        her hearty support. She now presents a candidate and asks from that county
                        the same cheerful acquiescence and support which she accorded Mr. Coffroth
                        on former occasions.</p>
                    <p>The candidate presented by Franklin county is well known throughout the
                        district, and combines in a high degree all the necessary elements of an
                        efficient and reliable representative in our national legislature. Of his
                        high character for ability, integrity and sound Democracy it is not
                        necessary to speak--they are universally conceded.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy of this county urge the nomination of Mr. Sharpe on the ground
                        of his eminent ability and fitness, as well as on the indisputable claim of
                        the county to the nomination. No other county in the district has presented
                        a candidate but Somerset, and as she has had the congressman for four years,
                        she should be satisfied. In view of these facts we hope the conference will
                        give Mr. Sharpe a unanimous nomination, and thereby render certain the
                        election of an able and reliable representative from this district in the
                        next Congress.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>The following is the plan of reconstruction reported by the caucus of
                        Republican Senators:</p>
                    <p>Section 1. All persons born in the United States and subject to the
                        jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State
                        wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall
                        abridge the privileges or immunities of any citizens of the United States,
                        nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property without
                        due process of law, nor deny any person within any jurisdiction the equal
                        protection of the laws.</p>
                    <p>Section 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States
                        which may be included within this Union according to their respective
                        numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding
                        Indians not taxed. But whenever in any State the elective franchise shall be
                        denied to any portion of its male inhabitants, being citizens of the United
                        States, not less than twenty-one years of age, or in any way abridged except
                        for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation
                        in such State shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such
                        male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens not less than
                        twenty-one years of age in such State.</p>
                    <p>Section three being stricken out, the following is proposed in lieu of it:</p>
                    <p>No person shall be a Senator of Representative in Congress, or elector of
                        President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under
                        the United States or under any State, who having previously taken an oath as
                        a member of Congress or as an officer of the United States, or as a member
                        of any State Legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any
                        State to support the Constitution of the United States, shall bave engaged
                        in insurrection or rebellion against the same in giving aid or comfort to
                        the enemies thereof; but Congress may, by a vote of two thirds of each
                        House, remove such disability.</p>
                    <p>Section 4. All obligations of the United States incurred in suppressing
                        insurrection, or in defence of the Union, or of payment of bounties or
                        pensions incident thereto, shall remain inviolate.</p>
                    <p>Section four in the original will be changed to section five, and it is
                        proposed to change that section so as to make it read:</p>
                    <p>Section 5. Neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any
                        debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the
                        United States, or any claim for compensation for emancipation of any slaves,
                        and such debts and obligations and claims shall be forever held illegal and
                        void.</p>
                    <p>Section 6. Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation,
                        the provisions of this article.</p>

                <commentary>"The Philadelphia Daily News, a Republican newspaper which is as well
                    known as any in this State, very plainly intimates that General Geary does not
                    stand a shadow of a chance of being elected. It declares that thousands of
                    sensible Republican[s] know that the platform onwhich he stands will be
                    repudiated by the people of Pennsylvania and the candidate with it. We make the

                <transcript>
                    <p>Why Hiester Clymer Should be Elected Governor in Preference to John W. Geary.</p>
                    <p>1. Because he is more capable to discharge the duties of the office than
                        Geary.</p>
                    <p>2. Because he is a gentleman of fixed and correct political principles, which
                        Geary is not.</p>
                    <p>3. Because he is thoroughly acquainted with the wants and interests of the
                        people of Pennsylvania. Geary is not.</p>
                    <p>4. Because he is opposed to Negro Suffrage and Negro Equality in every shape.
                        Geary is in favor of these outrageous measures.</p>
                    <p>5. Because he sustains the patriotic policy of President Johnson. Geary
                        don't.</p>
                    <p>6. Because he regards the war as ended and desires the people of every State
                        to dwell together, once more, in unity and peace. Geary, on the other hand,
                        has promised to support old Thad. Stevens and Sumner, in their efforts to
                        keep the Union divided and the country in everlasting turmoil.</p>
                    <p>7. Because as Governor, Mr. Clymer will uphold and respect the Constitution
                        of the country and State. Geary will be the tool of designing and corrupt
                        politicians, who will "throw conscience to the d--l" and and have no regard
                        for Contsitutions.</p>
                    <p>8. Mr. Clymer has established an unblemished reputation for honesty and
                        integrity. He is a pure man. Geary can lay claim to no such character.</p>
                    <p>9. Because Mr. Clymer, if elected, will oppose any alteration of our State
                        Constitution. Geary will prostitute the position to have the word "white"
                        stricken from the Constitution, which will give the negroes the right to
                        vote, to hold office, to sit on juries, and to enjoy all the rights and
                        privileges of white people. Wm. D. Kelly, John W. Forney and other leading
                        disunionists have publicly declared that it is their purpose to do this,
                        when they have the power.</p>
                    <p>10. To elect Mr. Clymer would be to return to the good old days of Simon
                        Snyder and Francis R. Shunk. He is descended from an old-fashioned
                        Pennsylvania German family. To elect Geary would be to re-instate into power
                        men of the Thad. Stevens stripe, when plunder and roguery would be the order
                        of the day.</p>
                    <p>No good man--no patriot, should hesitate how to vote next fall.--<emph
