<b>Veto Message</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Contains a copy of President Johnson's message to the Senate, acknowledging
					his decision to veto the Freedmen's Bureau Bill.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"The following is the Message of President Johnson, sent to the Senate
					vetoing the Freedman's Bureau bill:"<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>To the Senate of the United States:-- I have
						examined with care the bill which has been passed by the two houses of
						Congress to amend an act entitled, and act to establish a bureau for he
						relief of freedmen and refugees, and for other purposes. Having with much
						regret come to the conclusion that it would not be consistent with the
						public welfare to give my approval to the measure, I return the bill to the
						Senate with my objections to its becoming a law. I might call to mind, in
						advance of these objections, that there is no immediate necessity for the
						proposed measure. </p>
					<p>The act to establish a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees, which
						was approved in the month of March last, has not yet expired. It was thought
						stringent and extreme enough for the purpose in view in time of war. Before
						it ceases to have effect further experience may assist to guide us to a wise
						conclusion as to the policy to be adopted in time of peace. I share with
						Congress the strongest desire to secure to the freemen the full enjoyment of
						their freedom, and their prosperity, and their entire independence and
						equality in making contracts for their labor, but the bill before me
						contains provisions which, in my opinion, are not warranted by the
						Constitution, and are not well suited to accomplish the end in view.</p>
					<p>The bill proposes to establish, by authority of Congress, military
						jurisdiction over all parts of the United States containing refugees and
						freedmen. It would by its very nature apply with most force in those parts
						of the United States in which the freemen most abound, and it expressly
						extends the existing temporary jurisdiction of the Freedmen's Bureau, with
						greatly enlarged powers, over those States in which the ordinary course of
						judicial proceeding has been interrupted by the rebellion.</p>
					<p>The source from which this military jurisdiction is to emanate is none other
						than the President of the United States, acting through the War Department
						and the Commissioner of the freedmen's Bureau. The agents to carry out this
						military jurisdiction are to be selected either from the army or from civil
						life; the country is to be divided into sub-districts, and the number of
						salaried agents to be employed may be equal to the number of counties or
						parishes in all the United States where freedmen or refugees are to be
						found.</p>
					<p>The subjects over which this military jurisdiction is to extend in every part
						of the United States includes protection to all employees, agents and
						officers of this Bureau in the exercise of the duties imposed upon them by
						the bill in eleven States. It is further to extend over all cases affecting
						freedmen and refugees discriminated against by local laws, customs or
						prejudice. In these eleven States the bill subjects any white person who may
						be charged with depriving a freedman of any civil rights or immunities
						belonging to white persons to imprisonment or fine, or both, without,
						however, defining the civil rights and immunities which are thus to be
						secured to the freedmen by military law.</p>
					<p>This military jurisdiction also extends to all questions that may arise
						respecting contracts. The agent who is thus to exercise the office of a
						Judge may be a stranger, entirely ignorant of the laws of the place, and
						exposed to the errors of judgement to which all men are liable. The exercise
						of power, over which there is no legal supervision by so vast a number of
						agents as is contemplated by this bill, must, by the very nature of man, be
						attended by acts of caprice, injustice and passion. The trials having their
						origin under this bill are to take place without any fixed rules of law or
						evidence. The rules on which offenses are to be heard and determine by the
						numerous agents are such rules and regulations as the president, through the
						War Department shall prescribe.</p>
					<p>No previous presentment is required, nor any indictment charging the
						commission of a crime against the laws, but the trial must proceed on
						charges and specifications. The punishment will be, not what the law
						declares, but such as a court martial may think proper, and from these
						arbitrary tribunals there lies no appeal, no writ of error, to any of the
						courts in which the Constitution of the United States puts exclusively the
						judicial power of the country. While the territory and the classes of
						actions and offences that are made subject to these measures are so
						extensive, the bill itself, should it become a law, will have no limitation
						in point of time, but will form part of the permanent legislation of the
						country.</p>
					<p>I cannot conceive a system of military jurisdiction of this kind, within the
						words of the Constitution, which declares that "no person shall be held to
						answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or
						indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval
						forces, or in the military when in service in time of war or public danger,"
						and that "in all criminal proceedings the act used shall enjoys the right to
						speedy and public trial by and impartial jury of the State or district
						wherein the crime shall have been committed."</p>
					<p>The safeguards which the experience and wisdom of ages taught our fathers to
						establish as securities for the protection of the innocent, the punishment
						of the guilty and the equal administration of justice, are to be set aside,
						and for the sake of a more vigorous interposition in behalf of justice, we
						are to take the risk of the many acts of injustice that would necessarily
						follow from an almost countless number of agents established in every parish
						or county in nearly a third of the States of the Union, over whose decisions
						there is to be no supervision or control by the Federal courts.</p>
					<p>The power that would be thus placed in the hands of the President is such as
						in time of peace certainly out never to be intrusted to any one man. If it
						be asked whether the creation of such a tribunal in a State was warranted as
						a measure of war, the question immediately presents itself whether we are
						still engaged in war. Let us not unnecessarily disturb the commerce and
						credit and industry of the country by declaring to the American people, and
						to the world, that the United States are still in a condition of civil war.</p>
					<p>At the present there is no part of our country in which the authority of the
						United Sates is disputed. Offenses that may be committed as individuals
						should not work a forfeiture of the rights of whole communities. The
						community has returned, or is returning, to a state of peace and industry.
						The Rebellion is at an end. The measure, therefore, seems to be inconsistent
						with the actual condition of the country, as it is at variance with the
						Constitution of the United States.</p>
					<p>If, passing form general considerations, we examine the bill in detail, it is
						open to weighty objections. In time of war it was eminently proper that we
						should provide for those who were passing suddenly from a condition of
						bondage to a state of freedom, but this bill proposes to make the Freedmen's
						Bureau, established by the act of 1865 as one of great and extraordinary
						measures to suppress a formidable Rebellion, a permanent branch of the
						public administration, with its powers greatly enlarged.</p>
					<p>I have no reason to suppose, and I do not understand it to be alleged that
						the act of March, 1865, has proved deficient for the purpose for which it
						was passed, although at that time, and for a considerable period thereafter,
						the Government of the United States remained unacknowledged in most of the
						States whose inhabitants had been involved in the Rebellion. The institution
						of slavery, for the military destruction of which the Freedmen's Bureau was
						called into existence as an auxiliary, has been already effectually and
						finally abrogated throughout the whole country by an amendment of the
						Constitution of the United States, and practically its eradication has
						reached the assent and concurrence of most of those States in which it at
						any time had an existence.</p>
					<p>I am not therefore able to discern in the condition of the country anything
						to justify an apprehension that the powers and agencies of the Freedmen's
						Bureau, which were effective for the protection of freedmen and refugees
						during the actual continuance of hostilities will now, in time of peace and
						after the abolition of slavery, prove inadequate to the same proper ends. If
						I am correct in these views, there can be no necessity for the enlargement
						of the powers of the bureau, for which provision is made in the bill.</p>
					<p>The third section of the bill authorizes a general and unlimited grant of
						support to the destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen, their wives
						and children. Succeeding sections make provisions for the rent or purchase
						of landed estates for freedmen, and the erection, for their benefit, of
						suitable buildings for asylums and schools. The expense to be defrayed from
						the treasury of the whole people.</p>
					<p>The Congress of the United States has never heretofore thought itself
						empowered to establish asylums beyond the limits of the District of
						Columbia, except for the benefit of our disabled soldiers and sailors. It
						has never founded schools for any class of our own people, not even for the
						orphans of those who have fallen in the defense of the Union, but has left
						the care of their education to the much more competent and efficient control
						of the States, of communities, of private associations and of individuals,
						it has never deemed itself authorized to expend the public money for the
						rent or purchase of houses for the thousands, not to say millions of the
						white race who are honestly toiling from day to day for their subsistence.</p>
					<p>A system for the support of indigent persons in the United Sates never was
						contemplated by the authors of the Constitution. Nor can any good reason be
						advance why, as a permanent establishment, it should be founded for one
						class or color of our people more than for another. Pending the war many
						refugees and freedmen received support for the Government, but it was never
						intended that they should henceforth be fed, clothed, educated and sheltered
						by the United States. The idea on which the slaves were assisted to freedom
						was, that on becoming free they would be a self-sustaining population, and
						any legislation that shall imply that they are not expected to attain a
						self-sustaining condition must have a tendency alike injurious to their
						character and their prosperity.</p>
					<p>The appointment of an agent for every county and parish will create an
						immense patronage, and the expense of the numerous officers and their
						clerks, to be appointed by the President, will be great in the beginning,
						with a tendency steadily to increase. The appropriations asked by the
						Freedmen's Bureau, as now established, for they year 1866, amount to
						$11,745,000, and it may b safely estimated that the cost to be incurred
						under the pending bill will require double that amount, more than the entire
						sum expended in any one year under the administration of the second Adams.</p>
					<p>If the presence of agents in every parish and county is to be considered as a
						war measure, opposition of even resistance might be provoked, so that to
						give effect to their jurisdiction, troops would have to be stationed within
						reach of every one of them, and thus a large standing force be rendered
						necessary. Large appropriations would therefore, be required to sustain and
						enforce military jurisdiction in every county or parish from the Potomac to
						the Rio Grande. The condition of our fiscal affairs is encouraging, but in
						order to sustain the present measures of public confidence, it is necessary
						that we practice not merely customary economy, but as far as possible,
						severe retrenchment.</p>
					<p>In addition to the objections already stated, the fifth section of the bill
						proposes to take away land from its former owners without any legal
						proceedings being first had, contrary to that provision of the Constitution
						which declares that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty property
						without due process of law. It does not appear that a part of the lands to
						which this section refers, may not be owned by minors or persons of unsound
						mind, or by those who have been faithful to all their obligations as
						citizens of the United States. If any portion of the land is held by such
						persons, it is not competent for any authority to deprive them of it. If, on
						the other hand it be found that the property is liable to confiscation even
						then it cannot be appropriated to public purposes, until, by due process of
						law, it shall have been declared forfeited to the Government.</p>
					<p>There is still further objection to the bill, on grounds seriously affecting
						the class of persons to whom it is designed to bring relief; it will tend to
						keep the mind of the freedmen in a state of uncertain expectation and
						restlessness, while to those among whom he lives it will be a source of
						constant and vague apprehension.</p>
					<p>Undoubtedly the freedmen should be protected, but he should be protected by
						the civil authorities, and especially buy the exercise of all the
						constitutional powers of the courts of the United States and of the States.
						His condition is not so exposed as may at first be imagined. He is in a
						portion of the country where his labor cannot well be spared. Competition
						for his services from planters, from those who are constructing or repairing
						railroads and from capitalists in his vicinage or from other States, will
						enable him to command almost his own terms. He also possesses a perfect
						right to change his place of abode and if, therefore, he does not find in
						one community or State a mode of life suited to his desires, or proper
						remuneration for his labor, he can move to another, where that labor is more
						esteemed and better rewarded.</p>
					<p>In truth, however, each States, induced by its own wants and interests, will
						do what is necessary and proper to retain within its borders all the labor
						that is needed for the development of its resources. The laws that regulate
						supply and demand will maintain their force, and the wages of the laborer
						will be regulated thereby. There is no danger that the exceedingly great
						demand for labor will not operate in favor of the laborer, neither is
						sufficient consideration given to the avidity of the freedmen to protect and
						take care of themselves.</p>
					<p>It is no more than justice to them to believe, that as they have received
						their freedom with moderation and forbearance, so they will distinguish
						themselves by their industry and thrift, and soon show the world that, in a
						condition of freedom they are self-sustaining, capable of selecting their
						own employment and their own places of abode, in insisting for themselves on
						a proper remuneration, and of establishing and maintaining their own asylums
						and schools. It is earnestly hoped that instead of wasting away, they will,
						by their own efforts, establish for themselves a condition of respectably
						and prosperity. It is certain that they can attain to that condition only
						through their own merits and exertions.</p>
					<p>In this connection the query presents itself, whether the system proposed by
						the bill will not, when put into complete operation, practically transfer
						the entire care, support and control of four millions of emancipated slaves
						to agents, overseers or task masters, who, appointed at Washington, are to
						be located in every county and parish throughout the United States,
						containing freedmen and refugees. Such a system would inevitably tend to a
						concentration of power in the executive, which would enable him, if so
						disposed, to control the action of this numerous class, and use them for the
						attainment of his own political ends.</p>
					<p>I cannot buy add another very grave objection of the bill. The Constitution
						imperatively declares, in connection with taxation, that each State shall
						have at least one representative, and fixes the rule for the number to which
						in future times each State shall be entitled; it also provides that the
						Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each
						State, and adds with peculiar force, that no State, without its consent,
						shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate. The original act was
						necessarily passed in the absence of the States chiefly to be affected,
						because their people were then contumaciously engaged in the Rebellion.</p>
					<p>Now the case is changed, and some, at least, of the States are attending
						Congress by loyal representatives, soliciting the allowance of the
						Constitutional right of representation. At the time, however, of the
						consideration and the passing of this bill, there was no Senator or
						Representative in Congress for the eleven States which are to be mainly
						affected by its provisions. The very fact that reports were and are made
						against the good disposition of the country is an additional reason why they
						need and should have representation in Congress, to explain their condition,
						reply to accusations, and assist by their local knowledge in perfecting
						measures immediately affecting themselves, while the liberty of
						deliberations would then be free, and Congress would have full power to
						decide according to its judgement, there could be no objection urged that
						the States most interested had not been permitted to be heard. The principle
						is firmly fixed in the minds of the American people that there should be no
						taxation without representation. Great burdens have now to be borne by all
						the country, and we may best demand that they shall be borne without murmur
						when they are voted by a majority of the representatives of all the people.
						I would not interfere with the unquestionable right of Congress to judge and
						act for itself of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own
						members, but that authority cannot be construed as including the right to
						shut out, in time of peace, any State from the representation to which it is
						entitled by the Constitution at present.</p>
					<p>All the people of eleven States are excluded; those who were most faithful
						during the war not less than others. The State of Tennessee, for instance,
						whose authorities engaged in rebellion, was restored to all her
						constitutional relations to the Union by the patriotism and energy of her
						injured and betrayed people. Before the war was brought to a termination
						they had placed themselves in relation with the general Government; had
						established a State Government of their own, and as they were not included
						in the Emancipation proclamation they, by their own act, had amended their
						Constitution so as to abolish slavery within the limits of their States.</p>
					<p>I know no reason why the State of Tennessee, for example, should no fully
						enjoy all her constitutional relations to the United States. The president
						of the United States stands towards the country in a somewhat different
						attitude from that of any member of Congress chosen from a single district
						or State. The President is chosen by the people of all the States. Eleven
						States are not at this time represented in either branch of Congress; it
						would seem to be his duty, on all proper occasions, to present their just
						claims to Congress.</p>
					<p>There always will be differences of opinion in the community, and individuals
						may be guilty of transgressions of the law; but these do not constitute
						valid objections against the right of a State to representation, and would
						in no wise interfere with the discretion of Congress with regard to the
						qualification of members, but I hold it my duty to recommend to you in the
						interests of peace, and in the interest of the Union, the admission of every
						States to its share in public legislation when, however, insubordinate
						insurgent or rebellions its people may have been, it present itself not only
						in an attitude of loyalty and harmony, but in the persons of representatives
						whose loyalty cannot be questioned under any existing constitutional or
						legal test.</p>
					<p>It is plain that an indefinite or permanent exclusion of any part of the
						country from representation must be attended by a spirit of disquiet and
						complaint. It is unwise and dangerous to pursue a course of measures which
						will unite a qery large section of the country against another section of
						the country, however much the latter may preponderate. The course of
						emigration, the development of industry and business, and natural causes
						will raise up at the South men as devoted to the Union as those of any other
						part of the land. But if they are all excluded from Congress, if in a
						permanent statue they are declared not to be in full constitutional
						relations to the country, they may think they have cause to become a unit in
						feeling and sentiment against the Government. Under the political education
						of American people, the idea is inherent and ineradicable that the consent
						of the majority of the whole people is necessary to secure a willing
						acquiescence in legislation.</p>
					<p>The bill under consideration refers to certain of the States as though they
						had "been fully restored in all their Constitutional relations to the United
						States." If they have not, let us at once act together to secure that
						desirable end at the earliest possible moment. It is hardly necessary for me
						to inform Congress that in my own judgment most of those States, so far at
						least as dependent on their own action, have already been fully restored,
						and are to be deemed as entitled to enjoy their Constitutional rights as
						members of the Union.</p>
					<p>Reasoning from the Constitution itself, and from the actual situation of the
						country, I feel not only entitled but bound to assume that with the Federal
						courts restored, and those of the several States in the full exercise of
						their functions, the rights and interests of all classes of the people will,
						with the aid of the military, in cases of resistance to the law, be
						essentially protected against unconstitutional infringement and violation.</p>
					<p>Should this expectation unhappily fail, which I do not anticipate, then the
						Executive is already armed with the powers conferred by the act of march,
						1865, establishing the Freedmen's Bureau, and hereafter, as heretofore, he
						can employ the land and naval forces of the country to suppress
						insurrection, or to overcome obstructions to the laws, in accordance with
						the Constitution.</p>
					<p>I return the bill to the Senate in the earnest hope that a measure involving
						questions and interests so important to the country will not become a law,
						unless upon deliberate consultation by the people it shall receive the
						sanction of an enlightened public judgment.</p>

					<p>The Legislature on Wednesday last passed finally a bill imposing a tax on the
						Stock of the banks of the Commonwealth, and also on the gross receipts of
						Railroad Companies. The revenue expected from these sources it is thought
						will be sufficient to meet he wants of the Commonwealth, and real estate is
						exempted from taxation for the State purposes in the future. The following
						is the Act as passed:</p>
					<p>SEC. 1. That from and after the passage of this act, it shall be the duty of
						the cashier of every bank in this Commonwealth, whether incorporated under
						the law of this State or of the United States, to collect, annually, a tax
						of one per centum upon the par value of the stock held by said stockholder,
						and to pay the same into the State treasury on or before the first day of
						July in every year hereafter, commencing on the first day of July Anno
						Domini one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six, and the said stock, shall
						be exempt from other taxation under the laws of this commonwealth.</p>
					<p>SEC. 2. That in addition to the taxes now provided for by law, every railroad
						canal and transportation company incorporated under the law of this
						Commonwealth, and not liable to the tax upon income under existing laws,
						shall pay to the Commonwealth a tax of three fourths of one per centum upon
						the gross receipts of said company; the said tax shall be paid
						semi-annually, upon the first days of July and January, commencing on the
						first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six; and for the
						purpose of ascertaining the amount of the same, it shall be the duty of the
						treasurer, or other officer of said company, to transmit to the Auditor
						General, at the dates aforesaid, a statement, under oath or affirmation, of
						the amount of the gross receipts of the said company during the preceding
						six months; and if any such company shall refuse or fail, for a period of
						thirty days after such a tax becomes due, to make said return, or to pay the
						same, the amount thereof, with an addition of ten per centum thereto, shall
						be collected, for the use of the Commonwealth, as other taxes are
						recoverable by law, form said companies.</p>
					<p>SEC. 3. The revenue derived under the second section of this act shall be
						applied to the payment of the principal and interest of the debt contracted
						under the act of 15th May, 1861, entitled. An act to create a loan, and to
						provide for arming the State.</p>
					<p>SEC. 4. From and after the passage of this act, the real estate of this
						Commonwealth shall be exempt from taxation for State purpose: Provided. That this section shall not be
						constructed to relieve the said real estate from the payment of any taxes
						due the Commonwealth at the date of the passage of this act. </p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The fact is becoming more and more apparent every day, that in the selection
						of Andrew Johnson for the Vice Presidency the Radical Republicans have
						"caught a tartar." They find to their sorrow and the discomfiture of their
						finest hopes, that the President will not lend himself as a tool for the
						accomplishment of their unconstitutional purposes. He stands as a wall of
						fire between them and the Constitution. Chosen by the people to administer
						the Government, he fells that he is acting as a trustee for the nation.
						Bound by his oath to se that the laws are faithfully executed, he is
						determined to fulfill its obligations, but not one step will he advance
						beyond his duty. Not one provision of the Constitution will he allow the
						Rump Congress to violate without his solemn protest. Not one amendment will
						he allow to be incorporated in the Constitution which tends to destroy the
						equality and dignity of the States, if he can prevent it. He has with heroic
						patriotism planted his foot firmly upon the written law of the land, the
						Constitution of the United States, and the Radicals know well that they can
						not bring a pressure to bear upon him, strong enough to move him a single
						inch.</p>
					<p>His utterances have the old Jacksonian ring. The fiat of his indomitable will
						has gone forth. The bold, intrepid spirit evinced in the veto of the
						iniquitous Freedmen's Bureau bill, has awakened a feeling of admiration for
						the President all over the country. Even men who do not agree with him in
						sentiment, can not refrain from commenting in terms of praise upon the
						heroism which he has exhibited in refusing to be bound by the trammels of
						party, and in rebuking the reckless majority of Congress who are riding
						rough-shod over the interests of the white race in order to give undue
						prominence to the negro. They must feel that Andrew Johnson is the champion
						of the white race; that he will not allow this negro-mania which has taken
						such fast hold of the Radicals, to subvert the fundamental principles of the
						Government--in short, that if laws are to be passed for the benefit of the
						black man, they must be in accordance with the Constitution of the country.
						With the skill of a first-class surgeon, he lays bare in iniquitous
						provisions of this bill. His dissecting knife cuts clear through it.</p>
					<p>And yet he does it in no spirit of factious opposition. Impelled by a stern
						sense of duty, he examines the bill carefully, he scrutinizes it closely and
						then points out clearly and succintly his weight objections to its
						passage--weighty, because no careful reader of the Constitution of the
						United States can fail to come to the conclusion that the bill is in direct
						conflict with that old-fashioned and time-honored document. The President
						has exhibited the antagonism between the two with such a master hand that
						the most careless observer must acknowledge it. Why it were enough alone to
						damn the bill in the opinion of all true lovers of liberty that it ignores
						entirely that provision of the Constitution which guarantees to every
						citizen the right of trial by jury. Through the terrible period of carnage
						through which the nation has just passed that right has frequently been
						invaded and swept away at the bidding of fanaticism. It was excused or
						rather over-looked by the American people, who "are tolerant of usurpation,"
						on the ground of military necessity. But that earnest, liberty-loving people
						fondly looked forward to the day when the fierce clash of arms would cease,
						so this dearly-bought right might again be restored and firmly established.
						They know how dear, how invaluable that right is; they blushed with shame
						and hung their heads in mortification when a fanatical party set it aside to
						give place to irresponsible military commissions who were always ready and
						willing to do the behests of arbitrary power. The day so long-looked for,
						has at last come when the Executive of the nation, with the warm blood of
						liberty running through every vein and artery of his body, has boldly
						denounced in unmeasured terms the still further attempted infraction of this
						right. Let the American people remember that this great right, which the
						President has thrown himself into the breach to define, is theirs, purchased with rivers of blood, and if they
						would preserve it for themselves and their children they must sustain the
						President. </p>
					<p>Another objection of the President to the bill is that Congress has never
						heretofore thought itself competent to legislate for the subsistence of the
						white men of the country and he can not see what entitles the black man to a
						preference in this respect. Soldiers! ought Congress in your opinion, to
						feed, clothe and subsist the freedmen and black refugee of the South, while
						you, who perhaps have lost and arm or a leg in the struggle for the
						preservation of the Government, are obliged to earn a living for yourself,
						and to support your family by hard labor? The President says not; the
						Radicals in Congress say yes. Choose ye. Are you willing that you should be
						taxed for the support of the negro and for the support of swarms of
						commissioners and office-holders whose duty it would be to provide for the
						maintenance of these negroes? Andrew Johnson says it would be unjust to the
						heroic dead, fallen upon the field of battle, whose widows and orphans have
						entirely escaped the attention of the present Congress.</p>
					<p>Another serious objection to the bill is that it proposes to tax the people
						of the Southern States for the purpose named without allowing them
						representation in Congress. This objection brings directly before the
						country the President's views as to the right of the States which had
						seceded to be represented in the National Councils. The President utters his
						condemnation of the odious sentiment, in opposition to which the thirteen
						original colonies sprang to arms--taxation without
							representation. It is well known to the country that the great
						majority of the members of Congress are opposed to the admission of Senators
						and Representatives from the Southern States. The President says that the
						rebellion is at an end--that the Southern States have reorganized their
						State Governments and are now in a condition to participate in the
						legislation of the country. </p>
					<p>Taxation without representation is the principle which the British Government
						sought to impose upon the colonies. Our forefathers resisted it and
						triumphed over it. Let the sense of justice of the American people speak out
						and inform those Radical leaders in Congress that we are not in favor of
						retrogression--that the principle is as odious to us as it was to our
						forefathers--and that if this Union is to be restored and the harmony of the
						people North and South to be preserved, we must reiterate our opposition to
						it--we must "let by-gones be by-gones" and extend the hand of fellowship;
						friendship and good-will to the people of the South.</p>
					<p>The issue is made. The President and the Radicals are at daggers' points. The
						people must decide between them. With the utmost frankness the President has
						staterd the issue and no man need be in ignorance of it. It is one of vital
						interest to every American citizen. Every man should consider it well, and
						throw all the weight of his influence in support of the President.</p>
					<p>The Democratic party comes up with a solid front to his support because it is
						the party of the Constitution. They will encourage and strengthen any man
						who stands upon that platform. They have recognized in the President since
						his elevation to the Presidential chair one who desires to preserve the
						integrity of the Union and the life of the Constitution. They appeal to the
						conservative men of the country of whatever shade of political opinion, to
						join with them, and by one spontaneous, overwhelming expression of opinion
						to show the radicals, how contemptibly small is that portion of the American
						people who would elevate the black man over the ruins of the Republic.</p>
					<p>Stevens, Sumner &amp; Co have attacked the President with almost
						unparalleled vehemence and bitterness. In public and private, in the Halls
						of Congress and in social circles, he has been the object of their vilest
						vituperation. They laughed to scorn his earnest efforts to restore the Union
						and challenge him to the contest. The President, undaunted has taken up the
						gauntlet. Speaking freely as a citizen of the United States to his
						fellow-citizens, he proclaims to the world who these men are who are
						attempting to breakup this Government. With an earnest, patriotic boldness
						to which history scarcely furnishes a parallel, he throws his charge into
						their teeth, and asks the American people to be judges, "Stevens is one, Sumner is another, and Wendell Philips is
						another." This glorious triumvirate--the quintessence of
						super-refined loyalty--are branded as traitors, by the President of the
						United States. "Under which flag, Bezonian?" That of the President, or that
						of the traitorous triumvirate? You can not serve two masters. You can not
						ride two horses in this contest. You can not endorse the President and Congress. </p>
					<p>He that is not for the President is against him.</p>
					<p>Let us apply the test of loyalty.</p>
					<p>During the late administration it was a crime of the darkest hue to arraign
						the president, to doubt the constitutionality or expediency of any
						administration measures. Nay more--it was an
							unpardonable sin to keep one's mouth shut--the test of loyalty
						was the open endorsement of the President. The
							Administration was the Government. Our opponents could see no
						distinction between them. The Democracy claimed to support the Government by
						denouncing the Administration. For this they were branded on the hustings,
						in private circles and by the press, as traitors. Let the revilers of the
						Democracy stand by their own test. Accept the situation. If you refuse, if
						you denounce the President:--if you arraign him for any public act, you are disloyal, according to your own standard of
							loyalty.</p>
					<p>We can scarcely see how we will support the dignity of our position. We are
						"chuck full to the brim" of loyalty. Oh how good and glorious one feels! to
						be loyal! yes that is it, to be loyal! hip, hip, hurrah!!</p>
					<p>Andrew Johnson has taken down the Constitution from the shelf on which these
						Radicals have laid it and unrolled it. He calls upon the people to read it
						again--to study its principles--to seek to learn its spirit and to apply
						that Constitution to the existing state of affairs. The Democracy are
						ready--have been always ready. They protested against "shelving" the
						Constitution. Their creed has ever been the Constitution and the Union! They
						will rally as one man to its defence. They will give to the President their
						sincere, hearty support, because he is right.</p>
					<p>And now we say to our penitent opponents, come, join us. You have wandered
						away like lost sheep. You may have forgotten the fold. You have watched your
						substance in riotous living until no you are almost compelled to fill your
						bellies with the husks of Radicalism. You have stayed away from the old
						land-marks of the Constitution, but return, oh wanderer return. The
						political anxious bench is standing before a mutilated Constitution and an
						almost dissevered Union.</p>
					<p>"Come, ye" political "sinners, poor and needy, weak and wounded, sick and
						sore." Come penitently, acknowledge your errors and your unfitness, and who
						knows but that the fatted calf may yet be killed for you, and the best robe
						be put upon you? If you have any hankering for office, the last
						consideration will move you fastest.</p>

<b>The Spring Election</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

					<p>We would earnestly urge upon our Democratic friends the great importance of
						preparing immediately for the approaching borough and township elections. if
						proper exertions are made there can exist but little doubt that a majority
						of the Judges and Inspectors of elections can be secured. Of the importance
						of these officers it is scarcely necessary that we should say anything.
						Every Democrat in the County is aware of the high-handed outrages practiced
						by abolition election officers during the past several years. In order to
						guard against this in the future, every Democrat should turn out at the
						Spring Election and perform his whole duty. The contest upon which we are
						about entering will be one of the most exciting ever witnessed. The bold bad
						men who are now in power will scruple at nothing which may be calculated to
						insure their continuance in the position which they have so much abused. The
						experience of some years past ought to be sufficient to teach us that they
						will not hesitate to resort to the most barefaced and unblushing frauds. The
						Democracy should take immediate steps to secure the election of their most
						competent men in the different townships to the important positions of
						Judges and Inspectors of Elections. Let us begin the campaign aright by
						carrying the township elections this Spring. There is time enough to do this
						important work effectually, and barely time enough. Let the best man of the
						party be put forward as candidates, and let a vigorous effort he made to
						carry every township where we have any possible show for it. A little of the
						right kind of effort can effect wonders in this respect.</p>

<b>Local and Personal--The Cumberland Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The piece offers a tepid defense of the Cumberland Valley Railroad, which
					has recently come under attack. Directed mainly at the line's President and
					Superintendent, the criticism is based primarily on "personel considerations."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Several of our exchanges, published on the line of the Cumberland Valley
						railroad, have recently been indulging in a spirit of fault-finding with its
						management. The President and Superintendent seem to have incurred the
						displeasure of the controllers of these papers, and it is against those
						officers specially that their batteries are levelled. From the tenor of the
						complaints made, we are inclined to the belief that personal consideration,
						and no the benefit of the public, are the bottom of them. We have never yet
						asked a favor of the Company which was granted, but notwithstanding are not
						disposed to denounce the management of the road without some doubt the
						policy which denies to the members of the Press the courtesy of a free pass,
						so generally accorded by other roads, but that is the company's business and
						affords us no just grounds of complaint. We are free to say so, that in our
						opinion a little more liberality in the management would be beneficial to
						its interests, but so long as the public are carried over it with reasonable
						speed and safety, we are not disposed to complain. We doubt if there is in
						the State a railroad--all things considered, better managed than this the
						same Cumberland Valley Road. Its trains run on time with as much, if not
						more, regularity than on any other short road. Transit over it has become so
						safe to person and property that we can scarcely remember when either life
						was lost or property destroyed upon it. It sometimes happens that trains are
						delayed by heavy snows and other unavoidable causes, but it is an undeniable
						fact that such delays are less frequent on this than on other roads. We fail
						to perceive the justice of the complaints of our co-temporaries against the
						President and Superintendent. They have spared no effort to meet the
						requirements of the travelling public and are entitled to commendation
						instead of censure.</p>
