<b>The Philadelphia Convention</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editorial praises the upcoming National Union Convention in
					Philadelphia as an opportunity to "kindle anew the glow of patriotism" that
					binds the citizens of the country in "common allegiance."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The convention to be held at Philadelphia on the 14th of August, will be the
						first gathering for many years of the people from all sections of the Union.
						For this reason, if for no other, it will be a remarkable assembly. Not
						since the first blow at Sumter, in 1861, have the representatives of all the
						States met in any council, either ecclesiastical or civil, or come together
						for any purpose upon a common platform. We shall be greatly mistaken of this
						fact has [UNCLEAR] a marked influence upon the spirit of those who, for the
						first time in six years, shall greet each other as brethren. Over the
						intervening graves, stronger than the memory of the bitter strife, hushing
						the tumult of sectional animosities, will come the hallowed associations of
						the earlier days, and the hearts of old time brethren will once more flow
						together. The blood that has been shed will rest in the grave of buried
						controversy; and the warmer current of a fresher life will be quickened in
						the hearts of those who still own the tie that makes them one, and meet to
						kindle anew the glory of patriotism that binds them in a common allegiance.
						With such a spirit in the convention there will be neither reproaches for
						the past nor distrust for the future; and the only question will be, how
						best to remove from all parts of the land the traces of the evil days, and
						to develop anew the sources of the national prosperity.</p>
					<p>It is a happy circumstance that the convention as a body will have no party
						ties, and owe no allegiance to any platform except the implication in the
						call under which it assembles. It is significant--and, we may hope an augury
						for good--that the first gathering of the people from all sections after
						such a period of waste and desolation may enlist, the sympathies of every
						true patriot without distinction of political divisions. Those who love
						party more than country have tried in vain to prevent this meeting of
						brethren long estranged, and will doubtless make still another effort to
						keep alive the hatreds and jealousies of that pact, and to now the seeds of
						fresh dissentions. All such attempts must fail in the presence of the better
						spirit which has been invoked, and which, we trust, will rule in all hearts.
						If we are to learn anything from the past, it should be a lesson of mutual
						trust. Half a million of lives and thousands of millions in treasure, have
						been sacrificed on the altar which party spirit erected, and is not yet
						satisfied. Fresh victims are demanded, and if they were granted, it would
						still cry, "Give, give." If all sections but one were annihilated it would
						turn upon itself as fierce as ever, for its cravings know neither abatement
						nor satiety. It will be a relief, therefore, to see one convention of the
						people bound by no party ties, and free to suggest measures for the common
						good without restraint from the shackles which have proved the bane of most
						political assemblies.</p>
					<p>Some selfish and unscrupulous men will doubtless [UNCLEAR] their way into the
						convention, but they will be powerless for evil if the good and true of all
						parities are only resolute and will act in concert. The occasion is
						eminently fitted to secure such united and harmonious action, and if it lead
						to this result it will send a thrill of joy to every true heart throughout
						the nation. We trust that all who would rejoice in such a blessed
						consummation, will do what they can in time to secure the attendance of
						delegates, whose unselfish patriotism is superior to personal considerations
						or mere party affinities, and that no element of discord will creep into the
						assembly through the apathy or neglect of any portion of the people.</p>

<b>Pennsylvania--Her Duty To The Union</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Labeling Pennsylvania the "Keystone of the Federal Arch," the article
					expounds on the necessity of restoring the Union not only for political
					considerations but also because "all of [the state's] material interests point
					in the same way."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Pennsylvania is deeply, vitally interested in all measures and movements
						intended to restore the late revolted States to their former places in the
						Confederation. Apart from political motives urging her in the direction of
						conservative and patriotic action, all her material interests point in the
						same way and demand similar duties from the citizens of this Commonwealth.
						We have many interests which depend upon peace, prosperity, and a wide home
						market for their full and complete development. A large proportion of our
						trade and commerce has been with that section of the Union now excluded from
						political companionship with the rest of the nation. We have found a ready
						and remunerative market for all our surplus products in the Southern part of
						the country. New England is our rival, not our customer. New York takes from
						our income instead of adding to it.--But the South, being essentially an
						agricultural and planting region, and her people being devoted to these and
						kindred pursuits, needs such articles as are manufactured and produced in
						this State, and thus becomes a constant purchaser. The workshops and
						manufactories of this Commonwealth need the stimulating influence of
						Southern orders. Our merchants miss the trade which used to flow upon them
						from that section. The shipping merchants along our commercial front now
						[UNCLEAR] one vessel for Southern ports during a period of time which used
						to see ten depart full-freighted for the same localities and in all
						directions evidences accumulate showing how much, in a material point of
						view, Pennsylvania is interested in an early and fair settlement of this
						question of the restoration of all the States to full equality in the
						Federal Union.</p>
					<p>Congress, owing to the action of the Radicals, having refused to restore the
						Union, the people have determined to undertake the sacred and responsible
						task, and hence the call for the National Union Convention, to meet in this
						city on the 15th of August. This is no partisan or sectional government. It
						proposes no plan of action for the benefit of any particular party or clique
						of men. Inside this Convention all mere party lines will be obliterated in
						the one grand amalgamation of Union men "for the sake of the Union." In
						comparatively minor matters, such as the tariff, the currency, and other
						questions affecting the detail of government, each delegate will retain his
						individuality.--Democrats will not loosen their hold upon that old
						organization which they so love and reverence, and men who differ from them
						upon questions of State or national policy other than those affecting the
						restoration of the States, will be called upon to make no sacrifice of their
						convictions or principles.--The single point to be kept in view, is the
						Union under the Constitution, and the best way to arrive at that
						consummation. The settlement of the tariff question in a satisfactory
						manner, and the placing of the currency upon a firm basis, will be of little
						avail so long as ten States of the union are separated from the balance, and
						thus the harmony and prosperity of the whole country destroyed. The Union
						must first be perfected before any laws, no matter how wise, can give relief
						to the people, and the duty of restoring that Union in the one which the
						National Union Convention will endeavor to discharge. The Democracy of this
						State are Union men. They have always been so. They are so at the present
						time, and they will unite with all who are willing to aid in restoring the
						Union, no matter what may be their views upon other subjects.</p>
					<p>Antecedents are nothing in this crisis.--It is not what a man has been, but
						what he is now. When the call for volunteers sounded through the land, the
						brave man who responded was not questioned as to what might have been his
						opinion before the war began. Was he in favor of the Union now. If he was, the country accepted his services.
						This is the principle upon which the national Union men of the nation mean
						to act. they will accept as allies all who are honestly and fairly in favor
						of the Union and the restoration of the States. The eleventh hour laborer
						will not be rejected, if he comes with testimonials of his sincere desire to
						aid in preserving this free form of government, and guaranteeing to the
						several States a separate and individual existence under the wise and
						beneficent provisions of the Constitution. Men may and did differ widely as
						to the best means of preserving the nation, but if they are willing to
						accept the realities which surround them, and work in harmony with the great
						Union party of the country at this crisis, they have a right to fellowship,
						and should be represented in the coming Convention and all Union men are
						entitled to recognition on the broad and catholic basis of national
						brotherhood and fellowship. </p>
					<p>Pennsylvania, the old Keystone of the Federal Arch, is called upon by all the
						memories of the past, and all the hopes in the future, to do her full duty
						at this epoch in the history of the nation. Upon her soil was held the
						Convention which adopted the Declaration of Independence, the Convention
						which formed the Constitution of the United States, and now upon her soil is
						to be convened a meeting of the people of the States to restore the
						disjointed Confederation to its old condition. Pennsylvanians did their duty
						in a noble patriotic manner in the first Convention. They must act in a like
						way in the one that is to come. The subject is a big one. It must be met in
						a manner commensurate with its great importance. Everything must be elevated
						to the dignity and grandeur of the question to be considered. We have a
						delegation equal to the occasion and have no fears as to the result.--Age</p>

<b>The Adjournment of Congress</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Maligning Congress' accomplishments during the last session, the editorial

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Congress adjourns to-day, says the Age of last
						Saturday, and the patriotic pulse of the nation beats with fresh hope for
						the future of the country. There will be now a period of comparative repose.
						The nation will have time to look back upon the eventful past, and into the
						coming future, pregnant with good or evil for the country, as it may be used
						or abused. The members will have to face their constituents, and hear public
						opinion from the people, and not from the pages of partisan journals. The
						deep and positive change that has taken place in the public sentiment upon
						this question of a restoration of States, will now become a reality which
						the Radical members will have to meet. Their record on this subject is dark
						and damning. They have deliberately plotted against the peace and prosperity
						of the nation. They have labored and spoke and voted to keep the States
						asunder, not to reunite them. They have subordinated the best interests of
						the Union to party hopes and partisan expectations, and taken the first
						steps towards a civil war in the North in order to secure a mere party
						triumph at the coming elections. All appeals to patriotism and love of
						country have been thrown away upon this Congress. They have represented
						party, not the country, and their labors have tended to widen the breach
						existing between the sections, and not to heal it. </p>
					<p>If in patriotism the majority of this Congress have been sadly, wickedly
						deficient, in corruption, extravagance, robbery and profligacy, they have
						reached an altitude unknown heretofore in the annals of this nation. When
						not robbing the people of their political rights, they have been plundering
						the Treasury in all possible ways. Jobs, large and small, have monopolized
						the time and attention of the dominant party. From Freedman's Bureau bills
						to smaller pickings, the Radicals have traveled in the same miry path. No
						efforts have been made to reduce the expenses of the country. The taxes have
						not been made lower by wise and judicious retrenchments nor have the
						business interests been stimulated by proper laws, applicable to all parts
						of the country.--Trade, commerce, and manufactures, have been ground to the
						earth by fanatic projects founded on wild notions of humanity and
						philanthropy, and the finances disturbed by schemes which are intended to
						benefit a few interested parties at the expense of the whole people. These
						are a few of the acts of the present Congress for which the Radicals are
						responsible, and it is no wonder that the adjournment of that body will be
						hailed with delight in all sections of the country.</p>
					<p>The Democrats have acted wisely and well during the present session. Though
						few in numbers, they have stood up unitedly against all schemes for
						distracting the country, or plundering the Treasury. They have been national
						in all their movements; no sectional measure has received their sanction or
						support. The whole country has been their country, and no act has received
						Democratic voters that was not intended to benefit equally all sections. All
						Radical plans for plundering the Treasury met with Democratic opposition,
						and though not able at all times to stay the current, still they called
						public attention to the facts, and thus made the record perfect against the
						plunderers.--The contrast between the Radical majority and the Democratic
						minority in the present Congress is too glaring to escape public attention,
						and the country will decide between them at the next election. In the
						meantime, we chronicle with delight the adjournment of the present
					Congress.</p>

						merely to make it appear that the rebellion is not yet suppressed, and thus

<b>Message of the President</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Providesa a copy of Johnson's letter to Congress approving the re-admission
					of Tennessee to the Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>WASHINGTON, July 24.</p>
					<p>The President this afternoon transmitted the annexed message, namely: To the House of Representatives: </p>
					<p>The following joint resolution, restoring Tennessee to her relations to the
						Union, was last evening presented for my approval:</p>
					<p>Whereas, In the year 1861, the government of the
						State of Tennessee was seized upon and taken possession of by persons in
						hostility to the United States, and the inhabitants of said State, in
						pursuance of an act of Congress, were declared to be in a state of
						insurrection against the United States; and </p>
					<p>Whereas, The said State government can only be
						restored to its former political relations in the Union by the consent of
						the law making power of the United States; and </p>
					<p>Whereas, The people of the said State, did, on the
						22d day of February, 1864, by a large popular vote, adopt and ratify a
						constitution of government, whereby slavery was abolished, and all
						ordinances and laws of secession and debts contracted under the same were
						declared void; and </p>
					<p>Whereas, A State government has been organized
						under the said constitution, which has ratified the amendment to the
						Constitution of the United States abolishing slavery; also the amendment
						proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress, and has done other acts proclaiming
						and denoting loyalty; therefore be it </p>
					<p>Resolved, (by the Senate and House of
						Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled),
						That the State of Tennessee is hereby restored to her former proper
						practical relations to the Union, and is again entitled to be represented by
						Senators and Representatives in Congress. </p>
					<p>The preamble simply consists of statements, some of which are assumed, while
						the resolution is merely a declaration of opinion. It comprises no
						legislation nor does it confer any power which is binding upon the
						respective houses, the Executive or the States. It does not admit to their
						seats in Congress the Senators and Representatives from the State of
						Tennessee; for notwithstanding the passage of the resolution, each House, in
						the exercise of the constitutional rights to judge for itself of the
						elections, returns and qualifications of its members, may at its discretion
						admit or continue to exclude them. If a joint resolution or this character
						were necessary and binding as a condition precedent to the admission of
						members of Congress, it would happen in the event of a veto by the
						Executive, that Senators and Representative could only be admitted to the
						halls of legislation by a two-thirds vote of each of the two houses.</p>
					<p>Among other reasons recited in the preamble for the declarations contained in
						the resolution is the ratification by the State government of Tennessee, of
						the amendment to the Constitution of the United States abolishing slavery,
						and also the amendment proposed by the Thirty-ninth Congress. If, as is also
						declared in the preamble, the said State government can only be restored to
						its former political relations in the union by the consent of the law-making
						power of the United States, it would really seem to follow that the joint
						resolution, which at this late day has received the sanction of Congress,
						should have been passed, approved, and placed on the statute books before
						any amendment of the Constitution was submitted to the Legislature of
						Tennessee for ratification. Otherwise, the interference is plainly deducible
						that while, in the opinion Congress, the people of a State may be too
						strongly disloyal to be entitled to representation, they may nevertheless,
						during the suspension of their former practical relations to the Union, have
						an equally potent voice with other and loyal States in propositions to amend
						the Constitution, upon which so essentially depends the stability,
						prosperity and very existence oft he Union.</p>
					<p>A brief reference to my annual message of the 4th of December last, will show
						the steps taken by the Executive for the restoration to their constitutional
						relations to the Union of the States that had been affected by the
						rebellion. Upon the cessation of actual hostilities Provisional Governors
						were appointed, conventions called, Governors elected by the people,
						Legislatures assembled, and Senators and Representatives chosen to the
						Congress of the United States. At the same time the courts of the United
						States were re-opened, the blockade removed, the custom houses
						re-established, and postal operations resumed. The amendment to the
						Constitution abolishing slavery forever within the limits of the country,
						was submitted to the States, and they were thus invited to, and did,
						participate in a ratification, thus exercising the highest functions
						pertaining to a State. In addition, nearly all of these States, through
						their Conventions and Legislatures, had adopted and ratified the amendment
						to the Constitution, whereby slavery was abolished, and all ordinances and
						laws of secession and debts contracted under the same were declared void.</p>
					<p>So far, then, the political existence of the States and their relations to
						the Federal government had been fully and completely recognized and
						acknowledged by the executive department of the government, and the
						completion of the work of restoration, which had progressed so favorably,
						was submitted to Congress, upon which devolved all questions pertaining to
						the admission to their seats of the Senators and Representatives chosen from
						the States whose people had engaged in the rebellion.</p>
					<p>All these steps had been taken when, on the 4th day of December, 1865, the
						thirty-ninth Congress assembled. Nearly eight months have elapsed since that
						time, and no other plan of restoration having been proposed by Congress for
						the measures instituted by the Executive, it is now declared in the joint
						resolution submitted for my approval that the State of Tennessee is hereby
						restored to her former practical relations to the Union, and is again
						entitled to be represented by Senators and Representatives in Congress.
						Thus, after the lapse of nearly eight months, Congress proposes to pave the
						way to the admission to representation of one of the eleven States whose
						people arrayed themselves in rebellion against the constitutional authority
						of the Federal government. Earnestly desiring to relieve every cause of
						further delay, whether real or imaginary, on the part of Congress to the
						admission to seats of loyal Senators and Representatives from the State of
						Tennessee, I have, notwithstanding the anomalous character of this
						proceeding, affixed my signature to the resolution. My approval, however is
						not to be construed as an acknowledgement of the right of Congress to pass
						laws preliminary to the admission of duly qualified representatives from any
						of the States. Neither is it to be considered as committing me to all the
						statements made in the preamble, some of which are in my opinion without
						foundation in fact, especially the assertion that the State of Tennessee has
						ratified the amendments to the constitution of the United States proposed by
						the Thirty-ninth Congress. No official notice of such ratification has been
						received by the Executive, or filed in the Department of State; on the
						contrary, unofficial information from more reliable sources induces the
						believe that the amendment has not yet been constitutional sanctioned by the
						Legislature of Tennessee. The right of each House under the Constitution to
						judge of the election returns and qualifications of its own members is
						undoubted, and my approval or disapproval of the resolution could not in the
						slightest degree increase or diminish the authority in this respect
						conferred upon the two branches of Congress.</p>
					<p>In conclusion, I cannot to efficaciously repeat my recommendation for the
						admission of Tennessee and all other States to a fair and equal
						participation in national legislation, when they present themselves in the
						persons of loyal Senators and Representatives, who can comply with all the
						requirements of the Constitution and the laws. By this means harmony and
						reconciliation will be effected, the practical reconciliation will be
						effected, the practical relations of all the States to the Federal
						government re-established, and the work of restoration inaugurated upon the
						termination of the war successfully completed.</p>
