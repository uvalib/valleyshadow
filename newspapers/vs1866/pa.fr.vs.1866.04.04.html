<b>A Word With Our Soldiers</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Alleging that the Republicans nominated Gen. Geary primarily to win the
                    votes of the returning soldiers, the article contends that the party selected
                    Geary over a host of other, more accomplished and conservative Republicans who
                    are also veterans, because he supports the Radicals' agenda. In spite of the
                    Republicans' chicanery, it maintains, the soldiers will surely see through their
                    veiled attempts to undermine democracy and the Constitution.<br>

                    field under the direct constraint or indirect influence of superiors, who, like
                    Geary, made their freedom as voters a gross and cruel lie."<br>

<b>The Veto</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Hailing Johnson's decision to veto the Civil Rights Bill as a "barrier to
                    the destructive policies" of the Radicals, the editorial praises his resolve in
                    the face of the overwhelming pressure exerted by those individuals whose
                    "triumphant fanaticism" threatens the country's security.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Friends and Foes</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>As the controversy over the Freedmen's Bureau bill aptly illustrates, there
                    is a great divide separating the Republicans and the President. But it is the
                    position advanced by Johnson, the article reports, that commands the
                    overwhelming support of the masses. Bearing this in mind, the author of the
                    piece exhorts the President to acknowledge the indispensable support he receives
                    to advance his policies from both conservative Republicans and Democrats.<br>

<b>Harrisburg</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

                    percent.<br>
