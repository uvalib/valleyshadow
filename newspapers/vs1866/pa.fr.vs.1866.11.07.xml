                <summary>Contains a copy of a letter sent by Secretary Browning in which he argues
                    "against the constitutional amendment" and in favor of "a triumphant vindication
                    of the restoration policy of Presidents Lincoln and Johnson." According to the
                    Spirit, Browning wrote the letter, in part, to dispel rumors floated by the
                    Radical press, alleging that Johnson intends to "abandon the Constitution" in
                    order to secure his power in the face of the growing threat of impeachment.</summary>

                <transcript>
                    <p>What the South needs at this time is capital to put life and animation into
                        the business interests of that section. The people are ready for work, but
                        are prevented from going forward on that road by a lack of funds. Thousands
                        of acres of the best land in the nation are lying idle and unproductive, and
                        will continue to do so until the tide of capital flows in that direction.
                        Business men and men of means would look to the South as a field for
                        operations if they were not deterred by the statement made in the Radical
                        papers, that no security can be given for capital in the Southern States in
                        the present condition of affairs in that section. This statement is
                        pronounced erroneous by the New Orleans <emph rend="italic">Crescent</emph>,
                        which journal says: </p>
                    <p>We, who live in the extreme South, and know the country, its resources, its
                        actual condition and the character and sentiments of the people, think the
                        very opposite to be true. We believe that if there be any part of the
                        country in which capital is safe, "in the present State of our political
                        affairs," it is in the Southern and especially in the Southwestern States.
                        We have passed through our sea of trouble, and are on dry land again. We
                        came near losing every thing-did not actually approach the brink of
                        ruin--but what ruthless war spared is safe from any further danger. There
                        will never be civil war again, or political revolution, or even a
                        respectable attempt at commotion, either in the present generation, or the
                        next, or the next, in the Southern States. We have ever present with us now
                        not only the light of our own experience, but by that light we can better
                        read and appreciate the experience of other people who have suffered
                        themselves to become involved in civil war. If there be one sentiment
                        predominant among the Southern people at the present time, if there be any
                        one lesson impressively taught to the rising generation, it is that
                        political agitation, necessarily leading to civil war, is the greatest of
                        all evils--a curse. And with it is taught its complement, the equally
                        important lesson, that order, security to life and property, agriculture and
                        commerce and manufactures, with attention solely to them and the cultivation
                        of social virtues, are the greatest of all blessings.</p>
                    <p>With these lessons indelibly impressed upon our minds, and with this
                        determination, where can there be found a country in which capital can be
                        more securely invested than in this? And where more profitably? In
                        consequence of the late unfortunate attempt at revolution, a vast amount of
                        the most valuable property has been thrown upon the market at the lowest
                        prices. The immediate necessities of individuals who suffered most severely
                        during the war, have brought with them, to such as have ready money, the
                        most admirable opportunities, such as offer themselves only in a century, to
                        possess themselves of stocks, real estate, and all kinds of property,
                        frequently at one-eighth their real value. This is the view which a great
                        many Northern people are actually taking of our affairs, and hence the
                        Southern country has, thus early in the season, a far larger number of
                        visitors looking around for profitable business and investment than ever
                        before.--They are right. There is no safer, more profitable country for the
                        investment of money and labor, no more secure place in which to settle than
                        these Southern and Southwestern States.</p>

                <summary>Employing an article taken from the New Orleans Crescent to substantiate
                    his opinion, the editor argues that the South is in need of a massive infusion
                    of capital to help it become productive once again. He claims, however, that
                    businessmen are reluctant to invest there because of statements "made in the
                    Radical papers, that no security can be given for capital in the Southern
                    States," considering the present state of affairs in that section.</summary>
