                <excerpt>"The truth is that Africa seems to be reserved for the Africans, and the
                    question is whether the Africans can be civilized and made members of the great
                    commercial population of the world."</excerpt>

                <summary>After announcing the publication of Dr. Livingston's new book on his
                    adventures in Africa, the article uses the occasion to deprecate blacks, and
                    their place in American society. Unlike all "other races [that] have advanced in
                    one or another degree," it claims, "the African of the nineteenth century after
                    Christ is the precise counterpart of his ancestor three thousand years ago."</summary>

                <summary>In a stinging attack, the editorial casts Senator Thaddeus Stevens as an
                    "infidel" who will stop at nothing to force his agenda, the debasement of
                    whites, particularly southerners and members of the working class, on the
                    American people.</summary>

                <summary>Led by Thad Stevens, who, the article reports, closed the debate over the
                    issue with the "most vindictive fiendish and brutal speech, perhaps ever made in
                    a deliberative body," Republicans approved the Constitutional Amendment drafted
                    by the Reconstruction Committee.</summary>

                <summary>Congress' acceptance of Colorado's bid to become a state is strictly a
                    Republican ploy to ensure them a veto-proof two-third majority in Congress,
                    contends the article. To justify the claim, it mentions that the territory is
                    composed of a substantial number of non-whites, the "real population" totaling
                    only 15,000, which is "half the minimum prescribed by the Constitution for a
                    single representative."</summary>

                <summary>It is reported that Secretary Stanton's stand on the President's
                    reconstruction policies has left many Republican's baffled. Stanton, who has
                    publicly thrown his support behind Johnson, believes that "the party which dared
                    to stand in the way of an absolute and immediate Union, in all its integrity,
                    would be ground to powder," according to the piece.</summary>
