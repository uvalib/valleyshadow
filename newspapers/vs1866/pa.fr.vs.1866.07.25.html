<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, July 16</p>
                    <p>The following is the veto message of the President, communicated to the House
                        today:</p>
                    <p>To the House of Representatives: </p>
                    <p>A careful examination of the bill passed by the two Houses of Congress
                        entitled "An act to continue in force and to amend an act to establish a
                        bureau for the relief of the freedmen and refugees and for other purposes,"
                        has convinced me that the legislation which it proposes would not be
                        consistent with the welfare of the country, and that it is clearly within
                        the reasons assigned in my message of the 19th of February last, returning
                        without my signature, a similar measure which originated in the Senate.</p>
                    <p>It is not my purpose to repeat the objections which I then urged. They are
                        yet fresh in your recollection, and can be readily examined as a part of the
                        records of one branch of the national legislature. Adhering to the
                        principles set forth in that message, I now re-affirm them and the line of
                        policy therein indicated. The only ground upon which this kind of
                        legislation can be justified is that of the war making power. The act of
                        which this bill is intended as amendatory was passed during the existence of
                        the war. By its own provisions it is to terminate within one year from the
                        cessation of hostilities and the declaration of peace. It is, therefore, yet
                        in existence, and it is likely that it will continue in force as long as the
                        freedmen may require benefit of its provisions. It will certainly remain in
                        operation as a law until some months subsequent to the meeting of the next
                        session of Congress, when, if experience shall make evident the necessity of
                        additional legislation, the two Houses will have ample time to mature and
                        pass the requisite measures. In the meantime the questions arise, why should
                        this war be measure continued beyond the period designated in the original
                        act? And why in time of peace, should military tribunals be created to
                        continue until each "State shall be fully restored in its constitutional
                        relations to the government, and shall be duly represented in the Congress
                        of the United States?"</p>
                    <p>It was manifest, with respect to the act approved March 3, 1865, that
                        prudence and wisdom alike required that jurisdiction over all cases
                        concerning the free enjoyment of the immunities and rights of citizenship,
                        as well as the protection of persons and property, should be conferred upon
                        some tribunal in every State or district where the ordinary course of
                        judicial proceedings was interrupted by the rebellion, at that time
                        therefore, an urgent necessity existed for the passage of some such law.</p>
                    <p>Now, however, war has substantially ceased; the ordinary course of judicial
                        proceedings is no longer interrupted; the courts both State and Federal are
                        in full, complete and successful operation, and through them every person,
                        regardless of race and color, is entitled to and can be heard. The
                        protection granted to the white citizen is already conferred by law upon the
                        freedman. Strong and stringent guards, by way of penalties and punishments,
                        are thrown around his person and property, and it is believed that ample
                        protection will be afforded him by due process of law, without resort to the
                        dangerous expedient of "military tribunals," now that the war has been
                        brought to a close.</p>
                    <p>The necessity no longer existing for such tribunals, which had their origin
                        in the war, grave objections to their continuance must present themselves to
                        the minds of all reflecting the dispassionate men. Independently of the
                        danger in representative republicanism of conferring upon the military in
                        time of peace extraordinary powers, so carefully guarded against by the
                        patriots and statesmen of the earlier days of the republic, so frequently
                        the ruin of governments founded upon the same free principles, and
                        subversive of the rights and liberties of the citizens, the question of
                        practical economy earnestly commends itself to the consideration of the
                        law-making power. With an immense debt already burdening the incomes of the
                        industrial and laboring classes, so inseparable connected with the welfare
                        of the country, should prompt us to rigid economy and retrenchment, and
                        influence us to abstain from all legislation that would unnecessarily
                        increase the public indebtedness.</p>
                    <p>Tested by this rule of sound political wisdom, I can see no reason for the
                        establishment of the "military jurisdiction" conferred upon the officials of
                        the Bureau by the fourteenth section of the bill. By the laws of the United
                        States, and of the different States, competent courts, Federal and State,
                        have been established, and are now in full practical operation. By means of
                        these civil tribunals, ample redress is afforded for all private wrongs,
                        whether to the person or the property of the citizen, without denial or
                        unnecessary delay. They are open to all, without regard to color or race. I
                        feel well assured that it will be better to trust the rights, privileges and
                        immunities of the citizen to tribunals thus established and presided over by
                        competent and impartial judges, bound by fixed rules of law and evidence,
                        and where the right of trial by jury is guaranteed and secured, than to the
                        caprice or judgement of an officer of the bureau, who, it is possible, may
                        be entirely ignorant of the principles that underlie the just administration
                        of the law.--There is danger, too, that conflict of jurisdiction will
                        frequently arise between the civil courts and those military tribunals, each
                        having concurrent jurisdiction over the person and the cause of action; the
                        one judicature administered and controlled by civil law, the other my
                        military. How is the convict to be settled, and who is to determine between
                        the two tribunals when it arises? In my opinion, it is wise to guard against
                        such conflict by leaving to the courts and juries the protection of all
                        civil grievances.</p>
                    <p>The fact cannot be denied that alone the actual cessation of hostilities many
                        acts of violence, such, perhaps, as had never been witnessed in their
                        previous history, have occurred in the States involved in the recent
                        rebellion. I believe, however, that public sentiment will sustain me in the
                        assertion that such deeds of wrong are not confined to any particular State
                        or section, but are manifested over the entire country, demonstrating that
                        the cause that produced them does not depend upon any particular locality,
                        but is the result of the agitation or derangement incident to a long and
                        bloody civil war. While the prevalence of such disorders must be greatly
                        deplored, their occasional and temporary occurrence would seem to furnish no
                        necessity for the extension of the Bureau beyond the period fixed in the
                        original act.</p>
                    <p>Besides the objections which I have thus briefly stated, I may urge upon your
                        consideration the additional reason that recent developements in regard to
                        the practical operations of the Bureau in many of the States show that in
                        numerous instances it is used by its agents as a means of promoting their
                        individuals advantage, and that the freedmen are employed for the
                        advancement of the personal ends of the officers instead of their own
                        improvement and welfare, thus confirming the fears originally entertained by
                        many that the continuation of such a bureau for any unnecessary length of
                        time would inevitably result in fraud, corruption and oppression. It is
                        proper to state that in cases of this character investigations have been
                        promptly ordered and the offender punished, whenever his guilt has been
                        satisfactorily established.</p>
                    <p>As annother reason against the necessity of the legislation contemplated by
                        this measure, reference may be had to the Civil Rights Bill, no a law of the
                        land, and as it shall remain unrepealed and may not be declared
                        unconstitutional by courts of competent jurisdiction. By that act it is
                        enacted "that all persons born in the United States and not subject to any
                        foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be
                        citizens of every race and color, without regard to any previous condition
                        of slavery and involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime
                        whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall have the same right
                        in every State and Territory in the United States, to make and enforce
                        contracts, to sue the parties and give evidence, to inherit, purchase,
                        lease, sell, hold and convey real and personal property, and to full and
                        equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and
                        property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like
                        punishment, pains and penalties, and to none other; any law, statute,
                        ordinance, regulation or custom to the contrary notwithstanding."</p>
                    <p>By the provisions of the act full protection is afforded, through the
                        District Courts of the United States, to all persons injured, and whose
                        privileges, as thus declared, are in any way impaired, and heavy penalties
                        are denounced against the person who willfully violates the law. I need not
                        state that that law did not not receive my approval, yet its remedies are
                        far more preferable than those proposed in the present bill, the one being
                        civil and the other military.</p>
                    <p>By the sixth section of the bill herewith returned certain proceedings, by
                        which the lands in the "parishes of St. Helena and St. Luke, South
                        Carolina," were sold and bid in, and afterwards disposed of by the Tax
                        Commissioners, are ratified and confirmed. By the seventh, eighth, ninth,
                        tenth and eleventh sections, provisions, by law, are made for the disposal
                        of the lands thus acquired to a particular class of citizens, while the
                        quieting of the titles is deemed very important and desirable, the
                        discrimination made in the bill seems objectionable, as does also the
                        attempt to confer upon the commissioners judicial powers, by which citizens
                        of the United States are to be deprived of their property in a mode contrary
                        to that provision of the Constitution which declares that no person "shall
                        be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." As a
                        general principle, such legislation is unsafe, unwise, partial, and
                        unconstitutional. It may deprive persons of their property who are equally
                        deserving objects of the nation's bounty as those whom, by this legislation,
                        Congress seeks to benefit.</p>
                    <p>The title to the land thus to be portioned out to a favored class of citizens
                        must depend upon the regularity of the tax sales under the law as it existed
                        at the time of the sale, and no subsequent legislation can give validity to
                        the rights thus acquired as against the original claimants. The attention of
                        Congress is therefore invited to a more mature consideration of the measures
                        proposed in these sections of the bill.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I again urge upon Congress the danger of class legislation, so
                        well calculated to keep the public mind in a state of uncertain expectation,
                        disquiet and restlessness, and to encourage interested hopes and fears that
                        the national government will continue to furnish to classes of citizens in
                        the several States means for support and maintenance, regardless of whether
                        they pursue a life of indolence or labor, and regardless, also, of the
                        constitutional limitations of the national authority in times of peace and
                        tranquility.</p>
                    <p>The bill is herewith returned to the House of Representatives, in which it
                        originated for its final action.</p>
                    <p>ANDREW JOHNSON,</p>

<b>The Radical Plot For Another Civil War</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>As the battle intensifies between Congress and the President, asserts the

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Hon. Henry J. Raymond, editor of the New York Times], Chairman of the National Executive Committee of the
                        Republican party, and member of the National House of Representatives, has
                        startled the country by his exposure of the doings of their late secret
                        caucus of the radical member of Congress. According to Mr. Raymond's report
                        of the caucus proceedings, leading radicals there avowed their determination
                        to resort to force, if necessary, to carry out
                        their infamous schemes. Mr. Boutwell of Massachusetts, is reported on having
                        said: "The battle has already begun, and if resistance was not much, the
                        President would take possession of the Capitol. Any such attempt must and
                        would be resisted by force." </p>
                    <p>Senator Lane, of Indiana, followed in a very excited speech demanding the
                        enactment of stringent laws to restrain and curtail the power of the
                        President--saying "he was ready to sit all summer, if necessary, at the
                        point of the bayonet; that if a victim was wanted, he was ready; and
                        declaring that a million of soldiers would flock to the capital to sustain
                        Congress against the tyranny of the President."</p>
                    <p>This, says the Age, is very strong language, and
                        not for "Buncombe," for this was thought to be a secret meeting. Another
                        thing, as part of the chain of evidence of an ultimate aim of violence is to
                        be remarked. Who in it that is talked of for President of the Senate--the
                        possible successor of Andrew Johnson, during the eventful [UNCLEAR]? Not,
                        Mr. Sherman, or Judje Harris, or Senator Morgan, or Mr. Anthony, or Mr.
                        Femendon recess, or any relatively modern man, but the most reckless,
                        ruthless, and unscrupulous Radical who has ever yet spring from the
                        seething, fomenting, compost heap of abolition, Benjamin F. Wade, of Ohio,
                        the boldest revolutionist of them all. If this choice be consummated, we
                        shall regard it as the worst and most alarming symptom yet developed. Woe
                        indeed to the country, its peace, its honor, its integrity, if is this even
                        the head of God, in the form of the unlooked for disease, or the hand of the
                        assassin, and the breed is not extinct, should remove the only man who now
                        checks the course of mischief. </p>
                    <p>But does he stand alone? Will he be sustained? In other words and speaking
                        more impersonally, what conservative elements may be relied on to resist or
                        defeat the coming storm? Let us look for them intelligently and measure them
                        exactly.--There is one element of this sort which would soon arouse itself
                        and make it all felt. We mean the capital of the country--that which is more
                        or less represented by or represents the public debt. If there be any class
                        of men who ought to pray for social repose, it is the creditors of the
                        nation--They know that the bonds they hold are constituents of a vast ,
                        aggregation of debt, as part of which is more sacred than another, and the
                        whole of which presses with equal weight on the taxed industry of the
                        country, and which that industry is barely capable of sustaining. But they
                        also know that it is not more able to sustain it, and that any new
                        disturbance, any deflection of this industry to profitless pursuits, any
                        revolution, or serious threat, or appearance of revolution, would put the
                        whole fabric in peril. Ought not the public creditor, night and morning on
                        bended knee, to pray that those unseemly cabals should come, these ominous
                        threats be silenced? Do not his instincts and his interest, too, teach him
                        his duty to stand by the constitutional Chief Magistrate, him whom Br.
                        Binney, in one of his high prerogative essays, if we mistake not, called
                        "the government in action." Abraham Lincoln never needed more support from
                        the property of the country than does Andrew Johnson now. We wish our voice
                        of warning could reach (and just now it certainly does not) the nank
                        parlors, and saving funds, and insurance offices, of the commuty, and they
                        might be roused to a sense of danger ere it be too late.</p>
                    <p>Now are capitalists the only natural allies of the friends of continued and
                        complete peace? Has the farmer, or laborer, or artisan, we mean those who
                        labor always, anything to gain from new Revolution, and that a wanton one?
                        Are the memories of the last war entirely dim? Are taxes so light that they
                        should be increased? Are the thoughts of the distant dead faded away that
                        bloody strife among neighbors is to be desired? These are the questions we
                        can but briefly ask. Their answer is very obvious.</p>
                    <p>On our compact and harmonious organization the opponents of the new
                        Revolution can faithfully rely--the great Democratic party North and South.
                        It is pledged to the Constitution and it will fight for the Constitution. As
                        to that there can be no mistake, and in the event of the new conflict now so
                        ominously threatened, but which we pray Providence to avert, we may live to
                        see the day when Radicalism, driven into a congenial corner of the land, may
                        fall on its knee and beg for mercy.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, to be forewarned is to be forearmed. We thank Mr. Raymond
                        for his warning.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We desire to call the attention of the Democratic and conservative soldiers
                        of Franklin county to the Soldiers' State Convention to be held in
                        Harrisburg on the first of August, the call for which we published two weeks
                        ago. It is important that the patriotic soldiers of our country, who fought
                        of the Union and the Constitution should be well represented in that
                        convention.-- Owing to the shortness of the time and the busy season, a
                        county convention for the election of delegates has not been called, but we
                        are glad to learn that it is the intention of a large number of our returned
                        veterans to be present at the Harrisburg convention in person. This is
                        right. Let there be a general turnout of the 'boys in blue," showing by
                        their presence that they mean to maintain by the ballot that the Union and
                        the Constitution for which they fought in the field.</p>
                    <p>It is but a few hours ride to Harrisburg, and we have no doubt the Cumberland
                        Valley Railroad Company will cheerfully issue excursion tickets to all
                        soldiers who desire to attend this convention, so that the expense will be
                        merely nominal. Let a few of the leading spirits among our brave boys take
                        this matter in hand, and make the necessary arrangements to have a large
                        delegation of Franklin county boys at Harrisburg on the first of August. It
                        will do them good and the country good. We should send a delegation of at
                        least fifty.--It can easily be done. Let the necessary preliminary steps be
                        taken at once.</p>
