                    <p>SPEECH OF MR. STEVENS.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stevens said: A candid examination of the power and proper principles of
                        reconstruction can be offensive to no one, and may possibly be profitable by
                        exciting inquiry. One of the suggestions of the message which we are now
                        considering has special reference to this. Perhaps it is the principle most
                        interesting to the people at this time. The President assume what no one
                        doubts, that the late Rebel States have lost their constitutional relations
                        to the Union, and are incapable of representation in Congress, except by
                        permission of the Government. It matters but little, with this admission
                        whether, you call them States of the Union and now conquered Territories, or
                        assert that because the Constitution forbid them to do what they did do that
                        they are therefore only dead as to all national and political action, and
                        will remain so until the Government shall breathe into them the breath of
                        life anew and permit them to occupy their former position--in other words
                        that they are not of the Union, but only dead carcasses lying within the
                        Union. In either case it is very plain that it requires the action of
                        Congress to enable them to form a State Government, and send representatives
                        to Congress. Nobody, I believe, pretends that, with their old Constitutions
                        and forms of government, they can be permitted to claim their old rights
                        under the Constitution. They have torn their Constitution into atoms, and
                        built their foundation fabrics of a totally different character. Dead men
                        cannot raise them selves; dead States cannot restore their own existence as
                        it was. Whose especial duty can do it? In whom does the Constitution place
                        the power? Not in the judicial branch of the Government, for it only
                        adjudicates and does not prescribe laws. Not in the executive for he only
                        executes and cannot make laws. Not in the Commander in Chief of the armies,
                        for he can only hold them under military rule until the sovereign
                        legislative power of the conqueror shall give them law. There is fortunately
                        no difficulty in solving the question. There are two provisions in the
                        constitution under one of which the case must fall. The fourth articles says
                        "new States may be admitted by the Congress into this union." In my judgment
                        this is the controlling provision in this case. Unless the law of nations is
                        a dead letter, the late war between two acknowledged belligerents severed
                        their original compacts, and broke all ties that bound them together. The
                        future condition of the conquered power depends on the will of the
                        conqueror. They must come in as new States, or remain as conquered
                        provinces. Congress--the Senate and House of Representatives--with the
                        concurrence of the President, is the only power on earth that can act on the
                        matter. But suppose as some dreaming theorists imagine that these States
                        have never been out of the Union, but have only destroyed their State
                        Governments so as to be incapable of political action, then the fourth
                        section of the fourth article applies, which says "the United States shall
                        guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of Government." Who
                        is the United States? Not the Judiciary, not the president; but the
                        sovereign power of the people exercised through their representatives in
                        Congress, with the concurrence of the Executive. It means the political
                        Government, the concurrent action of both branches of Congress and the
                        Executive. The separate action of each amounts to nothing, either in
                        admitting new States or guaranteeing Republican Government to lapsed or
                        outlawed States. Whence springs the preposterous idea that either the
                        President, or the Senate, or the House of Representatives, acting
                        separately, can determine the right of States to send members or Senators to
                        the Congress of the Union? To prove that they are and have been out of the
                        Union for all legal purposes, and are now conquered subjects in the absolute
                        disposal of Congress, I will suggest a few ideas and adduce a few
                        authorities. If the so-called Confederate States of America were an
                        independent belligerent, and were so acknowledged by the United States and
                        Europe, or had assumed and maintained an attitude which entitled them to be
                        considered and treated as a belligerent, that during such time they were
                        precisely in the condition of a foreign nation with whom we were at war, nor
                        need their independence as a nation be acknowledged by us to produce that
                        state.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stevens then quoted from Mr. Justice Grier in the prize cases all the law
                        on these points. After such clear and repeated decisions, he said, it is
                        something worse than ridiculous to hear men of respectable standing
                        attempting to nullify the law of the nations, and declare the Supreme Court
                        of the United States in error, because as the Constitution forbids it, the
                        States could not go out of the Union de facto.
                        After proceeding further in his argument, he remarked, it is obvious that
                        the first duty of Congress is to pass a law declaring the condition of these
                        outside defunct States, and providing proper civil government for them.
                        Since the conquest they have been governed by martial law. Military rule is
                        necessarily despotic, and ought not to exist longer than is absolutely
                        necessary. As there are no symptoms that the people of these provinces will
                        be prepared to participate in a Constitutional Government for some years, I
                        know of no arrangement so proper for them as Territorial Governments. There
                        they can learn the principles of freedom, and eat the fruit of foul
                        rebellion under such governments. While electing members to the Territorial
                        Legislatures they will necessarily mingle with those to whom Congress shall
                        extend the right of suffrage. In the Territories, Congress fixes the
                        qualifications of electors, and I know of no better place or better occasion
                        for the conquered rebels and the conqueror to practice justice to all men,
                        and accustom themselves to make and to obey all laws. As to these famed
                        rebels, they cannot at their own option re-enter the heaven which they have
                        disturbed, not the garden of Eden which they have deserted, as flaming
                        swords are set at the gates to secure their exclusion. It becomes important
                        to the nation to inquire when the doors shall be re-opened for their
                        admission. According to my judgment they ought never to be recognized as
                        capable of acting in the Union or being counted as valid States, until the
                        Constitution shall have been so amended so as to make it what its framers
                        intended, so as to secure a perpetual ascendancy to the party of the Union,
                        firm and stable forever. The first of these amendments is to change the
                        basis of membership to actual voters. Now all the colored freedmen in the
                        Slave States and three-fifths of the slaves are represented, though none of
                        them have votes. The rebel State have 19 representatives of colored slaves.
                        If the slaves are now free, then they can add for the other two-fifths, 18
                        more, making the slave representation 32. I suppose the free blacks in those
                        states will give at least five more, making the representation of the non
                        voting people of color about 37. The whole number of representatives of from
                        the Slave States is 70; add the other two-fifths, and it will be 83. </p>
                    <p>If the amendment prevails, and those States withhold the right of suffrage
                        from persons of color, it will deduct about 37 leaving them but 43. With the
                        apportionment unchanged, the 83 Southern members with the Democrats that
                        will in the betimes be elected from the North, will always give them a
                        majority in Congress and in the Electoral College. They will at the very
                        first election take possession of the White House and the halls of Congress.
                        I need not depict the ruin that would follow. The assumption of the rebel
                        debt or repudiation of the Federal debt would be sure to follow. The
                        oppression of the freedmen and the re-amendment of the State Constitutions,
                        and re-establishment of Slavery would be the inevitable result. That they
                        would scorn and disregard their previous Constitutions, forced upon them in
                        the midst of martial law, would be both natural and just. No one that has
                        any regard for the freedom of elections can look upon those governments,
                        forced upon them in duress, with any favor. If they should grant the right
                        of suffrage to persons of color, I think there would always be Union white
                        men enough in the south, aided by the blacks, to divide the representation
                        and thus continue the Republican ascendancy. If they should refuse thus to
                        alter their election laws it would reduce the representatives of the late
                        Slave States to about 4 and render them powerless for evil. It is plain that
                        the amendment must be consummated before the defunct States are admitted to
                        be capable of State action, or it never can be. The proposed amendment to
                        allow Congress to lay a duty on exports is precisely the same situation. Its
                        importance cannot well be overstated. It is very obvious that for many years
                        the south will not pay much under our internal revenue laws. The only
                        article on which we can raise any considerable amount is cotton. It will be
                        grown largely at once. With ten cents per pound export duty it would be
                        furnished much cheaper to foreign markets than they could obtain it from any
                        other part of the world. The late war has shown that. Two millions of bales
                        exported at 50 pounds to the bale, would yield $100,000,000. This seems to
                        be the chief revenue we shall ever derive from the South. Besides it would
                        be a protection to that amount to our domestic manufactures. Other proposed
                        amendments to make all laws uniform, to prohibit the assumption of the rebel
                        debt, are of vital importance and the only thing that can prevent the
                        combined forces of copperheads and secessionists from legislating against
                        the interests of the Union whenever they may obtain an accidental majority.
                        But this is not all we ought to do before these inveterate Rebels are
                        invited to participate in our legislation. We have or are about to turn
                        loose 4,000,000 of slaves without a hut to shelter them or a cent in their
                        pockets. The infernal laws of Slavery have prevented them from acquiring an
                        education or from understanding the commonest laws of contract or from
                        managing the ordinary business of life. The Congress is bound to provide for
                        them until they can provide for themselves. If we do not furnish them with
                        homesteads and hedge them around with protective laws, if we leave them to
                        the legislation of their late masters, we had better have left them in
                        bondage. Their condition would be worse than our prisoners in Andersonville.
                        If we fail in this great duty now, and when we have the power we shall
                        deserve and receive the execrations of history and all future ages. Two
                        things are of vital importance. So to establish a principal that none of the
                        Rebel States shall be counted in any of the amendments of the Constitution
                        until they are duly admitted into the family of States by the law-making
                        power of their conquerors. For more than six months the amendment of the
                        Constitution abolishing Slavery has been ratified by the Legislatures of
                        three-fourths of the States, that acted on its passage by Congress which had
                        Legislatures, or which were States capable of acting or required to set on
                        that question. I take no account of the aggregations of white-washed Rebels,
                        who, without any legal authority, have assembled in the capitols of the late
                        Rebel States and stimulated legislative bodies. Nor do I regard with any
                        respect the cunning by play into which they deluded the Secretary of State
                        by frequent telegraphic announcements that "South Carolina had adopted the
                        Amendment," "Alabama has adopted the amendment, being the twenty-seventh
                        State," &amp;amp;c. This was intended to delude the people and accustom
                        Congress to hear the names of these extinct States as if they were alive,
                        when in truth they have no more existence than the revolted cities of
                        Latuim, two-thirds of whose people were colonized and their property
                        confiscated and their right of citizenship withdrawn by conquering and
                        avenging Rome.</p>
                    <p>It is equally important to the stability of this republic that it should now
                        be solemnly decided what power can revise, recreate and reinstate these
                        provinces into the family of States, and invest them with the rights of
                        American citizens. It is time that Congress should assert its sovereignty
                        and assume something of the dignity of a Roman Senate. It is fortunate that
                        the President invites Congress to take this manly attitude. After saying
                        with great frankness in his able message his theory, which, however, is
                        found to be impracticable, and which I believe very few now consider
                        tenable, he refers the whole matter to the judgment of Congress. If Congress
                        should fail firmly and wisely to discharge that high duty, it is not the
                        fault of the president. This Congress owes to its own character to set the
                        seal of reprobation upon a doctrine which is becoming too fashionable, and,
                        unless rebuked, will become the recognized principle of our Government.
                        Governor Perry and other Provisional Governors and orators proclaim that
                        this is the white man's Government. The whole copperhead party, pandering to
                        the lowest prejudices of the ignorant, repeat the cuckoo cry, "This is the
                        white man's Government." Demagogues of all parties, even some high in
                        authority, groveling, shouting, "This is the white man's government." What
                        is implied by this? That one race of men is to have the exclusive right
                        forever to rule this nation and to exercise all acts of sovereignty, while
                        all other races and nations and colors are to be their subjects and have no
                        voice in making the laws and choose the rulers by whom they are to be
                        governed. Wherein does this differ from slavery except in name? Does this
                        not contradict all the distinctive principles of the Declaration of
                        Independence? When the great and good men promulgated that Instrument and
                        pledged their lives and sacred honors to defend it, it was supposed to form
                        an epoch in civil government. Before that time it was held that the right to
                        rule was vested in families, dynasties or races--not because of superior
                        intelligence or virtue, but because of a divine right to enjoy exclusive
                        white privileges. Our fathers repudiated the whole doctrine of the legal
                        superiority of families or races, and proclaimed the equality of all men
                        before the law, upon that they created a revolution and built the Republic.
                        They were prevented by slavery from perfecting the superstructure whose
                        foundation they had thus broadly laid. For the sake of the Union they
                        consented to wait, but never relinquished the idea of its final completion.
                        The time to which they looked forward with anxiety has come. It is our duty
                        to complete their work. If this Republic is not now made to stand on their
                        great principles, it has no honest foundation, and the Father of all men
                        will [unclear] shake it to its centre. If we have not yet been sufficiently
                        scourged for our national sin to teach us to do justice to all God's
                        creatures, without distinction of race or color, we must expect the still
                        more heavy vengeance of an offended Father [unclear] increasing his
                        inflictions as he increased the severity of the plagues of Egypt until the
                        tyrant consented to do justice, and when that tyrant repented of his
                        reluctant consent, and attempted to re-enslave the people, as our Southern
                        tyrants are attempting to do now, he filled the Red Sea with broken chariots
                        and drowned horses, and strewed the shores with dead carcasses.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Speaker--I trust that the Republican Party will not be alarmed at what I
                        am saying. I do not profess to speak their sentiments, nor must they be held
                        responsible for them. I speak for myself and take responsibility, and will
                        settle with my intelligent constituents. This is not a white man's
                        Government in the exclusive sense in which it is used. To say so is
                        political blasphemy, for it violates the fundamental principles of our
                        gospel of liberty. This is man's government, the government of all men
                        alike. Not that all men will have equal power and sway within it; accidental
                        circumstances, natural and acquired endowment and ability will vary their
                        fortunes--but equal rights to all the privileges of the Government is innate
                        in every immortal being, no matter what the shape or color of the tabernacle
                        which it inhabits. If equal privileges were granted to all I should not
                        expect any but white men to be elected to office for long ages to come. The
                        prejudice engendered by Slavery would not soon permit merit to be preferred
                        to color. But it would still be beneficial to the weaker races in a country
                        where political division will always exist their power, joined with just
                        white men, would greatly modify if it did not entirely prevent the injustice
                        of majorities without the right of suffrage in the late slave States. I do
                        not speak of the Free States. The slaves had far better been left in
                        bondage. I see it stated that very distinguished advocates of the right of
                        suffrage declared in this city that they do no expect to obtain it by
                        Congressional legislation but only by administrative action; because as one
                        gallant gentleman said the State had not been out of the Union; then they
                        will never get it. The President is far sounder than they. He sees that
                        administrative action has nothing to do with it. If it ever is to come it
                        must by Constitutional amendments, or Congressional action in the
                        territorial and enabling acts. How shameful these men of influence should
                        mislead and miseducate the public mind. They proclaim this is the white
                        man's Government, and the whole coil of copperheads re-echo (hiss) the same
                        sentiments, and upstart, jealous Republicans join the cry. Is it any wonder
                        ignorant foreigners and illiterate natives should learn this doctrine and be
                        led to despise and maltreat a whole race of their fellowmen. Sir, this
                        doctrine of a white man's government is as atrocious as the infamous
                        sentiment that damned the late Chief Justice to everlasting fame, and I fear
                        to everlasting fire.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Sixteenth District of the State of Pennsylvania, of which Franklin County
                        forms a part, is, it appears, without a representative in Congress. In this
                        respect it is no worse off than many other districts in the Southern States
                        which have legally elected members of that body. It is clear to us that both
                        are entitled to representation, yet if our great men at Washington choose to
                        exclude from their "loyal" company the members of the States lately in
                        rebellion, for the reason that they were not elected by negro votes, it is
                        not our purpose at present to complain on that account. We do however
                        complain of the exclusion of the legally elected member from this district.
                        The objection against the right of southern members to Seats, does not lie
                        in this case, and if it did, it might be urged that if niggers were not
                        permitted to vote in the district, white men--having as little right to the
                        elective franchise in Pennsylvania, did vote. We can assure Congress that at
                        least two hundred "loyal," "union" abolition soldiers from the States of New
                        York, Massachusetts and elsewhere, having no more right to vote here than "the American citizens of African
                        descent," exercised the right of suffrage in this county alone and voted for
                        the regular loyal-union-abolition candidate. This assurance with the further
                        evidence of the attempt at fraud by the bogus board of return judges should
                        satisfy Congress that the election was such an one as deserves recognition
                        on their part. They should therefore give the seat to one of the claimants
                        without further delay. </p>
                    <p>It matters very little as far as regards the material interest of the people
                        of the district whether they are represented or not in the present Congress.
                        As a matter of right, however, they are entitled to representation, and one
                        or the other of the Brigadiers should be admitted.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The style of debate recently adopted by Mr. Sumner in the Senate, and Mr.
                        Stevens in the House, is not calculated to raise them in the esteem of their
                        countrymen. Perhaps, indeed, Mr. Sumner does not care, for we understand
                        that he has no regard for white people. There was a time in the Congress of
                        the United States when the members of that body had sufficient respect for
                        their own dignity to receive and treat with courtesy a message from the
                        President, who is their equal as a co-ordinate branch of the Government. But
                        some of our modern lawgivers have changed all that. The Senate Sends to the
                        President a resolution asking to be informed of the condition of the States
                        lately in rebellion, and for certain reports on the subject. This
                        information is promptly and courteously furnished by the President, and
                        thereupon the Senator from Massachusetts, because the message does not agree
                        with his ideas, stigmatizes the communication as a "whitewashing report."
                        What can be expected of a Senator who thus permits passion to cloud his
                        judgment, and personal spleen to overcome a proper sense of official
                        decency?</p>
                    <p>A similar scene took place in the House on Monday last, showing a total
                        disregard of that courtesy (to say nothing of good feeling) which should
                        prevail between a member of Congress, who is part of one branch of the
                        Government, and the President, who is head of another. Mr. Stevens,
                        pretending to state the positions of Mr. Johnson, wholly misrepresented
                        them, giving a distorted view of his opinions; and then with a perfect
                        knowledge that the President has officially acted on the ground that all the
                        States are still in the Union. Mr. Stevens characterized those who held such
                        opinions as "dreamy theorists." Nothing could be more offensive or insulting
                        than such language used by one officer to another, and it was only surpassed
                        by the savage and almost blasphemous attack made by Mr. Stevens, in the same
                        speech on a dead Chief Justice of the United
                        States. If Andrew Johnson were a bad man, or a man of doubtful loyalty, or
                        of weak mind, or ambitious of power to be used for his own advancement,
                        instead of being a strong, firm vigorous thinker, an unimpeachable patriot,
                        and jealous of the one-man power, the remarks used by Mr. Sumner and Mr.
                        Stevens might have some color or excuse, but as the case stands they are
                        such as the people should unanimously condemn. </p>
                    <p>As to the matter which called out Mr. Sumner's improper words, the people
                        have had an opportunity to judge. They will fail to find in the plain,
                        dispassionate and clear statement of the condition of the Southern States,
                        which Mr. Johnson sent into the Senate, anything which calls for such
                        offensive observations. It must be remembered that he has the whole case before him, and no
                            other member of the Government has, either inside or outside of
                        Congress, and therefore his judgment is entitled to respect, as it is most
                        likely to be correct. And it should also be borne in mind that he had just
                        been strengthened in his opinion by the report of General Grant, who was
                        fresh from an extended Southern tour of examination on the very subject on
                        which the Senate asked to be informed. General Grant's opinion is identical
                        with that of the President. He had talked with all kinds of people, as he
                        was traveling, with leading Southern men in the principal towns, and with
                        his own officers, high and low, and he came back "satisfied that the mass of
                        the thinking men of the South accept the present situation of affairs in
                        good faith," and that they regard the decisions which had been given against
                        them on the battle field "as a fortunate one for the whole country." In another place in his report he says that
                        there "is such a universal acquiescence in the
                        authority of the General Government" in the parts of the country he visited,
                        that the mere presence of small portions of the
                        military is sufficient to preserve order. The people will be much more
                        likely to put faith in the President and General Grant than in Mr. Sumner
                        and Mr. Stevens, and it is gratifying to find that no
                            one in the Senate echoed the offensive words of the Massachusetts
                        Senator. Such influential Union men as Mr. Doolittle, of Wis., and Mr.
                        Dixon, of Connecticut, and Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, took opposite ground, and
                        two of them administered to him a strong and proper rebuke.--Philadelphia Ledger. </p>

                        and we were pleased to receive it. Our offence was a trivial one--having
                        copied one of its editorials from another paper which had stolen it, thereby
                        becoming the receiver of stolen goods, not
                        knowing them to have been stolen. The Intelligencer has at length recovered its equanimity, and
                        overlooking our past delinquency, comes to us again. We welcome its
                        reappearance with pleasure and hope that nothing may occur in the future to
                        mar existing friendly relations, or to disturb the equanimity of either.</p>

                    <p>A CAPT. JOHN T. HILL, of the 6th California Volunteers, while with his
                        command in northern Nevada, found a dead Indian woman, upon whose breast was
                        a babe with a bullet wound in the shoulder, but alive.--Hill ordered that
                        the woman be scalped and the babe killed, which was done--the babe being
                        thrown over a high precipice and slashed to pieces. A court martial at San
                        Francisco took his case in hand and sentenced him to be dismissed from the
                        service and undergo imprisonment on Alcatraz island for thirty days. Gen.
                        M'Dowell refused to approve the findings on account of their being too
                        light. In the meantime Hill is in the enjoyment of the liberty of the city,
                        and no more will be heard of the case. We haven't any comments to make upon
                        Hill's [unclear] conduct. When the Governor of Minnesota sent South to
                        purchase bloodhounds at one hundred dollars a piece, with which to hunt down
                        Indians--men, women and children--and when General Pope and thousands of
                        other Christains approved of the plan, and nobody but "copperheads," in
                        press or in pulpit, condemned the Governor or the General, we began to think
                        it must be a recognized principle of Christian warfare to kill Indians in
                        any way and without regard to age or sex. If we had any doubts upon the
                        subject they have been since dissipated. When Federal officers on the plains
                        took to poisoning squaws and children by wholesale with strychnine, without
                        reproof from loyal press or pulpit, and not even the intimation of a court
                        martial, we came to the final conclusion that a "copperhead" unrefined by a
                        knowledge of the "higher law," and to whom "grand moral ideas in the
                        interest of God and humanity" are utterly unknown, is incapable of a clear
                        judgment upon questions of humanity and religion. Of course, therefore, Hill
                        was right--the Governor was right--so was the General and the strichnine
                        officers--and so is every loyal press and preacher who, by silence, says
                        they were right.--Patriot and Union</p>

                    <p>The population of this city, all told, is about 10,000 souls--one half white
                        and the same number black. The monthly average of the mortality in the city,
                        before and during the war, when the negroes were taken care of was about
                        forty, proportioned according to population. The mortality among the negroes
                        in this city during the past month was as near as can be ascertained, about
                        five hundred, while the number of deaths among the white population remained
                        substantially the same as before the war.</p>
                    <p>The cause of this difference in the mortality of blacks needs
                        explanation.--When the United States forces took possession of Macon the
                        negroes were all declared free. It was in vain that it was urged that
                        neither would the state of the growing crop justify the laborers in leaving
                        the fields nor should humanity suffer women and girls to [unclear] will into

                        unrestrained by any influences to defend them from ruin. Nothing availed.
                        The flat had gone forth and was maintained, whether for the weal or the woe
                        of the negro. The fields were deserted by the laborers, and almost in a
                        body, the women and children employed as house servants in the city, left
                        comfortable homes seized with a sudden passion for freedom and independently
                        setting up themselves. Instigated by an insane desire for city life and
                        under the apprehension that their freedom would not be completed if they did
                        not leave their former homes; nor permanent unless under the eyes of the
                        United States soldiery, the negroes flocked from the country into the city,

                    <p>
                        To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives
                            of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania:
                    </p>
                    <p>After four years of the most fearful internecine strife known to modern
                        history, it hath pleased Almighty God to bring this people back again into
                        the paths of peace. The throes and convulsions of a gigantic and
                        unjustifiable rebellion have passed off and the Republic lives. The war
                        commenced and waged at first to save the Union and maintain the supremacy of
                        the Constitution, widened and deepened in its sweep until it crucified
                        slavery--not only that the safety of the Union might be secured, but that it
                        might also be perpetual.</p>
                    <p>But the life of the Nation was not rescued from the jaws of death without
                        immense sacrifice, and intense sufferings. The waste of treasure, property
                        and life, has no parallel in modern warfare. To attempt to speak of our
                        fallen braves, in this memorial, would be unjust. "The whole earth is their
                        sepulchre, and all time the millenium of their glory." To tell here, the sad
                        story of the bereaved ones would be a work of [unclear], for a partial
                        people has already embalmed them in a hallowed memory, and the beneficence
                        of a munificent government will minister to their daily wants.</p>
                    <p>Death and bereavement are everywhere throughout the land. No community, and
                        very few families, escaped these common calamities of the war. Such losses
                        are incapable of compensation, because incapable of computation. But, whilst
                        it is eminently proper that such afflictions should occupy the most
                        commanding position in the public eye, it is also right that a reasonable
                        share of consideration and importance should be given to those calamities of
                        the war, which were peculiar, and confined to particular localities. In
                        calling, therefore, in this unostentatious manner, the attention of the
                        people of Pennsylvania to the extraordinary misfortunes of the citizens of
                        the border, and particularly of Chambersburg, it is by no means our object
                        to dwarf the sacrifices of other portions of the State, or to magnify our
                        own. We simply desire to commit our cause to the magnanimity and justice of
                        a great Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>It has passed into history that three times during the rebellion the
                        insurgent forces invaded the border counties of Pennsylvania, committing
                        great waste and destruction of property. During their last visitation, on
                        the morning of the 30th of July, 1864, they sacked and burned Chambersburg.
                        During the last two sessions of the Legislature, the citizens of the border
                        counties have been seeking, through their representatives, such legislation
                        as would enable them to have an adjudication of their losses, with a view to
                        their ultimate payment by the United States. The wisdom of the Legislature
                        overruled the application, chiefly upon the ground that it would be
                        dangerous for the State to take any steps that might work towards a
                        recognition of these claims until the war should close. The concurrent
                        decisions of two successive Legislatures having been given against any
                        obligation on the part of the State to pay, the citizens of the border
                        counties have very generally acquiesced in the judgment, and are disposed to
                        wait the action of the general government. But there is a growing feeling
                        all along the border, and we are happy to believe that it is gaining
                        strength throughout the State, that the Legislature should make a liberal
                        appropriation to the sufferers by the burning of Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>We will briefly state a few of the reasons which now are molding public
                        sentiment in its favor.</p>
                    <p>1st. It was an extraordinary and crushing calamity, unparalleled in extent
                        and ferocity throughout the war. Two-thirds of a loyal and thriving town of
                        five thousand people are laid in ashes, nearly three thousand people are
                        made homeless, and one-half of them reduced to want. Two millions of
                        property is destroyed. Families arose from their beds in the morning in
                        comfortable circumstances, and before night were entirely impoverished.
                        Nothing comparable to this was suffered by any other community. This
                        calamity towers above all others of the like kind--like Mount Blanc above
                        her sister Alps.</p>
                    <p>2d. It was not an accidental or fortuitous destruction. Abundant proof can be
                        had that it was deliberately resolved upon and ruthlessly executed in
                        pursuance of the orders of Gen. Jubal Early, as an act of fiendish
                        vengeance, and to strike the North with terror. The blow
                            that struck Chambersburg down, was aimed at every loyal town in the
                            State. Her sacrifice paid the penalty of concentrated rebel revenge and
                            hate.</p>
                    <p>3d..Chambersburg having sent her sons into the army, and having shared the
                        dangers and the honors of every battle-field of the war, left by the General
                        and State government without adequate protection, the most tempting prize
                        within reach of rebel attack, to become a victim to the horrors of plunder
                        and conflagration, now claims that common sympathy and common justice in her
                        behalf which uncommon misfortune universally commands from a great and
                        benevolent Commonwealth.</p>
                    <p>4th. The necessities of the sufferers most imperatively demand that a liberal
                        appropriation should at once be made. The contributions from all sources,
                        public and private, amount to about one hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
                        This sum has been largely sufficient to relieve from actual suffering and to
                        supply the necessaries of life. It has not availed anything towards the
                        rebuilding of the town, or the re-establishment of the sufferers in
                        business. It is a melancholy truth, that fully two-thirds of those who
                        suffered at all, have been entirely ruined. Wherever they have made an
                        effort to re-build their dwellings, or to establish a business, it has been
                        done upon borrowed capital. It is a grave mistake to suppose that the new
                        town, that is rising like the Phoenix from the ashes of the old, has been
                        built upon the wealth or substantial prosperity of its own citizens. He who
                        trades or builds upon borrowed capital, sleeps upon a bed of thistles.
                        Without immediate and efficient help, bankruptcy and despondency will
                        overwhelm the community. This is not an ostentatious parade of our
                        necessities before the public eye; it is simply the voice of truth speaking
                        to the humanity and justice of a liberal people.</p>
                    <p>5th. The only argument that could ever have been used with fairness against a
                        liberal appropriation, has now been entirely destroyed by the overthrow of
                        the rebellion. The prudence and caution which prevented former legislators
                        from giving a large appropriation, whilst the danger of renewed invasion was
                        imminent, were wise and entitled to great respect. And no one treated them
                        with more respectful consideration than the sufferers themselves. But now,
                        when the Union has been established again upon the foundation stone of
                        liberty, and the sounds of war have died away throughout our borders, such
                        an objection would be foolish and insincere.</p>
                    <p>Lastly. The finances of the State will justify such an appropriation as would
                        be of essential aid to our people. The exhibit of the condition of the
                        Treasury shows a surplus fund of more than two and a half millions of
                        dollars. No embarrassment would be entailed upon the treasury, and not a
                        single feather's weight would be added to the taxes of the citizens by such
                        a contribution. Why then shall it not be made? If a most astounding and
                        crushing calamity, incurred by a loyal people, not through any fault of
                        theirs, but as an expiating sacrifice for the whole State, which as
                        impoverished over three hundred families, is not to be redressed at the
                        close of the war, by a State with a plethoric treasury, and without laying
                        additional burdens upon the taxpayers, those ought certainly to be made very
                        strong and convincing reasons for remarkable harshness and injustice.</p>
                    <p>In some quarters there has been a reason given, and it may be again urged,
                        but it is unworthy of the head and heart of a true man. It has been asserted
                        that the people of Chambersburg ought to have defended their own. We will
                        not strive to vindicate ourselves from this implication. The pen of an
                        impartial historian has already blown away this cruel and insulting
                        accusation. His Excellency, Gov. Curtin, in his special message to the
                        Legislature at its extraordinary session in August, A. D., 1864, gave the
                        following narrative of the military operation that resulted in the
                        destruction of Chambersburg. He says:</p>
                    <p>"On Friday, the 29th of July, the rebel brigades of Johnson and M'Causland,
                        consisting of from two thousand five hundred to three thousand mounted men,
                        with six guns, crossed the Potomac at Clear Spring ford. They commenced
                        crossing at ten o'clock, A. M., and marched directly on Mercersburg. There
                        were but forty-five men picketed in that direction, under the command of
                        Lieut. M'Clean, U. S. A., and as the enemy succeeded in cutting the
                        telegraph communication, which from that point had to pass west by way of
                        Bedford, no information could be sent to Gen. Couch, by telegraph, who was
                        then at Chambersburg. The head of this column reached Chambersburg at three
                        o'clock, A. M., on Saturday the 30th.</p>
                    <p>"The rebel brigades of Vaughn and Jackson, numbering about three thousand
                        mounted men, crossed the Potomac at about the same time at or near
                        Williamsport; part of the command advanced on Hagerstown; the main body
                        moved on the road leading from Williamsport to Greencastle. Another rebel
                        column of infantry and artillery crossed the Potomac simultaneously at
                        Shepherdstown, and moved toward Leitersburg. Gen. Averill, who commanded a
                        force, reduced to about two thousand six hundred men, was at Hagerstown, and
                        being threatened in front by Vaughn and Jackson, on his right, by M'Causland
                        and Johnson, was also threatened his rear, and on his left by the column
                        which crossed at Shepherdstown, he therefore fell back upon Greencastle.</p>
                    <p>"Gen. Averill, it is understood, was under the orders of Gen. Hunter; but was
                        kept as fully advised, by Gen. Couch, as was possible of the enemy's
                        movements on his right and on his rear. Gen. Couch was in Chambersburg,
                            where his entire force consisted of sixty infantry
                            and forty five cavalry, and a section of a battery of artillery, in all
                            less than one hundred and fifty men. The six companies of men,
                        enlisted for one hundred days, remaining to the State, and two companies of
                        cavalry had, under orders from Washington, (as I am unofficially advised,)
                        joined General Averill. The town of Chambersburg was held until daylight by
                        the small force under Gen. Couch, during which time the Government stores
                        and train were saved. Two batteries were then planted by the enemy,
                        commanding the town, and it was invested by the whole command of Johnson and
                        M'Causland. At seven o'clock, A. M., six companies of dismounted men,
                        commanded by Sweeney, entered the town, followed by mounted men under
                        Gilmore. The main force was in line of battle. A demand was made for one
                        hundred dollars in gold, or five hundred thousand dollars in Government
                        funds, as ransom, and a number of citizens were arrested and held as hostage
                        for its payment. No offer of money was made by the citizens of the town, and
                        even if they had any intention of paying a ransom, no time was allowed, as
                        the rebels commenced immediately to burn and pillage the town, disregarding
                        the appeals of women and children, the aged and infirm, and even the bodies
                        of the dead were not protected from their brutality. It
                            would have been in vain for all the citizens of the town, if armed, to
                            have attempted, in connection with General Couch's small force, to
                            defend it. General Couch withdrew his command, and did not
                        himself leave until the enemy were actually in the town. General Averill's
                        command being within nine miles of Chambersburg, it was hoped, would arrive
                        in time to save the town, and efforts were made during the night to
                        communicate with him. In the meantime, the small force of Gen. Could held
                        the enemy at bay. Gen. Averill marched on Chambersburg, but did not arrive
                        until after the town was burned, and the enemy had retired. He pursued and
                        overtook them at M'Connellsburg, in Fulton county, in time to save that
                        place from pillage and destruction. He promptly engaged and defeated them,
                        driving them to Hancock and serves the Potomac." </p>
                    <p>Gen. Couch, the Commander of the Department of the Susquehanna, also bore
                        this testimony to the gallantry of the people of Chambersburg. In a dispatch
                        to the Secretary of War, dated July 22, 1864, he said: "During the recent
                        raid into Maryland, the citizens of Chambersburg turned out with a
                        determination to stand by the few soldiers present, and hold the town
                        against any cavalry force that might assault it."</p>
                    <p>Such testimony ought to be sufficient to convince every candid mind that the
                        accusation of want of spirit and [unclear] among our citizens, is not only
                        groundless, but malevolent.</p>
                    <p>Our cause is now before the people of Pennsylvania. If its feeble
                        presentation shall have the effect to turn public attention towards us, to
                        stir up a feeling of sympathy in our behalf, to cause men in the hurry of
                        life to stop and reflect upon the justice and propriety of the claim, we
                        will not cease to cherish the hope that tardy relief will come at last. We
                        feel sure, that to all fair and reasonable minds, quick and strong upon
                        knowing, sympathizing, and reflecting, will come the sudden impulse to help
                        and to save.</p>
