<b>People Must Be Trusted In A Free Government</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In response to the passage of a loyalty oath, to be taken by all members of
                    Congress, the article dismisses the measure as unconstitutional.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Louisville Democrat</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Congress passed a test oath, to be taken by all its members, which directly
                        excludes from that body all who gave aid and comfort to the rebellion. A man
                        must swear what few men of talent and influence in the South can swear, or
                        he can't be a member of Congress.</p>
                    <p>We don't think any impartial tribunal would pronounce this oath
                        constitutional.--The Constitution defines who shall be members of Congress:
                        and, surely, no one will hold that Congress can add other qualifications,
                        because that body is authorized to judge of members. To judge of
                        qualifications is not to fix them, as they are laid down in the organic law.</p>
                    <p>But grant that the power exists; is it statesman-like to exercise it this
                        way? It is idle to expect the South not to prefer men who sympathized with
                        them, suffered with them and surrendered with them. It would be contrary to
                        human nature if they did not. They may feel that the rebellion was wrong and
                        a blunder, and still love the men who sinned and suffered with them.</p>
                    <p>These prominent and trusted men South that went with the current ought to
                        have resisted it, it is easy to say; but much easier said than done. These
                        prominent and trusted men were the very ones to be victimized by a popular
                        excitement. They would be drafted into service or exiled. If they give it
                        up, and their constituents too, what more should be asked? They are not to
                        be trusted, it will be said. Perhaps some of them are not. Perhaps thousands
                        would repeat the disastrous experiment; but shall we, on the strength of
                        this distrust, adopt a principle incompatible with free representative
                        government?</p>
                    <p>Whilst there is some danger on the one side, there is certainly more on the
                        other. The people and their favorite representatives must be trusted, if we
                        expect them to trust the Government. If we have got to such a pass that the
                        millions of a whole section can't be trusted by the Government, we have got
                        to the end of free government.</p>
                    <p>They might as well tell us at once that free representative government is a
                        failure, and not amuse us with empty forms and the substance gone.</p>
                    <p>Will the South trust the Government?--Will the South be friendly to the
                        Government ?</p>
                    <p>Whilst these questions are asked, the majority proceed to legislate on
                        distrust. The masses South may reply: Why should we trust the Government--it
                        will not trust us. Why should we be friendly to the government--it is not
                        friendly to us? Why should we be friendly to the Government--it is not
                        friendly to us? These distrustful expedients, adopted to secure the
                        Government, may pass, and men may flatter themselves with an apparent
                        tranquility; but it will be a false and deceitful tranquility.</p>
                    <p>The majority, consisting their passions and prejudices are going in the wrong
                        direction to secure the perpetuity of the Union. It is thrusting the power
                        of thc Federal Government into local interests, and claiming the right of a
                        majority to rule all parts of this vast republic at its discretion. It is
                        carefully seeking provision for disaffection and rebellion. It is sowing the
                        seeds. There is much more security in abandoning some of the powers the
                        Government has, than in usurping others that it never had, and never ought
                        to have.</p>
                    <p>No rebellion or disaffection has ever risen in this country on account of
                        what the Federal Government did not do.</p>
                    <p>If Congress had not declared war in 1812, New England could have had no food
                        to feed disaffection and secession. If Congress had not levied duties for
                        protection, South Carolina could have found no excuse to nullify.</p>
                    <p>If Congress had not claimed power over slavery in the Territories, and had
                        not exercised the power to pass a fugitive slave law, there would have been
                        no fuel to fire the Southern heart up to this rebellion. It is the acts of
                        commission, not of omission that feed defection and produce rebellion.</p>
                    <p>One merit of the old confederation was, that its acts produced no rebellion.
                        It may have needed a little more power; but our present Federal Government
                        has exercised too much, and the present dominant party are resolved to
                        increase the evil a thousand fold. The attempt to rule out members of
                        Congress by test oaths is one of these usurpations of power. Whilst these
                        incompetents are looking at evils they have seen and felt, they have no
                        conception of dangers that are not developed. Whilst they are stopping leaks
                        in the ship of state, they don't see how many they are making. There is
                        little danger in what they fear; that danger is over; but the next one will
                        be of their own make and much more formidable.</p>
                    <p>One point seems evident to us. In a free representative government the people
                        have to be trusted. Whatever danger there is in it, there is more in the
                        opposite course certain and inevitable.</p>
                    <p>Once begin these arbitrary, repressive measures for the sake of security--the
                        common plea of tyrants--and there is no stopping place. Such measures
                        themselves create the necessity for more, and persevered in, will end in
                            despotism.--Louisville Democrat.</p>

<b>The Radicals Frightened</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the editorial, the Radicals are running scared in Washington,
                    fearful that their demise is imminent. For this reason, they have sought to
                    extend the current session of Congress "in order to checkmate the schemes" of
                    the President, who, they believe, is trying desperately to cut short their hold
                    on power.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is strong evidence just now of a big scare among the radical
                        conspirators at Washington. Forney has been sounding the alarm for some days
                        through his newspapers, the Washington Chronicle
                        and Philadelphia Press. His fertile brain has
                        been at work imagining huge conspiracies on the part of President Johnson
                        and his friends, calculated to cut short the radical hold on power. He again
                        earnestly counsels Congress to continue the session "until the ides of
                        December," in order to check-mate the schemes of the "reckless man in the
                        Presidential Chair." He is growing wild and frantic. He raves and fumes like
                        a madman. The untimely publication of his January love-letter, addressed to
                        "My Dear Mr. President," has turned his brain and knocked all the philosophy
                        out of him. He talks about "revolution," "usurpation," "conspiracies," and
                        the like, and loudly calls upon Congress to come to the rescue. Congress
                        catches the contagion and acts on Fourney's suggestion. The radical leaders
                        hastily summon a caucus of the faithful, to deliberate upon the critical
                        political situation, and to take counsel together. The caucus met. The
                        telegraph informs us that "the first thing done was to enjoin secrecy
                        regarding their proceedings but notwithstanding this, it has transpired that
                        there was a full and free interchange of views as to the questions pending
                        before Congress and the interests of the party
                        generally," and that "they could not now fix the
                        time for adjournment, the radical party is in a strait something like the
                        fellow who had a hungry wolf by the ears--it was death to hold on and death
                        to let go. Many of the radical members are candidates, or want to be, for
                        re-election. If they remain in session their personal interests at home may
                        suffer, and if they adjourn they fear that Andy Johnson will "let slip the
                        dogs of war" against their dear friends, the radical office holders, thus
                        depriving them of the lever by which they have retained themselves in power
                        for the past five years, and destroying their party at one fell swoop.
                        Herein is the difficulty. It is death to hold on and death to let go. We are
                        happy to observe, however, that "it was finally con-cluded to appoint a
                        committee of Senators and Representatives to review the
                            entire ground," and report at a future meeting. We wish them a
                        safe deliverance. </p>
                    <p>And to make matters still worse, we have rumors of a general "bunt [UNCLEAR]
                        up" in the Cabinet. The weak-kneed are expected soon to retire, if they have
                        not already sent in their resignations, and their places to be filled by
                        staunch and true men. When the Cabinet is re-organized as a harmonious unit
                        on the basis of thc President's restoration policy, we may expect the
                        Executive war against the disunion radicals to be waged in no halting or
                        shilly-shally manner. It will be sharp and quick and decisive, and the
                        radicals well know it will result in their complete and final discomfiture
                        and defeat.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Swisshelm, writing to the Repository of last
                        week, says: "John W. Forney Wilkinson, late correspondent of the New York
                            Tribune, and other men of that stamp, have
                        been feeling gloomy during the past week and
                        talking of "stormy time" ahead. The gentlemen I have named do not say
                        revolution, appeal to arms, but they seemed less
                        hopeful now than when revolution appeared most imminent." </p>
                    <p>Our readers will readily perceive that the radicals are badly frightened. We
                        predict that they will be badly hurt, as well as
                        frightened, about the ideas of October and November next.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Under the direction of the Thad. Stevens radicals a call has been issued,
                        signed by a number of "soreheads" from different parts of thc South, for a
                        convention of Southern Radicals to be held in Philadelphia on the first
                        Monday in September. This is intended as a set-off to the 14th of August
                        convention, but it will prove a miserable failure, for the reason that the
                        participants in the affair will have no constituents to represent. To
                        pretend that such men as Judge Underwood and John M. Botts are exponents of
                        the sentiments of even a respectable fracture of the Southern people would
                        be a gross libel on the name of the character of that people. The signers of
                        the call, with a few exceptions, are men of no importance whatever--mere
                        polical adventurers, who hope to gain a little notoriety, and perhaps
                        something a little more substantial from their radical masters, by the
                        movement.</p>
                    <p>The call says: "It is proposed that we should meet at that time to recommend
                        measures for the establishment of such government
                        in the South as accords with and protects the rights of all citizens." Now
                        it is well known that governments have been
                        established in the South by competent authority, and we have only to
                        say that if these "loyal patriots" undertake to establish counter or
                        revolutionary governments, they will find themselves quickly "squelched" by
                        the strong arm of the General Government. </p>
