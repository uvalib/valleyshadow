<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>THE Repository, in commenting on an editorial
                        article in our columns several weeks since, in relation to the contest then
                        pending between Gen. Coffroth and Mr. Koontz for a seat in Congress as the
                        Representative from this district, accuses us of occasional stupidity. We do
                        not intend here to deny the charge, and freely acknowledge that we are not
                        at all times as smart as our contemporary with his "score of assistants." It were folly for an humble individual
                        like ourself to claim anything like the immense ability, weekly displayed in
                        the columns of that journal. The idea of any one man measuring sentences
                        with a "score" of individuals such as do the scribbling for the Repository, is simply preposterous and we
                        distinctly disclaim any intention of the kind. The "score" composing the
                        editorial "staff" of that paper, comprising as it
                        does lawyers, doctors, loafers, teachers, book-store keepers and Yankee
                        vagabonds generally, no doubt monopolizes nearly all the talent in this
                        section, and we freely accord to them all that they claim in this respect. </p>
                    <p>But in this matter of the contest between Messrs. Coffroth and Koontz, we
                        must be permitted to deny that they have exhibited their usual prescience.
                        In proof of what we assert in the way of denial we would refer to the
                        columns of that paper for the past several months. Week after week, its
                        readers were favored with an editorial on this Coffroth and Koontz business,
                        and taking everything as true and made by authority, its readers never
                        dreamed of any other result than that Gen. Koontz would get the seat and our
                        friend Coffroth be left out in the cold. We must confess that we feared as
                        much ourself. The swagger of the writer almost convinced us that he knew all
                        about it, and that right and justice would be overslanghed in the decision
                        of this question, as it had been in others. Article after article was
                        written by some one of its "score" of editors and published in its columns
                        which in view of what has since been done by the Committee, would have had
                        no other object than to prejudice the decision of the case. Gen. Coffroth
                        was abused without stint and made the subject of the writers ridicule. Even
                        the grave charge was made that he became a party to a corrupt bargain in
                        order to secure the seat. All the influences which the editor could bring to
                        bear to defeat General Coffroth were freely used, but alas for the mighty
                        influence of the Repository without avail. </p>
                    <p>As early as the 20th of December the Repository
                        said: </p>
                    <p>"[unclear] committee on elections in Congress will report in favor of giving
                        Gen. Wm. H. Koontz the seat as having the right prima
                            facie, and he will be qualified while Gen. Coffroth will be
                        allowed to contest and make out the best case he can. As Gen. Koontz was
                        elected and Gen. Coffroth was not, it is eminently proper that Gen. Koontz
                        should be sworn." </p>
                    <p>On reading this almost any one would have been satisfied that the thing was
                        even then fixed, and that the Repository knew all
                        about it, but as we were a little "stupid" we did'nt believe it--in fact we
                        knew better--and wrote an article setting forth the simple facts of the case
                        and urging, in our feeble way, the admission of Gen. Coffroth to the seat,
                        on the ground that he was of right entitled to it. We did it with all due
                        deference to the superior acuteness of our neighbor, and we now submit
                        whether the facts have borne it out for its assumption of prescience. The
                        assertion that Gen. Koontz "will be given the seat as having the right prima facie" and that "he will be qualified while
                        Gen. Coffroth will be allowed to contest and make out the best case he can,"
                        has not been borne out by the decisions of the Committee and the writer in
                        the Repository occupies the position of a blatant
                        braggart. Before the article accusing us of stupidity had appeared, the case
                        had been decided the seat given to Gen. Coffroth "leaving Mr. Koontz to
                        contest and make out the best case he can." </p>
                    <p>We are altogether too modest to claim that anything we said on the subject
                        had an effect in the decision of the question, and we ascribe the result to
                        the merits of the case, but at the same time, we confess to a slight
                        suspicion that the Repository after all had much
                        to do with it. The editor of that journal is a very cunning man, and
                        sometimes when he wishes to damage a man very seriously, he takes to
                        advocating his cause in his paper as the most effective mode of doing it. In
                        most cases this plan works admirably. Everything said in his favor is taken
                        against him, and the poor devil who imagines his cause aided by the advocacy
                        of that paper, finds out in the end that it was that which "eviscerated" his
                        case. On the whole we are somewhat inclined to the belief that such is the
                        fact in the present instance. The Repository
                        did'nt like Koontz, and, as the most effectual way to kill him off, it took
                        to abusing Coffroth and puffing Koontz. The result is before the people. Our
                        friend Coffroth has the seat, while Koontz--poor devil "will be allowed to
                        contest and make out the best case he can." Verily the Repository hath influence in our national counsels. </p>

                    <p>The Committee selected to try the right to a seat in the Senate of this State
                        for the 19th district, between Messrs. Duncan and McConaughy on Tuesday last
                        reported giving the seat to Mr. McConaughy, and ousting the sitting member,
                        Mr. Duncan. Mr. Duncan, in order to shorten the proceedings and bring the
                        matter to a speedy issue, put in a demurer, by which he acknowledged that
                        the non-reporting drafted men had voted for him as alleged in the petition
                        of the contestant, thus placing the whole on the constitutionality of the
                        law disfranchising that class of men. He did this in the belief, that the
                        committee would take the opinion of the Attorney General of the
                        Commonwealth, on the matter, but he has been disappointed. The Committee at
                        first, did intend to take an opinion from that officer, but after an
                        interview with Hon. Simon Cameron, whose
                        creatures they appear to be, and knowing full well that that opinion would
                        be adverse to his political interests, declined doing so, and decided the
                        question in accordance with their party predilections and in violation of
                        right, justice, their oaths, and every honest instinct which should govern
                        men in such cases. We now and here denounce the men who have been guilty of
                        this infamous outrage, and in order that they may be held up to the scorn
                        and contempt of all honorable men we append their names: WILMER WORTHINGTON,

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In another column of our paper will be found the opinion of Judge King, in
                        the matter of the contested election for District Attorney of this county.
                        It will be observed that the learned Judge expresses no opinion on the 1st
                        and 2nd points of the respondent, for the reason that if even the law of
                        Congress disfranchising non-reporting drafted men and deserters be
                        constitutional the provisions of the act cannot be enforced in this case. He
                        is of the opinion that a Board of Election officers are not competent to
                        decide on the question whether a man is a deserter or not. And by taking for
                        granted the mere allegation of a defunct Provost
                        Marshal that he is such, they are assuming more authority than is delegated
                        to such functionaries. He seems to be impressed with the idea, and so holds,
                        that no man can be justly and lawfully deprived of one of the dearest rights
                        of a freeman, until his guilt shall have been judicially established. The
                        question of the Constitutionality of the act of Congress disfranchising the
                        class of men alluded to, did not arise in this case, but we are informed
                        that the learned Judge gave it as a dictum, that the act was clearly
                        unconstitutional--that Congress had no power to prescribe the qualifications
                        of electors in Pennsylvania. </p>
                    <p>We congratulate the people of our noble old State, that its Judiciary have
                        still the nerve to disregard the assumptions of illegal power on part of the
                        Federal government and its underlings, and that in the hands of such men as
                        Judge King, the law will be administered
                        regardless of the behests of party or party expediency. Although the Senate
                        of a great State may nullify, for party purposes, the election laws of the
                        commonwealth and approve the unconstitutional Ex Post
                            Facto Laws of Congress, by which white men are declared infamous
                        outlaws and are disfranchised, without trial, upon the mere allegation of
                        men who for a brief hour strutted upon the stage in all the glory of
                        shoulder straps and gold lace, yet the Judiciary are to be trusted as the

                        day of March, A. D. 1865, entitled an act to amend the several acts
                        heretofore passed to provide for the enrolling and calling out of the
                        National forces, and for other purposes, the said deserters so having cast
                        said votes as aforesaid, for said Calvin M. Duncan, were to be deemed and
                        taken to have voluntarily relinquished and forfeited their rights of
                        citizenship, and were not therefore qualified electors of said Senatorial
                        district or of this Commonwealth. Your committee, regarding said act as
                        valid, and knowing no right or power in them to question it, have found the
                        said ninety-three votes so cast as aforesaid, by said deserters, and
                        returned for said Calvin M. Duncan, to be illegal votes and have therefore
                        deducted the same from the said six thousand one hundred and eighty-eight
                        votes returned for the said Calvin M. Duncan, and have ascertained and do
                        report the whole number of legal votes cast and returned for the said Calvin
                        M. Duncan to be six thousand and ninety-five (6,095); and having deducted
                        the said illegal votes cast and returned for the said Calvin M. Duncan from
                        six thousand one hundred and sixty-three (6,160), being the whole number of
                        legal votes cast and returned for the said David McConaughy, do find and
                        report the said David McConaughy to have received an actual majority of
                        sixty-eight (68) votes of the whole number of legal votes cast and returned;
                        and your committee do therefore decide and report that the said David
                        McConaughy had the greatest number of legal votes, and ought to be admitted
                        to the contested seat as Senator election from the Nineteenth Senatorial

                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--Of all the infamous measures
                        which have of late years been attempted to be foisted upon the country, that
                        of negro suffrage is the most shameful and degrading to the white citizen.
                        No other proposition yet advocated is so degrading to white Americans and so
                        fraught with evil to the country as this. The purpose of Congress to
                        legislate negro suffrage into the District of Columbia is but the entering
                        wedge, to force it on the Southern States before they shall be admitted to
                        their constitution rights in the first place, and ultimately on the North
                        also. The enactment and enforcement of such a law on an unwilling people
                        carries with it poison to the very vitals of American liberty. The sentiment
                        of the people of the Union was shocked at the time it was determined to free
                        the negro in the South, but the only wonder now is that his right to vote
                        was not proclaimed at the same time. That such a right can be conferred by
                        Congress and enforced without provoking another civil convulsion, is a
                        problem which the future alone can solve. The devil very probably has
                        sufficient influence with the present Congress to have this element of
                        mischief thrown upon the country, but we hope the good sense of the people will assert itself in time to prevent
                        much of the evil which will inevitably result from the passage of such laws.
                        The negro differs in skin and brain from all other races of men, and the
                        effort to make him the equal politically and socially, of the white race, is
                        the offspring of folly or madness which could only excite the pity and
                        contempt of all right thinking people, for its advocates did not their
                        craziness endanger the place and welfare of the nation. We hope President
                        Johnson will restrain those miserable fanatics with his Executive veto,
                        until the people can replace them in the halls of Congress, with honest and
                        sensible representatives. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the matter of the Contested Election for District Attorney for the County
                        of Franklin, D. Watson Rowe vs. Wm. B. Stenger.</p>
                    <p>OPINION OF JUDGE KING.</p>
                    <p>This case comes before us on the petition of twenty or more of the qualified
                        electors of the County of Franklin, complaining that Wm. S. Stenger was not
                        duly elected to the office of District Attorney; that the election was
                        undue, and D. Watson Rowe was duly elected to said office.</p>
                    <p>The respondent has filed a motion to quash this petition for the following
                        reasons:</p>
                    <p>1st. Because said petition was not filed within ten days after the election
                        for said office of District Attorney, held on the 10th day of October, 1865.</p>
                    <p>2nd. That the act of Congress of March 3d 1865, so far as relates to all
                        persons drafted into the military service of the United States prior to the
                        passage thereof, is an ex post facto law and
                        therefore unconstitutional and void. </p>
                    <p>3rd. Because the said petition is too vague, indefinite and imprecise to
                        entitle it to a hearing.</p>
                    <p>4th. Because it does not appear that, if all that is stated upon the face of
                        the petition was proved, the result of the election would be changed, or
                        that the Court would be compelled to declare the election an undue election.</p>
                    <p>5th. Because, were, if it be true that the alleged persons named in the
                        petition, were deserters from the military service of the United States, and
                        that they did vote for the said Wm. S. Stenger, still said persons were
                        qualified electors of Franklin County and this Commonwealth, notwithstanding
                        anything in the Act of Congress of March 3d, 1865; entitled "An Act to amend
                        the several acts heretofore passed, to provide for the enrolling and calling
                        out the National forces and for other purposes."</p>
                    <p>The first reason assigned has not been pressed, and but little stress has
                        been laid on the second, by the counsel for the respondent; and the views we
                        are about to submit on the principal question in the case, as presented by
                        the fourth and fifth reasons, render it unnecessary to express any opinion
                        upon the third reason assigned. We come, therefore, to consider whether the
                        votes of Curtis Dulabon, George Miller, John Tallhelm and Abraham Sheely
                        were illegal, on the ground that these voters, had been drafted into the
                        military service of the United States, and had failed to report to the
                        provost marshal of the 16th District of Pennsylvania, composed, in part, of
                        the County of Franklin.</p>
                    <p>The counsel for the respondent make these points:</p>
                    <p>1st. That the act of Congress of March 3d 1865, so far as relates to all
                        persons drafted into the military service of the United States, prior to the
                        passage thereof, is an ex post facto law and
                        therefore unconstitutional and void. </p>
                    <p>3d. That were, if the act be Constitutional, the voters referred to, in the
                        petition, could not be disfranchised, without hearing and trial according to
                        the law of the land.</p>
                    <p>The first and second of these points involve questions of very grave
                        importance and require time for their investigation; and having arrived at
                        the conclusion that the provisions of the act of Congress cannot be enforced
                        in this case; for the reasons we shall presently note, we express no opinion
                        in regard to them.</p>
                    <p>That Congress has power to punish desertion, or refusal to report when
                        drafted, or for evading the draft by leaving the jurisdiction of the United
                        States, we entertain no doubt; and no punishment that can lawfully be
                        inflicted for such offenses can be too severe. These are crimes against the
                        country of the most dangerous tendency, and admit of no palliation or
                        excuse; and it is held that no man can justly and lawfully be deemed guilty
                        of them, until such guilt has been judicially established. No man can be
                        deprived of life, liberty or property unless by the judgment of his peers or
                        the law of the land. Both the federal and State constitutions guarantee this
                        fundamental right to every citizen. Have these safeguards been provided, in
                        the organic law of the federal and State governments, for no purpose? Is
                        there any dearer right than the elective franchise, and is that left
                        entirely without protection? We can best answer these pregnant questions by
                        quoting the eloquent language of Justice Coulter, in the case of Brown v.
                        Hummel, 6 Barr 91--"The talismanic words, I am a citizen of Pennsylvania,
                        secures to the individual his private rights, unless they are taken away by
                        a trial, where he has an opportunity of being heard, by himself, his counsel
                        and his testimony, more majorium, according to
                        the laws and customs of our fathers, and the securities and safeguards of
                        the Constitution. Sir Edward Coke defines the meaning of the words, by the law of the land--for they were used in magna charta, and have been sprinkled with tears
                        and blood of many patriots--to be a trial by due course and process of law.
                        * * * * It is against the principles of liberty and common right to deprive
                        a man of his property of franchise, while he is
                        within the pale of the Constitution and with his hand on the altar, without
                        hearing and trial by due course and process of law." In another part of the
                        same opinion he speaks of the right of suffrage as the most important of all
                        a man's franchises and asks: "Who does not feel its value; and who but would
                        turn pale if he thought he could be deprived of it without hearing or
                        trial." These fundamental principles of civil liberty, cannot be overlooked
                        or disregarded by the courts, to which we all look for protection, without
                        seriously imperiling the safety of the people. It is a thousand times better
                        therefore, that Mr. Rowe should lose the office he claims than that his
                        right thereto should be declared by trampling under foot the sacred right,
                        to which we have just adverted, that no man shall be condemned without an
                        opportunity of being heard in his own defence. </p>
                    <p>For the reasons we have thus hastily and imperfectly presented. We sustain
                        the motions to quash the petition.</p>
