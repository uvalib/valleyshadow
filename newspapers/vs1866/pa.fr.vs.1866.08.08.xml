                <transcript>
                    <p>We give in this week's issue a pretty full account of the great Johnson
                        Clymer Soldiers' Convention held at Harrisburg on Wednesday last. This
                        convention was a grand <emph rend="italic">success</emph>, exceeding the
                        most sanguine expectations of its friends. Over several hundred regularly
                        elected delegates were in attendance, representing every county in the
                        State. In addition to the regular delegates, large delegations of soldiers
                        from various parts of the State were present, who came a spectators to give
                        encouragement by their presence to the great cause for which they fought in
                        the field--namely, the maintenance of the Union and the Constitution. At
                        least <emph rend="italic">five thousand</emph> veteran soldiers were in
                        Harrisburg on that day, many of them maimed and giving other evidence of
                        hard service in the field, and all animated by a firm determination to
                        complete with the ballot the great work for which they took up arms and
                        risked their lives on the bloody field of battle. It was encouraging to see
                        the noble enthusiasm which inspires these brave men as they sent up cheer
                        after cheer for JOHNSON, CLYMER AND THE UNION. </p>
                    <p>This grand demonstration of the "boys is true" has struck terror in the
                        hearts of the Geary disunionists. It is the handwriting on the wall which
                        portends their utter and overwhelming defeat in October. Before the
                        convention met they undertook to ridicule it, but since it has proved a
                        magnificent success they have no other resort than <emph rend="italic">hard
                            lying</emph> to counteracts influence on the people. The Harrisburg
                            <emph rend="italic">Telegraph</emph> we should judge, has been employed
                        by its party to <emph rend="italic">lie</emph> by contract and for pay. That
                        any editor, however depraved would do the wholesale lying of the <emph
                            rend="italic">Telegraph</emph> merely for the fun of the thing is hardly
                        a supportable case. And more than that, Bergner has not the representation
                        of doing the dirty work of his party for <emph rend="italic"
                        >nothing</emph>--it is not his style. We suggest to Mr. Jordan, Chairman of
                        the Republican State Committee, to pay the Hessian well, in order to atone
                        in some degree in this world for the torments he will have to endure in the
                        next. The work, however has not been well performed by the <emph
                            rend="italic">Telegraph</emph>--its lies have been gotten up in rather a
                        bungling manner for an adept in the business. For instance, it characterizes
                        the convention as a "failure," a "fizzle," &amp;c., and then calls for a
                        [UNCLEAR] meeting of Geary soldiers to "<emph rend="italic">counteract the
                            influence</emph>" of the "fizzle." If the Clymer Convention was a
                        "fizzle" where is the necessity of counteracting its influence? A "fizzle"
                        could hardly be said to have any influence to counteract. </p>
                    <p>But all the lying the <emph rend="italic">Telegraph</emph> and kindred sheets
                        in the State can do will not destroy the influence of this Convention or the
                        October election. It shows conclusively that the hearts of the real
                        soldiers--the ranK and file of the army are--with US TWO TO ONE. It will
                        inspire the conservative masses of the State with fresh courage and lead
                        them to increased exertions on behalf of Constitutional liberty and a
                        restored Union. It is a bright omen of the election of Hiester Clymer by not
                        less than twenty thousand majority </p>

                    <p>The Democratic Conference for this district will meet shortly to nominate a
                        candidate for Congress. There are three candidates in the field, Messrs.
                        Sharpe, Coffroth and McSherry. Somerset and Bedford have instructed for
                        Coffroth, Franklin and Fulton for Sharpe, and Adams for McSherry. This makes
                        it an interesting fight, with Adams county holding the balance of power.</p>
                    <p>We have nothing to say against any of the gentlemen named--they are all good
                        men and would doubtless represent the district in Congress with credit alike
                        to themselves and their constituents, if elected--but we hope to be pardoned
                        for making a mere allus on the distinguished gentlemen presented by the
                        Democracy of Franklin county. We present the name of J. McDowell Sharpe,
                        Esq., a gentleman whose eminent talents and unbounded popularity are known
                        and appreciated not only throughout this district but throughout the State.
                        We ask his nomination at the hands of the conference, first, because our
                        county, being the largest in the district and not having had a candidate
                        since the district was formed, is properly entitled to the nomination; and
                        second, because we believe, without intending to disparage the popularity of
                        the other gentlemen named, that Mr. Sharpe will poll a larger vote <emph
                            rend="italic">in the district</emph> than any other man that can be
                        nominated. This is our claim in a few words, and we respectfully ask the
                        conference to give it a careful consideration when it meets. </p>

                <summary>With three Democrats competing to represent the district in the upcoming
                    Congressional election, the contest will be tight, says the editor. Of the
                    three, however, the Spirit endorses the candidacy of Chambersburg's own J.
                    McDowall Sharpe, whom, it asserts, "will poll a larger vote in the district"
                    than any of the other contenders.</summary>

                    and brave soldiers who did the fighting in defense of the Union" harbor no
                    feelings of vengeance toward their former enemies, states the article.
                    Unfortunately, it continues, the current state of crisis in the country will

                <summary>On August 2nd a fire broke out in the barn belonging to John G. Shelbie and
                    quickly spread to the adjoining stables owned by Messrs. Fisher, Monath, and
                    Scheller. It is believed that the blaze, which caused $2,000 worth of damage,
                    was set by arsonists.</summary>
