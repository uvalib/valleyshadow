                <transcript>
                    <p>The nomination of Abraham Lincoln for the Presidency, by the Chicago
                        Convention, is generally regarded as a breaking down of the Black Republican
                        party. Mr. Lincoln has no elements of popularity, and certainly no special
                        qualifications for the office. A year ago, says the Baltimore American, he
                        was unknown out of his own State, and all his recent reputation rests upon
                        his popularity as a stump orator in canvassing Illinois as the Republican
                        opponent to Mr. Douglas' return to the Senate, when he succeeded in carrying
                        the State by the popular vote, though Mr. Douglas secured a majority in the
                        Legislature. His record as a public man is brief and obscure. He was born in
                        Kentucky in 1809, received a limited education, adopted the profession of
                        law, was a Captain in the Black Hawk war, at one time Postmaster of a small
                        village, four times elected to the Illinois Legislature, and a
                        representative in Congress from Illinois for one term. from 1847 to 1849.
                        His private record is that of a third rate district politician, not, at one
                        time at least in his life very particular in his associations or correct in
                        his moral habits. The selection of such a man over the great exponents of
                        the Republican party, to the exclusion of Seward, Wade, Banks, Fessenden,
                        and others, whose nomination would at least have been entitled to respect,
                        is an insult as gratuitous as its accomplishment appears inexplicable. We
                        cannot see how any amount of party management can overcome the general
                        feeling of disgust which its announcement must create with the masses.</p>
                    <p>The nomination of Mr. Hamlin for the Vice Presidency, is much more
                        respectable. He is a native of Maine, born in 1809, a lawyer by profession,
                        and entered public life as a member of the Maine Legislature in 1836. He was
                        a member of the House of Representatives in the twenty-eighth and
                        twenty-ninth Congresses, and entered the United States Senate in 1848. He
                        was re-elected for six years in 1851. In 1857 his party in Maine, to avail
                        themselves of his personal popularity, ran him for Governor. He was elected,
                        but soon afterwards resigned the Governorship and was re-elected to the
                        Senate for the term ending 1863. He has not been particularly distinguished
                        in the Senate, but ranks among the most decided Republican members of that
                        body.</p>

                <summary>Author writes that four candidates were selected for Magistrate of the
                    Churchville precinct, but none will meet the satisfaction of the voters. The
                    author believes these men were selected to purposefully deprive Deerfield of a
                    magistrate altogether, and he thus proposes that William Guy run and be elected
                    by voters at Churchville.</summary>
