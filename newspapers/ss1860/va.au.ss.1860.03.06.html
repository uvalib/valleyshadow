<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>To the People of Virginia:</p>
     <p>This Convention, by original appointment, was to have assembled on the 14th day of December
      last, but it was deemed advisable, in consequence of subsequent events to postpone its
      meeting.--Those events were of a character so unexpected, and accompanied by developments so
      startling, as to make it, at one, the dictate of prudence and of patriotism to defer our
      action until further time should be given to discern the issue to which they conducted.</p>
     <p>Pursuant to the postponement, we met together at the Capitol of the State, on the 22d of
      February, and as the day itself is hallowed in the annals of our history, we would, ourselves,
      catch from it an inspiration of the moderation, wisdom and virtue of the patriot to whom it
      gave birth.</p>
     <p>At our appointment we were commissioned to deal with the party politics of the day, and on
      behalf of the Opposition of Virginia, to initiate measures looking to concerted action on the
      part of the Opposition of all the States in the approaching election of President.</p>
     <p>The public considerations involved in the attempt well justified the action, although the
      condition of affairs had been less auspicious of success. The Democratic party, for a long
      succession of terms, with slight exception, had controlled the Federal Government and ruled
      the policy of the country. The expenses of the government from about $---- under the second
      Adams, and $---- under Mr. Fillmore, had increased to $---- under Mr. Pierce, and were rapidly
      swelling to more than $100,000,000 under Mr. Buchanan. The principle that "to the victors
      belong the spoils," borrowed from degenerate days, but at one time indignantly repudiated by
      all parties, had for a long period of time, under successive Democratic administrations, been
      avowed as their rule of action, and the public offices, created for the public benefit, had
      been unblushingly bestowed as rewards on partizans, and tools, and minions of executive
      pleasure. The public press was pensioned, and the freedom of elections constrained by
      executive patronage. In the shape of federal contracts, political favorites fraudulently
      obtained the rewards of party service, and of party apostasy, and in every ramification of
      executive action, extravagances, corruptions and frauds marked the rule of the men in
      authority, until the public mind, habituated to these abuses, had become, in a great degree,
      to experience the same demoralization. Under its influence, patriotism has given place to
      partyism, considerations of the public weal having been abandoned by those that belong to
      party success, and our Presidential elections have degenerated into mere contests for place.</p>
     <p>Every recurrence of these is marked by some issue originating in the interests of a few, and
      continued for special effect. Whatsoever is calculated to excite the public mind, to inflame
      passion, to produce discord and engender sectional animosity is habitually seized upon by
      aspirants for place and industriously pressed forward by politicians and the presses in their
      interests.--No consideration of the public peace; no consideration of fraternal concord, of
      our Union, of its blessings; no consideration of the happiness and prosperity of the country;
      no consideration of the obligations, which as a nation, we owe to other nations, interposes
      restraint. In the lust for office, and in the greed for spoil all of these are trodden down,
      and the dearest interests of all are gambled with for the gain of a few. In the very nature of
      things it was not possible for the question of slavery to remain unappropriated, it was by far
      too inviting to the ends of party.</p>
     <p>Existing in a part only of the states, the institution of slavery is necessarily sectional,
      and claiming to extend itself into the unoccupied territory of the public domain, it was of
      itself calculated to excite sectional jealousy. This was first seen when the thirteen
      colonies, pressed by the progress of the revolution, settled the articles of confederation.
      When independence was achieved it was more strongly manifested in the convention that framed
      the Constitution. It again exhibited its influence when Missouri applied for admission into
      the sisterhood of States. But greatly as the public mind was excited on these occasions, and
      important as were the measures volved [sic], parties forebore to form upon it, and the
      patriotism of the country rose to equality with the exigencies of the day.</p>
     <p>After 1820, for a long series of years, the country reposed quietly in the settlements, and
      progressed, undisturbed by the baneful excitement. Certain societies of the Friends, contrived
      to forward to each Congress, memorials against slavery, but these disturbed no man's
      composure, and excited no complaint. A few fanatics in the Eastern States, combined into
      abolition Societies, sent also their petitions to Congress, but these were disposed of like
      those of the Quakers, and the currents of National and State politics, flowed smoothly on,
      without a ripple proceeding from that cause.</p>
     <p>In the progress of events, the abolitionists, increasing in numbers, associated themselves
      into party organization, and in the States, especially of Ohio, New York and Massachusetts,
      put forward candidates for political office. But, despised by both of the great parties into
      which the politics of the country had divided the people, they would assimilate with neither.
      In Massachusetts, for years, Marcus Morton, was their standing candidate for the office of
      Governor, and for a succession of Presidential terms, they voted in all the Sites, for Mr.
      Binny, as their candidate for the Presidency. Engrossed with the idea of general emancipation,
      they addressed themselves to measures, wholly without the jurisdiction of Federal authority,
      and they could find, therefore, no foundation on which to rear the super-structure of an
      enduring political organization, and unassisted by the extraneous influences, their
      idiosyncrasy was certain, in the end, to exhaust its energy. But, unfortunately, these
      influences were not withheld.</p>
     <p>The old Federal party, under whose auspices the government was inaugurated, and conducted
      through three successive administrative terms, found itself opposed by the Republican party,
      by which it suffered overthrow in the election of Mr. Jefferson. Proceeding upon the leading
      idea of opposition to executive influence, the victorions [sic] party successfully addressed
      itself to to [sic] the susceptibility of the public mind on the subject of the one man power,
      and so consolidated its strength, that under the administration of Mr. Monroe, it found itself
      without a rival. Everywhere in the Federal and State governments, the policy of the country
      was shaped by its influence. Lofty in its aspirations, high-toned in its principles, in the
      conduct of our Federal affairs, it addressed itself to the great tenets with enlightened and
      patriotic devotion. In our foreign relations it commanded the respect of other Powers; in our
      domestic affairs, while regard was had to the constitution and the rights of the States, it
      recognized the duty of protecting and advancing the great industrial interests of the country,
      and under its fostering measures commerce, manufactures and agriculture, made rapid progress
      in prosperity. No power not granted to the federal authority was assumed, and no power granted
      to it, when necessary to the general welfare, was abrogated.--But, in the progress of time,
      divisions arose, and parties formed for the advancement of political favorites. One division
      addressed itself to popular appliances, and assumed the name of "democracy," a name which soon
      was found strongly to distinguish its prominent features. By artful appeals to popular
      prejudice, by loud professions of love for the people, this division succeeded to power, and
      inaugurated an era in which the executive department stretched its powers to unheard of
      extents. Then was begun that fatal resort of purchasing support with the emoluments of office,
      and the proclamation went forth that "to the victors belong the spoils."</p>
     <p>The other division took the name of Whig; a name in British history significant of
      opposition to Kingly power, and in this country illustrated in our annals by patriotic
      devotion to the cause of liberty. True to the antecedents of the great Republican party,
      pursuing its high purposes, the Whigs cast themselves in opposition to Democratic excesses,
      and invoked the public judgement upon the disastrous tendencies of public affairs. Although
      the dominant party experienced some defections from its ranks, the iron rule of party held
      stern away; but in the hands of Mr. Van Buren the Sceptre was held by a feebler grasp. The
      misrule, the extravagances, the work, the corruptions of the administration, were more than
      the positions of the Democracy could withstand, and for a time the people were rallied to the
      rescue. In the North the great States of New York, Ohio and Massachusetts, and in the South
      the States of Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina were in the ranks of the Whigs, while in
      Georgia, Florida, Louisiana and Virginia, and some of the other States, the contest for the
      supremacy was sharp and doubtful.</p>
     <p>The great questions of Executive power, Congressional responsibility, economy, reform of
      abuses, of protection to the great interests of the country, were pressed at every point, and
      the opposing hosts reeled and staggered under their irresistible force. Condemned upon these
      issues by the public judgments, in their extremity they let fly a Parthian arrow at the
      pursuing hosts, and the envenomed point rankled in the bosom of the country. For the first
      time in our history, the question of slavery was introduced for party effect, and that
      dangerous element intruded into the conflict of parties. The Democrats of the Southern States
      set themselves up as the Exclusive guardians of the institution of slavery, while those of the
      Northern States were strenuous in the interests of freedom, and the Whigs found themselves in
      the anomalous condition of being assailed in one quarter as unsound on the question of
      slavery, and denounced in the other as untrue to liberty. Yet, both in the North and in the
      South there were in the ranks of the Whigs men as eminent for ability, as illustrious for
      integrity and patriotism as ever adorned the division of a party, and as thoroughly identified
      with the interests of their sections, as any that lived in them. The susceptibility of the
      Southern mind to the interests of slavery, enabled the Democrats to waken the Whigs in the
      slaveholding Sates, and finally to withdraw them from their influence, while in the North they
      combined with the Abolitionists, and succeeded to power in the States of Ohio, New York and
      Massachusetts. During these operations the victors had no difficulty in uniting for the common
      purpose. On whatever battle fields they fought, they were wings of the same army, fighting for
      the same spoils, and when met together in general convention, resolutions of equivocal import,
      designed to admit of opposite construction, were put forth, as the platform of the party on
      which either wing could securely stand in the region where it was to give battle.</p>
     <p>It was not the least remarkable feature of this strange anomaly that successes achieved at
      the North by abolition aid were heralded at the South as Democratic victories, until, at last
      the party became jubilant over the election of Marcus Morton to the chief executive office of
      the State of Massachusetts.</p>
     <p>The new element thus introduced into the conflict of parties, tended necessarily to
      sectional antagonism, and it was easy to see that, however well it served the exigency of the
      moment, it was likely in the end, to bring discord into the party on whose behalf it was
      invoked. As a political issue, it tended to mischief, to excite passions, to inflame
      prejudices, to secionalize parties and imperil slavery. But no considerations of
      statesmanship, no enlightened forecast of party-welfare, no regard for the peace of the
      country and the safety of its institutions, no respect for the integrity of the Union, nothing
      availed to restrain the Democracy from the desperate resort. Introduced upon the political
      arena, it soon engrossed the public mind, and the success that attended it in the Southern
      States, invited to similar use of it in the Northern States. Now, all other issues are laid
      aside, and opposing parties rely for success in the different sections upon their ability to
      excite and exasperate the minds of the masses by the laudation and abuse of slavery.</p>
     <p>The claim of legislative power to exclude slavery from the common territory was a fruitful
      source of agitation. In the ordinance of 1787, providing a government for the Northwestern
      territory, it was declared that involuntary servitude except for crime should be forever
      excluded therefrom. This ordinance was contemporaneous with the formation of the federal
      constitution. Being adopted by the Congress of the confederation, it was ratified by express
      provision of that instrument, and so the unfortunate policy was inaugurated at the birth of
      the Government. But for a long time nothing occurred to disturb the peaceful relations of the
      States.--Under Mr. Jefferson's administration, Louisiana was purchased from France and
      subsequently Florida was purchased from Spain, and in both territories slavery was recognized
      and established by law, and in the inhabited parts was actually existing at the time of the
      purchases. No effort was made by the federal authority to interfere with it, but when Missouri
      applied for admission it was proposed to impose upon her people the condition of excluding
      slavery from the new State. The struggle ended in a compromise by which the line of 36:30 was
      drawn through the remaining part of the Louisiana purchase, and the application of the
      prohibition of the ordinance of 1787 to the part north of that line. The country acquiesced in
      the settlement and the excitement subsided, but in the division of parties, the question of
      slavery was not permitted to enter.</p>
     <p>The States of Arkansas and Florida, in the course of events, were duly admitted, without
      question as to their system of labor. But, in 1850, another condition prevailed; the fathers
      of the Republic had passed off from the scene of their usefulness; the great republican party
      had given place to the fierce Democracy, and the agitation of slavery was the pabulum of its
      existence. Under their conduct of the government, sectionalism had erected its horrible head,
      and parties already threatened to divide by Mason and Dixon's line. When, therefore, Congress
      came to make disposition of the territory ceded by Mexico, it furnished no just ground of
      surprise that this vicious element should distract the repose of the country. But fortunately
      there were distinguished patriots of both parties then in the conduct of affairs. These great
      minds addressed themselves to the work of pacification, and a series of enactments, know as
      the Compromise measures of 1850, were placed on the statute book. By these the law for the
      rendition of fugitives from service was made more stringent; California was admitted as a
      State with a Constitution prohibiting slavery; a government was provided for the territory of
      New Mexico, without any provision on that subject; the line of the Missouri Compromise was
      extended through the Northern part of Texas; and the trade in slaves was prohibited in the
      District of Columbia. The purpose of these acts was to dispose, at once, of all the subjects
      touching which the question of slavery was likely to be agitated, and thenceforward to exclude
      that topic, as matter of legitimate discussion, from the halls of Congress. In this spirit Mr.
      Fillmore accepted them, and, in his message, declared them to be a final adjustment in
      substance and in principle of the questions to which they related. The State of Virginia, by
      her legislature, expressed her acquiescence; the country was content, and peace and concord
      seemed about to be restored to a divided brotherhood.--The Democratic Convention that
      nominated Mr. Pierce, adopted a resolution declaring the finality of the settlement, and made
      it a plank in their platform; the Whig Convention that nominated Gen. Scott did the same. In
      his inaugural address, Mr. Pierce re-affirmed the settlement, and both in that and in his
      first message, expressly pledged himself to the country that, by nothing that he would do, or
      countenance in the doing of others, should the distracting question of African slavery, during
      his term of office, be obtruded upon the deliberations of Congress.</p>
     <p>When Mr. Pierce entered upon the duties of his office, there had been no time since the
      first introduction of this mischievous element into party politics, at which the agitators, in
      both sections, were more powerless; their strength was paralized [sic], and parties were
      rallying to bring again to issue, the great questions from which they had so long been led
      astray. It was at this juncture, that the act of 1820, known as the Missouri Compromise, was
      repealed, and through the flood gates of Congress, the slavery discussion poured its torrents
      over the land. Of its disastrous effects, the whole country is witness. That it disrupted the
      Whig party; that it drove from the administration hosts of Democrats; that it gave rise to the
      modern republican organization; that it brought the two divisions of the country into angry
      opposition, upon a sectional issue; that it caused civil, and threatened servile war; that it
      relieved the agitators from their paralysis, and invigorated their strength; that it swelled
      the ranks of the disaffected, and imperiled the Union, are facts of present existing history,
      the evils and dangers of which, are yet to have their solution.</p>
     <p>Had the repeal been demanded by some great public exigency in the affairs of the country,
      the evils encountered in its accomplishment, might be compensated by the object it was
      successful in obtaining. But no exigency pressed its demand; no State Legislature, and no
      member of any; no primary assembly of the people; and as far as is known, no individual of the
      masses, sent up either petition or request. The scheme was concocted in the closet of the
      politician, and to serve the ends of political adventurers, sprung suddenly from the Senate
      chamber on the public. Had it been designed as a practical benefit to the institution of
      slavery, to enable the master to settle the new territories with his slaves, justification or
      excuse might be found for the act in the spirit of justice on which it proceeded. But we were
      told by the projectors and advocates of the repeal that the slave owners could not take
      possession of the lands, because both nature and climate dedicated it to freedom.</p>
     <p>But it is said that the act repealed was unconstitutional, and has been so declared to be by
      the Supreme Court. Then the repeal was unnecessary, as the act itself was a nullity. But the
      case in which the judgment was rendered was pending before the Court when the repealing act
      was introduced, and as the question of constitutionality was appropriately a judicial
      question, there was a fitness in leaving it to that arbitrament. It cannot be doubted that had
      the question been left to progress quietly through the judicial forum, the judgment would have
      been received as a final settlement, but dragged untimely into party politics, the vexation
      endures to work its mischief.</p>
     <p>The introduction of African slavery into party politics is the prolific cause of all our
      troubles. It has proved to this country what the wrath of Achilles was to Greece, "the direful
      spring of woes unnumbered."</p>
     <p>We trace this history for the double purpose of exposing the guilty authors and exhibiting
      the evil itself.</p>
     <p>The public mind has become, in a measure, disordered, and we must have the courage to look
      the disease in the face and submit to the remedy necessary for a cure.</p>
     <p>The remedy is to restore the question of slavery to the condition in which our fathers left
      it, to be discussed when occasions arise appropriate to the discussion, and to expel it
      forever from the creed of party. To deal with it properly, demands the best exertions of
      enlightened patriotism. Withdrawn by the very form of the constitution form the common power
      of all, it was expressly reserved to the States, separately, under the authority of whose law
      it is permitted to exist. Constituting a large and important interest in these States, it is
      entitled to the consideration of every State, and, within the just limits of constitutional
      power, to the protection of the common agent. Its religious, its social, its industrial
      tendencies belong not to others to determine, and are unfit and unprofitable for others to
      discuss. We are not now considering the formation of the confederacy; our Union is
      established, free States are associated with slave holding States, and what concerns us, is,
      how to discharge the duties that the compact of association imposes.</p>
     <p>Slavery is not now what it was at the commencement of our government. It has grown into
      proportions far exceeding the anticipations of our fathers. They looked forward to the day
      when it could be abolished with safety. But the times have changed since there were but a few
      hundred thousand slaves in the country, with comparatively small prices. The number has
      swelled to four millions, constituting the labor of one half the nation.</p>
     <p>It has an importance reaching to national proportions. It produces commodities that
      constitute the necessaries, comforts and luxuries of all nations. It is the main support of
      Northern commerce and manufactures, and of Northern wealth and progress. Southern society
      rests upon its base, and upon its security the world depends for the products of its labor in
      those larger quantities that the progress of civilization and the arts demand.</p>
     <p>But if slavery only concerned the South it would be entitled to be treated with liberal
      views and impartial and candid judgment; it is unfit for sectional and partisan intrigues and
      management. The prosperity and safety of the South concern the nation.</p>
     <p>The States under whose laws the system of free labor obtains, are secure, like their
      Southern sisters, from all federal interference as it is reserved to them alone to consider
      the religion, the social and industrial questions that spring from it. Whatever great
      interests these systems give rise to are equally entitled to the consideration of the other
      States, and within the prescribed limits, to the protection of the federal agent.</p>
     <p>If a diversity exists between the two systems of labor and different interests spring from
      them requiring special measures to accommodate the exigencies of each, it is the plain dictate
      of justice that the power of all shall be exerted in the behalf of each, it is only by
      measures and enactments founded in concession and compromise, that government can discharge
      its high duty.--We see nothing in our system incompatible with a cordial Union of the States,
      and the harmonious working of the federal government. It is replete with every element of
      national, social and individual prosperity and happiness, and if permitted, under Providence,
      to work out its destiny, it cannot fail to establish the United States in the foremost rank of
      the great nations of the earth.</p>
     <p>Between the two extremes of North and South we would gladly find a path of safety. The
      Constitution and the laws made by its founders have, in ample measure, promoted the happiness,
      prosperity and security of the whole country.--The South has flourished and grown to wealth
      and strength under them; can it be that the time has arrived to abandon this Constitution and
      repeal these laws? To a great extent, we think, the solution of this question remains with the
      people of the North. For the South we claim as the condition of our Union the principle of
      legal equality, and the principle that political power is a trust power, to be exercised for
      the good of the governed. We claim security for slavery as a domestic institution; we claim
      the right to extend it into any Territory of the public domain, now in possession or hereafter
      to be acquired, where the soil and climate invite it; we desire no further importations from
      Africa to degrade and barbarize and render valueless the slaves that are here. With these
      recognitions we are content with the Constitution, we are content with the Union, and content
      to live with the people of the North as the citizens of one government, and to share with them
      a common prosperity.</p>
     <p>But recent events have disclosed the existence, in the North, of opinions and passions
      dangerous to the peace of Southern society, and the South cannot shut its eyes to the fact;
      nor can it be insensible to the dangerous tendencies of the present Republican organization;
      an organization founded on the idea of an "irrepressible conflict" among brethren of the same
      country, teaching doctrines that had a disregard of the Constitution and laws, and incite to
      treasonable invasions of the States and sympathy for the traitors.</p>
     <p>If the great body of the Northern people are loyal to the country and to the South as a part
      of it, let the conservative classes prove their title to the appellation, and by their acts
      show themselves to be lovers of order and peace, of industry and its rewards, and of the
      security of property and all vested rights.</p>
     <p>The powers conferred upon the Federal Government are the common concessions of all the
      States, acting as Independent Sovereign, and are conceded for the common benefit. Delegated to
      special agents, they become sacred trusts, which are abused when perverted to uses
      inconsistent with the purposes of their concessions.</p>
     <p>A reference to the true Constitutional relations of the States, most clearly demonstrates
      how widely we depart from the spirit of the Constitution when we lend ourselves to those
      unhappy sectional combinations that mar the beauty and deform the symmetry of the system.</p>
     <p>To the angry passions kindled by the fierce contests between the Democrats and Republicans
      we attribute the bloody scenes in Kansas, and the wicked foray of John Brown, and to the same
      cause, in a great degree, we refer the persistent obstruction in some of the States to the
      rendition of fugitive slaves, and the impunity extended to the spoliators on the Southern
      slaveholders. With the removal of the causes exciting to them, we would fain hope that these
      just grounds of complaint will no long endure.--Certainly our sister States owe it to
      themselves to remove that reproach from their penal codes, wherein exemption from legal
      reprobation, encourages to wanton aggression upon the property of their neighbors.</p>
     <p>But, however earnestly we hope for these results, however strongly we think the general
      welfare demands them, however confidently we believe them to be within the reach of the
      people, we are forced to confess that we anticipate none of them from the success of either of
      the parties now struggling for power; with the Republicans, we would not feel that the Union
      will be safe, and with the Democracy, the baneful sectional strife would rage with fresh
      vigor.--The only safety is to be found in the success of a party inaugurated upon the basis of
      the Union, the Constitution, pledged to suppress the agitation of slavery, to expel it from
      Federal legislation, and to discard it absolutely as a political issue; pledge to respect the
      Constitution and to observe the rights of the States; pledged to administer the powers of
      government as sacred trusts, and guard them from abuse; pledged, within the just limits of the
      granted powers, to encourage and protect the great interests of the country without respect to
      the latitude in which they spring; pledged to restrain the encroachments of the executive
      power; pledged to economy and reform of abuses; pledged to purge the departments of those
      corruptions that deform and disgrace them; pledged to redeem the country from that base and
      corrupt practice that deals with the emoluments of office as the spoils of victory; and, in a
      word, pledged to administer the government in the spirit of the Constitution, and with a view
      to the preservation of the Union.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
     <p>The movement of patriotic and conservative men against the Black Republican and Democratic
      parties, both of which are alike sectional and tending to disunion, is gathering strength in
      all quarters, and is destined, we trust to become a power that will be felt in the land. We
      laid before our readers last week a tolerably full report of the proceedings of the Virginia
      Convention, held in Richmond on the 22nd ult., and publish on the first page of to-day's paper
      the able and patriotic address to the people, adopted by the Convention. This admirable paper
      is from the pen of Robert E. Scott, of Fauquier, one of the ablest of our public men, and sets
      forth the views and the principles of the Whigs of the State in clear and unmistakable
      terms.--The Convention adopted the suggestions of the National Whig and American Executive
      Committee, only so far as to send delegates to the proposed National Convention; setting
      forth, however, fully and distinctly their own principles and opinions to be read and known of
      all men with whom they might choose to co-operate, or who might desire to co-operate with
      them. One objection to the plan of the National Committees was the proposition to express a
      preference for two candidates for the Presidency, which suggestion it was considered
      inexpedient to adopt, as likely to lead to feuds and disaffection among the friends of
      particular gentlemen. It was, therefore, wisely concluded to leave the selection of candidates
      to the sound discretion of the National Convention, with the confident belief that the choice
      of that body will be such as to command the support, not only of the people represented in the
      Virginia Convention, but of the united opposition throughout the Union.</p>
     <p>Of our own Convention, we say with pride and pleasure, that it was a glorious re-union of
      men of the right stamp--men of patriotism and ability--who felt the importance and the
      magnitude of the work they had assembled to perform, and who addressed themselves to it with
      calm deliberation and the strictest decorum.--The work was well done--"decently and in
      order"--in such a manner as to command universal admiration and respect. The twelve hundred
      delegates in the body took counsel together in a fraternal spirit, for the good of the whole
      country.</p>
     <p>Conventions have also been held in New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, all
      breathing the same spirit of patriotism and devoted to the Union and the constitution. New
      Jersey, like Virginia, expressed no preference, of [illegible] to fight the battle under the
      lead of any sound national man. North Carolina prefers Graham first, and Washington Hunt, of
      New York, next. Tennessee goes for her own cherished son, John Bell; and Kentucky for the
      venerable statesman, John J. Crittenden. The resolutions adopted by the Conventions in all
      these States do not differ substantially in the principles which they enunciate; and all are
      distinct and emphatic in the expression of their attachment to the Union of the States and a
      just interpretation and strict fidelity to all the guarantees of the Constitution as the bond
      of a yet more perfect Union. With such objects, and under the lead of such men as the crisis
      has brought to the van, we may hope that the movement will meet with such favor in all
      quarters as will soon embody the conservative elements of the whole country into a solid and
      irresistible column of opposition to Republicanism and Democracy. So may it be!</p>
