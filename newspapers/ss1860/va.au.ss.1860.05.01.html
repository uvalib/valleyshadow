<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--Several years ago, a Mrs. Lemmon, of Virginia, went to New York with her
                        family, to take passage for Texas, where she proposed to settle. Her slaves
                        were liberated in New York city, on the ground that the local laws
                        prohibited slavery. This gave rise to a suit at law, which has recently been
                        decided by the New York Court of Appeals.--The opinion of the Court,
                        delivered by Judge Denio, holds that when Mrs. Lemmon carried her slaves to
                        New York she did not carry there the laws of Virginia. Her claim to hold
                        them rested on the ground that as a citizen of the . . . [illegible line] .
                        . . -stitution, to all the privileges that she had in Virginia. Judge D.
                        denies this, and affirms that the "privileges and immunities" to which a
                        Virginian is entitled in New York are not those of a citizen of Virginia,
                        but those of a citizen of New York. And the right to hold slaves, he says,
                        is not one of the privileges and immunities of citizens of New York. Three
                        of the Judges--Comstock, Seden and Clark--dissent from the judgement
                        pronounced in this case; and five--Denio, Davis, Wright, Bacon and
                        Welles--concur therein.</p>
