<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have read with deep interest a letter published in the Louisville Journal,
                        by Rev. Robert J. Breckenridge, addressed to his nephew, Vice President
                        Breckenridge. It is one of the most remarkable letters that the present
                        excitement has drawn out. His free criticism of the bad blunder made by the
                        South in the repeal of the Missouri Compromise would hardly be tolerated in
                        anyone else than a clergyman. So too his bold avowal that secession is a
                        revolutionary right--that the election of no man according to the forms of
                        the Constitution would justify any attempt to interfere with the stability
                        of the Union. So too his comment on parties--the absurdity of the South
                        claiming that slavery is carried into the Territories by the Constitution
                        are vividly presented. He maintains that the parties really having cause to
                        complain are the citizens of Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, that
                        the cotton States have no excuse for their disunion threats. He appeals to
                        Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, to rally to the Union, that these
                        central States, on either side of the supposed line of separation cannot and
                        will not tolerate a dissolution of the Union. Balt.
