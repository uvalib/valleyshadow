<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Tuesday night there was a discussion in the Court-house between Hon.
                        Shelton F. Leake and Mr. Gallagher of Baltimore, the former for Breckenridge
                        and the latter for Douglas. -- During this discussion and at its close,
                        there was a repetition of the scene enacted at Harrisonburg the day before.
                        Such a scene of noise and confusion, disorder and wrangling, cheering,
                        shouting and stamping, was never before witnessed in this place, and it is
                        hoped never will be again. After the discussion was over, a few of the
                        "harmonious" brotherhood manifested their sincere fraternal affection by
                        securing locks of hair from each other without
                        taking time to go to the barbers. The ran into the embrace of each other
                        with such impetuosity that fists and faces met in violent concussion. </p>
                    <p>It is generally conceded that Hon. Shelton F. Leake came off "second best" in
                        this discussion. His friends say that he "was not himself," but fail to say
                        who he was, if "not himself." We suppose that he had not recovered from the
                        "indisposition" with which he was afflicted in Harrisonburg.</p>
