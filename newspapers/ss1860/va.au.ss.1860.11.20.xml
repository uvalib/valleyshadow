                <summary>Argues that the secessionist impulses in Southern states has nothing to do
                    with fear of Lincoln. Lincoln has no power to carry through any policies without
                    the consent of Congress, which is controlled by Southerners. Rather,
                    secessionist sentiment is based simply on a long-standing opposition to the
                    Union and a desire to reopen the slave trade.</summary>

                <summary>Spectator argues that although Breckinridge was supported by disunionists,
                    it believes him to be a Union man. Now that the election is over, Breckinridge
                    should speak in favor of the Union. This would allow repentance for him
                    personally and would strike a strong blow against secessionists.</summary>

                <summary>Spectator notes that Lincoln did not receive a majority of the popular
                    vote, and that more Northerners voted against him than Southerners. By this
                    logic, the Spectator argues that secession would serve to cut the South off from
                    their "friends" in the North who voted against Lincoln.</summary>
