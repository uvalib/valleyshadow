                <transcript>
                    <p>The country now beholds the extraordinary spectacle of four great political
                        parties striving for ascendancy in the Presidential contest.--There is the
                        Republican, or Northern Sectional party, the Breckenridge, or Southern
                        Sectional party, the Douglas, or Squatter Sovereignty party, and the
                        Constitutional Union party. The policy of the first two named--whatever may
                        be the intention of their supporters--necessarily leads to disunion. Neither
                        of them has the order of nationality about it. They represent only the
                        extreme opinion of their representative sections, and the success of either
                        would be the triumph of one section over the other. The result would be to
                        strain to the utmost, if not to break, the cords, which bring the Union
                        together.</p>
                    <p>The Douglas party represents the small modicum of nationality which yet
                        belongs to the Democracy. In Virginia it has its strength in the Tenth
                        Legion and other districts most devoted to the Union, whilst in the
                        secession, fire-eating districts, it is powerless. Objectionable as this
                        party is, it is far more acceptable to the conservative sentiment of the
                        country than either of the sectional parties, because it does not threaten
                        the integrity of the Union.</p>
                    <p>The only purely national party now before the people is the Constitutional
                        Union party.--It presents itself under the auspices of a Convention composed
                        of distinguished men--men known to the whole country--and with candidates
                        entitled to the confidence of the whole country. Bell and Everett are
                        statesmen of mature experience, tried patriotism, and acknowledged ability.
                        Amidst all the excitement of sectional strife, neither of them has been led
                        into the expression or advocacy of extreme opinions or measures.--They have
                        been emphatically men of moderation. Prudence, a wise discretion, and a
                        catholic nationality, have characterized all their public conduct. The
                        crisis demands the services of men of their stamp. The country now has more
                        the need of the rein than the spur. The temper of the public mind is
                        explosive. We require men who, by wisdom and conciliation, will calm down
                        and smooth the popular excitement, and restore harmony and the spirit of
                        concord to the nation. The divisions in public sentiment are such as to
                        render it extremely doubtful whether there will be an election of the
                        President by the people. Judging from the past, the Republican party is
                        likely to have a plurality of the electoral vote, though in common with all
                        men of national sentiments, we most earnestly hope that it will not rise
                        into a majority. -- The danger, however, as matters now stand, is from that
                        quarter. It behooves all national Union- loving me, therefore, to consider
                        maturely, the best means of arresting such a dire calamity as the election
                        of a sectional Black Republican President. To this end, every arrangement
                        for co- operation should be made by other organisations, which can be
                        effected without an abandonment of fundamental principles.</p>
                    <p>Let us then proceed to consider what is the true policy of the conservative
                        men of the Union:</p>
                    <p>The Republican and the Breckenridge or Secession parties, being both, as
                        already stated, essentially sectional, and tending to the same
                        end--DISUNION--but by different means--it is manifest that neither of the
                        parties claiming to be national and Union-loving can unite or co- operate
                        with either of them. It would be like mingling oil and water. It would
                        involve an abandonment of the cardinal principles of their national
                        organizations. Between the SECTIONAL and the NATIONAL parties there is an
                        impassable gulf--as wide as that which separated Lazarus and Dives.</p>
                    <p>But between the Douglas and Bell parties, there if no such inseparable
                        barrier. True they differ--differ widely on many important questions; but
                        these are administrative questions, which are entirely subordinant to the
                        greater question of the permanency of the Union. In view of the strong bond
                        of sympathy between them, arising out of a common devotion to the Union,
                        these parties may well afford to adjourn all functional questions for future
                        adjudication, and address themselves earnestly, energetically, and
                        patriotically to the preservation of the organism of our political system.
                        There is no vital antagonism between them, and no good reason why they
                        should not act together in the extraordinary emergency that has arisen.</p>
                    <p>It must be obvious to every friend of Douglas that he cannot be elected
                        President by the Electoral Colleges. He has great strength in the
                        North-western States and in some of the Eastern and Middle States, but in
                        the South he is powerless. His most sanguine supporters, therefore, can
                        hardly suppose that he will carry a majority of the whole number of
                        electoral votes. The determined and relentless hostility of the Seceders,
                        headed by Breckenridge, aided by the Democratic Senators, and backed by
                        Buchanan and his horde of officials, precludes the possibility of his
                        obtaining a majority.</p>
                    <p>His only hope, then, is in defeating the election of Lincoln by the people,
                        and going before the House of Representatives as one of the three highest
                        candidates. Lincoln will certainly be one of those three. It is almost
                        equally sure that Bell will be another. The only question is, then, who
                        shall be the third? The contest lies between Douglas and Breckenridge--every
                        vote cast <emph rend="italic">for Breckenridge</emph> is substantially cast
                        against Douglas. It is a death grapple between them. One or the other must
                        go to the wall, and it is entirely within the power of the friends of
                        Douglas to decide who it shall be. We advise the friends of Douglas to have
                        a clear perception of this view of the case, and for that purpose we will
                        submit a practical illustration of it. Douglas certainly has no chance of
                        carrying Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
                        Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi, or Louisiana.--The
                        Seceders are stronger than he is in many of these States, and almost as
                        strong in others?--What then is his policy in regard to those States? If he
                        should be soft enough to go into convention with the Seceders, is it not
                        obvious that he would be in effect giving those States to his rival? This
                        would be the consummation of folly--it would be suicide! Douglas holds the
                        balance of power in most of those states. He can decide how they shall be
                        thrown in between Breckenridge and Bell, and his friends should have the
                        sagacity to see that every vote taken from Breckenridge adds to the relative
                        strength of Douglas. It is to be hoped that they will perceive this palpable
                        truth, and act accordingly. Douglas understands his game perfectly, and
                        hence we shall see that Forney, professing to speak by authority, scorns and
                        spits upon all chattering proposals of the Breckenridge men for a bargain.
                        He knows that the embrace of the Seceders is death to him. </p>
                    <p>But let us look at the question in another aspect. Suppose we are in error in
                        regard to the inherent and independent strength of the Bell ticket. Suppose
                        that Breckenridge has more strength than Bell, would this enure to the
                        benefit of Douglas? Certainly not. If he is to go before the House of
                        Representatives it is clearly to his interests that Breckenridge should not
                        be there to compete with him and divide the Democratic vote. It would be
                        much better for him to have Lincoln and Bell as his competitors, because as
                        against them he can unite the whole Democratic vote.</p>
                    <p>View the matter, then, as we may, it is clearly the policy of the friends of
                        Douglas to see that the votes of the Southern States are cast for Bell, and
                        to accomplish that object they should, if necessary, even vote for the Bell
                        ticket.--We lay it down as a self-evident proposition that every man who
                        desires to see Douglas have a fair chance in the House must use every effort
                        to squeeze Breckenridge out!</p>
                    <p>Patriotism, too, prompts the adoption of the same course which policy
                        dictates. Douglas himself, in his speech at Washington, denounced the
                        Secession nomination of Breckenridge at Baltimore as a disunion ticket.
                        Secession from party is a prelude to secession from the confederacy.
                        Believing this, it is the duty of every patriot to frown indignantly on
                        every measure that tends to alienate one part of the country from the other,
                        or to suggest even a suspicion that this Union can be dissolved. Believing
                        this, Douglas and his friends cannot, without a sacrifice of principle and
                        public duty, give their aid, either directly or indirectly, to the election
                        of the Yancey Rhett candidate.</p>
                    <p>Self respect demands that in those States where the contest is narrowed down
                        to Breckenridge and Bell, Douglas and his friends should favor the
                        latter--as everyone knows that the nomination of Breckenridge was made by
                        the enemies of Douglas, and with a view to his political destruction. The
                        "Little Giant" outstripped his Senatorial competitors in the race for
                        popular favor--and like the brethren of Joseph, they envied and hated him,
                        and "<emph rend="italic">could</emph> not speak peaceably unto him," because
                        they feared that their sheaves would have to bow down before his sheaf! When
                        they saw him afar off, even before the Charleston Convention, they conspired
                        against him to slay him. </p>
                    <p>"And they said one another behold this dreamer cometh.</p>
                    <p>Come now, therefore, and let us slay him and cast him into some pit, and we
                        will say "Squatter Sovereignty hath devoured him," and ye shall see what
                        shall become of his dreams (of the Presidency.)</p>
                    <p>And Ruben (Senator Pugh) heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and
                        said "let us not kill him."</p>
                    <p>And they took him and cast him into a pit (of senatorial resolutions) and the
                        pit was empty, there was no water in it (all were barren abstractions!)</p>
                    <p>But Douglas, like Joseph, escaped from the malice of the brethren, and like
                        Joseph, if he acts wisely, may live to reign over them, and to requite good
                        for evil!</p>
                    <p>Dropping our figurative language, it only remains for us to say that the
                        enemies of Douglas, failing to effect his ruin, but on the contrary being
                        soundly drubbed by him in the arena chosen by themselves for the conflict,
                        have resorted to the unmanly expedient of <emph rend="italic"
                        >secession!</emph>--Like tricky boys in a game of marbles, they went into
                        the game hoping to win, but as soon as they found that they were bound to
                        lose, they picked up their laws and ran. Neither Douglas nor his friends can
                        give countenance to any such faction. To sustain them or their candidate,
                        would be in effect to condemn Douglas and acknowledge that his brethren were
                        right. </p>
                    <p>Self respect--every just sentiment of pride and honor--the interest of
                        self-preservation, all concur to compel Douglas and his friends to repel
                        with indignation every overture for union and co-operation from that
                        quarter.</p>
                    <p>Finally, if there were no other considerations strong enough to refrain
                        Douglas from truckling to and bartering with the seceders, the conduct of
                        that paragon of Democracy, James Buchanan, would oblige him to reject their
                        propositions with contempt. The friends of Douglas have been, and are being,
                        hunted down with a relentless bitterness that has never before been
                        practiced even toward political enemies. To show that an office holder
                        entertains friendly sentiments towards Douglas is enough to draw down upon
                        him the wrath of the Administration, and to ensure his decapitation. How,
                        then, can Douglas and his friends give aid to the candidate of the
                        Administration. To do so would manifest not only a dastardly but a
                        traitorous spirit. Whatever faults Douglas may have, we believe that want of
                        fidelity to his friends cannot be counted among them.</p>
                    <p>We say, then, to friends of Douglas, make a gallant fight wherever you can.
                        Carry for him as many States as you can. But wherever, as in Virginia, for
                        example, you cannot carry the State <emph rend="italic">for</emph> Douglas,
                        take especial care that it shall not be cast <emph rend="italic"
                        >against</emph> him, by being given to Breckenridge. Use your power to
                        rebuke party treason and secession, and to frustrate the ignoble purpose of
                        Buchanan and his crew to trample you and your favorite under their feet! </p>
                    <p>Having thus given our views of the policy of the friends of Douglas, it only
                        remains for us to say a word or two as to the course which should be pursued
                        by the Constitutional Union party in the North.</p>
                    <p>Our primary objective is the defeat of the Sectional Republican candidate.
                        Every other consideration should be secondary to that. As practical men, we
                        should aim to achieve the greatest good to the country, and where that is
                        not attainable, we should aim at the second best thing. We should strive to
                        carry for Bell every State that we have a reasonable prospect of carrying;
                        but where that cannot be done, we should throw our weight in the scale of
                        Douglas as the most national and the least objectionable of the other
                        candidates. By this interchange of support between the friends of Douglas
                        and Bell, Lincoln can easily be defeated, and the election carried to the
                        House where the choice must fall on Bell or Douglas. Wherever we are the
                        strongest, as in the Southern States, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
                        Connecticut and New Jersey, the Douglas men should come to our aid. Whilst
                        in Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and

                        Douglas.</p>
                    <p>In regard to Pennsylvania, it may be doubtful which is the stronger, Bell or
                        Douglas. Such being the case, it would be fair to make a division of the
                        electoral ticket, and thus ensure the defeat of Lincoln.</p>
                    <p>It seems to us that the policy thus indicated, is the only one by which
                        Lincoln can be defeated. [remainder of article illegible]</p>

                <summary>Extremely lengthy editorial reflecting on the presidential election and
                    suggesting that the main goal of the Constitutional Union party is to defeat the
                    Republicans. If the Constitutional Unionists cannot win, then Douglas is the
                    next best candidate and most likely to avert diusunion. Spectator calls on
                    Douglas supporters to win as many states as they can, but if they cannot win a
                    state, to be sure not to give the state over to Breckinridge or Lincoln.</summary>

                <summary>Editorial critical of the secessionist Democrats for threatening to bring
                    about disunion. They claim to want only to defeat Lincoln, when in reality they
                    will only assist the Republicans and ruin their own party.</summary>

                <summary>John A. Harman asks the Spectator to allow him to clarify some remarks he
                    was reported to have made at the Democratic meeting a week ago. There were some
                    sentiments he uttered that could be interpreted as disunionist, but Harman
                    insists that those were made in the wake of the excitement from John Brown's
                    raid and that he (Harman) retracts them. He insists he is a Union man.</summary>
