<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Though the country is enveloped in gloom and darkness, and the minds of the
                        people oppressed with anxiety and dread, those who supported the Union
                        ticket have done nothing for which they can reproach themselves. They did
                        all they could to avert the dangers which at this time threaten the
                        Government with destruction. If they had succeeded in the election of their
                        ticket the country would now be at perfect peace with a bright and hopeful
                        prospect for continued happiness and prosperity. They predicted the evils
                        which would ensue in the event of their defeat, but the people turned a deaf
                        ear to their entreaties and expostulations. They are now, though in a great
                        minority, doing all they can to save the country. The train which contains
                        all the vast interests of this great country is now on a descending grade,
                        driven with an excess of steam, and it is time the conservative "brakes"
                        were put down with vigorous force, else there will soon be a general smash
                        up.</p>

<b>They Know Not What to Do</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial claiming that the people are looking to Congress to lead the
                    nation out of the peril in which the Union now stands, but it seems that there
                    is no one in that body who has any idea how to find a solution.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The members of Congress, like the people generally, seem to be at a perfect
                        loss to know what to do in the present perilous condition of the country.
                        They are like persons groping their way in a dark cave where not a ray of
                        light penetrates, and where there is constant danger that a misstep may
                        precipitate them over a fearful precipice. All is gloom, darkness, danger
                        and dread. They feel that it will not do to stand still, and yet they know
                        not in what direction to move, for fearful dangers environ them on every
                        side. The people look to Congress to lead the way out of this labyrinth of
                        dangers, but it seems that that body does not possess an Ariadne who can
                        furnish the clue by which that object can be attained.</p>
