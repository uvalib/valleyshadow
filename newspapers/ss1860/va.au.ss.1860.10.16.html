<b>The Late Slave Murder Case</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Story about a man from Mecklenburg County convicted of murdering one of his
                    female slaves, who died after he tied her to a tree and whipped her for three
                    hours.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the term of the Circuit Court of Mecklenburg county, Va., Charles Hudson
                        was tried for the murder of his slave woman Jane, convicted of murder in the
                        second degree, and sentenced to the Penitentiary for eighteen years.</p>
                    <p>The Tobacco Plant says very truly that it is one of those cases which
                        thoroughly vindicate the Southern character against the aspersions cast upon
                        us by our enemies at the North. It develops what is as true of us as of any
                        other people on the civilized globe, that we utterly detest and abhor
                        cruelty and barbarity, whether to whites or blacks.</p>
                    <p>The evidence in the case was that on the morning of the 4th of July last, at
                        8 o'clock, one of the hottest days of the past Summer, Hudson stripped the
                        woman, naked as she came into the world, tied her to a persimmon tree, and
                        whipped her for three consecutive hours, with occasional intermissions of a
                        few minutes, until he had worn out to stump fifty-two switches, and until
                        the bark of the body of the tree was rubbed smooth and greasy by the
                        attrition of the body of the victim. The ground around the tree for seven or
                        eight feet, though it had been freshly plowed, was trodden hard. One witness
                        testified that he heard distinctly, at the distance of six hundred yards,
                        both the noise of the switches and the screams and entreaties of the woman.
                        The poor creature was buried the same afternoon only some ten inches beneath
                        the ground, in a rough box, without any shroud. The overseer suggested that
                        the neighbors had better be sent for to see the body before burial, but
                        Hudson dissented.</p>
                    <p>The body was exhumed on Friday, two days afterwards, but was in such a state
                        of decomposition that the external marks of violence were well nigh
                        obliterated. But the testimony of the physician, who dissected the body, and
                        of several other physicians, who were examined as experts, was distinct and
                        positive that the violence used was sufficient to produce death. It was also
                        in evidence that, after the protracted punishment, Hudson untied the woman
                        and sent her to the creek, some one hundred and fifty yards distant, to wash
                        herself, accompanied by a negro boy, with instructions to bring her back to
                        him; that she complained of great thirst, and was seen to go down to the
                        water's edge; that she remained there about fifteen minutes; that on her
                        return she stopped two or three times, and complained of having a severe
                        colic; that finally she stopped and could proceed no further, when the negro
                        boy, at the command of his master, took hold of one hand and Hudson of the
                        other, and dragged her towards the tree.</p>
                    <p>The main argument of the defense was based upon the idea that the woman went
                        into the creek, remained there fifteen minutes, drank to great excess, and
                        that this, in all probability, brought on a congestion of the vitals and
                        produced death.</p>
                    <p>Such is an imperfect account of this horrible transaction. The jury hesitated
                        much between a conviction for murder in the first and murder in the second
                        degree. But finally they agreed and ascertained the term of imprisonment in
                        the Penitentiary at eighteen years--the longest term known to the law.
                        Hudson is now sixty-eight years old, and there is scarcely a probability
                        that he can survive his confinement. Indeed he is already exceedingly
                        prostrated.</p>
                    <p>On Monday morning, the last day of the Court, Judge Gholson pronounced
                        sentence upon him, as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Charles Hudson--You have been regularly tried for the murder of your own
                        slave. You have been defended with great ability, and a jury of your own
                        country have found you guilty of murder in the second degree, and fixed the
                        term of your confinement in the Penitentiary at eighteen years. In this
                        verdict this Court entirely concurs. I will not go into the details of the
                        shocking deed. You tied and stripped a female, who dared not raise her hand
                        against you--whose only protector in this world you should have been. For
                        three hours did you, in one of the hottest days of the summer, cruelly whip
                        and torture this helpless woman, until, in the language of counsel, 'the
                        angel of death delivered her from the hands of her tormentor.' You have thus
                        committed a great crime against both human and divine law. You have outraged
                        the feelings of the community among whom you lived. You have enabled their
                        enemies to fan the flame of fanaticism, by charging against them the
                        enormity and cruelty of your hard and unfeeling heart, although that
                        community cordially loathe and condemn cruelty and oppression towards black
                        or white.</p>
                    <p>"But, if your crime has been great, your punishment will be heavy. You are an
                        old man. In all human probability, before eighteen years have expired, you
                        will be dead. The remnant of your days are to be spent within prison walls.
                        The labors of the day will never be followed by the pleasures of home and
                        friends--but night after night, until the last night of your earthly
                        existence, will you be carried to your narrow cell, and hear, as the prison
                        house keeper departs, the harsh grating of the heavy key that keeps safe the
                        door of your dungeon. From man you have nothing to expect. Your doom is
                        fixed. A murderer, you are now a convict and prisoner for life, and your
                        sentence is just, nay merciful. Nor is there hope for you beyond the grave,
                        unless you truly and deeply repent.</p>
                    <p>"If you will sincerely repent yourself of this horrible deed and your other
                        sins--if you will bow your head to this deserved punishment, and pray
                        Almighty God to pardon your sins, and soften and regenerate your heart,
                        there is hope. Yes--if your repentance is sincere, it is certain that God
                        will pardon you--for rest assured that the same power which translated the
                        criminal from the Cross to Heaven, can and will save alive the penitent
                        convict. Desolate and dreary beyond description is your present
                        condition.--With a hard and unfeeling heart, human blood resting upon your
                        head, and your limbs fettered with a felon's chains, whenever weary and
                        tired you may ask: 'When shall I be free? this verdict of eighteen years
                        will answer--'Never'--'never.'</p>
                    <p>"Then I will, with deep humility and sincere repentance, feel and confess
                        your crime and sins, and that this sentence may prove the means of saving
                        your soul."</p>
