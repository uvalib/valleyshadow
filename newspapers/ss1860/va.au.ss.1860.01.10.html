<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"The New York Times endeavors to show that much of the apprehension felt
                    in the Southern States, in regard to the present aspects of the slavery
                    question, is without any real basis; and particularly in reference to the
                    attempts which have been made in my Northern States to render the laws of
                    Congress imperative, it asserts that the South will find no such array of
                    hostile legislation as they have been told exists." However, the Times fails to
                    mention the laws of Connecticut.<br>

                    <p>"Unless we are greatly mistaken, Vermont is the only State that has passes a
                        Personal Liberty Bill, or taken any legislative steps to defeat the
                        operations of the Fugitive Slave Law. In several others, attempts to pass
                        such acts have been made, but have been defeated. In Massachusetts such a
                        bill was vetoed by the Governor. In New York it was defeated in the Senate.
                        In Pennsylvania it was also stopped in its progress through the Legislature.
                        In New Hampshire it was voted down, and a similar fate has befallen similar
                        endeavors in other States. -- Yet to read the excited appeals of some of our
                        ultra Southern journals, one would suppose that nearly every Northern State
                        had enacted the most fearful penalties against every man who should seek to
                        recover a fugitive under the Federal Law of 1850. Resolutions may and
                        probably have been passed by several State Legislatures, expressing opinions
                        hostile to slavery and to the Fugitive Slave Law; but we need not remind our
                        Southern contemporaries that these resolves have no legal validity, and are
                        usually intended to have no effect beyond influencing some local election."</p>
                    <p>Connecticut is not mentioned above, as among the States whose Legislation has
                        been hostile to the South. She was the first to enact a Personal Liberty
                        Bill, in opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law, which it entirely
                    nullifies.</p>
