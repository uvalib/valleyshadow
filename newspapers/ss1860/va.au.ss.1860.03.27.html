<b>Utah Territory</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Report of the Mormon Wars in Utah.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Recent letters from Utah represent that there is a complete reign of blood in
                        that Territory.--United States soldiers are assassinated by the Mormons,
                        whenever they go out from the camp singly or in small parties. A letter
                        dated the 15th of February says if the army is withdrawn the Mormons will
                        exterminate every one in the Valley who does not yield to the behests of the
                        church. The writer continues:</p>
                    <p>"We sincerely hope that if they do remove the troops, Congress will take the
                        matter in hand and have them replaced with additional strength in Salt Lake
                        City, and when a murder is committed ferret it out and execute the offender.
                        The memory of the Mountain Meadow massacre is still fresh in our minds, of
                        whole families destroyed, of young girls violated and then murdered, and the
                        murderers walking the streets of Salt Lake City with the garments of their
                        victims upon their persons. These are facts that cry aloud her
                    vengeance."</p>
