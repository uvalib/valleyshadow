                    winning it.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The people of the North are begining [sic] to feel that the war, if not soon
                        closed with success on their part, will not be a "paying job." As soon as
                        this conviction shall become more general in that benighted part of the
                        world, they will begin to take steps for a cessation of active hostilities.
                        They have already expended more money in the prosecution of the war than all
                        the property of the South, exclusive of slaves, is worth. If they do not
                        succeed in the present campaign they will be forced, for the want of means,
                        in the classic language of Lincoln, to "guv it
                        up." </p>
                    <p>With the Richmond Examiner, we trust and believe that defeats are in store
                        for them even more signal than any they have ever yet suffered; but, be this
                        as it may, we have only to keep in good heart, make a stout resistance
                        wherever they present themselves, and hold on to the bitter end. Mere time
                        is a sword of destruction in our hands; every week they lose being
                        equivalent to a new victory on our side. We may have a dark and gloomy
                        winter, but if true to ourselves we cannot fail of success. The second six
                        hundred thousand troops will be destroyed more easily and more rapidly than
                        the first; and it is not probable that a third will ever be recruited. The
                        war may nominally linger for a long time to come; but we can virtually end
                        it within sixty days. No success of the enemy can bring them nearer their
                        object. Mere failure of success on their part must conclude the war.</p>

                    was necessary in order to "open our eyes to the monsters with whom we had been
                    associated."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>When the developments, now being made, of Yankee character, come to be duly
                        appreciated by the world, they will be held by impartial history, to be the
                        vilest race on the face of the earth. They are without the one redeeming
                        virtue of which the Roman Historian speaks. Possessed of all the views,
                        which distinguish the Chinese, they have the additional one of pretending to
                        virtues which they do not possess. Bigotted [sic] and intolerant, rapacious
                        and stingy, fraudulent and roguish, boastful and cowardly, ostentatious and
                        vulgar, envious and spiteful--they are an exaggerated embodiment of all the
                        vices of the Puritan and Blackleg. What particular cause, or combination of
                        causes, conspired to produce this odious population, it is not our purpose
                        now to inquire. But great as may be the calamity of war, we cannot resist
                        the conviction, that it is an inappreciable blessing, and will so continue,
                        until every Southern bosom is filled with detestation and loathing for this
                        abominable race. To hate vice is the first step to virtue; and it may be
                        that Providence, in its mysterious, but wise and beneficent ways, may have
                        chosen to subject us to the ordeal of a disastrous war, in order to infuse
                        into all our hearts a becoming abhorrence of these living representatives of
                        all the vices. Had we continued in political connexion with them, we, too,
                        in the lapse of time, must inevitably have fallen into the same deplorable
                        state of moral degradation. A quiet and peaceful separation--continuing
                        commercial and social relations--would not have been sufficient to save us.
                        The rupture must be attended with violence and bloodshed, and pillage and
                        devastation, to open our eyes to the monsters with whom we had been
                        associated.--The God of Heaven, who, in former times, employed Satan to do
                        his will, did not perhaps, deem Seward an unfit successor of the elder
                        Mephistophiles, and prompted him to draw the sword, that the separation
                        might be thorough and final, and ensure the cause of freedom and virtue
                        throughout the world.--Rich. Whig.</p>
