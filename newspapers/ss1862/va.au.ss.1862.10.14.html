<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--Allow me through this medium of your paper, to enquire what has
                        become of the Soldier's Aid Societies of our county? One year ago they were
                        doing good service by furnishing our soldiers with many essential and
                        indispensable articles of clothing, and no doubt made glad the hearts of us
                        brave men who were in the tented field, exposing their health and lives for
                        the sake of the dear ones at home, and for all that is dear to them and us,
                        our National Independence. Alas! I am pained to say that with many or all of
                        these societies, apathy and indifference seems to have taken the places of
                        effort and kind feelings, so prevalent twelve months ago. I appeal to my
                        countrymen and countrywomen, to arouse from the seeming lethargy they have
                        fallen into, revive and resucitate [sic] the various Soldier's Aid and
                        Relief Societies of the county, enter into the obligation due our brave men
                        without delay, shape them into garments suitable for the soldiers whose
                        necessities are crying aloud for relief. Is not the heart of every man and
                        woman moved who possess one spark of human kindness when they witness the
                        ragged and deplorable condition of many of our soldiers? It is a shame and
                        reproach to our Government to thus neglect [illegible] brave defenders.</p>
                    <p>A FARMER.</p>

<b>Lydia Maria Child on Amalgamation</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Excerpts a letter written for the New York Tribune by Lydia Maria Child
                    arguing that "amalgamation" between the races will not occur if a "natural
                    antipathy" exists between blacks and whites. Child points out, however, that
                    when the races have "been brought into vicinity" they have mixed freely,
                    generally because whites have desired it.<br>
