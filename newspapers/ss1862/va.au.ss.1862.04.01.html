<b>Soldiers on Furlough</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spectator reprints the order revoking all furloughs and leaves of
                    absence and encourages all soldiers to obey this order cheerfully.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We adopt the appeal of the Richmond Dispatch in reference to the annexed
                        order No. 16, of the Adjutant and Inspector General revoking all furloughs.
                        It revokes, on the spot, all leaves of absence, from whatsoever quarter
                        obtained; it orders all officers and men absent from duty except on
                        surgeon's certificate of disability, to return at once to their respective
                        commands.--The Department adopts this with reluctance; but we feel assured
                        that it will be cheerfully obeyed. The enemy is pressing us on all sides. We
                        want every man we can get. We cannot spare a man. Our soldiers, who have
                        manifested so much devotion, so much self denial, so much patriotism, will
                        bear this cross without a murmur. We appeal to them in the name of all that
                        they hold sacred--country, home, wives, children, friends, altars, and
                        firesides--hasten at once to the field. They will thereby add to the already
                        large debt of gratitude due them from their country. They will be admitted
                        and pointed at, as men who were, when the occasion called for it, ready to
                        sacrifice all to their country. Posterity will hold them in veneration, and
                        they will be regarded in history as worthy of all imitation.</p>
                    <p>Men of the South, will you be found wanting on such an occasion? Your former
                        history proves that you will not. Wherever your duty calls you, there will
                        you be. It may be hard to relinquish the pleasures of home sooner than you
                        expected, but your country calls you and you will not fail her. Her eyes are
                        upon you, and great as will be your reward if you succeed, greater will be
                        your misfortune if you fail. But why speak of failing? It is a word of which
                        you know not the meaning, when it is applied to your charge of duty.</p>
                    <p>To your posts, men of the South, to your posts!</p>
                    <p>WAR DEPARTMENT, Adj't. and Inspector General's Office. <br>Richmond, March
                        21, 1862, </p>
                    <p>General Orders, No. 16.</p>
                    <p>All leaves of absence and furloughs, from whatever source obtained, are
                        revoked; and officers and men absent from duty, except on surgeons'
                        certificate of disability, will return at once to their respective commands.
                        It was with extreme reluctance that the Department adopts a measure which
                        deprives our patriotic soldiers of the relaxation they have so well earned;
                        but the enemy presses on every side, and the necessities of the service
                        demands new illustrations of that noble self denial which has been so many
                        times evinced since the commencement of our struggle for independence. The
                        furloughs of all who have engaged for the war, which are thus curtailed,
                        will be extended hereafter, when circumstances permit. But, judging from the
                        past, no fears are entertained of an unwilling response to this call. Those
                        who have so many times proved their devotion to their country, cannot be
                        indifferent or backward in this hour of her greatest need. By order of the
                        President,</p>
                    <p>S. A. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General.</p>
