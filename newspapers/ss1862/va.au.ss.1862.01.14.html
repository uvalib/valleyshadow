<b>Western Virginia Defenseless</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that western Virginia is highly susceptible to invasion by the
                    North because of a lack of troops available to serve in this theater. It is
                    alleged that the citizens of the west are angry because their own volunteers
                    have been removed to other fields of action, thus leaving the area defenseless.<br>

<b>Statistics of Augusta County</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

                    which was a lower number than the previous year. There were 652 births and 306
                    deaths in the county in 1860.<br>(Names in announcement:  William A. Burnett)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The multiplicity and contrariety of rumors in reference to the operations of
                        Gen'l Thomas J. Jackson's forces are so great that we find it impossible to
                        give anything like a satisfactory account of them. From the Winchester Republican we learn that when our forces
                        were within a few miles of Bath, in Morgan county, on their onward march, a
                        skirmish ensued between our advance guard and the enemy's picket, in which
                        we lost one killed and five or six wounded. The loss of the enemy in killed
                        and wounded could not be definitely ascertained. Eight prisoners were,
                        however, captured. Brig. Gen Meem was then sent around with his militia to
                        prevent the Yankees, 1,400 strong, from retreating from Bath by a narrow
                        defile in the mountain, the only way of escape left them. Upon the closing
                        in of our lines; confident that the enemy was in our grasp, it was found
                        that the Yankee rascals were too smart for the militia, and had made good
                        their escape. Seven additional prisoners were, however, secured, with some
                        five hundred Overcoats and from 800 to 1,000 Rifles. The rail road bridge at
                        Capon River, just completed by the enemy, was also destroyed, with the loss
                        of several killed and wounded. The loss to the enemy other than the burning
                        of the bridge we could not learn. (Our entire loss so far is five killed and
                        fifteen wounded). This we believe to be the sum total of the damage done to
                        the enemy. </p>
                    <p>On Thursday week it appears that the Yankees, some three thousand strong,
                        left Romney and surprised the militia, 600 in number, under Col. Monroe, at
                        Hanging Rock, one mile from Col. Blue's, and 14 from Romney, the enemy
                        capturing two of our guns, and securing what has been regarded heretofore as
                        an impregnable position. We lost none in killed, wounded or prisoners. After
                        taking possession of this position, the enemy next visited the farm of
                        Colonel Blue, killing all of his stock and burning his barn and all of his
                        out buildings. Some report his dwelling as burnt also, but this lacks
                        confirmation. On their return toward Romney, old Mr. Reed, a worthy and
                        loyal citizen, was shot, fortunately not mortally, and then locked in his
                        house, which was fired and burned to the ground over his head. Some two
                        thousand of these desperadoes still hold possession of Hanging Rock, whilst
                        Romney is occupied by about 6,000. Whether they will be suffered to winter
                        there time will tell.</p>
                    <p>From the Rockingham Register we learn that two of
                        the sons of Rockingham were killed--John Berry (son of John K. Berry near
                        Edom) and Jacob Nisewander, son of Samuel Nisewander near Antioch. They were
                        members of Capt. Arch. Taylor's company of militia. </p>
                    <p>From a correspondent of the Lynchburg Republican, we learn that on the
                        evening of the 4th inst., Colonel Rusk, of Arkansas, proceeded up the road
                        to the west of Bath, to burn the Capon bridge, in command of a brigade
                        consisting of four regiments and a battery. When near the bridge he saw the
                        camp fires of the enemy, and advanced to attack them. It seems that the
                        enemy were aware of his approach, and had taken position some distance to
                        the rear, so as to ambuscade his command. Before the Col. was aware of the
                        position of the enemy he was fired into. Finding himself thus ambuscaded,
                        Col. Rusk halloed with all his voice as if to forces yet in his rear--"bring
                        up the 16th and 18th Mississippi regiments, the 6th Texas brigade, and hurry
                        up that battery." This command to ideal forces had the proper effect, and
                        immediately the enemy broke and ran like sheep. Rusk, however, from the
                        first attack lost four men killed and eighteen wounded.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The efficient representative of this country in the Senate of
                        Virginia--Bolivar Christian, Esq--offered the following resolution looking
                        to the defence of Western Virginia, which has recently been rendered
                        defenceless by the withdrawl of troops from that section of the State:</p>
                    <p>Resolved by the General Assembly, that a joint
                        committee of five members of the Senate, and seven of the House of Delegates
                        be appointed to confer with the Confederate authorities, and devise
                        co-operative movements on the part of the State with the Confederate
                        Government for prompt protection to the persons and property of citizens,
                        and the general defence [sic] in Western Virginia against the invasion of
                        the enemy. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Christian, in explanation of the motives for offering this resolution,
                        said it was, of course, in no spirit of criticism on the conduct of the war
                        by the Confederate authorities, but in view of emergent acts. It is well
                        known that the bogus Government at Wheeling publicly proclaims its intention
                        to extend its jurisdiction over all Trans-Alleghany, at least; and also that
                        authentic information has just reached us that the Lincoln troops have
                        advanced in force and taken possession of the county seat of Pocahontas,
                        hitherto the headquarters of our armies; that they have invaded Greenbrier,
                        Monroe, Mercer and other counties, whence we drew the supplies of beef for
                        our armies; that they are pillaging the property and harassing the faithful
                        citizens of that country. Meanwhile the Confederate forces, doubtless for
                        proper reasons, have been withdrawn, even the forces organized in that same
                        country for its defence constituting nearly all its fighting material, and
                        transferred to the distant fields of Kentucky and South Carolina. It is
                        farther understood that Gov. Letcher has already tendered the services of
                        the militia brigade under Gen. Chapman for home defence, but the General
                        Government has declined accepting it; hence the executive having exhausted
                        his resources, it becomes proper that the Legislature should provide other,
                        or some relief for this distressed portion of our Commonwealth.--The
                        reorganization of the militia being now under consideration, it is
                        peculiarly proper to consider all the circumstances.</p>
                    <p>This resolution was adopted in both houses of the Legislature. The committee
                        on the part of the Senate is as follows:</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Christian of Augusta, Neeson, Douglas, Thomas of Fairfax and Win.
                        Frazier of Rockbridge.</p>
                    <p>The following compose the committee on the part of the House of Delegates:</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Hunter, H.W. Sheffey, Garrison, Anderson of Botetourt, Wilson, Mason
                        Matthews of Greenbrier, and Crockett.</p>
