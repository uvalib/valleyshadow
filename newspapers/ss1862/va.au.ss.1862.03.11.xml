                    <p>The Richmond Dispatch says that there never has been an hour from the
                        beginning of this contest when a determination as profound has animated the
                        souls of the Southern people. They can die, and they can die with dignity
                        and glory, but they will never live to be slaves. In this sublime resolution
                        they have rendered their subjugation an impossibility. Such a people cannot
                        be conquered. The Yankee shall not take our country from us, our homes, our
                        liberty, our farms, our wives and children, our honor. They shall not make
                        us slaves, and above all, slaves to the meanest, the most rapacious, and
                        most cruel of mankind.</p>

                    <p>Monterey, Va. <lb/>March 3rd, 1862. </p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Mr. Editor:</emph> The time is past, in my humble
                        opinion, when our army of recruits should have entered the field. Why should
                        we, or how <emph rend="italic">can</emph> we lie at home listless and
                        inactive, when multiplied vandal hordes are approaching and menacing our
                        homes and firesides? Our army is still diminishing daily by furloughs and
                        going home, and on the contrary the Federal army is filling up to
                        overwhelming numbers, and <emph rend="italic">our army still at home</emph>!
                        Why this delay? The old adage, "delay is dangerous," is no longer applicable
                        to us. Delay to us is actual destruction. We have men enough, if we just had
                        them out <emph rend="italic">now</emph>. <emph rend="italic">Now</emph> is
                        the time we should rally. We know we must fight, and we must fight <emph
                            rend="italic">now</emph> or forever hold our peace. I have confidence in
                        our government, and our officers, civil and military, but I must think them
                        too slow. Our present volunteers are going to re-enlist, and many, very many
                        of them have, but they look for and expect help from home, and think they
                        should come out to assist in the good work. We would like to see Gen'l
                        Edward Johnson on Alleghany strongly reinforced, and that position held
                        against all opposition. The enemy has been reinforced on Cheat; reliable
                        informants say, with 15,000 men. And we should by all means hold them in
                        check and allow them to come no further. We expect to gain our independence,
                        and to do it, not by folding our arms in ease, but by fighting, and if needs
                        be, by sacrificing our lives on the altar of our country. Our recent
                        reverses should not discourage us, and will not discourage the truly brave,
                        but nerve them to still more desperate efforts. </p>
                    <p>The darkest gloom of the old revolution of '76 was in the campaign
                        immediately preceding the dawn of victory and success, when the shackles of
                        tyranny were burst asunder.</p>
                    <p>The darkest hours of the church have always been just before the dawn of a
                        glorious revival of religion. And the deepest and darkest gloom of the soul
                        is the immediate precursor of its transition from the wrath of God to his
                        mercy.</p>
                    <p>We have another ravaging and ruthless foe to oppose, and that is liquor. When
                        will the proper authorities stop the tremendous consumption of grain in the
                        distilleries, and thereby save the grain, and instill new life into our
                        army? Since I have been in the service I have seen youths as it were fresh
                        from the endearing circles of home, and warm from their mother's bosom,
                        staggering and reeling and swearing, under the influence of poisoned drugs.
                        None need argue the necessity of its use, or allege its medical virtues, for
                        I am happy to say there are some who totally abstain from the demon, and who
                        are living witness of its uselessness and evil.</p>

                    <p>MR. EDITOR: I have understood that great dissatisfaction exists among those
                        who are liable to be drafted on account of the speculators. I am free to
                        admit that there is too much truth in it. In times like the present, all
                        inordinate desires to amass a fortune should be abandoned until we obtain
                        our independence. We are all deeply interested in this struggle in which we
                        are now engaged; and it requires the united efforts of both rich and poor,
                        for what effects one effects the other. Our forefathers made great
                        sacrifices and endured great hardships, and by perseverance established
                        their independence. Has the spirit which animated them ceased to beat in the
                        bosoms of the present generation? I hope not, but with one accord I wish to
                        see a bold and united front to the vile invaders who have trampled under
                        foot and set aside the sanctity of an oath, in order to reap their hellish
                        vengeance against us by confiscation, and if need be necessary,
                        extermination. What would wealth avail us under such circumstances? We might
                        this day have been a prosperous people if it had not been for that paramount
                        desire to horde wealth, and in order to obtain it, corruption has entered
                        into the very vitals of our Government, and now the dreadful consequences
                        are upon us. We must resist the invasion, at all hazards, that has been made
                        against us, and humbly trust in that God who led our forefathers to liberty
                        and established for us the best government the world ever beheld, and which
                        has now been perverted in order to enslave us. I hope all selfish motives
                        will be laid aside, and wish to see such a spirit aroused as will crush the
                        tyrant who now disgraces the chair which Washington once occupied. To the
                        rescue then, one and all, and set your country free.</p>

                    <p>The Northern serpent who has penetrated the Southern Eden, attempts his
                        natural arts. At Hatteras, and Nashville, and Roanoke Island he shows his
                        brightest hues and assumes his quietest and most innocent airs. He proposes
                        to harm no one--to disturb nobody's private rights--and only to restore
                        quiet and security to the land. Were we simple and irrational, we might
                        naturally fall a prey to his natural arts. But can he decoy Southern people
                        by such duplicity, such charming? Are they to forget the burning houses, the
                        confiscated property, the stolen and liberated servants of Southern people?
                        Will they forget the cruelties practised upon our loyal and true citizens,
                        the brutal treatment of women and children by the ruthless invader? Is <emph
                            rend="italic">Southern blood</emph>, shed in their defence, to be
                        forgotten, and sink into the ground unavenged? Nay, can they forget the
                        cause of the separation of the South from the North--or even think of the
                        possibility of reconstruction? </p>
                    <p>To listen to the enemy, to <emph rend="italic">think, even, of forgetting
                            these things</emph>, would be [illegible]. Once in his power, we would
                        indeed be <emph rend="italic">crushed out</emph>. Our property would be
                        confiscated and passed over to the possession of our conquerors--our sacred
                        boundaries would be blotted from the map, and our States be no more known to
                        the world--ruined, down-trodden, disgraced forever in the eyes of the world,
                        so that our children would fain disown their parents, the very sight of our
                        poor country would be intolerable to us, and those of us who were able would
                        wander away from the land of our birth to find what relief we might in
                        stranger climes. Those that remained would welcome death as a friend to
                        close their eyes and their memories upon events and scenes fraught only with
                        dishonor and misery for them! </p>
                    <p>This is what the northern serpent would do! Can he? Shall he? The response of
                        a free people, who deserve to be free, will be given before this war is
                        over. And all the falsehoods and all the charming arts of the most artful
                        and unscrupulous of foes that ever waged a war, will be dissolved like the
                        "baseless fabric of a vision."--<emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph>. </p>
