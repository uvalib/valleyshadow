                    <p>The county Courts ought to appoint patrols of some guards in every
                        neighborhood. Neighbors ought to organize themselves and be ready to render
                        such assistance as exigencies may require. All that is wanted besides is a
                        little vigilance, but vigilance and organization are not to be dispensed
                        with in such times as the present. We trust these intimations will be
                        received as a word to the wise.</p>
                    <p>There are other subjects that deserve much attention at this time. The enemy
                        are changing their system of war. The plundering that was occasional and
                        sporadic before, depending somewhat on the character of the commander, is
                        probably to become universal. The country through which they may pass is to
                        be despoiled. The citizens are to be indiscriminately robbed in the latest
                        despatches which have come to us through the enemy's papers, touching the
                        operations of McClellan's army, we find the following:</p>
                    <p>"General Pleasanton is now seizing all horses to be found for the use of the
                        Government, without reference to the opinions of the owners."</p>
                    <p>Now, so far as possible, we ought to leave nothing for the enemy to commit
                        robbery upon. At all events anything that has legs, like a horse or a beef,
                        should be driven away before he comes.</p>
                    <p>The negroes whom he has heretofore seduced, he will probably hereafter
                        constrain. They should be kept out of his way as far as possible in the
                        districts which have been ravaged by the war, these removals will be
                        difficult for the owners to effect for want of transportation and other
                        facilities. We entreat therefore, our Generals in command in the various
                        localities, and those who have the direction and management of affairs to
                        make it a prominent idea in their plans subordinate only to the exigencies
                        of important military operations to afford every possible facility and
                        protection to the citizens in removing their property out of the enemy's
                        grasp. We know that it is the policy of the Commissary Department to draw
                        its supplies from the exposed localities first; and that arrangements have
                        been made to effect this. We entreat all connected with the transportation
                        service whether in a civil or military capacity, to bend their energies to
                        the promoting of the same end. It is a high duty of patriotism, because it
                        is an important patriotic service. We shall thus save our citizen from
                        plunder, deprive the enemy of this source of supply, and secure to ourselves
                        the benefit of all our resources.</p>
                    <p>Let the citizens themselves be active in effecting the removals we have
                        mentioned. Government should do all it can, but cannot do all it may wish.
                        Take command of your own ingenuity and energy, and act without unnecessary
                            delay.--<emph rend="italic">Richmond Enquirer.</emph></p>

                <summary>Warns that plundering may soon become standard practice among Northern
                    troops in the war. Advises that Southerners in the areas where the enemy is to
                    pass should "leave nothing for the enemy to commit robbery upon." Implores
                    generals to protect the property of the South and civilians to do their part in
                    keeping that property from falling into enemy hands.</summary>

                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt>"Our duty is . . . to make it the burden of our prayers, and the business
                    of our lives, never doubting that success, final and glorious success, will be
                    awarded us when it seems well to the Great Ruler of Nations."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The Richmond Whig maintains that the North will continue the war as long as
                        it is possible for them to do so, for the reason that upon its termination,
                        without the accomplishment of the end for which it was waged, the North
                        would be utterly ruined--the mob would be the only Government, and confusion
                        and anarchy would reign supreme. The "Whig" concludes its article as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>It is to avoid such scenes as we have pictured and such a doom as we have
                        traced, that the Northern people will continue the war as long as
                        possible.--They may realize many of its horrors, but they must feel that for
                        them the peace that would result from defeat would be more horrible still.
                        They have the wolf by the ears and dare not let him go.</p>
                    <p>Is there, then, to be no end to the war? Yes. War cannot last always; and
                        where neither party has the power to subjugate the other, it requires only
                        the constancy that becomes a good cause and a brave race to wear out the
                        party in the wrong. Financial prostration or physical exhaustion will end
                        the struggle in due time. And this, if no accidental cause should bring it
                        to a speedier termination. Of such accidental, or, we might better say,
                        incidental cause, there is a chance in the possible withdrawal of the
                        Northwestern States after a while. They do not profit by the war as do the
                        New England States.--They are not urged on by the demon of fanaticism as are
                        the New England States. They have nothing to fear from the return home of
                        their soldiers, as have the New England States. Reason and interest may,
                        therefore, lead them to dissolve the unholy and unnatural alliance, and
                        withdraw from the bloody and bootless crusade. This would give us peace. The
                        intervention of the Great Powers of Europe is another circumstance to which
                        we may look with reasonable hope. Some time or other, if the war continues,
                        it will come. It may not be as soon as we desire. It may be long deferred.
                        But we have faith--the faith of just deduction from immovable facts--that it
                        will come. And when it comes, it will be potential, all the more for the
                        delay.</p>
                    <p>From all points of view, our duty is clear. It is to bear resolutely up
                        against all trial; to husband all our resources; to bring every energy to
                        bear; to give all that we have, if needed, and all that we are, to the
                        cause; to make it the burden of our prayers, and the business of our lives,
                        never doubting that success, final and glorious success, will be awarded as
                        when it seems well to the Great Ruler of Nations.</p>
