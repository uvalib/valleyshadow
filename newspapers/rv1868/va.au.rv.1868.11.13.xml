                <transcript>
                    <p>In our last we gave the latest telegrams of the result of the Presidential
                        election. In this issue we have but to reiterate the statements of those
                        telegrams as corroborated, generally, by the official returns, which, as far
                        as received, indicate that Grant and Colfax have been elected by a very
                        large majority of the electoral vote. After the first reports their election
                        was generally conceded, so singularly did the vote in many of the Northern
                        and Western States vary from the result in their late elections. The vote in
                        the Southern States surprised the Republicans as much, perhaps, as did the
                        result in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and other States astonish
                        the Democracy. One thing must be patent to them that the negro vote can't be
                        relied upon. This may serve to open their eyes to the enormities they have
                        committed to secure a continued lease of power through the colored vote.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy, though beaten, have accomplished much. They have reduced the
                        Republican majorities of 1864 very considerably in nearly every State, and
                        have gained about 15 Representative in Congress, enough at least <emph
                            rend="italic">to prevent the impeachment of Grant</emph> by the
                        Republicans, which, should they continue their reckless legislation, they
                        are likely to attempt before the expiration of his term.</p>
                    <p>What President Grant will do is the question on all sides and promptly
                        answered by many. As he has indicated no policy but has been perfectly mum
                        on all subjects, it appears to us a mere matter of guess-work. There is
                        however one fact evident. The excitement of the contest over, the Republican
                        journals are less violent and far more conservative than we anticipated.
                        This would seem to indicate the dissatisfaction of the Republican party with
                        the continued disturbed condition of the country. Then, as Gen. Grant's only
                        policy seems to be the <emph rend="italic">"will of the people,"</emph> it
                        may very fairly be assumed that his administration will have a conservative
                        tendency, and, as the Republicans still control both Houses of Congress, the
                        clashing between them and the executive, which tended to increase the
                        asperities of legislation, is likely to cease and more conservatism be
                        exhibited there also. Since we could not get a Democratic President and a
                        Democratic Congress we must of necessity be content with the election of
                        Gen. Grant and await his acts to censure or to praise.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, as the occasion for political assemblies among the people
                        dies away with the presidential election and labor is likely to be more
                        steady and reliable in the South, it becomes one and all to work with a will
                        for the restoration of that pecuniary prosperity which once characterized
                        our beloved Southland. We hear from Republican sources on all sides, that
                        since the election of Gen. Grant, money and immigration will rapidly flow
                        southward, but we warn all against too great reliance on this. If the influx
                        of sturdy immigrants and northern funds come, well and good, but our own
                        endeavors must be the touch-stone of our future.--Let the policy of the
                        incoming administration be what it may, the advancement and prosperity of
                        the South is certain if our own shoulders be put to the wheel.</p>

                    <p>The Washington <emph rend="italic">Express</emph> thus speaks of the election
                        of Grant:</p>
                    <p>We have been beaten in this fight, but by what number of votes we cannot tell
                        at this writing: nor can we say by what amount of intrigue, corruption and
                        fraud. It is enough that we are beaten. <emph rend="italic">What is our
                            solemn duty in this?</emph></p>
                    <p>There can be but one answer. Our highest, noblest, most patriotic--<emph
                            rend="italic">our imperative duty is to stand by our
                        organization</emph>--to rally at once under our banners, on which is
                        inscribed our principles and <emph rend="italic">stick to them at all
                            hazards!</emph> Our duty to ourselves, our party, and our country
                        demands this course. There should be no faltering, but manfully, and at
                        once, we should begin again to prepare for future efforts that will yet
                        rescue the country from the hands of the destroyers who for eight years past
                        have been daily undermining its influence, its power and its greatness. The
                        splendid vote cast for our candidates shows clearly how narrowly our enemies
                        have escaped defeat, and how cautious, they must be in all their actions
                        hereafter if they would avoid being crushed at the first opportunity by the
                        awful majesty of an outraged people whom they have again seduced into
                        trusting them with power.</p>
                    <p>That vote is a warning to them, as it is an incitement to us to perpetuate
                        the organization. Deny it who will, <emph rend="italic">the democratic party
                            is the majority party of the country</emph>, and sooner or later it must
                        wield its destinies. That high duty is denied us now, but the people will
                        yet see their mistake, and with "the sober second thought" will come the
                        reaction that will crush the radical organization, which has already brought
                        so much of rain upon the country. <emph rend="italic">Courage, then,
                            comrades! Close ranks! Keep organization! Stick to our colors! Hold on

                    <p>We think there is much force in the conclusions of the New York <emph
                            rend="italic">Herald</emph> concerning the interpretation of the late
                        election. It says:</p>
                    <p>"At the first glance the popular majorities of General Grant in most of the
                        Northern States are somewhat astounding, but they admit of an easy
                        interpretation. The republicans for their candidate had the most popular man
                        in the United States. The democratic ticket and platform were, from their
                        rebel affiliations, not only weak but extremely obnoxious to the great Union
                        party of the war. The October elections, though comparatively close, in
                        settling the main question demoralized the democracy outside of New York and
                        relaxed their efforts for November, while this foreshadowing of Grant's
                        election brought over to the republicans a considerable body of floaters."</p>
                    <p>Again the <emph rend="italic">Herald</emph> remarks:</p>
                    <p>"Gen. Grant's popularity as the great victorious Union champion of the war
                        has saved the party in power for another Presidential term. In the election
                        of 1867 the popular tide had turned against the ruling radicals, and nothing
                        but the name of Grant and a campaign upon the issues of the war could have
                        saved them from a crushing defeat in 1868. The election of Grant and Colfax,
                        then, does not involve an endorsement by the people of the extreme measures
                        and programme of the ruling radicals of the present Congress; but it does
                        involve a verdict from the people in favor of a more conservative and
                        conciliatory policy. General Grant was not the choice (except as Hobson's
                        choice) of the ultra-radical faction. They fought him off as long as
                        possible, and at last they adopted him only from sheer necessity. The people
                        have elected him in view of a new departure; they look to him for a new
                        policy, and it is not only his right but his duty to take his position
                        accordingly in his inaugural address and in the selection of his Cabinet,
                        and broadly and definitely in his first message to Congress.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>On Wednesday night last a meeting was held in the Court House to discuss the
                        question of the subscription by the town of Staunton of $100,000 to the
                        stock of the Valley Railroad.</p>
                    <p>As we were unable to be present we take the following proceedings of the
                        meeting from our neighbor of the <emph rend="italic">Spectator</emph>:</p>
                    <p>On motion of Col. B. Christian, Mayor N.K. Trout was called to the chair, and
                        Jno. B. Evans, Esq., appointed Secretary.</p>
                    <p>The meeting was then addressed by Col. M.G. Harman, the President of the
                        Valley R.R. Company. He earnestly urged the propriety of the subscription
                        and gave the assurance that the road would be put under contract within a
                        few months after the sum of $1,000,000 should be subscribed by the counties
                        and towns along the line of the proposed road, and expressed the belief that
                        that amount would be subscribed.</p>
                    <p>Judge H.W. Sheffey followed Col. Harman with a speech characterized by sound,
                        practical views. He said that there would be, in a short time, a tendency to
                        immigration into the South, and particularly into this fertile Valley.</p>
                    <p>There are times, said he, when people were called upon to decide, and that
                        promptly whether they would be great and successful, or stand back and be
                        beggars. The present is such a time with the people of Staunton. This is not
                        the time to be alarmed at taxes.</p>
                    <p>Years ago, the old fogies of Staunton were startled when it was proposed to
                        establish the water works. They feared the taxes could not be paid and that
                        the town would be rendered bankrupt. Now Staunton has eight miles of water
                        pipe, and it has increased greatly both the value of property and the
                        population of the town.</p>
                    <p>He said there were two things which the citizens of this county were wont to
                        do successfully: 1st. To choose the best men to represent them in the
                        Legislative Halls.--2nd. To do boldly what they were called upon to do. This
                        was a time for the citizens of Staunton to act boldly, if they wished to win
                        the distinction of being the city of the Valley.</p>
                    <p>One thing is certain, and that is, that the Valley R.R. will tap the
                        Covington &amp; Ohio R.R. and it will depend upon the action of the
                        citizens of Staunton whether it will thus tap that great line of trade and
                        travel at this place or not. If Staunton shall subscribe the proposed amount
                        it will be made a point on the Valley R.R.--if she does not, that road may
                        tap the Covington &amp; Ohio R.R. at some other point. The interest on
                        the $100,000 at 6 per cent would only be 40 cents on the $100 value of
                        property in the town at its present valuation, but the population and value
                        of property in town is destined to a great increase, and the tax thus
                        rendered less burdensome.</p>
                    <p>In November 1846, a meeting was held here to secure the extension of what was
                        then known as the Louisa R.R. from Gordonsville to Staunton. Rockingham
                        county tried hard to make Swift Run Gap a point on the Road. The President
                        of the R.R. hesitated, rather leaning in favor of that route, with
                        Harrisonburg as a contemplated point on the Road. After an anxious
                        consultation with Col. Crozet one night, Judge Sheffey, (then one of the
                        Representatives of this county,) the next day offered an amendment to the
                        bill providing that the route should be in the direction of Covington and to
                        cross the Blue Ridge where the distance and cost would be least. The bill
                        thus amended was passed, and the Road secured to Staunton.</p>
                    <p>Staunton, said Judge Sheffey, cannot afford to fail to vote the proposed
                        subscription of $100,000.</p>
                    <p>Suppose the Valley R.R. should cross the Covington &amp; Ohio R. R. at
                        the toll gate four miles from Staunton. The scream of the whistle then would
                        make the oldest fogy in Staunton grunt. Then they would regret that they had
                        not voted the tax. Should this be made a point of intersection of the Valley
                        and Covington &amp; Ohio Railroads, Staunton will become a place of
                        wealth and population not now even dreamed of by the most hopeful.</p>
                    <p>The building of the Road through this county would <sic>necessitatate</sic>
                        an expenditure within the county of more than a million of dollars. All will
                        be benefitted by this expenditure.</p>
                    <p>By the construction of this Road through the county, its citizens would make
                        four times the amount of the tax in a mere business point of view. He dated
                        the prosperity of Staunton from the building of the McAdamized Road in the
                        Valley. He concluded by the expression of the hope that this people would
                        work out a noble destiny.</p>
                    <p>Dr. C.R. Harris, Capt. Jed Hotchkiss, and Col. Jno. B. Watts addressed the
                        meeting in pointed and telling speeches.</p>
                    <p>Col. Harman moved that the vote of the meeting be taken upon the question of
                        subscription. The vote was taken and resulted unanimously in favor of it.</p>
                    <p>On motion of Col. Harman, the chair appointed a committee of ten to canvass
                        the town in favor of the proposed subscription of $100,000.</p>
                    <p>The chair appointed the following to constitute the canvassing committee of
                        ten:--Robt G. Bickle, Dr. C.R. Harris, R. Mauzy, Jno. B. Evans, J.C.
                        Marquis, Jed Hotchkiss, Wm. H. Tams, H. M. Bell, Wm. A Burke and Bolivar
                        Christian.</p>

                <summary>Describes in great detail the proceedings of a railroad meeting in
                    Staunton. Railroad representatives gave long speeches outlining the great
                    opportunities available to the city even though the railroad extension would
                    require a new tax. Ends by recording the unanimous vote in favor of the measure
                    and the men appointed to a canvassing committee.</summary>
