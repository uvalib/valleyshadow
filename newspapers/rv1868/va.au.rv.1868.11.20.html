<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The spirit of the age demands increased facilities for reaching the great
                        centres of trade. Countries and sections which were accessible, in the past,
                        only by long and arduous journeys, are now, by the potent agency of steam,
                        opened up to the traffic of the world. Others are anxiously looking to and
                        preparing for the time when steam communication will bear their productions
                        speedily to the great marts.</p>
                    <p>In the recollection of the youngest man, the vast prairies of the West were
                        more inaccessible than trans-Atlantic countries, but to-day the
                        steam-whistle is heard in every part of them, cities have arisen almost by
                        magic, and are now the most progressive and prosperous on this
                        continent--populous and powerful States have taken the place of the prairie
                        and the wilderness, and surpass in prosperity their older sisters of the
                        Union, while the productions of this comparatively new land now control the
                        markets of the world. All this has been done by opening up rapid systems of
                        communication with the world--in a degree annihilating time and space.
                        Without steam communication, the great West would to-day be the abode of the
                        wild Indian alone. The older States, especially the Southern states, might
                        learn a lesson from this. Virginia would, particularly, be benefitted by
                        adopting the progressive spirit of her Western daughters. Her rich mineral
                        deposites will never be developed nor her fertile fields cultivated to their
                        full extent, until emulating the example of her children, steam
                        communication is extended into every available portion of her rich domain.
                        Without it, the prairies of the past are nearer the markets of the world
                        than some of her most fertile sections. Give us but the spirit of progress
                        of the West and Virginia's prosperity will, in a few years, rival that of
                        any State of our once proud Union.</p>
                    <p>While we look at the advantages of steam inter-communication, we should not
                        forget that our common roads must be improved. Railroads can not run to the
                        barns and granaries of every one, but our common roads can be so improved as
                        to greatly expedite the transportation of productions. Both of these
                        subjects are of direct interest to the people of this section and it
                        behooves them to look well to them.</p>
                    <p>Thus much because our people to reflect and reason among themselves on this
                        subject. Reflection and reasoning beget action and action is the only
                        Aladdin's Lamp we need to convert the rich productions and resources of the
                        "Old Dominion" into the yellowest of gold.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A subject now fitly commanding much attention in "the Old Dominion" and her
                        promising young daughter, West Virginia, is the opening of direct railway
                        communication between the Ohio river and Chesapeake bay. A good portion of
                        the distance was long since traversed by the Virginia Central while much
                        grading has been done, but (we believe) no rails laid, on the Covington and
                        Ohio railroad, in West Virginia. Acts have passed the Legislatures of both
                        Virginia and West Virginia providing for a consolidation of the existing
                        corporations and completion of a through line on the route up the Kanawha
                        and down the James, which, since the day of George Washington, has been
                        regarded by Virginians as not only the shortest and most direct, but the
                        easiest and most natural channel of artificial communication between the
                        Atlantic and the Great Valley.</p>
                    <p>Negotiations looking to the legal consolidation of the existing companies
                        into one, which shall be charged with the completion and operation of the
                        "Chesapeake and Ohio railroad," are now in progress, and some divergences of
                        views or of interests have been developed. One party proposes to cut the
                        knot by the sword. General Stoneman, commanding the military department
                        which includes Virginia, is solicited to issue an edict deciding that the
                        required consolidation shalt be effected in a certain way and under certain
                        auspices, and not otherwise. We presume him incapable of such an abuse of
                        authority; but we shall nevertheless, record our protest against it. Civil
                        authority was rightful conferred by Congress on the military arm for no such
                        purpose as that here contemplated, but for the protection of personal rights
                        and the preservation of order and peace. We trust all necessity for such
                        authority will soon cease; meantime, let it not be discredited by glaring
                        abuse. We understand that northern capital stands ready to supply the
                        missing links in the proposed and much-needed chain so soon as the
                        differences now existing shall be finally adjusted. Leave business
                        arrangements to business men, and let the military power be satisfied with
                        doing its whole duty in protecting personal rights and preserving the public
                        peace.</p>
