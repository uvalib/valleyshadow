                    that had scarcely bloomed; taken from loved ones who so much needed her care;
                    deeply mysterious indeed, seems this dark dispensation of Providence." "The
                    deceased was a member of the Presbyterian Church, and those who knew her best,
                    testify to her pious life, her gentle, amiable disposition; and though it was
                    not permitted her to recognize the loved faces around her bed-side, yet they can
                    have the comfortable assurance, all is well with her; she now rests in the
                    heavenly home."<br>(Names in announcement:  Emma C. Booz,  J. W. Booz,  C. D. McGhee)</blockquote>
