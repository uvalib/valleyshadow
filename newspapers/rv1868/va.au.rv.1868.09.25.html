<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Warns voters in both the South and the North of the brutal consequences
                    should Grant be elected. Quotes a speech from Garfield showing how Radicals
                    intend to rule the whole country with military force. Appealing mainly to
                    Northerners to get Seymour elected.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals raise the hue and cry that if Grant and Colfax are elected peace
                        will ensue but if Seymour and Blair are elected the rebellion will be
                        re-opened and war will be inevitable. The response to each individual cry,
                        that if war then ensues the Radicals, themselves, must of necessity
                        inaugurate it, since the Democracy will have attained their ends, is a
                        virtual estoppel, yet the general cry of "Seymour, Blair and War" continues
                        for buncombe. In the event of an untrammeled and fair election, there is not
                        the slightest probability of war whether Grant and Colfax or Seymour and
                        Blair be elected. But is there a probability of peace in either event? If
                        Seymour and Blair be elected, we hope and expect to see that peace which
                        will follow the restoration of the Constitution, the restriction of the
                        privileges, prerogatives and powers of each department within their
                        constitutional spheres, the removal of military Governments in the South,
                        the reduction of taxes and restoration of the Union in fact and in truth.
                        Then will follow that confidence, prosperity and progress throughout the
                        land which are the only sure indicators of positive peace.</p>
                    <p>Should Grant and Colfax be elected the peace which will follow is that which
                        we of the South enjoy (?) to-day, viz: military Governments and trials by
                        military commissions, suspension of the habeas
                        corpus and revocation of judicial decrees, whenever it suits the whim
                        of a military satrap, continued disfranchisement of our best and wisest men,
                        the general sway of ignorance and vice, enormous taxation and a consequent
                        continued stagnation of business and prosperity throughout the whole
                        country. This is the peace that the Democracy not only believe and predict,
                        from the election of Grant and Colfax, but which we are promised by high
                        Radical authority. They promise us that the re-construction acts of Congress
                        shall be maintained and enforced, with their white subordination to
                        ignorance and vice, taxation to support a host of useless officers, and
                        defray the expenses of an unnecessary standing army, &amp;c.
                        &amp;c., and if any, North, South, East or West, presume to raise an
                        objection to this kind of peace, a little triangular "piece of steel" is to
                        be the quietus. This is no fancy sketch. It emanates from one who stands
                        high in Radical estimation, Gen. Garfield, member of Congress from Ohio.</p>
                    <p>In a late speech he said: "General Grant will be elected the next President
                        of the United States. When thus elected, he intends, with the aid of the
                        Radical majority in Congress, to rule the country by the help of a little triangular piece of steel called a
                        bayonet."</p>
                    <p>This "little triangular piece of steel" is to rule the whole country, says Gen. Garfield. We of the South are not
                        disturbed in the least at the threat of this "little triangular piece of
                        steel," since it is now held aloft every day in our midst, but will it be
                        received with the same equanimity North? The experience of the South under
                        the rule of the bayonet should suffice for any people, who really love
                        liberty regulated by law. We cannot therefore believe that the northern
                        people will willingly, unresistingly yield to the rule of the bayonet.</p>
                    <p>They have the choice. Civil government or the rule of the sword and bayonet.
                        Peace like unto that of the past or the peace which Gen. Grant wants and
                        which Gen. Garfield offers. Constitutional Government with Seymour and
                        Blair, or Military rule with Grant and Colfax.</p>
                    <p>How they will exercise it remains to be seen but, with the issue patent, we
                        can not believe they will consign themselves to a tyranny like that which
                        broods over the South, sapping its vital energy and prostrating the business
                        interests of the whole country.</p>
