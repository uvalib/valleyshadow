<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that General Stoneman is contemplating passing a
                    compromise substitute for the Stay Law set to expire on January 1st. The new
                    measure would restrain creditors while putting some pressure on debtors. The
                    editors call for people to hold meetings and demonstrations to let their
                    sentiments on the subject be known. "Without a general expression of sentiment,
                    Gen. Stoneman is likely to act for the interest of but a few, while he may
                    honestly entertain the opinion that he is acting for the good of the many."<br>
