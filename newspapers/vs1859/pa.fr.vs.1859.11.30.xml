                    <p>--The work of relaying the track of this road has been pushed forward with
                        all possible dispatch, and hopes are entertained of having the road
                        completed to Hagerstown by the 1st of January. The cross-ties and iron to
                        finish the road are in readiness, a considerable number of workmen are
                        engaged in putting it down, and the work will be prosecuted vigorously to
                        completion. Efforts are being made to effect an arrangement with the C. V.
                        Railroad to stock, and commence at once running, the finished portion of the
                        road, which we hope may be successful. Such an arrangement would operate
                        greatly to the advantage of our Forwarding men and the public generally.</p>
