<b>TRUTH WILL OUT; The Sunbury and Erie Swindle Exposed!; Petrikins Revelations;
                    McClure's Platform Upset</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Canal scandal. Allegation that McClure was bribed with some silver plate.

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. B. RUSH PETRIKEN, one of the opposition candidates for State Legislature
                        in Lycoming and Clinton counties, having quarrelled with some of his late
                        political associates, is making a clean breast of the manner in which the
                        State was swindled out of her Canals by that rotten
                            concern, the Sunbury and Erie Railroad, and its corrupt
                        speculators, that have taken these gentlemen all aback. Mr. Petriken was one
                        of the active managers in procuring the passage of the Sunbury and Erie bill
                        through the Legislature, and was, consequently, cognizant of all the plots,
                        bargains, wire-pullings and arrangements by which
                        that scheme was accomplished. His position enabled him to obtain correct
                        knowledge of all the doings hidden from the public eye. He is well posted up
                        as to how much money certain members received for their votes, and why
                        presents were given to others. This is the business in which Col. McClure
                        played such a conspicuous part and for which the Service of Silver Plate was
                        obtained. In a letter published in the Janiata
                        Sentinel, purporting to come from Philadelphia, though mailed at
                        Chambersburg, and set up in type from manuscript in the handwriting of Col.
                        A. K. McClure, and which fact we are prepared to prove, he puffs himself for
                        his agency in the nefarious business after the following fashion:--"It (the
                        Silver Ware) is a testimonial from the friends of the sale of the Public
                        Works TO COL. A. K. McCLURE [It will be observed that ho states in his own
                        letter that the present was to himself which
                        makes him guilty of receiving bribe,} for his able and indefatigable
                        championship of that great reform in the late Legislature, and none will
                        deny that the rich tribute is well deserved. During the whole of the
                        protracted and bitter struggle in the House to sever the Canals from the
                        State, and State management--in every emergency Col. McCLURE came to the rescue!" This unfortunate letter, from
                        which we make this extract, fixes McClure's agency in the matter beyond the
                        possibility of his shuffling out of it as he will be glad to do at no very
                        distant day. It will not be long before the public will get an inside view
                        of the mysteries of this swindle and the principal actors in it.</p>
                    <p>With Mr. Petriken's motives in making these disclosures we have nothing to
                        do. It is enough for us to know that he has voluntarily become "State's
                        evidence" against his former associates. In his . . . [text missing] . . .
                        benefit of the plundered public in general, and Col. McClure in particular,
                        he reveals the dishonest transactions connected with the sale and re-sale of
                        the Canals; and promises further, that if elected, he will institute such
                        inquiries as will establish the fact of the most astounding frauds in that affair.</p>
                    <p>Among other charges, he says it can be made manifest, by proof, that the
                        Canals were sold for $2, 000, 000 less then they could have been sold for,
                        the same kind of payment being received--that in each sale the Directors and
                        Officers of the railroad were parties purchasing--that all the sales were
                        made in the short period of one month from the time the canals were conveyed
                        to the railroad, in a secret manner, without notice of when they would be
                        sold, or the kind of payment that would be received; and that
                        notwithstanding this secret manner of sale, much larger sums were bid by
                        other parties, before the present possessors had consummated their pretended
                        title under law.</p>
                    <p>On investigation he says it can be proven that the West Branch and
                        Susquehanna Canal was sold for $500, 000, in promises payable twenty years
                        hence; but before the sale was consummated under the law, $750, 000 were
                        offered for that part between Northumberland and Duncan's Island, (about
                        one-half)--and such witnesses as Judge Jordan and Wm. I. Greenough, Esq., of
                        Sunbury, will prove it.-- Mr. Petriken says the North Branch Canal was sold
                        for $1, 500, 000 in promises payable in future, and that before the sale was
                        consummated an offer was made by other parties of $2, 000, 000. The Deleware
                        Division, a Canal which under State management cleared six per cent. per
                        annum on the sum of $4, 000, 000, was sold for $1, 775, 000, $75, 000 in
                        hand, $100, 000 in the stock of the company created, $400, 000 in monthly
                        installments of $40, 000 and $1, 200, 000 in promises to pay twenty years
                        off. Before this sale was made, other parties offered $2, 000, 000, and no
                        doubt if the world had known the terms of payment $3, 000, 000 could been
                        had. Inquiry may prove, says Mr. Petriken, that two or three persons in his
                        own district own more than one-half of this stock, for which they paid
                        nothing but the guilt of the wrong to the people, and on which they realize
                        at least $30, 000 annum!</p>
                    <p>We have never doubted that the time would come, sooner or later, when the
                        secret history of the passage of the Sunbury and Erie bill would be made
                        public, and we are not likely to be disappointed. The parties to that fraud
                        are already quarreling over the spoils, and in their eagerness to criminate
                        one another, are making disclosures that will open the eyes of the people to
                        the disreputable means by which the Commonwealth was plundered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Petriken's Statement.</p>
                    <p>FELLOW CITIZENS:--I propose, in the event of my election to the assembly by
                        you, to enquire how the officers of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad have
                        discharged the TRUST confided to them by "an Act for the sale of the State
                        Canals."</p>
                    <p>In this inquiry I think it will be made manifest by proof that the Canals
                        were sold at $2, 000, 000 less then they could have been sold for, the same
                        kind of payment being received--that in each sale the Directors and officers
                        of the Railroad were parties purchasing--that all the sales were made in the
                        short period of one month from the time they were conveyed to the Railroad,
                        in a secret manner, without notice of when they would be sold or the kind of
                        payment that would be received, that notwithstanding this secret manner of
                        sale, much larger sums were bid by other parties, before the present
                        possessors had consummated their pretended title under the law.</p>
                    <p>To illustrate, I believe on such an investigation it will be proven, that the
                        West Branch and Susquehanna Canal was sold for $400, 000, in promises
                        payable twenty years hence, but before its consummation under the law $750,
                        000 was offered for that part between Northumberland and Duncans
                        Island,--about one half,--and such witnesses as Judge Jordan and Wm
                        Grenough, Esq., of Sunbury will prove it.</p>
                    <p>I believe it will be proven that the North Branch Canal was sold for $1, 500,
                        000 in promises payable in future, and that before the sale was consumated
                        an offer was made by other parties of $2, 000, 000.</p>
                    <p>I believe it will be proven that the Delaware Division, a Canal which under
                        State management cleared six per cent. per annum on the sum of $4, 000, 000
                        was sold for $1, 775, 000.</p>
                    <p>$75, 000 in hands, $100, 000 in the stock of the Company created, $400, 000
                        in monthly instalments of $40, 000 and $1, 200, 000 in promises to pay
                        twenty years off-- before this sale was made other parties offered $2, 000,
                        000 and I have no . . . [text missing] . . . had.</p>
                    <p>I think it can be proven that in all the sales made a portion of the
                        Directors of the Railroad were parties in the purchase.</p>
                    <p>The enormity of the wrong done to the Commonwealth will be thus made manifest
                        and when inquiry comes to be made as to the owners of these Canals since the
                        sales, it will be proven that a few individuals, who perpetrated the wrong
                        are in receipt annually of princely incomes.</p>
                    <p>To illustrate this--The West Branch and Susquehanna Canal is represented by
                        stock $600, 000--by bonds $500, 000; the interest on the bonds is $30,
                        000--the revenue about $100, 000 leaving $70, 000 to divide amongst the
                        stockholders. Enquiry may prove that two or three persons in this district
                        own more then one half this stock, for which they paid nothing but the guilt
                        of the wrong to the people and on which they realize at least $30, 000 per
                        annum.</p>
                    <p>But inquiry I think will make the Delaware Division the most startling
                        fraud.-- The Brother of the President of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad is
                        President of this Canal. It was organized with a stock capital of $1, 200,
                        000 and the $100, 000 stock held by the Railroad. I think it will be proven
                        that this capital has been doubled making in all $2, 500, 000 in stock and
                        $1, 200, 000 in Bonds and debt--and that it pays the interest on this debt
                        and a dividend of 8 per cent has been declared on the
                            stock.</p>
                    <p>Many say we know great wrong has been done but how can it be remedied?--My
                        answer to their inquiry is this: By the act for the sale of the State
                        Canals, the Sunbury and Erie Railroad company is made Trustee to sell them,
                        the State agreeing to take in part payment $3, 500, 000 of the Railroad
                        company's bonds, payable in the future, and three fourths of all realized
                        over and above that sum in such payment as the Railroad company should
                        receive, and the other fourth of the surplus the Sunbury and Erie keep as
                        compensation.</p>
                    <p>If this position be correct, then the only way the Sunbury and Erie Railroad
                        could legally sell was by public sale--and no officer of the Sunbury and
                        Erie could become a purchaser. Surely in the ordinary affairs of life, the
                        Law holds that a trust sale must be public, and it holds with equal force
                        that a Trustee cannot be a purchaser at his own sale, hence the sale of the
                        canals is void and the remedy is to create a new trustee to carry out the
                        design of the "Act for the sale of State canals."</p>
                    <p>It is as to the truth or falsity of the charges made that enquiry is designed
                        to be made in the Legislature. Then the parties who denounce me can have the
                        privilege of doing it in a legal manner, and at the same time have their
                        lips hallowed by kissing the Gospel of God, if they have belief in Him.</p>
                    <p>Then an approximation to truth can be reached or a multitude of souls be
                        damned for false swearing. Then it will not be an allegation against
                        allegation without the restraining influence of an oath.</p>
                    <p>Fellow citizens, if there is nothing wrong, why are those people accused, so
                        uneasy. Because they dread your wrath, when you come to know by proof--no
                        allegation--that they are living in princely magnificence, on the revenues
                        of a canal built by your sweat and toil and by
                        them fraudulently obtained.</p>
