                <origin/>
                <excerpt>"It is frequently complained, that during the winter months, churches are
                    kept at a temperature either too high or too low, and you are therefore either
                    left to freeze in a comfortless pew, while a prosy preacher gets off a still
                    prosier sermon, or are rendered so uncomfortable by the heat that the influence
                    of such an atmosphere on the human system, rather than the subject matter of the
                    discourse, occupies your attention, and you feel a relief when the service is
                    over."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>--One of our exchanges has some remarks on this subject which apply with
                        equal force to this locality. It is frequently complained, that during the
                        winter months, churches are kept at a temperature either too high or too
                        low, and you are therefore either left to freeze in a comfortless pew, while
                        a prosy preacher gets off a still prosier sermon, or are rendered so
                        uncomfortable by the heat that the influence of such an atmosphere on the
                        human system, rather than the subject matter of the discourse, occupies your
                        attention, and you feel a relief when the service is over. This is a fair
                        cause of complaint, and one to the truth of which not a few of our readers
                        can bear testimony. It is one, however, which may be easily remedied. A
                        little attention from the janitor, with a thermometer by which to arrange
                        the temperature, will prevent it all, unless, indeed, the heating apparatus
                        be imperfect, and then neither thermometer nor janitor will avail much in
                        remedying the evil. In the latter case the furnaces or stoves, as the matter
                        may be, should be removed, and their place supplied by others. It is the
                        only effectual way to remove the cause of complaint, and the trustees or
                        managers of churches so fixed, would do well to give it their attention.</p>
