<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--The concert given in Franklin Hall, on Friday night, was not only a rich
                        vocal and musical treat, but a most gorgeous and gratifying spectacle. The
                        audience in attendance was the largest, and most highly respectable, we have
                        ever seen assembled in the Hall. The stage was decorated with wreaths and
                        festoons of evergreens and flowers arranged in the most beautiful forms and
                        exquisite designs, indicating the best judgement and the most refined taste.
                        The rural picturesqueness of the stage presented a scene of great beauty and
                        grandeur, for surpassing anything ever witnessed in this place, and
                        attracted much admiration and praise. It is but justice to say that this
                        delightful feature in the entertainments was the handiwork of the estimable
                        lady of our fellow townsman Col. A. K. McClure.</p>
                    <p>The accompaniments on the Piano, which are of a very difficult character,
                        were executed by Miss Minns Andre, and were the embodiment of everything
                        that is delightful in Music. This young and much esteemed lady has had the
                        imprimatur of excellence affixed to her performance on the Piano by the best
                        judges, and on this occasion she more than realized the fondest expectations
                        of her numerous friends.</p>
                    <p>The Fifteen young ladies representing the Flowers evinced a perfect knowledge
                        of the highest order of vocal attainment, and acquitted themselves in a
                        manner highly satisfactory to the audience and creditable to themselves. It
                        is seldom we find persons so young in years attain to such a degree of
                        perfection in vocalization requiring so much time for study and practice. We
                        must recollect that these young ladies are not professional performers, and whatever deficiency we may have
                        discovered in their singing, may be attributed to that loveliest trait in
                        female character--modesty. The suppressed note of modesty is always more to
                        be admired than the brazen sound of brassfacedness however artistic it may be.</p>
                    <p>The part of the Recluse by Mr. J. Mac. Thompson, who is well known as a
                        talented and experienced teacher of vocal music, was enacted in admirable
                        style, and his singing much admired for its clearness and melody.</p>
                    <p>The Band on this as on every other occasion it performs, discoursed the most
                        melodious and inspiring sounds, and contributed much to the pleasures of the
                        evenings entertainment.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J. K. Shryock, the gentleman under whose auspices this brilliant
                        entertainment was gotten up deserves the gratitude of our citizens for his
                        disinterested efforts to afford them an evenings enjoyment, and at the same
                        time contribute to the advancement of that praiseworthy object--a Public
                        Library. To Mr. Shryock, more than any other man, is our community indebted
                        for the introduction of a higher and purer musical taste, and a greater degree of musical spirit than we ever thought would be our good fortune of our town to
                        possess.</p>
                    <p>The entire community is eager for a repetition of "The Flower Queen" and
                        whatever imperfections occurred, (unavoidable in a first representation,) we
                        are well persuaded will be handsomely remidied in a second performance.</p>
