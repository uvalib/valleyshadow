<b>Another Shot from Heavy Peg</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>More fighting with Heavy Peg in the Transcript. This a long list of
                    complaints about him, including corruption. Heavy Peg appears to refer to A. K.
                    McClure.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--We again take up this loathsome subject, not from choice, but from a sense
                        of duty towards the people of the Senatorial district. Heavy Peg has once
                        more belched forth its thunder, from its masked batter "MERCERSBURG," in
                        self glorification of the "great champion" of the combination clique, and it
                        would never do to let this opportunity pass without verifying his boast that
                        he "has the Spirit paid to abuse him," for the
                        purpose of drawing out the sympathies of his own party. We trust that our
                            expose will save him the necessity of
                        incessantly cracking up himself, until he has become the eye sore of his own
                        party and the laughing stock of the Democracy, and that he can henceforth
                        stand on the tender platform of sympathy and exclaim--"Save me! Save me!!--I
                        am traduced and vilified by the locofocos!!!" We have no objections--none
                        whatever--that he should rate himself "a head and shoulders taller than any
                        other man in his own party," and are perfectly satisfied that every man in
                        his party should feel themselves very small--mere
                        pigmies in his towering presence. That is a matter between him and
                        themselves, to be settled by the arbitrary rules in such cases made and
                        provided by his lick spittle combination clique. It is also a matter of
                        indifference to us however "HONEST AND RELIABLE" he may represent himself to
                        be, so long as he does not stand above suspicion in public estimation. That
                        is at all times sufficient for our purpose, but it is truly unfortunate for
                        his cracked up "honesty" and "reliability," and he has our warmest
                        sympathies in his peculiar predicament, that he
                        does not stand above the suspicion, when Superintendent of Public Printing,
                        of corruptly using the office for his own private
                        gain.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above suspicion, when loafing about Harrisburg, holding the office just named, and thus
                            apparently thrown into intimate relations
                        with Gov. Pollock, of having sold to any and
                        every person, who would pay for the same, the
                            seeming influence he had with the Governor.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having colluded with others, and bargained with a certain candidate for
                        State Treasurer, that if they elected him, (which they subsequently did) the
                            Caucus was to be well paid out of the State
                        Treasury--which it is believed they were.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having so bitterly denounced
                        and opposed Gen Cameron, in 1855, when a candidate for U S Senator, for the
                        only reason that the General would not "come down with the spondulicks" for
                        his mighty influence and support, preferring defeat rather than be compelled
                        to purchase so venal a creature.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having gotten from a certain
                            medical candidate for U. S. Senator, several thousand gilded pills, for the influence of
                        his facile pen and incorruptible paper in favor of his nomination, which several
                        thousand capsules he swallowed and never paid for.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having by false representations
                        endeavored to deceive Gov. Pollock into signing the bill relating to the
                        Public Printing, which, had he succeeded in accomplishing, would have
                        defrauded the State out of at least $30,000 per year, which would have been
                        a snug little sum to divide between himself and his equally corrupt
                        colleagues.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having, when Commissioner of
                        the Erie and North East Rail Road, taken particular care of the interests of number
                        one.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion (whilst the effort was being made
                        to get the Legislature to restore the above Railroad to its former owners,)
                        of having sold himself for money to the parties
                        interested on both sides of the question.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion, while hanging about the Executive
                        Anti-Chamber, much to the disgust of Gov.
                        Pollock, of having been deeply interested pecuniarily, in the granting of certain pardons, and in the signing
                        of certain Acts of Assembly.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having received $8000 from the
                        Union Bank of Philadelphia, for services rendered
                        and monies disbursed on securing its passage and
                        approval.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having received from the
                        Farmer's and Mechanic's Bank of Philadelphia, a large amount in Stock of the
                        Bank, and otherwise, for procuring the passage of
                        the bill for its re charter, and getting the Gov. to sign it.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having been well paid for supporting the bill under which the Public Works
                        were sold to that corrupt and dangerous monopoly, the, Penn., Railroad
                        Company.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having been much better paid for supporting that other Act of Assembly
                        whereby the State Canals were given away to that
                        rotten concern, the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having handled some thirty or
                        forty thousand dollars of the Bonds of the last
                        named concern which never returned to the custody of its Treasurer.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having ordered and paid for the
                        $500 set of Silver Ware, presented to his lady,
                        in behalf of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, or its friends, for his
                        peculiar and disinterested efforts in the passage of the bill to give them the State Canals.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having himself written a
                        certain letter eulogistic of the above bogus presentation.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having received from a certain
                        wealthy Philadelphian last winter, $25,000 to be used to secure the passage
                        of a bill through the Legislature to divorce his daughter--which bill never
                        passed--and of which trust fund the small sum of
                        $12,500 remains unaccounted for.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having been all the last
                        session of the Legislature most deeply interested
                        in the good of the citizens of Philadelphia--especially in securing them a
                        sufficient number of Passenger Railroads--even if the Corporators had to
                        bleed freely for their passage.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of enjoying the privilege of
                        holding 100 shares of Stock in the Chestnut and Walnut street Rail Roads,
                        worth $5000.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of owning a large number of shares
                        in several other Banks and Insurance Companies in Philadelphia, which were
                        chartered or re chartered within the past five years.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having used money freely to
                            buy a right to sit in the Chair graced by
                        Hancock, but rumor says Simon was about and a small installment of the old debt of 1855 was
                        then and there paid. </p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having written all the
                        communications, and editorials which appeared in the Harrisburg Daily and
                        Weekly Telegraph, the Independent and the Repository and
                            Transcript, cracking up his activity, honesty and fidelity as a
                        public servant, his integrity and morality as a man and a citizen, and his
                        peculiar fitness and availability as a candidate.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the universal
                        suspicion, while a member of the Legislature, of having been one of the most
                        corrupt and venal men who ever had a seat in that body, ready at all times
                        for any scheme which would advance his private
                        interests. If any doubt the truth of this suspicion, we pray them inquire
                        about Harrisburg, where many things are well
                        known that are not dreamed of in the pure regions
                        of Franklin County.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of being worth 40 or 50 thousand
                        dollars now, while it is well known that he came here only seven years ago
                        several thousand dollars in debt. If this suspicion be true--Quere--How was
                        the money made? Not surely as a pettifogger at one
                        third pay.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having defeated his own party
                        nominee, Washington Crooks, for Senate, simply because the people would not
                        then force the nomination on him but preferred
                        Crooks. Rumor says that the Col. boasted at Harrisburg before the election
                        that Crooks would not be elected--that HE would allow no man to succeed who
                        had beaten him.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having, each term he was
                        elected to the Legislature, sacrificed his colleagues of Fulton County, and
                        secured his increased majority here by buying up
                        with money certain venal democrats of this county.</p>
                    <p>That he does not stand above the suspicion of having, with a few others of
                        the would be leaders of his party, selected from the numerous candidates now
                        scrambling for office in his party, a certain few
                        to be supported for the offices they are seeking, at the sacrifice of all
                        the others, thus forestalling the action of the County Convention and
                        determining to force upon it the adoption of a caucus ticket.</p>
                    <p>These are only some of the suspicions which exist about and against this extra honest individual, whom "Mercersburg" and a
                        few other paid sycophants and pimps consider a
                        "head and shoulders taller" than his fellows. There are none but will admire
                        their standard of excellence--over the left.</p>
                    <p>We cannot dismiss this subject, tedious and loathsome as we find, it, without
                        expressing our admiration at the "Herculean labor" with which the
                        redoubtable endeavors to force down the throat of the public, that he alone
                        is entitled to all the credit of all the Legislation of the last few
                        years--that he originated all the public measures of the day--that his clear reasoning demonstrated their propriety--that
                        his Ciceronian eloquence passed them over the
                        prejudices of personal and political opponents--that he is the only man that possesses the
                        requisites for a seat in the Senate, and that he alone can lead the party to
                        victory in this Senatorial District. Pretty well piled on for a modest man
                        who is required to be "forced" into nominations
                        at a great sacrifice to his legal business, and personal comfort, and when
                        too he may run a risk of being "reprimanded for neglect
                            of duty."</p>
                    <p>We have endeavored to do our duty gently--as
                        gently as our sense of duty we owe the public has permitted. We have only
                        for the present partly lifted the veil and
                        disclosed the deeds of darkness behind it, and that too at the earnest
                        solicitation of members of the opposition party, who have become nauseated
                        at the doses they are asked to swallow about the "great champion"--the
                        "acknowledged leader of the People's forces"--"a head and shoulders taller
                        than any other man in the
                        ranks"--"capable"--"honest"--"reliable"--"fearless"--and so on and so forth!</p>
                    <p>The view we have here presented we trust may be profitable, and a timely
                        warning to all interested, but if it should not prove so, and the people of
                        this Senatorial District will still allow themselves to be gulled by the
                        tricks of a designing and corrupt politition [sic], now for the first time
                        partially exposed, then we can only--</p>
                    <p>"Pray the powers to mend their mental flaw</p>
                    <p>or grant them kindest keepers and clean straw,"</p>

                    <p><br>A SPLENDID SIGHT. <br>Safe Descent of the Aeronaut. <br>AT
                        LEITERSBURG, MARYLAND. A full Account of the
                        Voyage.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday last, Mr. John A. Light, of Lebanon, Penns., a young, daring and
                        skillful Aeronaut made his third ascension in his splendid Balloon "Eclipse," from the Public Square, in this borough.
                        The Balloon was inflated by the Gas manufactured at our Gas Works, and the
                        Superintendent, Mr. Allen McGrath, and the President of the Company, Wm.
                        Heyser, Esqr., were very attentive and obliging and seemed to take a deep
                        interest in the whole matter. The process of inflation was commenced, and
                        conducted to its completion, in presence of a large concourse of people,
                        assembled from all parts of country, who watched it with seeming
                        gratification and the deepest curiosity. Mr. Light, though quite a young
                        man, and of but little practical experience in the science of Aeronautics,
                        appears to thoroughly understand the hazardous business. All his
                        arrangements were perfect, and the coolness and judgement he displayed in
                        making his preparations fully satisfied all that, so far as human foresight
                        and prudence can go, he would guard against accidents, and had the nerve to
                        successfully carry out the undertaking. We predict for him a brilliant
                        career as an Aeronaut.</p>
                    <p>Everything being in readiness for starting, at 2 1/2 o'clock Mr. Light took
                        his position in the car, attached to his Balloon, and gave directions for
                        releasing him for the time being from terra
                        firma. The car contained three bags of sand, intended for ballast,
                        but it was found impracticable to ascend with that weight, and it was
                        instantly, and we thought, injudiciously, thrown overboard, when the balloon
                        lightened of its load shot upwards into the regions above in gallant style.
                        Mr. Light stood up in his car and waved his cap and cheered, seemingly as
                        much delighted as any of the spectators below him, who sent up shouts of
                        applause that made the welkin ring. The balloon soon attained an altitude of
                        about a mile, sailing off in a south east direction, and keeping pretty much
                        on a line parallel with the road leading from Chambersburg to Waynesboro'.
                        When apparently over New Franklin the balloon disappeared behind the heavy
                        clouds covering the sky in that direction and was lost to view from town.
                        For further particulars of the voyage we give the statement furnished us by
                        Mr. Light. He says:</p>
                    <p>After the balloon passed through the clouds it ascended with great velocity
                        and soon became distended to its fullest capacity, the gas rushing from the
                        valve with quite a musical sound. His watch, from some unaccountable cause,
                        stopped and he was left without any means of computing time, and being shut
                        out from a view of the earth by the clouds, could form no idea of the rate
                        at which he was traveling. By throwing out papers, which floated on the air,
                        he could tell he was rapidly ascending by their being soon left far beneath
                        him. He thinks the highest elevation he attained was about two miles and a
                        half; the balloon at that height changed its course from south east to
                        direct south, and by occasional glimpses of the earth, obtained through
                        transitory openings in the clouds, he could discover a large town a head of
                        him, supposed to be Hagerstown, with another of a smaller size (Greencastle)
                        almost directly beneath him. He then tugged pretty smartly at the valve rope
                        with a view of descending, and having dropped down a considerable distance
                        he gained the under current in which he was first sailing which impelled him
                        south east at a very rapid rate. The whole valley was now in view and
                        presented a most charming picture. The diversified scenery of green meadows,
                        fertile fields and clustering woods resembled the rich and gaudy coloring of
                        a map, while the farm houses, towns and villages dotted over the surface of
                        the valley added a deep and enlivening interest to the scene. The view
                        presented the most grand, gratifying and gorgeous spectacle possible for the
                        mind to conceive, and which it is alone the privilege of the Aeronaut to
                        enjoy. The towns of Waynesboro' and Hagerstown were now in full view but
                        animate objects could not be observed. A cluster of houses was noticed
                        directly below, and in the course of the balloon, and preparation was at
                        once made for the descent. The grapple was thrown out and the valve opened
                        wide, when the balloon shot downwards with the speed of an arrow. On nearing
                        the earth he observed he was over a small village and its inhabitants in the
                        utmost confusion and alarm. The grapple struck the earth in the centre of
                        the street and but one man came to his assistance, Mr. George Rissinger, to
                        whom he expressed himself under many obligations for his kind and timely
                        service in helping him to land. On gaining a foot-hold on old Mother Earth
                        once more, he made rapid inquiries as to the time of day--his position,
                        &amp;c., and was surprised to learn that it was but 3 o'clock, and that
                        he was in the town of Leitersburg, Md.-- twenty three miles from
                        Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that the voyage was made, and in somewhat a zig zag
                        course in half an hour. Finding himself so much further from Chambersburg
                        than he expected, he did not wait for the conveyance engaged to bring him
                        back but hired another and returned by way of Greencastle, without having
                        stopped in Waynesboro. He arrived safe in Chambersburg about half past 12
                        o'clock at night and received the hearty congratulations of the many friends
                        he has made during his short stay among us.</p>
                    <p>He left for home on Monday morning, delighted with his visit, and well
                        pleased with the treatment he received from the Committee, and citizens
                        generally. He will make an ascension from Lebanon on Saturday next.</p>

                    <p>--A public examination in the studies pursued in Dr. Reeves' Female Seminary,
                        of this place, was given during last week, and was largely attended by the
                        citizens of this and neighboring towns. We were present at a part of the
                        examination, and were pleased to find that this institution, under the
                        auspices and good management of its present talented Principal and
                        Proprietor, has attained a most flourishing condition, and is certainly not
                        surpassed, in any essential particular, by any other Seminary of learning
                        for young ladies in the county. Mr. Reeves is a Christian, a Gentlemen and
                        Scholar, and no man is better qualified, by enlightened views of education
                        and long experience in teaching, to impart literary instruction, and sound
                        moral principles to the youthful mind than he, aided by his accomplished
                        corps of lady assistants. We would heartily recommend this Seminary to all
                        parents who have daughters to educate, and are desirous that they receive a
                        thorough and practical education, as well as all the ornamental
                        accomplishments which should adorn the female mind.</p>

                        The leader of the Victorious Army afterwards Captured by
                            the Enemy.

                    <p>
                        The Owner of the Battle Ground "chock full" of
                        Charity
                    </p>
                    <p>Our readers through the County will doubtless wonder where an important
                        battle could be fought in this county without them first having some
                        information of the cause, &amp;c. We deem it our duty as chroniclers of
                        passing events to lay before the public one of the most bloody and hard
                        fought battles in this community. Fired with the zeal and warlike
                        disposition of the beligerents over the water, a portion of the sooty sons
                        and daughters of Afric's scorching plains took a notion, on Thursday last,
                        to show that though centuries had passed, they had not forgotten that
                        Hanibal had led their fathers to victory. Harvest ended and Whisky
                        plenty--courage up to fighting point, at it they went and for two days and
                        nights the combat raged. Here and there, in the different forts might be
                        seen the combatants stretched out dead-- drunk. The hospital echoed with the
                        groans of the half dead--drunk. Here and there could be seen those who had
                        fought and run away, so that they might drink and fight another day, with
                        heads bandaged and garments fulfilling all the requirements of banners.</p>
                    <p>The absence of the soul stirring drum and fife was made up by the solidity of
                        heads and unearthly yells. Several noble patriots whose unbronzed faces
                        showed them of a colder clime, became participants in the strife. Females
                        displayed the most undaunted courage and endured the fight until near the
                        end when they were taken prisoners and thrust into the gloomy cells of Fort
                        Brown. The greatest battles ever fought had a point of termination and so
                        had this. Eight prisoners of both sexes were taken and placed in security to
                        be exchanged next court.</p>
                    <p>We are happy to say that none of the wounded have since died, their wounds
                        being principally of a whisky character.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps a few of our readers may be in ignorance as to the locality of this
                        battle ground. East of the Franklin Railroad and the property of Wm.
                        McLellan, and South of the Gettysburg pike, may be seen a collection of huts
                        inhabited, with few exceptions, by the most degraded and drunken men and
                        women, no better than can be found in Spafford and Baker Streets in
                        Philadelphia. Streams of filth flow from these pens, bearing enough poison
                        to create sickness of the most deadly kind. Blasphemy and ribald songs,
                        yells, screams and hootings, fill the sabbath day. Night is turned into a
                        time of robbing and worse vices--and such is only
                        a small part of what is done on Tote's Island.</p>
                    <p>And now to the kind of Charity that prompted the planting of this hot bed of
                        iniquity. It is argued by the owner that these wretches would have to be
                        homeless unless he provided shelter for them--charity for the degraded black
                        is made the excuse for collecting these huts in the various parts of our
                        town--yes, dear reader, this charity is worth just 25 to 50 cents a week--a
                        charity worth indulging indeed. There is a point, however, at which this
                        charity ceases, and that point is reached every Saturday night when "um"
                        calls for his rent. The question is rent or out. Now why one man should be permitted for the
                        sake of gain to override a community with the outcast of this unfortunate
                        race of people. The cost of maintenance in prison of those who were lately
                        put in, will far overbalance the taxes derived from such worthless property.
                        A charge of maintaining a nuisance is now hanging over this charitable
                        individual, and it is to be hoped that our court will see that at least a
                        start in economy is made by routing this intolerable nuisance. </p>
                    <p>It is not the citizens of this town who suffer, the whole county bears the
                        expense of these suits, resulting from the congregating together of these
                        degraded beings.</p>
