<b>Miss Judson Goes to Indiana and Gets a Divorce</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Michigan woman who eloped with a black man has gone to Indiana to get a
                    divorce from him.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--Miss Judson, the heroine of the Anglo African elopement which caused so
                        much commotion about six weeks since, arrived in town yesterday on her way
                        homeward, having been to Indiana, in company with her brother, and
                        advertised Joe for a divorce. Joe hadn't any money to take him there to
                        plead his own case, and, time being up, he was repudiated, and his bride
                        made a free woman. She was just in the nick of time, as the statutes were
                        immediately afterward amended so as to cut off all such operations in
                        future. Indiana is no longer the haven of domestic difficulties. The poor
                        disconsolate darkey is now alone again, and, although he is said to still
                        wander on the shore by moonlight, looking for his love to return, he will
                        never be able to embrace her again.</p>
                    <p>The operation is all unnecessary, as the girl was never legally married to
                        the nigger. If the ceremony was performed on this side, it was illegal,
                        because the marital connection of black and white persons is not only
                        contrary to law, but the functionary who officiates to such a union is
                        liable to severe punishment; and, if they were married on the other side, it
                        was illegal, because a license was required, which was not obtained. She
                        says that they were married on this side by a negro preacher who lives in
                        Canada.</p>
                    <p>The effect of the affair is of the most salutary nature. The publicity which
                        has been given to it has brought it into notice from one end of the Union to
                        the other, and the amiable Judson is as famous as he can possibly desire. We
                        will venture the assertion that it has placed Abolitionism and
                        amalgamationism in a position that years of reasoning and argument would not
                        have effected.--Detroit Free Press.</p>
