                    <p>A number of the teachers of Franklin county met at Strasburg, December 29th,
                        for the purpose of discussing in a practical manner the different branches
                        of education taught in our common schools. The inclemency of the weather
                        prevented many from attending this Convention. It however numbered some
                        thirty five members. The following is a summary of proceedings:</p>
                    <p>Organized at eleven o'clock, A. M. P. M. Shoemaker, Chairman, and A. H.
                        DeHaven, Secretary. Messrs. Lehman, Thomas and Pence were appointed a
                        committee to report permanent officers. In the afternoon the following
                        report was unanimously accepted. P. M. Shoemaker, President; Daniel Gelwix,
                        John Armstrong and J. W. Coble, Vice Presidents; J. Montgomery and J. Mac
                        Thomson, Secretaries. The President made some remarks, brief but pertinent,
                        respecting the cause of education. Messrs. Thomson, Coble and Wingert were
                        appointed a Business Committee. E. K. Lehman introduced the subject of
                        Geography; used Pelton's Outline Maps; exercises quite sprightly; the system
                        declared the best in use. Rev. Mr. Hanuaberry addressed the Convention on
                        Wednesday evening His subject, "The Nature and Importance of Education," was
                        well discussed, and elicited the profound attention of his audience. The
                        subject of Arithmetic was taken up. Messrs. Shoemaker and Coble,
                        instructors. On Thursday morning, Mr. J. K. Shryock addressed the Convention
                        on the subject of English Grammar. His remarks were entirely of a practical
                        nature, interspersed with exercises on the blackboard. In the afternoon, Mr.
                        B. F. Frey introduced the subject of Algebra. It was quite evident he had
                        given it much thought and study. Some difficult questions were analyzed. Mr.
                        Shoemaker addressed the Convention on Thursday evening Subject, "What is
                        Education; how is it to be obtained?" It was dealt with in a manner which
                        showed the lecturer to be well posted by experience on the ways and means by
                        which a practical education may be obtained. The subject of Vocal Music was
                        presented by J. Mac. Thomson. On Friday evening, the subject of Arithmetic
                        was continued by Mr. J. B. Cauffman. Messrs. Lehman, Croft and Cauffman were
                        appointed a Committee on Resolutions. On Friday afternoon a lively
                        discussion on the subject of Text Books occurred. A. H. DeHaven presented a
                        system of Penmanship. The Committee on Resolutions reported the following:</p>
                    <p>Resolved. That the thanks of this institute are
                        due, and are hereby tendered the Lutheran and German Reformed congregations,
                        for the use of their church on this occasion.</p>
                    <p>Resolved. That the thanks of this Institute be
                        tendered Mr. Stake for the comfortableness of the church during the
                        Institute's sessions.</p>
                    <p>Resolved. That our thanks be tendered Messrs.
                        Shryock, Frey and Cauffman, for the able and interesting instructions given
                        this society, and that copies of these lectures be requested for
                        publication.</p>
                    <p>Resolved. That our thanks be tendered the choir of
                        Strasburg, and J. Mac. Thomson's class, for enlivening the exercises with
                        excellent music.</p>
                    <p>Resolved. That in our opinion the County
                        Superintendency is the right arm of the school system, and that any attempt
                        to abolish it should be frowned upon by every friend of education.</p>
                    <p>Resolved. That we heartily approve of the course
                        pursued by our able and worthy Superintendent, in his examination visits to
                        schools, and in every other respect; and that, by his energy and
                        perseverance, he has endeared himself to every friend of education, and that
                        we will uphold and sustain him in every effort put fourth for the
                        advancement of the glorious cause of education.</p>
                    <p>Resolved. That the thanks of this Institute are
                        hereby tendered the citizens of Strasburg and vicinity, for encouragement
                        given us by their presence at our meetings, and that we will ever remember
                        their kindness with grateful hearts.</p>
                    <p>Resolved. That we believe that it is the
                        imperative duty of every teacher to use every means in his power to fully
                        prepare himself for the discharge of his responsible duties as a teacher;
                        and as a means of such improvement, we believe that every teacher who
                        possibly can, should attend the Normal School at Chambersburg, to commence
                        about the first April next.</p>
                    <p>Resolved That the proceedings be published in the
                        "Pennsylvania School Journal," and in the county papers.</p>
                    <p>The following letter was read, and a motion handed over for publication:</p>
                    <p>ST. THOMAS, Dec. 27, 1858.</p>
                    <p><br>Mr. P. M. SHOEMAKER:--Dear Sir: I am sorry to
                        inform you that by the sudden illness of my father, I am forced to be absent
                        from your meeting. How much I wish to be present you may imagine, as this is
                        the first meeting for the improvement of teachers that I have been absent
                        from since I commenced teaching in 1854; but my duty as a son to a kind
                        parent, must forego the pleasure I had anticipated at your meeting. All I
                        am, is owing to my attending the different kinds of educational meetings.</p>
                    <p><br>Respectfully yours,</p>
                    <p><br>JAMES H. MONTGOMERY.</p>
                    <p>On motion adjourned, to meet at St. Thomas in May.</p>

                    <p>--The Committee appointed by the Hook and Ladder Company, to purchase an
                        apparatus, visited Philadelphia last week and succeeded in purchasing the
                        "PROTECTION" apparatus of that city, on very reasonable terms. This
                        apparatus is one of the very best, and the latest style the city affords.
                        Our community will see the necessity of contributing liberally towards this
                        enterprise. The Committee have advanced their own funds and paid for the
                        apparatus, as it could only be purchased for cash. The money already
                        subscribed must be immediately collected, and the following named persons
                        are authorized to take it up as well as to solicit further aid:--James King,
                        J. P. Culbertson, J. S. Nixon, Samuel Reed, and Thomas Grier. The apparatus
                        will be ready to be delivered in this place about the 22 inst., and we
                        understand the "Hope" and "Friendship" intend giving it a handsome
                        reception.</p>
