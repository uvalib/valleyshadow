<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday night last at about 10 o'clock, our usually quiet town was
                        startled by a rumor that a horrible shooting affray had occured at a house
                        of bad repute, kept by a man by the name of Kobler, at the northern end of
                        town. This house has long been a nuisance to the whole neighborhood and has
                        already been up before court for its bad character. It was frequented
                        nightly by men and women of the worst description, and by many others who
                        would fain pass for respectable, and much rather that the veil of midnight
                        darkness should enshroud their stealthy visits than they be exposed to the
                        watchful eyes in that vicinity. A few nights ago some rowdies, as usual,
                        assembled at the house, and had a dispute about a prostitute in which one of
                        the parties was stoned away from the house. It appears from all the
                        information we could collect, and we think it may be relied upon as pretty
                        accurate, though a legal investigation may present it in a different light,
                        that on Saturday night last one of these parties, a man named McLaughlin, a
                        plasterer by trade, and a native of Gettysburg, Adams County, and who has
                        been working at his trade in this place for only a few weeks, visited this
                        house and induced a friend named Wm. Glenn to accompany him. This Glenn is a
                        native of Baltimore, a marble- worker by trade, and has been in the employ
                        of Mr. John McFadden, of this place, for several months back. McLaughlin
                        stated to Glenn that he had been attacked at this house on the Thursday
                        night previous, and desired Glenn to go with him to defend him in case of a
                        second attack. This at first Glenn refused to do, but after drinking
                        together he consented and armed himself with a revolving pistol. McLaughlin,
                        we believe, had a "Billy" or "Slung Shot." They visited the house together
                        and were in company with a prostitute named "Till Mellinger" in a back room
                        of the house, while the front room was occupied by four or five young men of
                        this place who were engaged in drinking. Glenn, McLaughlin, and the girl
                        Mellinger, left the house together, and went in the direction of town. They
                        were immediately followed by the young men in the house. McLaughlin remained
                        some distance in the rear of Glenn and the girl; and remarked to the young
                        men that "they had better not follow that man, that he had a pistol and
                        would shoot them."--A stone, it is said,was then thrown by someone in the
                        direction of Glenn, who immediately turned and fired three shots in rapid
                        succession, and running back a short distance, fired a fourth, in a
                        direction where two or three persons were standing. McLaughlin happened to
                        be one of these persons and was struck by the shot--Glenn then made at some
                        of the others and swore that he had still a shot in his pistol for them.
                        McLaughlin after being wounded ran towards town, but becoming faint from
                        loss of blood, returned to the scene of the shooting, and then for the first
                        dime Glenn discovered that he had shot his friend. He became almost frantic
                        with grief and expressed his distress at his mistake in the wildest manner.
                        He done all he could to comfort the apparently dying man, and ran
                        immediately for a doctor, to whom he stated that he had shot his friend, and
                        begged him to come to his relief at once.</p>
                    <p>On repairing to the scene immediately after hearing of this affray, we found
                        a large and excited crowd collected in and about the building. We elbowed
                        our way through the crowd and met Sheriff Brown coming out of the door of
                        the house with Glenn in custody. By a little manoeuvering, we gained
                        admission into the house and found it literally packed full. The wounded man
                        was stretched on a low bench in the centre of the densely packed crowd, and
                        our skillful Surgeon Dr. J. C. Richards by his side, industriously probing
                        the wound, and using every means for relief that Surgical Art affords.</p>
                    <p>We observed the wound to be on the right side of the neck a few inches below
                        the ear, and from the direction the probe seemed to take in the hands of the
                        Doctor, we supposed the ball to have entered the neck close to the Carotid
                        artery and passed along under the root of the tongue, opening the gullet,
                        and some of the arterial branches in that neighborhood. The wounded man was
                        vomiting blood freely which evidently entered the stomach through some other
                        passage than the natural one. The track of the ball at this point is
                        obliterated, and its course or location cannot be discovered.</p>
                    <p>Frank McLaughlin, the wounded man, would appear to be about 28 years of age;
                        he is very good looking and gentlemanly in appearance.--We could not but
                        admire his fine athletic form as he lay stripped for the examination of the
                        Surgeon, while we experienced a painful feeling of sorrow to see so much
                        manly beauty, in the health and vigor of its bloom, stricken down amid its
                        unholy scenes of vice, and surrounded by the very swine with which it
                        herded. How many who looked upon that young man weltering in his blood, in
                        such a place, will be warned by his fate? Few--very few--far less, we know
                        than will scoff at our moralizing. Well, we have one kind wish for them, and
                        that is, that they may not be the next victim!</p>
                    <p>Bill Glenn, the young man now in prison charged with this crime, is also
                        young in years and of very handsome appearance. He is said to be a very
                        skillful worker in marble, and has executed some very beautiful and
                        elaborate jobs during his stay in this place. He is, we believe, a native of
                        Baltimore, but has worked for some length of time in Philadelphia and New
                        Orleans. With his "antecedents" in these cities we are not acquainted. His
                        course of life will now, we presume, be thoroughly canvassed; it would be
                        unfair, however, in his present unfortunate situation to say aught
                        calculated to prejudice the public mind against him. He has our entire
                        commiseration, and had we the power we would open his prison doors and set
                        him free, feeling assured that he has been taught a lesson that must make
                        him morally a different man, and that he is now ready to exclaim with
                        Cain--"My punishment is greater than I can bear."</p>
                    <p>It is but proper to state that when Glenn discovered that it was his
                        companion and friend who was shot, he appeared in the deepest distress of
                        mind, which McLaughlin observed and remarked--"Bill do not worry yourself
                        about it, it was not you that shot me, it was the other party." McLaughlin
                        still persists in saying that Glenn did not shoot him.</p>
                    <p>A "Billy" or "Slung Shot" with marks of blood on the inside of the strap that
                        passes around the wrist, was found, on Sunday morning, near the spot where
                        McLaughlin fell. It is conjectured that this instrument belonged to, or had
                        been in the hands of McLaughlin, but concerning this matter we could find no
                        positive evidence.</p>
                    <p>McLaughlin remained at Kobler's until Sunday morning, laying on the floor all
                        night in a most uncomfortable position. The excitement through town on
                        Sunday morning was intense. Crowds of men, women and children visited the
                        scene of the shooting--looked at the wounded man and traced the blood--</p>
                    <p>"Where a human creature in the dead of night</p>
                    <p>Had coursed like hunted hare that cruel distance,</p>
                    <p>With many doubles in its wild flight,</p>
                    <p>Striving for dear existence!"</p>
                    <p>Some kind friend of the wounded man had him removed, about 9 o'clock on
                        Sunday forenoon, to Kyler's Hotel, where he had previously boarded. He was
                        carried through the streets on his way to the Hotel, laid on a settee, which
                        was borne on the shoulders of four men, and followed by a very large crowd
                        of persons. In his new quarters he is receiving every comfort and attendance
                        his condition demands, or the kindheartedness of the proprietors of the
                        house can bestow upon him.</p>
                    <p>From the nature of the wound, and the condition of the man at this time, his
                        recovery is considered doubtful. There is almost an entire inability to
                        swallow, and the neck, breast and face is dreadfully swollen, while there is
                        some internal hemmorhage going on which occasions vomiting of blood. It is
                        feared he may die from inflammation, or the sloughing consequent upon wounds
                        of this character.</p>
                    <p>When Glenn was arrested, he stated that he had thrown the pistol away, and
                        all day Sunday there was considerable hunting to find it. It was observed
                        that just previous to his arrest he had some private conversation with a
                        young man named John Lutz, and on Monday morning 'Squire Hamman, and
                        District Attorney Clark, obtained some information that induced them to
                        believe that Lutz had possession of the pistol. They called upon Lutz and he
                        at first denied having the pistol, but subsequently gave it up to Hon.
                        Wilson Reilly, who is engaged as counsel for Glenn. Mr. Reilly expressed his
                        willingness to place the pistol in the hands of the District Attorney
                        whenever desired. Glenn has done well to place his case in the care of an
                        attorney of such eminent legal ability as Mr. Reilly, and one whose well
                        know tact as a criminal lawyer will ensure him the full advantage of every
                        favorable point his case presents.</p>
                    <p>Our community owes its thanks to Sheriff Brown, District Attorney Clark, and
                        'Squire Hamman for their promptness in having the arrest made, and their
                        activity in hunting up evidence which may have a bearing on the case.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--This association has been revived and fully organized. For more than a
                        year, many of our Farmers and Mechanics were anxious to see this take place.
                        At length there appeared a notice for a meeting to elect officers and
                        managers; the meeting was held, and officers and managers elected for the
                        ensuing year; or until others should be elected to fill their places. On
                        Friday last a meeting of the officers and managers was held in the Office of
                        Wm. S. Everett, Esq., the Secretary, and such steps taken as will give
                        permanency to the organization. They start under the most favorable
                        auspices. They have the old Fair Grounds free of debt, and several hundred
                        dollars in the treasury to commence with. These grounds they purpose
                        leveling and extending, so that they will afford much satisfaction to those
                        who have stock and articles of different kinds for exhibition, and those who
                        come for mere enjoyment and improvement. They have agreed to hold a Fair, which will commence on the third Tuesday of
                        October next, and continue four days. From the interest manifested by our
                        Farmers and Mechanics we may expect a Fair unprecedented among those ever
                        held in our County. They have also made arrangements to secure the services
                        of one of the most eminent men in our County to address the association on
                        the occasion. This association has now become one of the institutions of our
                        County, and merits the attention of every Farmer and Mechanics who values
                        his occupation.--The benefits that will result from its successful operation
                        cannot easily be foretold, but that all those taking a deep interest in its
                        welfare will be benefitted, is as evident, as every effort put forth by
                        them, to advance and develope their peculiar trade, will tend to their
                        improvement. We shall inform our readers of whatever preparations or steps
                        are taken by its managers in the future.</p>

                        <br>Every Machine on Exhibition <br>SOLD BEFORE THE
                            TRIAL CONCLUDED.<br>THREE SUCCESSIVE TRIALS AT MOWING. <br>The
                        Chambersburg Trial <br>The first took place at Chambersburg, on Thursday
                        the 9th, at 2 o'clock, P. M., on two lots in town--one of lodged Clover,
                        very heavy; but the piece was so small that no machine on exhibition could
                        satisfactorily show what it could do in grass of that kind; the other was a
                        lot of Daniel Prostle's. It was Timothy, Clover, and other Grass, dry and
                        light. The Machines all did their work passably well. The only difference in
                        the machines on this trial, seemed to be the draft, some of which were
                        pretty heavy.</p>
                    <p>There having been no Committee appointed, there is no public decision to be
                        reported. The Manny Machine mowed wet Clover, on the morning of the trial,
                        in the field of Mr. Jacob Heyser, near town, to the great satisfaction of
                        many farmers. The Agents of other Machines were especially invited to come
                        out and mow wet grass in the morning, but it did not suit them so early in
                        the day. A large number of farmers were present at this trial, and
                        notwithstanting the number of other machines present, the many advantages of
                        the Manny Machine over others on trial, was apparent to the farmers, and
                        frequently discussed by them.</p>
                    <p>The Manny Machine which was used at the trials at Chambersburg, was purchased
                        by Mr. Joseph Kennedy, who used a New Jersey Machine part of last season,
                        but abandoned its use on account of its liability to get out of order, as we
                        can prove, if required so to do.--This is the gentleman to whom Mr. Thomas
                        S. Whitenack alludes in hiss bills headed "A King among Beggars," in which
                        he says that "Mr. Kennedy tried one of the Manny Machines, got of Mr. Hurst;
                        it failed to work to his satisfaction; he rejected it, and borrowed one of
                        the New Jersey Machines to mow his field." Somebody is lying--we leave the
                        public to decide who.</p>
                    <p><br>The Newville Trial: <br>The second took place at Newville, Cumberland
                        Co., Pa., on Friday, the 10th inst., at 10 o'clock, A. M., in the field of
                        P. A. Ahl &amp; Bros. The number of persons present at this very
                        important trial, was variously estimated, at from six to eight hundred
                        persons, mostly farmers. The grass at this trial was Clover, some lodged,
                        but mostly standing, the bottom very smooth. Five machines were entered for
                        trial.</p>
                    <p>The exhibitors made arrangements for the selection of a Committee, and the
                        following gentlemen were appointed:</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Matthew Boyd, Isaac Newcomer, James Harlan, John Gracy and Miles
                        Glen.</p>
                    <p>When all was in readiness, the Machines were put in operation, some of them
                        not proving to work, by any means, satisfactorily. We were not favored with
                        a copy of the official report of the Committee, but were told that it is as
                        follows: "The quality of the work of the Manny and New Jersey Machines is
                        equal, but the draft of the latter the lightest." We here beg leave to state
                        that it was not understood by us that the Committee were to report on the
                        merits of any of the machines on trial, but simply on the quality of work
                        performed by them. With this understanding we entered the Manny Machine,
                        with its reaping attachments--except the Platform Board, which is very
                        light. We did this with a view of showing to farmers some of the advantages
                        of our machine--such as raising and lowering of the Cutter bar, equally at
                        both ends, while the machine is in operation, an indispensable feature of
                        any good machine, for cutting all kinds of Grass and Grain, lodged and
                        standing, and to enable it to pass over all kinds of obstructions, such as
                        stumps, rocks, furrows, deep gutters. Also, its facilities for working on
                        hill sides, the equal draft of the machine, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>All these advantages farmers should understand, and carefully consider before
                        purchasing. We can, however, very materially lessen the draft of our
                        Machines, in Mowing, by disengaging the Reaping attachments. A new feature
                        was introduced at this trial by Whitenack on the New Jersey by operating it
                        with one horse. This, however, by no means met with the general approbation
                        of the farmers. It showed that there was as much sidedraft there, as it
                        required power to draw the Machine, a very objectionable feature to it. The
                        only thing established by this movement is, that the New Jersey Machine, is,
                        literally, a one horse-machine in every sense of
                        the term.</p>
                    <p>We would be glad to say more about the work of some of the other machines at
                        this trial; but as we were not favored with a copy of the report of that
                        committee, and were informed they took no notice of any of them, we shall
                        avoid having anything more to say about them except that each machine cut
                        about three quarters of an acre. The Manny Machine cut its piece in the
                        short space of twenty three minutes; but was
                        detained three minutes by the Jersey Machine standing in its way. According
                        to the statement of our reporter, we got through in less time than any other
                        machine at the trial.</p>
                    <p><br>The Carlisle Trial. <br>The third took place at Carlisle, at 10
                        o'clock, in the field of Mr. Noble. The field was level, rocky, and stony.
                        The grass was clover, lodged and wet. Six machines entered in competition.
                        No judges appointed. A large number of farmers were present, many of whom
                        wanted to purchase machines. The machines all mowed their lots during the
                        time the trial was going on except one. The agent of that one took the third
                        machine to the field to finish its lot while the crowd was dispersing. One
                        of their machine was so badly broken, it could not operate. The Manny
                        Machine mowed its piece in twenty minutes, in the most complete and
                        satisfactory manner to the farmers, and in much less time than that consumed
                        by any other machine on the ground. It was mowed with the Reaper attachment
                        disengaged, followed by a tender one round. The balance of the work was done
                        by the driver himself. The only machine on the ground operated by one man
                        only.</p>
                    <p>Thirty Manny Machines were sold during the three days of the trials, in
                        Franklin and Cumberland counties. Reported for me by a gentleman in
                        attendance upon all the trials. Given as correctly and impartially as could
                        be done, by a disinterested reporter. To the account furnished by my
                        reporter, I have added the last paragraph under the head of "The
                        Chambersburg trial." <br>A. R. HURST</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--The Manny Machine with Wood's improvement, stands before the public without
                        a rival. It has held its high position for over four years, and increasing
                        more and more every day, in Public favor, both as a Mower, and Combined
                        Machine for cutting all kinds of Grass and Grain. An almost endless number
                        of pretenders have come before the public with worthless machines, crowding
                        them upon the Farmers who have never yet received one dollar's worth of
                        benefit from them, many of which may be found at this time laying about in
                        the fence corners, and in fields in this, and perhaps every county in the
                        State, and stranger to say that as fast as some die out, others are
                        springing up, which in all probability, will soon meet the same fate that
                        those have, that have gone down before them.</p>
                    <p>The question naturally arises, why is this so? which may be explained in this
                        way: The Manny Machine has advantages which no other machines in the country
                        have.</p>
                    <p>First, The cutter bar can be raised or lowered at both ends, equally at the
                        same time.</p>
                    <p>Second, It is almost entirely free from side draft.</p>
                    <p>Third, It has its operator's stand on the rear of the platform, with an
                        arrangement of the platform which has a very convenient side delivery. Whole
                        fields of Grain can be cut without binding a single sheaf.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, The wheels are so high that the machine can be hauled on its own
                        wheels over almost any road that a wagon can travel upon.</p>
                    <p>Fifth, In the quality of material used in the manufacture of the machines,
                        which, necessarily, gives them a degree of strength and durability possessed
                        by no other machine now for sale in this country.</p>
                    <p>Sixth, It can be changed from Mowing to Reaping, without turning a screw, by
                        simply laying the platform on or off, as the kind of work to do may require;
                        and for cutting Clover s--- and placing it on heaps, at the same time, it
                        has no equal.</p>
                    <p>The above are all indispensable advantages to any good Machine, and they
                        should be clearly understood by every Farmer.</p>

                        have labored in the prosecution of the design resolved upon two years ago,
                        viz; "to make a thorough exploration of the County, and place a copy of
                        God's Word in every family."</p>

                        frequent rains and consequent badness of the roads, that object has not yet
                        been attained. It is expected soon to complete the work when, in our next
                        annual report, we will be able to give full and complete statistics. While
                        we find considerable destitution of the Scriptures in places remote from our
