<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--A public examination of the pupils of the Chambersburg Academy, Mr. J. K.
                        Shryock, Principal, commenced on Monday last, in the Academy Buildings, and
                        will continue until Wednesday. The friends of education and the public
                        generally have been invited to attend. There is no cause so deserving of our
                        attention as that of education, and no opportunity, of a character like
                        this, should be permitted to pass by without our bestowing on it by our
                        presence that encouragement its importance demands. We trust that this
                        examination may be well attended, and that our "future generation of citizen
                        kings" may feel that some persons, other than their teachers, take an
                        interest in their studies and progress in learning. We need hardly reiterate
                        a truth, so well know, that the school taught by Mr. Shryock, and his
                        talented associates, is about as perfect in every department as it is
                        possible to attain. A visit to this school, at this time, will not only be
                        an agreeable but a profitable spent hour, and will give us a better idea of
                        the advancement education is making among us than we could obtain in any
                        other way.</p>
                    <p>The Exhibition of the Music Class, in Franklin Hall, on Thursday evening,
                        will, we are assured, be a most delightful entertainment.--It is sufficient
                        to know that it is under the management of Mr. Shryock to predict for it a
                        complete success, both as regards the proficiency of the scholars and the
                        gratification their performance will afford the audience. The exhibition
                        will be gratuitous, but we hope some means will be adopted to prevent the
                        house from being filled with rowdy boys, who seem to attend such exhibitions
                        for no other purpose than to interrupt the performance with their unmannerly
                        clamor.</p>
