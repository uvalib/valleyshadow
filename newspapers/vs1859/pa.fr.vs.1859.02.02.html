<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We congratulate both Chambersburg and Mr. Reeves on the favorable prospects
                        of our Female Seminary, known to many as the Rosedale Seminary. We
                        congratulate the one on the prospect of having an essential want supplied,
                        and a flourishing institution, of a kind second in importance to none but
                        those sacred to worship, built up in our midst; and we congratulate the
                        other in the tokens of popular appreciation of which his school is the
                        recipient both in word and in deed. More than eighty pupils we understand,
                        are in daily attendance; but Mr. R. is determined that the sphere of
                        instruction should keep pace with the increase of pupils, and that
                        acceptable and thorough teachers shall be added from time to time, as
                        occasion demands. See advertisement in another column for proof of this.</p>
                    <p>We owe it to ourselves to sustain, unitedly, such an institution. If in the
                        several departments of female education our efforts are concentrated upon
                        something which promises to be a permanency, rather than upon that which
                        does not, our town will reap the advantage. Parents at a distance may wish a
                        safe and pleasant location for their daughters, with every needful facility
                        for their education, should not do better than commit them to the careful
                        management of Mr. Reeves and his lady. Their house, with its comfort,
                        friendliness, and Christian influence within, and attractive grounds
                        without, is just the place where young ladies should be happy and
                    studious.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Start.</p>
                    <p><br>About four weeks ago, Mr. James King one of our most public spirited
                        citizens, being impressed with the necessity of a well-organized Hook and
                        Ladder Company, to assist in the extinguishment of fires, drew up a paper
                        and solicited contributions from our community to purchase the necessary
                        Apparatus. At the same time a paper was put in circulation, the signers of
                        which "agreed to become members of a "Hook and Ladder Company, hereafter to
                        be organized." <br>The Progress. <br>In the course of a few days some $400
                        was obtained by superstition, and the names of forty of our most respectable
                        and active citizens as members. <br>First Meeting. <br>A meeting of the
                        persons who had signified their intention to become members of a Hook and
                        Ladder Company, convened at the Ticket Office of the Franklin Hall on the
                        31st of December, 1858. The meeting was organized by appointing Mr. James
                        King President. <br>Object of the Meeting. <br>Mr. King, on taking his
                        place as President, stated the object of the meeting. He made some
                        appropriate remarks on the necessity for the formation of a Hook and Ladder
                        Company, and the great utility to be derived from a well regulated
                        organization of the kind in times of fire, to preserve the property of our
                        fellow citizens from the ravages of that destructive element which has been
                        so fearfully rife among us of late. He also made a statement of the amount
                        of money subscribed for the purpose of purchasing Apparatus. <br>Election
                        of Officers. <br>An organization being effected, an election for permanent
                        officers was then held, which resulted as follows;--President, Mr. Jas.
                        King; Vice President, Dr. James Hamilton; Secretary, Dr. W. H. Boyle;
                        Treasurer, j. S. Nixon. <br>Committee to Purchase Apparatus. <br>The
                        meeting appointed Messrs. J. P. Culbertson, P. B. Housum and James King, a
                        Committee, invested with full power to purchase or have constructed,
                        whichever might be found most economical and expeditious, the appropriate
                        Apparatus for a Hook and Ladder Company. <br>Letter from Capt. John
                        Jeffries. <br>This gentleman, formerly of this place, but now a resident of
                        Philadelphia, was written to on the subject; he promptly replied, to the
                        effect that there was an Apparatus for sale in that city, consisting of a
                        Truck, Fire Hooks, Ladders, Axes, and other necessary appendages, which
                        could be purchased at a moderate price, as the company owning it was going
                        out of service, and urged upon the Committee to visit the city immediately,
                        and secure it by purchase. <br>Committee Visits Philadelphia. <br>On the
                        5th of January, the day after receiving Capt. Jeffries' letter, the
                        Committee visited Philadelphia, and on the 6th purchased the "PROTECTION"
                        apparatus of that city, together with the equipments of the members of the
                        Company. The Apparatus and equipments cost $370, without including the
                        expenses of the Committee. <br>Presentations. <br>The President of the
                        "PROTECTION HOOK AND LADDER COMPANY" of Philadelphia, presented the Chief
                        Director's Horn of that Company to Mr. James King. Capt. John Jeffries also
                        procured from the Company their beautiful Banner, which he has presented to
                        the Hook and Ladder Company of Chambersburg. <br>Generosity of the Town
                        Council. <br>The Town Council have exhibited a degree of generosity quite
                        commendable, in granting all resouable demands made on them by the Hook and
                        Ladder Company. They have erected a suitable building for a Track House out
                        of a part of the eastern wing of the Market House, and given the use of the
                        Hall on the second floor of the Market House for a meeting room for the
                        Company. <br>Liberality of the Railroad Companies. <br>The very efficient
                        and gentlemanly Superintendent of the Cumberland Valley Railroad Company,
                        Mr. O. N. Lull, on an application being granted to him, granted the use of
                        two cars, and permission to transport the Apparatus over the road, free of
                        all charge. The Lebanon Valley Railroad Company, in a like spirit of
                        generosity, passed the cars with the Apparatus gratuitously, over their very
                        excellent road. <br>Second Meeting. <br>A meeting of the Company was held
                        at their Hall, at the Market House, on Friday night last. The Constitution
                        and By Laws for the government of the Company were adopted, . . . [text

                        day. <br>Arrival of the Apparatus. <br>On Saturday, at 3 o'clock, P. M.,
                        the Apparatus, loaded on two double freight cars, arrived at the Depot, in
                        charge of Mr. P. B. Housum, who had accompanied it through from
                        Philadelphia. Messrs. Wm. Carlisle, Geo. W. Welsh, J. P. Culbertson, F. S.
                        Stumbaugh, D. A. Wertz and John H. Reed, had been appointed a Committee of
                        reception to meet Mr. Housum at Shippensburg, and returned with the
                        Apparatus to town. <br>Scene at the Depot. <br>In anticipation of the
                        arrival of the train, with the Apparatus, an immense crowd had assembled at
                        the Railroad station.--Men, Women and Children--the latter in the usual
                        preponderance, as regards numbers, for which our town is so much
                        noted--exhibited the wildest enthusiasm and sent up shouts of welcome in
                        deafening huzzas. <br>Appearance of the Apparatus. <br>The apparatus
                        consists of a Truck forty six feet in length, substantially built, elegantly
                        constructed and tastefully painted. On this is mounted five Ladders, six
                        Fire Hooks, two Axes, two Picks and five Lanterns. The front lantern is a
                        large and beautiful transparency of stained glass of different colors. The
                        word "Protection" is engraved in large letters, on a brass plate, which
                        encircles the top of the machine. The whole apparatus presents a handsome
                        appearance and attracted much admiration. <br>The Procession. <br>A
                        procession composed of the members of the "Hope" and "Friendship" Engine
                        Companies, together with the members of the "Protection" Hook and Ladder
                        Company, was formed under the Marshalship of Capt. Matthew Gillan and
                        Assistants Char. T. Campbell and Thos. H. Seibert. The procession being
                        arranged in proper order marched to the Depot where the Engine Companies
                        took charge of the apparatus, and paraded through the principal street of
                        our town, headed by the "Mechanics' Brass Band," discoursing delightful
                        music.The parade passed off without an unpleasant occurrence and was in
                        every respect a highly gratifying spectacle. <br>The Presentation.
                        <br>After passing over the route the Procession was marched to a stand
                        erected in front of the Court House, where a beautiful silver mounted Horn
                        was presented to the Hook and Ladder Company by its President, Mr. James
                        King. The presentation speech was made by F. S. Stumbaugh, Esq. It was done
                        in an off hand, easy and familiar style appropriate to the occasion, and
                        highly relished by all who had the pleasure of hearing it. The Horn was
                        received, in behalf of the company, by Dr. W. H. Doyle, who thanked the
                        generous donor for the beautiful and appropriate gift, and expressed his
                        gratitude to the members of the "Hope" and "Friendship" for the respectful
                        and honorable reception they had that day given to the "Protection." The
                        Horn is constructed of brass heavily mounted with silver. On a large silver
                        plate, on one side, is engraved: "Presented by James King to the Protection
                        Hook and Ladder Company." <br>Housing the Apparatus. <br>The ceremony of
                        presenting the Horn being concluded the Procession was reformed and marched
                        to the Truck House where the Apparatus was housed in splendid style, amid
                        the hearty cheers of the Firemen, and shouts of applause from a dense mass
                        of spectators, who had collected to witness the last ceremony of this
                        exciting and gratifying occasion. <br>Conclusion. <br>The companies
                        assembled on this interesting occasion now separated and returned to their
                        respective quarters, delighted with the proceedings of the day, and
                        entertaining sentiments of good will and esteem for each other, with a
                        "HOPE" for "PROTECTION" of "FRIENDSHIP" among the Firemen. <br>Card of
                        Thanks. <br>At a meeting of the "Protection Hook and Ladder Company," held
                        at their Hall, on Monday evening, January 31 1859, the following preamble

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--On Sunday night at about 7 1/2 o'clock, the stable of Judge Black, owned by
                        Judge Oyster, situated on the alley west of Main street, and between Market
                        and Queen streets, was set on fire by the scoundrels who seem determined to
                        get themselves into the Penitentiary. The building was in flames before
                        being discovered, and the fire could not be subdued until it had completed
                        its work of destruction. Our firemen repaired to the spot with great
                        promptitude, and worked with determined energy and activity in saving the
                        surrounding premises. The Hook and Ladder Company were speedily on the
                        ground with their Apparatus, and it is conceded on all parts that good
                        service was performed by them. The frame buildings in the rear of the
                        stable, which were on fire, were quickly pulled down by them, and by this
                        means the fire was prevented from spreading. Our Engine Companies are also
                        deserving of all praise for the faithful manner in which they performed
                        their duties.</p>
