                    <p>--The managers of the Public Library and Reading Room expect to open to the
                        Public on the First of September. They have a convenient room in the Mansion
                        House, and have selected a large and valuable library. It is to be hoped
                        that this Enterprise will be sustained by our citizens. So far it has been
                        the work of but a few enterprising persons. There are many in our midst

<b>Paris Fashions for August</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Light summer toilets engross all the attention, and there is a great run of
                        white, by far the prettiest wear for this melting period of the year. What,
                        for instance, is cooler or more harmonious than a white robe.</p>
                    <p>A fashionable costume consists of three distinct parts--dress, fichu, and
                        mantle-- all of which can be worn together or separately. The skirt is of
                        white muslin, and there are two flounces and two large bouillons, and two
                        flounces and two bouillons again. In the hem of the flounces is a blue,
                        pink, or green rib and and a much wider one is run underneath the bouillons.
                        The corsage is low, lined with silk the color of the riband, and a petticoat
                        of the same silk is worn with the skirt. The sleeves, reaching to the middle
                        of the arm, have two flounces and four bouillons, carried nearly up to the
                        shoulder. At the waist is also a riband, fastening either in front or
                        behind, and, if the dress is preferred high, the shoulders can be covered
                        with a fichu composed of flounces and bouillons, and drawn at the throat
                        with riband. For outdoors this toilet is completed by a mantle trimmed to
                        match the skirt and . . . [text missing] . . . length and voluminousness of
                        this mantle that distinguishes it from all that have been worn hitherto, and
                        it is patronised by those ladies who are always on the watch for new and
                        striking changes.</p>
                    <p>For morning wear there is nothing equal to clear muslin, colored or figured,
                        made with loose jacket or full bodice; either the body or jacket is fastened
                        in front by bows of muslin, the edges of which are rounded and edged with a
                        guipure.</p>
                    <p>Fashion in bonnets is nearly at a stand still, and our artists, for the time
                        being, have ceased racking their brains for novelties. The newest thing we
                        can mention is a bonnet made of fine black hair, embroidered with buttercups
                        in silken straw. The riband used in trimming has a black ground, and the
                        flowers at the side entirely black with jet centres. The effect of the
                        combination is very original, and it has the advantage of defying dust.</p>
                    <p>The heat is too great for caps to be worn in the house, and their place is
                        prettily supplied by resilles of silk lace. A wide riband goes all round and
                        terminates in a bow on one side; but, in order to render this coiffure
                        perfectly graceful it should have something like a light hood at the back.
                        If the resille is made of gold or silver thread, it can be worn in the ball
                        room by young girls, and Spanish acorns, finely worked, serve to complete
                        it. Fair women can wear the hood of the black lace, which keeps its
                        freshness and is not oppressively hot. Elderly ladies can line them with
                        thin silk, and those who have plenty of hair have only to put a flower on
                        one side, and they are at once in possession of a charming coiffure.</p>
