<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--The First Annual Exhibition of the Farmers and Mechanics Industrial
                        Association, of this county, closed on Friday last. The Exhibition was in
                        every way successful. The display of live stock, which was generally from
                        our own county, composed some of the finest ever placed on exhibition. The
                        superiority of the stock was the general subject of remark by all visitors.
                        We regret that we cannot particularize and give proper credit to our Farmers
                        for the very fine specimens of their stock entered. by an arrangement of the
                        Managers, the names of the exhibitors were not allowed to be attached to the
                        articles on exhibition. There may be some good reason for this regulation,
                        but we cannot perceive it. If it is intended to keep the judges in the dark
                        that no favoritism may be shown in awarding premiums, it is but a poor
                        compliment to the honesty of the judges, while it does not accomplish the
                        purpose intended. Exhibitors generally made it a point to be on hand and
                        show off their portion of their stock, or explain the operation of their
                        machinery, when the judges go around, and thus they become pretty well
                        booked up as to who are the exhibitors. This regulation has certainly an
                        injurious tendency, and if persisted in must be a great drawback on future
                        exhibitions. As a general thing exhibitors do not enter articles merely with
                        a view of obtaining the premium. A little pride in their stock or products,
                        or as an advertisement for their wares, is the incentive. If this is taken
                        away visitors as well as exhibitors, will hereafter take but little interest
                        in our Fairs.</p>
                    <p>The articles exhibited in every department were of a very superior order, and
                        gave the highest degree of satisfaction to all visitors. The display of
                        Flowers, Vegetables and Farm products were very extensive, and for quality
                        would have competed with any offered in the State.</p>
                    <p>In the department of Household Articles the display was very creditable to
                        the taste and skill of our ladies.</p>
                    <p>The variety of Farming implements and machinery was very large and the
                        articles generally of superior workmanship, and well adapted to the uses for
                        which they were constructed.</p>
                    <p>We must refer our readers to the List of Premiums awarded for particular
                        information as respects the superiority of articles and the names of the
                        exhibitors.</p>
