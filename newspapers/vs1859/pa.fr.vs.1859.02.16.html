<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"Some of the blatant Opposition and falsehearted Democratic presses of the
                        country are tickling their readers by propounding the above interrogatory.
                        Children are said to be pleased with a straw, even, and so we suppose we
                        ought not to deprive the Opposition of the meagre crumbs of comfort afforded
                        them in this innocent pastime. They will find out when the ballot boxes are
                        closed in 1860, that there is a Democratic party
                        among us, and a successful one, too. The glorious past history of this
                        country is but a record of the triumphs of the Democratic party. It has
                        already controlled the Government of the United States three fourths of the
                        time during its existence, and we venture the prediction that it will
                        continue to do so.-- Surviving the ignominy heaped upon it by incompetent
                        and designing men-- outliving the assaults of open enemies and secret
                        foes--the Democratic party will in 1860 take the field under the banner of
                        its time honored principles, and, despite the howlings of its adversaries,
                        it will again achieve victory."</p>

                        House was discovered to be on fire, and so rapidly did the flames spread
                        that everything contained in it, except two colts, was consumed. Eight farm
                        horses, seventeen head of fat cattle and cows, about one hundred and fifty
