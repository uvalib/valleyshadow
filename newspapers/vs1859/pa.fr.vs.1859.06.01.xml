                    <p>--This institution for the intellectual culture and moral training of our
                        young men is now, we are highly gratified to learn, being pushed forward
                        with an energetic and praiseworthy spirit. An organization, under the most
                        favorable auspices, has been effected--the necessary officers elected--a
                        suitable room fitted up, and a number of valuable books already purchased.
                        Hon: <emph rend="italic">Geo. Chambers</emph> was elected to the office of
                        President. The selection of this gentleman for the head of the Association
                        will give it a character for respectability, and intelligent management,
                        which will impart a fresh impetus to the movement and insure its complete
                        success. We would earnestly commend this institution to public favor, and
                        ask for it a degree of patronage to establish it upon a broad and permanent
                        basis which the importance of the objects in view demand. It is good
                        economy, <emph rend="italic">in a pecuniary point of view</emph>, to furnish
                        all necessary facilities for the intellectual culture and moral training of
                        youth. As a matter of "dollars and cents," it is a great deal cheaper to
                            <emph rend="italic">prevent</emph> vice than to <emph rend="italic"
                            >punish</emph> its victims. The community are forced to pay burdensome
                        taxes for the support of prisons, alms houses, and for the expensive process
                        of apprehending and convicting the perpetrators of crime. Is it not wiser
                        and cheaper, by liberal, voluntary contributions, to throw around the young
                        these wholesome restraints which will prevent them from becoming pests to
                        society!</p>
                    <p>But this, we admit, is a narrow and somewhat mercenary view of the subject.
                        We suggest it simply to expose the folly and the selfishness of those who
                            <emph rend="italic">begrudge</emph> a sixpence employed in efforts to
                        enlighten and restrain those who are exposed to the contaminations of vice.
                        We would be glad to convince <emph rend="italic">them</emph> that they are
                        "penny wise and pound foolish" in niggardly refusing to co-operate with
                        their neighbors in laudable efforts to prevent pauperism and crime, rowdyism
                        and riots, by those means which are designed and adopted to this end. Of the
                        higher and nobler objects secured by intellectual culture and right moral
                        training, we have not space at the present time to enlarge. They will be
                        readily suggested to every enlightened, reflecting mind. They are such as
                        these: Honesty and integrity in business, peace and happiness in social and
                        domestic life, good citizenship, obedience to law, regard and reverence to
                        divine authority, a useful life, peaceful death, and the glorious reward
                        that awaits the good.</p>
                    <p>Our esteemed friend, Wm. Seibert, Sr., who, in this, as in all other
                        enterprises, tending to the public good, has taken a deep interest and an
                        active part, procured last week of Mr. James piper, of Fayetteville, three
                        ancient volumes as a contribution to the shelves of the Library. This was a
                        very considerate, liberal, and praise-worthy act, on the part of Mr. Piper,
                        for which the Association, as well as the community in general, owe him a
                        debt of gratitude. We trust that many others possessing a similar spirit of
                        generosity towards the promotion of so laudable an object may be found in
                        our country. The volumes donated by Mr. Piper are on Law and Theology, and
                        the oldest of them dates back one hundred and ninety one years. The Student
                        of "Common Ley," fond of delving in musty records, or the Theological
                        Bookworm, may find something in them to interest, and perhaps, instruct; but
                        for ourselves we own up that we are not sufficiently skilled in the Old Fogy
                        language of that day to make much out of them. The little that we have been
                        scanning them over has given us rather a queer notion of their venerable
                        authors--they seem to have entertained about as favorable opinion of their
                        "Enlightenment," "Progress" and "Manifest Destiny" as we of the Nineteenth
                        Century boast of. Just hear them gas:--</p>
                    <p>"<emph rend="italic">WE live not now in the times of ignorance and darkness
                            wherein mens credulity is easily abused. Our age is an enlightened one,
                            and its notices are clear and penetrant and we should soon see the
                            downfal of several ancient Errors, were the not supported by the
                            affinity which they have with mens temporal interests. God will break
                            off this alliance when it shall seem good in his sight, but it is our
                            duty to keep firm in his truth and prefer they honor we receive from it,
                            above all the advantages of the earth, and beseech him that he would
                            reconcile those to it by his Grace, who are far from it, that all of us
                            may have but one heart to fear him, and one and the same mouth to
                            glorify him</emph>."</p>

                    <p>--On the 26th inst., a man, very gentlemanly in appearance, called at the
                        residence of the Rev. Samuel Huber, at Rocky Spring, a few miles from this
                        place, and desired to remain over night. The stranger complained of being
                        unwell, and Mr. Huber, with the hospitality for which he and his family are
                        so proverbial, agreed at once to keep him and extended every comfort his
                        case seemed to require. The next morning the stranger was so unwell as to be
                        unable to leave, and Mr. Huber proposed, and insisted, on sending for a
                        Physician, but the sick man obstinately refused to allow him to do so,
                        saying he would "Doctor himself." On the following day he died, and on
                        examining his effects one hundred and thirty seven dollars, in silver coin,
                        were found about him. Mr. Huber could not distinctly recollect the name he
                        gave, but understood him to say that he was formerly from New York, but at
                        the present time had an office in Carlisle. Mr. Huber had him decently
                        buried, took charge of the money, and brought it to Bank to deposit until
                        the relatives of the man could be found. The Bank officers on examining the
                        money discovered a counterfeit half dollar among it. This coin they at once
                        recognized as having been offered in Bank before, and it brought to their
                        recollection the circumstance of a gentleman calling at the bank but a few
                        weeks previous, to deposit Two hundred dollars in silver, among which was
                        this counterfeit coin, and which they threw out. The money was received on
                        deposit and the gentleman gave the name of <emph rend="italic">P. C.
                        Carder</emph>. This was doubtless the same man who subsequently died at Mr.
                        Hubers. Mr. Huber then sent one of his sons to Carlisle to make some inquiry
                        about him. After considerable search he learned that a man answering the
                        description, occupied a room in an obscure house on the outskirts of the
                        town. This room was visited and found in a most disgustingly filthy
                        condition.--A heap of dirty rags, intended for a bed, an old desk, a broken
                        chair and a pistol comprised the sum total of its furniture. No information
                        could be obtained to throw much light on the history of the man, his
                        business, or family connection. The money--three hundred and thirty seven
                        dollars--will remain in the bank of Chambersburg until his relatives, if
                        any, come forward and make good their claim.</p>

                    <p>--The ceremony of presenting a handsome and costly Stand of Colors to the
                        "Chambers Artillery," by the Hon. Geo. Chambers, took place on Tuesday
                        forenoon, in front of the residence of that gentlemen. The generous donor,
                        on presenting the Colors, made an eloquent address in which he related many
                        incidents in the early struggles against the Indians by the first settlers
                        on the banks of the Conococheague, and in which Col. Benj. Chambers took an
                        active and daring part. He highly complimented the company, and expressed
                        his deep sense of gratitude for the compliment bestowed in naming the
                        company after his honored ancester, the founder of our prosperous and
                        beautiful town. The present was received on behalf of the company by Col. F.
                        S. Stumbaugh, who made a brief, but appropriate address, in which he
                        alluded, in a most happy manner, to the important services which Col.
                        Benjamin Chambers had rendered in our border warfare, and hoped that his
                        example would have the effect to stimulate the company, named after him, to
                        emulate his noble deeds when their services are required to protect their
                        homes or the honor of their country. The speakers were listened to with
                        marked attention and their addresses elicited the admiration of the large
                        crowd assembled to witness the interesting ceremony. The whole affair was
                        conducted in an admirable manner and passed off very pleasantly, reflecting
                        much credit on all engaged in getting it up.</p>
