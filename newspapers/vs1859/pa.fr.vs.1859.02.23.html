<b>Who Are the Friends of "Freedom?"</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article complains about the hypocrisy of Republican and Know-Nothing
                    so-called advocates of freedom, who oppose the admission of states with
                    Democratic proclivities. The issue was brought to a head by the admission of
                    Oregon. Article complains about the New York Times and New York Tribune.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The "freedom" shriekers in Congress have demonstrated their hypocrisy lately
                        in the most glaring manner. The vote of the Black Republicans and their
                        anti- American allies of the Know Nothing party, upon the Oregon question,
                        shows in the clearest possible light the professions of friendship for
                        "freedom" and "popular sovereignty." Oregon is a free State, and there is
                        not the remotest possibility that it will ever be changed in that respect.
                        The Constitution is republican in form, there is more than the requisite
                        population, and the only possible excuses these croakers in Congress can
                        possibly have had for voting against her admission as a State, are, the
                        niggers are not recognized as the equals of an infinitely superior race, and
                        there is there and overwhelming Democratic majority; so these "traitors to
                        freedom," these "dough faces of the first water," voted almost to a man
                        against the bill. They were entirely willing to place their names upon the
                        Congressional record as enemies to the admission of any more "free" States
                        with Democratic proclivities. Only fifteen Republican members voted in favor
                        of "freedom" and seventy three voted against it. We hope this fact will be
                        carefully remembered.</p>
                    <p>The leading negro advocate in the United States, the New York Tribune, openly justifies the vote given by these
                        "freedom" champions. That paper says:</p>
                    <p>"We hold that the great body of the Republicans voted just right on this
                        question, and of course that the fifteen who separated from, opposed and
                        defeated them, did a grievous wrong."</p>
                    <p>So, then, it is "a grievous wrong" to vote for the admission of a "free
                        State" into this glorious confederacy, in the judgment of the sectional
                        fanatics who control the columns of that unscrupulous and malignant partisan
                        paper. The New York Times makes the following
                        admission:</p>
                    <p>Oregon is a free State--her Constitution prohibiting slavery--and she will
                        unquestionably always remain so."</p>
                    <p>Yet the Times opposes her admission, as well as
                        its Black Republican rival, the Tribune. Oregon
                        is a Democratic State, and is likely to remain so; white men are there
                        acknowledged to be superior to negroes--which are quite sufficient reasons
                        for the hypocritical Abolitionists objecting to her being allowed to enter
                        the great family of republican sovereignties.</p>
                    <p>The Black Republican journals admit that the votes of the two Senators from
                        Oregon settle the political complexion of the United States Senate, for the
                        next six years. It will be Democratic beyond all peradventure. The admission
                        of Oregon will give us three more votes at the next Presidential election.
                        To be sure they will not be needed, but they will be not the less welcome on
                        that account.</p>
                    <p>Our readers will not fail to bear in mind how faithful to the cause of
                        "freedom" the Republicans in Congress have shown themselves--Philad'a Argus.</p>
