<b>Look Out for a Carpet Bag Exodus</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Wilmington Star predicted that the carpet-baggers in Virginia will soon
                    leave the State, sarcastically saying they may pursue jobs in Texas or
                    Mississippi.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Wilmington (N.C.) Star calls attention to the fact that the
                        carpet-baggers in Virginia are packing up preparatory to a raid on
                        Mississippi, Texas, or some other place where they can make their salt. But
                        it don't take a carpet-bagger long to pack up. His wardrobe consists of one
                        shirt, marked "John Smith," one pair pants, one pea-jacket, one old hat, one
                        second-hand tooth-brush, one dozen Sumner's speeches, and one hundred copies
                        Ritual Union League. Carpet-baggers never wear drawers nor socks. This is an
                        infallible method of distinguishing them from white folks.</p>
                    <p>What the "miserable vermin" who have so long infested Virginia will now do we
                        cannot imagine. Possibly, they may get a job in Mississippi or Texas. We
                        have no room for them, says the Star, in North Carolina. All the offices are
                        already filled, and when a vacancy occurs, a carpet-bagger stands no chance
                        whatever for the place.</p>
                    <p>The Star begs its Virginia friends to keep a sharp look out after their
                        spoons until the carpet-bag exodus is completed. It says the "vermin" will
                        all want some "relics;" and they will find spoons very convenient for
                        stowing away in their carpet bags.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Claimed that the Radicals, even after the election is over, continue to lie
                    to the Freedmen by telling them that they will be returned to slavery.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals have not ceased to lie, even since the election, to the more
                        ignorant colored men. For some days they had a number very uneasy, by
                        telling them that they would be put back into slavery, and that all who
                        voted for Walker, would be sent to work on public works at Washington. We
                        cannot imagine what they expect to gain by such stories now, and presume it
                        is but the old habit strong in death. -- Lying has become chronic.</p>
