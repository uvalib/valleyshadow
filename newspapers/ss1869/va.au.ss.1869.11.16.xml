                    <p>All the signs, says the <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph>, point to the
                        speedy restoration of Virginia to the Union. The howl of the unrepentant,
                        but well threshed Wells "rebels" in this State have sunk into almost
                        inaudible whispers, and the current of "true Republican" sentiment is
                        drifting the State steadily back to her ancient moorings. Certain
                        inquisitive gentlemen, who have lately "interviewed" the President, report
                        that the clamors of the Radical "rebels" who "protested" so loudly during
                        the late session of the Legislature, have excited no more attention at
                        Washington than they did here, and that every friend of Grant is anxious to
                        crown the first year of his administration by the restoration of all the
                        Southern States.</p>
                    <p>We may hope, therefore, for the speedy reassemblage of the Legislature, and
                        the commencement of the work of State reconstruction. And when this labor
                        commences the Legislature of Virginia will become of far greater interest to
                        us than Congress.</p>
                    <p>The whole of our organic law must be vitalized by statutory enactments, and
                        so enforced as to make it as little oppressive as possible to all classes.
                        We believe that the Conservative majority in the Legislature will deal with
                        especial tenderness and fairness with the colored portion of our people, and
                        demonstrate the truth of the often repeated declaration that the native
                        white men of Virginia are the best friends of their late slaves. We venture
                        the prediction that the future legislation of Virginia for the protection,
                        education and advancement of the welfare of the blacks will be a model
                        worthy of general imitation. It will so far, in liberality and wisdom,
                        surpass all that the abolition States have done for the negro that our
                        traducers will blush for their calumnies.</p>
                    <p>We have long entertained the opinion that the complete demolition of the
                        carpet-baggers was indispensable to the inauguration of an era of good
                        feelings between the races in this State, and the information which has
                        reached us from all sections of the State confirms this opinion. Since the
                        utter rout of Wells demonstrated the ability of the whites to defeat all the
                        base conspiracies having for their object the political deposement of the
                        white race, the carpet-baggers have had little or no inducement to prosecute
                        with vigor their nefarious work of poisoning the mind of the negroes. It has
                        no longer paid to demoralize and deceive the freedmen, and, therefore, they
                        have, to a great extent, suspended their operations. Cuffee no longer hears
                        his old friends defamed and <sic>villified</sic> as he did for months before
                        the election.</p>
                    <p>Lying is not a sufficient luxury for a carpet-bagger to skulk through the
                        State from league to league, indulging in that sort of special preparation
                        for Hades. Hence cordial relations are again springing up between the native
                        white and the black races; and the land owners have abandoned all thought of
                        punishing the poor negroes for that "rebellion against Grant" into which
                        they were led by the carpet-baggers.</p>
                    <p>Now all this is precisely as it should be, and we trust that in all their
                        dealings with the negroes our people will visit upon them none of the sins
                        of those who led them astray. The curse of the carpet-bagger will not
                        afflict us much longer, for there will soon be a general exodus of the whole
                        flock of harpies. For a few months there will be a general flight and
                        flutter over the shreds which still cling to the carcass of bankruptcy -- a
                        fierce battle for the scraps of the feast, and then in a flight of lean and
                        hungry adventurers to other fields of pillage.</p>
                    <p>The old State, thank Heaven, is blessed with a vast amount of recuperative
                        energy, and she will emerge from all her troubles somewhat worn and
                        battered, but with strength enough left yet to make her influence felt as a
                        mighty power in the Union.</p>

                <summary>The Enquirer predicted that Virginia will soon be restored to the Union.
                    Hoped for the speedy reassemblage of the Legislature, and claimed that the State
                    will provide for the Freedmen far better than the Northern States. Also reported
                    that the carpet-baggers are leaving the State, and that this will help Virginia
                    improve her situation.</summary>

                    <p>"STONEWALL BAND." -- We are pleased to announce that this band has been
                        re-organized once more, with a fair prospect of success. At a meeting held
                        in the jury room, at the Court-house, on last Thursday night, a constitution
                        and by-laws were adopted, and the following officers elected for the
                        government of the band: Prof. A. J. Turner, Leader; T. M. Turner, Assistant
                        Leader; S. M. Cushing, President, and Samuel C. Baskins, Secretary and
                        Treasurer. This Band was first organized in the year 1838, under the
                        leadership of its present talented Professor of music, and had a most
                        successful career until the close of the late war. It entered the service of
                        the Confederacy in 1862, and was in the army up to the surrender of Gen.
                        Lee's army at Appomattox. Since that time, they have had no efficient
                        organization. We hope they will be able, in a short time, to furnish our
                        citizens with a series of musical entertainments equal to those which they
                        used to give in their palmiest days, and that our citizens will show their
                        appreciation by giving them a most hearty support and encouragement.</p>

                    christianity centered, and society has, in her demise, lost an excellent member,
