<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Richmond Enquirer and Examiner says: The
                        withdrawal of Col. Withers was made on two grounds: first it was not
                        believed that he could be elected, and secondly, it was known that if
                        elected and the Constitution defeated, we should have but infuriated
                        Congress, and would be handled more roughly than even Alabama or
                        Mississippi; and that if elected and the modified constitution adopted, the
                        cry of a "rebel triumph" would be raised when we went before Congress, and
                        the constitution sharply overhauled by way of punishment. It was believed
                        that Congress is determined on two things: 1. To
                        put Virginia in the Union under the Underwood Constitution in some form, and
                        2. To bring her in under Republican auspices.
                        Either they would not have allowed Col. Withers to take his seat, or they
                        would have struck us a heavy blow by imposing some new and harsh conditions.
                        This was the meaning of the acceptance of the resignation of Col. Withers as
                        our candidate. It was felt that we were not free, and that it was idle to go
                        through the farce of summoning the people to win a barren victory.</p>
                    <p>The result is, we have two Northern men running for the Governorship of this
                        State. We shall certainly have one of them as our Governor. -- We are
                        ordered to choose between them. We cannot see how any principle is involved in preferring one to the other. We
                        preferred General Stoneman as our military governor to General Terry, and if
                        we had been invited to choose, the people of Virginia would have so
                        indicated. Had there been a prospect of Terry's returning here, they would
                        have been glad enough to have had a vote between him and Stoneman, or
                        between him and Schofield -- and nobody would have said there was anything
                        discreditable in making a choice. And what is the difference in the cases?
                        It is precisely the same case. We have got to
                        have a governor, who will have veto power on the acts of the Legislature,
                        who will nominate our Circuit and Appellate Judges, who will have great
                        power in connection with the school system, who may have much to do with
                        filling the county offices, and we have got to take one of these two men. It
                        is Walker with the white people at his back, or Wells with the negroes at
                        his back.</p>
                    <p>With Wells, we shall also have the negro Harris for Lieutenant Governor.
                        People may say they do not care, but they will
                        care. And we are urging this question on the idea that persons hold
                        off from Walker on the ground of "mad" or of "honor." If it is mere
                        sullenness, of course it is wrong, and right-minded men ought to abandon
                        such nonsense at once; if it is a sentiment of duty or honor, then we want
                        to know if a man of honor, or one governed by a sense of duty, can see any
                        honor or duty in permitting an enemy to the white people of this State, at
                        the head of 75,000 negroes, to take possession of the Gubernatorial Mansion,
                        along with a negro for his colleague as President of the Virginia Senate?
                        That's the question. Is this right -- if you set
                        up to be fonder of right than other people? Can you look the people of this
                        State in the face when by your act you shall have
                        contributed to this result? Can you thank God after you have done this,
                        "that you are not as other men?" No, the honor is
                        all the other way: honor and duty require you to protect this people, and
                        this poor Commonwealth. But you will say, you are not going to perform an
                        affirmative act in the premises -- that you are only going to hold off, and
                        have nothing to do with it. Your neighbor has just as much right to do this
                        as you, and if everybody's neighbors do the same thing, then will nobody be
                        responsible for the election of Wells?</p>

                    <p>We may avert many evils of fearful magnitude by prompt and united action now.
                        We can take the shackles off the thousands of our best citizens, who are now
                        disfranchised and disqualified for holding office. We can drive from our
                        borders the horde of hungry adventurers who are now gloating over the
                        prospect of living upon the public treasury, which they will take good care
                        to keep well filled by such taxation as we have never felt. We can secure
                        the Legislature, and this is more important and vital to our interest than
                        anything else.</p>
                    <p>Is not this enough to work for? Do we need any other stimulus to arouse us,
                        to put forth every exertion to secure a full registration and a full vote?
                        The struggle is one of life and death. It is no time to mince words. -- We
                        must work, and work vigorously, to save even a remnant of liberty.</p>
                    <p>We have decided upon our own course. We think that every consideration of
                        honor and duty requires us to labor with all our might to prevent the
                        infliction upon our long-oppressed Commonwealth of such evils as the
                        election of Wells and his negro lieutenant and the adoption of the unamended
                        Constitution. We can see no way to do this, but to vote for Colonel Gilbert
                        C. Walker, and voting in solid column against such obnoxious clauses as the
                        President is pledged to submit to a separate vote.</p>
                    <p>Bitterly opposed as we have been to the course of the twenty-eight and their
                        committee of nine, who have been so influential in bringing about the
                        circumstances which now surround us, we shall indulge in no idle vaporings.
                        We cannot afford to indulge in the luxury of ill-humor. The times are too
                        serious for that. -- We shall work as earnestly and cheerfully to carry out
                        the views of the Convention as if our own wishes had been met. It is true
                        that the Convention did not, in words, recommend Mr. Walker. Their silence
                        upon this subject was proper, for reasons obvious to all. We know very well
                        what they intended.</p>
                    <p>Let us fall into line, and organize for a fight against carpet-baggers and

                    <p>STAUNTON, MAY 10th, 1869.</p>
                    <p>
                        Fellow-Citizens of the County of Augusta:
                    </p>
                    <p>In obedience to the wishes of many friends residing in various portions of
                        the county, expressed both publicly and privately, I announce myself a
                        candidate for a seat in the next House of Delegates of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>If it should be the pleasure of the people to elect me to this position, I
                        shall, irrespective of party considerations, work and vote to obtain the
                        passage of such laws as will, in my judgment, secure the greatest amount of
                        peace, prosperity and happiness to the people at large.</p>
                    <p>In the approaching election, soon to be held, I shall most unhesitatingly
                        vote for the expurgated constitution and for what is known as the Walker
                        ticket; believing the adoption of this course by the people is the only door
                        of escape from the ultimate imposition on them of an odious, tyrannical and
                        unbearable government. And although the result of this line of conduct, in
                        any event, is not as we would like to have it, yet I am firmly persuaded,
                        that in our subjugated, hapless condition, the exigency of the hour, makes
                        it a high and patriotic duty to yield to the demands of inexorable
                        necessity, accept the situation, and reconstruct the State, upon the basis
                        of the expurgated Constitution and the election of such men as are opposed
                        to disfranchisements and test-oaths, and who are identified with us in
                        interest and sympathy.</p>
                    <p>This result, which is the best we can hope for, can certainly be achieved if
                        all will register and vote -- Virginia, if her sons are true to her, can be
                        placed under the control of Virginians, and the miserable carpet-bag scum
                        and vultures of the north, who have come down among us to array one race
                        against the other, in order that they may more easily prey upon the
                        substance and vitals of our helpless and prostrate people, can be sent back,
                        howling, to their old haunts of vice and depravity.</p>
                    <p>These salutary results will only be attained, however, as a distinguished
                        countyman said, in the late Conservative Convention, by united effort,
                        induced by mutual conciliation and forbearance one towards another.</p>
                    <p>Let us then obliterate from our minds all past political differences, leaving
                        the dead past to bury its dead, and unite in one great band of friends and
                        brothers, "among whom no contention shall exist, but that noble contention,
                        or rather emulation of who can best work and best agree" in saving Virginia
                        from degradation and ruin.</p>
                    <p>My devotion to Virginia has always been great, but since dark, heavy clouds
                        have lowered over her and broken with remorseless fury upon her devoted
                        head, I have drawn her closer and closer to my heart, until her destiny and
                        mine have become inseparably locked up together, and should it be the will
                        of the people to make me an humble instrument, I shall ever be grateful for
                        the confidence reposed.</p>
