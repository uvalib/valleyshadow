                    <p>The New York <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph>, as our readers know, has
                        been, with decided force and emphasis, demanding that Virginia be allowed to
                        proceed with the business of re-construction, without unnecessary delay,
                        according to the acts of Congress.</p>
                    <p>This movement from so influential a paper in the line of fairness and justice
                        has rather disgruntled the proscriptive Radicals in this State, and their
                        organ in this city has been remonstrating with the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Tribune.</emph> That paper concisely replies that the terms of
                        reconstruction are presented by Congress, not the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Tribune</emph>, and it asks the <emph rend="italic">Journal</emph> if
                        it is in favor of restoring the States according to those terms. "If yea,"
                        says the <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph>, "we are with it. If no, its
                        difference is with Congress, not with us."</p>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Journal</emph> replies that it is in favor of
                        restoring the State on those terms "whenever it can be done safely." Ah ha!
                        Exactly. That's Wells's strategy. That answer was always put to his purpose
                        in the "Committee of Reconstruction." He was the most liberal man in the
                        world; entirely opposed to proscription, and would be for relieving the
                        people of Virginia "whenever it is safe to do so." When would that time come
                        if left to him and his followers?</p>
                    <p>Yes, they agree with Congress, <emph rend="italic">with a
                        qualification</emph>. They would execute the law of Congress, and admit the
                        State "whenever it can be done safely!" What impudence! It is mere slang --
                        the "cant of sharpers." They suspend a law of Congress until it is in their
                        estimation safe to enforce it!" -- <emph rend="italic">Dispatch</emph></p>

                <summary>The Dispatch discussed the debate in New York newspapers over the
                    admittance of Virginia to the Union. Democratic papers asked for immediate
                    admittance, while the Radical papers supported readmittance "whenever it can be
                    done safely". The Dispatch claimed that the Radicals merely use this as an
                    excuse to delay admittance indefinitely.</summary>

                    <p>If the Northern people want the Fifteenth Amendment ratified let the
                        Washington authorities recognize the Virginia election at once, and have the
                        Legislature assembled. -- That Legislature will ratify the fifteenth
                        amendment the second day after it meets. -- <emph rend="italic">Rich.
                            Enquirer.</emph></p>
                    <p>But suppose the Northern people have changed their mind about the Fifteenth
                        Amendment, and now don't want it ratified. That would account for their
                        seeking to exclude the vote of Virginia. Our Legislature, if permitted to
                        assemble, will undoubtedly vote for the Amendment, but since the Chinese
                        have been threatening to come in like a flood, and especially since the
                        colored people at the South have found less radical than was expected,
                        Northern people seem to care less about securing universal suffrage,
                        &amp;c., &amp;c., in all the States.</p>

                <summary>The Spectator recommended that the Northern people allow Virginia's
                    legislature to assemble if they want the fifteenth amendment ratified. Once that
                    body assembled, it would immediately ratify the amendment.</summary>
