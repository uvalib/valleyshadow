                    a few days. "More than seventeen years ago, she came to this community to
                    complete her education, and many still here remember her as a sprightly and
                    beautiful girl. Comparatively few know what a character she developed as the
                    christian daughter, wife and mother. Fully employed at home she could not go
                    abroad or mingle in general society. Having been well taught in early life she
                    devoted herself with wonderful success to the instruction of her children, as
                    well as to the ordinary domestic duties. This many in her situation would have
                    thought enough for them to do; but not so with her. There were those around and
                    near her who were 'ignorant and out of the way,' and she labored, earnestly to
                    impart to them 'that knowledge which maketh wise unto salvation." She was 34
                    years old and leaves a husband and six children.<br>(Names in announcement:  Isabella Waddell,  Robert Hill,  Legh R. Waddell)</blockquote>
