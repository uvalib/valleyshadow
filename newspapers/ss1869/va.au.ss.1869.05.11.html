<b>The Currency</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor spoke out against the government's policy of sticking with paper
                    currency instead of going back to gold and silver, which he considers a much
                    sounder currency. Urged people to invest in property to protect themselves and

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>With the exception of the Confederate States and other revolutionary systems
                        no government ever had such a currency as now constitutes the circulating
                        medium of the United States. In all other governments, and in all former
                        periods of our own, gold and silver were the measures of value. When we had
                        paper of Banks, either United States, or State, it was redeemable in gold
                        and silver, and whenever a Bank, without authority of law, failed to redeem
                        its notes in gold and silver, it was discredited and forced into
                        liquidation. This obligation to redeem was a constant check on the issue of
                        paper. If a Bank issued too much, it was promptly sent home for redemption,
                        and thus the gold standard was constantly applied to measure the value of
                        the paper. As long as it was convertible into gold, it maintained its
                        circulation. As soon as it became depreciated, it would no longer perform
                        the functions of money.</p>
                    <p>But now the currency of the country does not even profess to rest on a specie
                        basis. It is not even nominally convertible at the pleasure of the holder
                        into gold and silver. There is, therefore, no fixed standard which can be
                        applied to test its value. The whole volume of currency rests on credit. The
                        U. S. Treasury notes have the faith of the government as the only pledge not
                        for their present, but future redemption.</p>
                    <p>The notes of the Banks rest on a similar foundation. The Banks buy bonds of
                        the U.S. and deposit them in the Treasury, and thereupon the government
                        furnishes 90 per cent of the amount of these bonds in Bank notes for
                        circulation. The U.S. Bonds deposited are the security for the redemption of
                        these notes.</p>
                    <p>It will thus be seen that the whole system of currency is a stupendous system
                        of credit.--There is no cash about it, and there are no means by which
                        either the government or the Banks can be made to redeem their paper in
                        gold.</p>
                    <p>As might have been foreseen, the currency is therefore as unstable and as
                        shaky as the foundation on which it rests. The credit of a government, like
                        that of individuals, depends on a thousand adventitious facts. If a farmer
                        raises good crops, and is temperate, industrious and frugal his credit
                        rises. If his crops fail--if he frequents bar-rooms and gambling saloons--if
                        he idles his time and engages in rash speculations his credit falls. So it
                        is with nations. If the government is wisely conducted--if the taxes are
                        light--business prosperous--expenditures small--debt moderate and relations
                        with other governments peaceful--its credit will be good. But on the other
                        hand, if business is paralyzed by unwise legislation--if the people are
                        over-taxed--if the public debt be onerous--the people discontented and the
                        foreign relations be unsatisfactory, the credit of the government must
                        decline.</p>
                    <p>A currency therefore which rests not on the solid basis of gold and silver,
                        but on the unstable foundation of credit must always be fluctuating in
                        value. Hence we have seen U.S. Currency ranging, when measured by the gold
                        standard from 120 to 280--in other words in one condition of the credit of
                        the country $100 in gold will buy $120 in greenbacks, while in another
                        condition of government credit it will buy $280. And so it must continue to
                        be. A wise and prudent course on the part of the government will increase
                        the value of greenbacks as compared with gold, while a rush and indiscreet
                        policy will diminish it. As an illustration of this fact we saw gold a few
                        weeks ago down to 131, and now in consequence of Sumner's and Chandler's
                        speeches in the Senate threatening war, and the prospect of trouble in
                        regard to Cuba, gold has gone up to 138 1/2--a jar in our foreign relations
                        will carry it up still higher, and a war with England or any other great
                        foreign power would carry gold to 200, or, stating the matter in another
                        form, the value of Treasury notes would be diminished one half.</p>
                    <p>Every blunder of the administration will more or less affect the currency,
                        because it impairs the confidence of capitalists in the solvency of the
                        government.</p>
                    <p>Seeing therefore that we have such an unstable currency, the practical
                        question arises what should people who have money (currency) do with it?</p>
                    <p>Our answer is, the best policy is to vest it in some substantial
                        property--real estate or personal property. Stocks and bonds partake of the
                        instability of currency for they rest on credit. Even individual bonds and
                        mortgages are not entirely secure because they may be paid off in
                        depreciated greenbacks.</p>
                    <p>Land and houses are permanent. No convulsion in politics or finance can
                        destroy them.  short of an earthquake can swallow them up.</p>
                    <p>[6 lines unclear] The West is now filled up. Lands there are no longer cheap.
                        Virginia presents the best field for investment, and her people no longer
                        manifest a desire to emigrate. The tide is now flowing into Virginia--not
                        out of her limits.</p>
                    <p>Another fact is worthy of consideration.--Thirty years ago, the government of
                        the U.S. (Mr. Woodberry being Secretary) took measures through our foreign
                        agents, to ascertain approximately the whole amount of silver and gold in
                        the different countries of the world.--The aggregate was then estimated at
                        one thousand millions. Since then the gold mines of California and the
                        Pacific slope and of Australia and other countries have been discovered and
                        developed, and the aggregate of gold coin is now not less than three
                        thousand millions, and increasing at the rate of several hundred millions
                        per annum. This large increase of the precious metals, even if there were no
                        paper currency, would necessarily enhance the value of lands rapidly. Such
                        must be the case, and our advice is to those who have money, to buy real
                        estate, and to those who have lands, to hold on to them.</p>

                    <p>It is now certain, says the Enquirer, that Virginia will go into the Union within twelve
                        months under the Underwood Constitution in some form. That is settled. It
                        does not matter whether it ought to be so or not. It does not matter whether
                        anybody is to blame for it or not. We say it is a fact.
                            Virginia will go into the Union in twelve months under the Underwood
                            Constitution in some form.</p>
                    <p>Now, what are we going to do? We can modify this instrument, or we can refuse
                        to modify it. We can strike out the test-oath, or we can let it stay. We can
                        enfranchise some 15,000 of our best people, or we can leave them
                        disfranchised. We can strike out the county organization article, or we can
                        let it remain.--We write of course on the hypothesis that the President will
                        give us a vote on these propositions.</p>
                    <p>Now we have got to live under this Constitution. We wish our readers to
                        confront the facts. We have got to live under it until it is changed. If the
                        people of Virginia are too indignant to ride to the polls and vote, we shall
                        live under it as it claim from the hands of the Underwood Convention. We
                        shall have about 98 per cent of the white population excluded from office
                        and, perhaps, the jury box. We shall have a large number of whites denied
                        the right of suffrage. We shall have our counties cut up into town-ships,
                        and ruled by negro officials.</p>
                    <p>We may get along if these clauses are taken out. All whites can then vote,
                        and we can control the State. All whites, excepting those who come under the
                        operation of the Constitutional Amendment, will be eligible to office.--We
                        shall have an opportunity to devise another system of county organization.</p>
                    <p>And this will have to be done by the Legislature. And, therefore, we are
                        brought at once to the necessity of securing the
                            Legislature.--We can do it, if we work. The Legislature will not
                        only organize the system of county administration, but it will organize the
                        militia, and legislate, perhaps, with regard to a system of public schools.
                        It will lay all the taxes. It will elect two Federal Senators. It will elect
                        some one hundred County Judges. It will, on the nomination of the Governor,
                        elect the Circuit Judges and the Judges of the Court of Appeals. We say on
                        the nomination of the Governor.</p>
                    <p>And, therefore, we must have as good a Governor
                            as we can get. The issue is narrowed down to
                        H.H. Wells and Gilbert C. Walker--which shall we take? We have got to
                        choose. Not to act, is to act. We cannot escape voting. In undertaking not to vote, we yield
                        the point--and accomplish the worst result by our own inaction. To be
                        passive is really to decide in favor of Wells. For if all the white votes
                        are merely silenced, Wells will be elected by seventy-five thousand
                        majority. Mr. Wells does not expect our votes; he only aspires to our
                        neutrality. Thus we cannot stand off from Walker without yielding the prize
                        to Wells. You may not like the reasoning, but you cannot escape it.</p>
                    <p>Now without going into Mr. Walker's claims at all--we are for anybody against Wells. He is the most odious man to
                        the white people of this State that has ever put his foot here--we think we
                        need not except Underwood. They loathe him, they hate him--and he loathes
                        us, and hates us. We are uncompromising and deadly enemies. He has
                        marshalled the negroes against us, and taught them to hate us. Walker has not marshalled the negroes against us.
                        But we are for anybody against Wells. We must
                        kill him at all hazards.</p>

                    <p>
                        Fellow-Citizens of the County of Augusta:
                    </p>
                    <p>In obedience to the wishes of many friends residing in various portions of
                        the County, expressed both publicly and privately, I announce myself a
                        candidate for a seat in the next House of Delegates of Virginia.</p>
                    <p>If it should be the pleasure of the people to elect me to this position, I
                        shall, irrespective of party considerations, work and vote to obtain the
                        passage of such laws as will, in my judgment, secure the greatest amount of
                        peace, prosperity and happiness to the people at large.</p>
                    <p>In the approaching election, soon to be held, I shall most unhesitatingly
                        vote for the expurgated constitution and for what is known as the Walker
                        ticket; believing the adoption of this course by the people is the only door
                        of escape from the ultimate imposition upon them of an odious, tyrannical
                        and unbearable government. And although the result of this line of conduct,
                        in any event, is not as we would like to have it, yet I am firmly persuaded
                        that in our subjugated, helpless condition, the exigency of the hour, makes
                        it a high and patriotic duty to yield to the demands of inexorable
                        necessity, accept the situation, and reconstruct the State upon the basis of
                        the expurgated Constitution and the election of such men as are opposed to
                        disfranchisements and test oaths, and who are identified with us in interest
                        and sympathy.</p>
                    <p>This result, which is the best we can hope for can certainly be achieved if
                        all will register and vote--Virginia, if her sons are true to her, can be
                        placed under the control of Virginians, and the miserable carpet-bag scum
                        and vultures of the north, who have come down among us to arrary
                        one race against the other, in order that they may more easliy
                        prey upon the substance and vitals of our helpless and prostrate people, can
                        be sent back, howling, to their old haunts of vice and depravity.</p>
                    <p>These salutary results will only be attained, however, as a distinguished
                        countyman said, in the late Conservative Convention, by united effort,
                        induced by mutual conciliation and forbearance one towards another.</p>
                    <p>Let us then obliterate from our minds all past political differences leaving
                        the dead past to bury its dead, and unite in one great band of friends and
                        brothers, "among whom no contention shall exist, but that noble contention,
                        or rather emulation of who can best work and best agree" in saving Virginia
                        from degradation and ruin.</p>
                    <p>My devotion to Virginia has always been great, but since dark, heavy clouds
                        have lowered over her and broken with remorseless fury upon her devoted
                        head, I have drawn her closer and closer to my heart, until her destiny and
                        mine have become inseparably locked up together, and should it be the will
                        of the people to make me an humble instrument to aid in restoring her to
                        peace and prosperity, I shall ever be grateful for the confidence reposed.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully,</p>
                    <p>ALEXANDER B. COCHRAN</p>
                    <p>Vindicator and Virginian will publish</p>
