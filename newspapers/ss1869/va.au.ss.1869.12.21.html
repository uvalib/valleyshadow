<b>The Grant Monument</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Dispatch objected to the construction of a monument to General Grant
                    made out of metal from captured Confederate cannons. Claimed that the monument
                    would maintain feelings of sectional strife.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To use no harsher term, the managers of the proposed equestrian Grant
                        Monument have been guilty of the folly of determining to mould it of cannon
                        captured from the South during the late war. As the Dispatch truly says, "the fact that it was moulded with that
                        material will be remembered as long as the state endures. It will be
                        considered a monument to triumph on one side and humiliation on the other,
                        and this indiscreet partisanry will have cast into enduring metal the
                        recollections which ought to be buried.</p>
                    <p>We do not object to the monument to General Grant. Nobody objects to that;
                        but we do object to the continuation of a policy which is calculated to
                        perpetuate the recollection of strife, and therefore the fostering of
                        sectional rancor in appropriations from money collected from taxes imposed
                        upon us equally with all the other citizens of the United States. It is an
                        unwise use of power, and cannot be productive of any good. The disposition
                        of the national funds for purposes of sectional self-complacency is a
                        barrier to intersectional good feeling, and a wrong. It is against the
                        avowed sentiments of General Grant, and he should regret it as much as we
                        do."</p>

<b>A Bitter Drop</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article from the Norfolk Virginian which criticized the actions of Mr.
                    Turner in offering further concessions to B. F. Butler. Insisted that this
                    action was unnecessary, since Butler has no impact on the question of the
                    readmission of Virginia to the Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The State of Virginia is soon to be admitted. The pressure of public opinion
                        in the country is too heavy for the extreme party in Congress, and they will
                        acquiesce as gracefully as they can in what they see is now inevitable. When
                        the State is restored, we trust that the most florid pictures which have
                        been painted for us may prove cold and tame compared with the reality; but,
                        even then, they will be shadowed by the special and peculiar humiliation
                        which has just been incurred by Mr. Turner and his colleagues.</p>
                    <p>We allude to the interview between these gentlemen and Mr. Butler. It was a
                        disgusting exhibition, and all the more to be lamented because gratuitous.
                        Butler has been denounced all over the civilized globe for his brutality. He
                        oppressed and outraged the people of the South, and in the State of Virginia
                        showed that he had respect neither for the rights of property, the tender
                        feelings of our women, nor the sacred calling of our divines. To the
                        timidity of a sheep he added the appetite of a hyena, and no possible amount
                        of diplomatic graces, diplomatic degradations would be a better phrase, can
                        ever make the people of the country forget the facts to which we allude, or
                        gild with a decent apology the humiliating attitude of the committee of
                        which we speak.</p>
                    <p>When the President penned his Message and committed himself to the admission
                        of the State in compliance with his pledges, there was no need for this
                        abasement, which was as unwise as it was unbecoming. For Butler found
                        himself powerless to carry out the programme of exclusion which he himself
                        so recently favored, and was too adroit to take issue with the President on
                        a question where defeat awaited him. Under these circumstances the call on
                        Mr. Butler was a gratuity, and the demand made by that person for new
                        guarantees is an insult to the men whom he addressed. There is a certain
                        pathetic rebuke to the great man (!) too, in the reply of Mr. Turner, when
                        he said that as they were sworn to execute the law they had not thought it
                        necessary to fortify their oaths by a new declaration; but, nevertheless
                        they gave the additional guarantee -- and gave it to Benjamin F. Butler! On
                        receiving this that person graciously assured the committee that the State
                        should be admitted, and condescended to say that he was always ready "to
                        accept the pledge of a Virginia gentleman."</p>
                    <p>Now, the committee has succeeded in two things at least. It has degraded
                        itself by petitioning Butler to let Virginia in, and has elevated him into a
                        position which he never could have occupied without this recognition of his
                        pre-eminence. The cup of restoration, we trust, may prove a draught from the
                        fountain of perpetual youth, but this is a bitter drop in it which the
                        people taste with infinite disgust, and an irritation all the more intense
                        because the infusion was entirely unnecessary.--Norfolk

<b>Virginia Not Yet Admitted</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reported that Virginia will not be admitted until after the Holiday recess
                    of Congress. Blamed the actions of men like B. F. Butler for stalling
                    readmission against the legitimate wishes of Virginia and the Reconstruction
                    Committee.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is now very evident that Virginia will not be admitted till after the
                        Holiday recess of Congress. From the special telegram to the Richmond Dispatch we learn that the Reconstruction Committee
                        met at noon on Saturday last. There was barely a quorum present. The various
                        documents ordered by the House to be printed for the committee were laid on
                        the members' desks. Congressman-elect Porter and several other advocates of
                        the test-oath, &amp;c., were present. Wm. B. Downey made an extended
                        statement of the anti-republican manner in which civil justice had been
                        administered in Virginia. This was followed by a similar statement by
                        several others.</p>
                    <p>In reply, Isaac D. Budd, a Republican member of the Legislature from Loudon
                        county, made an able speech controverting many of the statements of those
                        opposed to admission. He declared that so far as Loudon county was
                        concerned, civil justice had been administered fairly, and that the
                        elections were free, quiet, and fairly carried out, and that he believed it
                        was equally so in the case of the entire State.</p>
                    <p>After the room was cleared, the committee remained in session for some time,
                        but came to no final action.</p>
                    <p>It is now claimed by the extreme Radicals that Butler is with them, and that
                        the State will not be admitted without requiring the Legislature to take the
                        test-oath.</p>
                    <p>Representative Farnsworth left the committee room before the adjournment. He
                        has openly avowed his views in favor of admitting the State at once, and is
                        accordingly much denounced by those who are opposed to his views.</p>
                    <p>General Butler has received several letters, in which it is stated that the
                        legislative committee are playing him false. One of those letters professes
                        to detail a conversation that recently took place between members of the
                        committee and ex-rebel officers on board the steamer en
                            route for Aquia Creek. It alleges that sport was made of Butler's
                        name, and that his promises were not considered genuine, &amp;c. The
                        opposition to the admission of the State are making a terrible fight, and it
                        is now conceded that nothing will be done before January in the way of
                        admitting the State.</p>
