                    <p>One would suppose that the most ardent admirer of radical reconstruction,
                        would find in the experience of those Southern States which have passed the
                        magic ordeal, such "food for thought" as would at least suggest a doubt as
                        to the reality of those blessings so commonly regarded as inseparable from
                        that condition. Those beatific visions of happiness and prosperity which the
                        "truly loyal" so rapturously describe, might be regarded as "mere figments
                        of the brain" if contrasted with the horrors daily occurring in those
                        communities which are now the blessed recipients of Congressional
                        legislation.</p>
                    <p>Without pausing to portray the delectable condition of Brownlow's domain,
                        where daily outrage and nightly violence mark the era of returning peace and
                        amity, without lingering to note the vacillating steps with which the craven
                        Holden essays to follow in the wake of the bolder but not more malignant
                        rulers of Tennessee, or to describe the outrages, the arsons, the murders,
                        the rapes, which with unvarying monotony attest the blessings which, in
                        every reconstructed State, flow from governments administered by "loyal
                        citizens," we would, in all candor, ask of those gentlemen whose new-born
                        zeal in the cause of reconstruction has hurried them forward with reckless
                        speed to the attainment of their desire, whether the harrowing scene now
                        daily occurring in "reconstructed" Arkansas, will not suffice to disturb
                        their equanimity and demand a pause in the hurry and precipitancy which mark
                        the character of the "late movement." A whole community placed under martial
                        law by a carpet-bag Governor, drum-head courts martial, military execution
                        and armed occupancy of whole sections of the State -- these, under any
                        circumstances embrace an array of evils, before which the human mind
                        instinctively recoils with horror and dismay; but how greatly are these
                        feelings intensified, how immeasurably are these horrors increased, when we
                        remember that the "military" who lord it over Arkansas to-day and live at
                        free quarters upon her citizens, are composed mainly, if not exclusively, of
                        NEGRO SOLDIERS -- of ruffians recruited for this very service by reason of
                        their anxiety to participate in the carnival of rapine and blood promised by
                        the "loyal" partisans of "<emph rend="italic">reconstructed</emph>"
                        government. When we read in the reports daily coming up from that
                        unfortunate State, of houses burned, property destroyed, citizens shot, and
                        defenceless maids and matrons ravished by brutal negro soldiers, and when we
                        know that absolutely no redress is afforded for these fiendish atrocities,
                        when we find an officer of the army, sent out for the purpose of examining
                        into these outrages, coolly reporting that martial law was required to
                        protect the loyal citizens, and that under its potent influence quiet is
                        being rapidly restored in these sections where disorders were formerly
                        committed, and especially when we find this official referring to acts of
                        violence committed on women and murders on men as " a few examples of
                        insubordination and lawlessness on the part of the soldierly, who in many
                        localities were of <emph rend="italic">necessity composed exclusively of
                            negroes,</emph>" the soul absolutely sickens at the reflection, that any
                        community in our land should be thus shamelessly abandoned to the mercy of
                        such a set of cut-throats and bandits. And yet this is done, in a
                        "reconstructed" State -- these scenes are enacted where "Congressional
                        policy" has had its perfect work, and a "restored sovereignty" is proudly
                        cited as evidencing the wisdom and efficiency of Radical statesmanship.</p>
                    <p>Does any thinking man suppose that similar scenes might not occur in
                        Virginia, when reconstructed on the same model plan? With a carpet-bag
                        Governor, who boasts of being actuated by the "spirit of John Brown," placed
                        at the head of affairs, with negroes controlling every election, and
                        dictating public policy in a large portion of the State, how long will it be
                        before a "militia system" similar to that of Arkansas will be seen here, and
                        "martial law" be made the potent agency whereby "rebel sympathizers" are
                        brought to terms, and conservative citizens converted into "loyal
                        leaguers??"</p>
                    <p>Virginia to-day is in a condition absolutely enviable, when contrasted with
                        that of <emph rend="italic">any</emph> of the reconstructed States. Under
                        the government of the military no such harrowing scenes as disgrace
                        humanity, and make of Arkansas a hell on earth, can occur here, for military
                        rule here means a white soldiery, controlled in the main by gentlemanly
                        officers, not negro soldiery under the command of malignant scalawags, and
                        hounded to their hellish work by a greedy and vindictive carpet-bag
                        Governor.</p>
                    <p>Reconstruction under the Congressional policy has as yet borne no fruits in
                        other States which should tempt Virginia so eagerly to seek in it for the
                        panacea of our ills. "Restoration to the Union" has in no instance been
                        accompanied with the blessings which were promised as the necessary
                        accompaniment of negro suffrage. Let Virginia then adhere to her former
                        policy -- let her act in accordance with her oft-repeated declaration of
                        undying opposition to this peculiar feature of Radical policy; and whatever
                        may be the consequence, we shall at least have preserved not only our
                        "consistency," but our <emph rend="italic">honor</emph>, although some may,
                        with reprehensible flippancy, ridicule the former, and, with more culpable
                        folly, sneer at the latter. -- <emph rend="italic">Lynchburg

                    <p>The Alexandria <emph rend="italic">Gazette</emph> says that, "never was there
                        a better illustration of "Love's Labor Lost," or the "Needlessness of an
                        Invitation," than is shown of the address of the Richmond State Journal to
                        the Old Whigs -- that is, those who were Whigs in old party times -- most
                        affectionately, earnestly and urgently exhorting them to "come in" and join
                        the Radical party! If it had only headed its <emph rend="italic"
                        >persuasive</emph> article, as a motto, with the lines---</p>
                    <p>"Will you walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,<lb/> It is the
                        prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy"</p>
                    <p>--the whole thing would have been complete.</p>
                    <p>But, seriously. Never were people more mistaken, than are the leaders of the
                        Radicals, if they suppose, for an instant, that former party distinctions
                        are to prevail with or operate upon the former Whigs in Virginia, to
                        affiliate in the slightest degree, politically, with the Radical party. They
                        have not a single political principle in common, and the events of eight
                        years past have sundered them, politically, as far apart as the poles. No
                        inducements of place, or distinction, or power, or gain, or success, could
                        bring about, with men who regard <emph rend="italic">principle</emph>, such
                        a monstrous coalition; differing as they do on constitutional doctrines, on
                        measures of policy, foreign and domestic; in ideas, in sentiments, in
                        motives of action, and in the very fundamental principles of government. And
                        when we speak thus, we are confident we speak for all, (with rare
                        exceptions,) of those who were Whigs in days gone by, and who are not now in
                        communion with the Radical party.</p>
                    <p>When we read the temptations held out, in the article to which we refer, we
                        could not but think, not irreverently or by way of comparison, but as
                        suggestive, of <emph rend="italic">another</emph> temptation recorded in
                        Holy Writ, "where all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them" were
                        shown, and the promise made "all these things will I give thee, if thou will

                    <p>With the Alex. <emph rend="italic">Gazette,</emph> "we have been, and are,
                        totally opposed to the whole batch of "constitutional amendments" that have
                        been brought before Congress during and since the war, and that continue to
                        be brought in, up to this day. They are "only evil and that continually." If
                        any of the propositions have merit of any kind, this is not the time, in
                        this day of change and disintegration, to present them; much less to force
                        them upon the people. If we had "peace" -- and were in a peaceful and
                        prosperous career of civil government, we would be willing to consider some
                        changes in the organic law which considerate, right thinking men, might
                        judge to be necessary or expedient. But, now, it is manifest that most of
                        these so-called "constitutional amendments" are designed for miserable
                        temporary party purposes, and as party expedients. We prefer, infinitely,
                        the Constitution as it <emph rend="italic">was</emph>. The tinkers at the
                        Constitution only batter and disfigure that noble instrument, and injure its
                        beautiful symmetry and proportions. In a word, in our opinion, they are not
                        competent by character, wisdom, virtue, good principles, or common sense, at
                        this day, and at this time, to <emph rend="italic">amend</emph> the
                        Constitution. They ought to confine their operations to other and more <emph
                            rend="italic">congenial</emph> matters. If the course of legislation
                        shows no respect to the Constitution -- let the instrument itself remain on
                        paper! It will be at least, even if unheeded -- a silent rebuke! And that is
                        as much as we can expect at this time!"</p>

                    <p>The New York <emph rend="italic">World</emph> says: The "new movement" in
                        Virginia likewise assumes a startling interest. We have heretofore stated
                        this to be an effort on the part of a few prominent Virginians to procure
                        the ratification of the proposed constitution on condition that the
                        restrictions on suffrage and office-holding be stricken out, but in the
                        light of fuller information, are reluctantly inclined to believe that, while
                        this was at first the animus of the "movement", it has now degenerated into
                        something very like a "ring" to build up a radical party within the State of
                        better materials than had gone to the formation of that organization
                        heretofore. The Editor of the Richmond <emph rend="italic">Whig</emph>,
                        which sustains the "movement" as originally meant, writes to his paper from
                        Washington that it is vitally necessary to its success that Gen. Grant and
                        the republican leaders be convinced that the people of Virginia will not use
                        their enfranchisement for the purpose of proscription -- which is all very
                        well -- "<emph rend="italic">or to build up a party to antagonize General
                            Grant's administration, or to fill our public offices with men offensive
                            to the Washington authorities,</emph>" which is not so well, being a
                        plain matter of bargain and sale to the effect that Virginia may come in on
                        guarantee that she sustains Grant, right or wrong, and puts none but radical
                        proteges in power. It is proper to say that the editor of the <emph
                            rend="italic">Whig</emph> does not endorse this writing only for
                        information; but the facts narrated by him show very conclusively that,
                        however honest and patriotic the intentions of those gentlemen favoring the
                        "movement;" it is not the purpose of the rogue Congress to even consider it
                        save at the price of a direct adhesion to the radical party. That there will
                        be this abasement, or that, if consented to, the people of Virginia will
                        ratify it, are things we do not believe.</p>
                    <p>The Washington Correspondent "X" of the Baltimore <emph rend="italic"
                        >Gazette</emph>, under date January 31st, says:</p>
                    <p>"When the "new movement" in Virginia was in embryo the people of that State

                        "universal amnesty" is made sufficiently manifest by the vote on the
                        "fifteenth amendment" to the Constitution, which passed the House yesterday
                        by a strict party vote, except Bingham, of Ohio, and Polsley, of West
                        Virginia. The negroes are to be forced to vote everywhere, and the whites
                        are to be excluded to any extent the carpet-baggers and negroes may choose
                        to inflict upon the South. To show the use to which the "movement" is put by

                    <p>"If the people of Virginia desire any relief and liberality at the hands of
                        Congress, the course for them to pursue is plain. They will have to accept,
                        not as a matter of choice, but as a necessity, the fact of negro suffrage,
                        and they will have to accept it in good faith. It is through that only that
                        they can hope to get a liberal State Constitution, or any relief from
                        disabilities. There is one thing more they will have to do, and that is so
                        to act as to convince Congress and the other authorities
                        <unclear>there</unclear> that any powers and privileges and powers accorded
                        to them will not be used to the prejudice of the negroes or to the building
                        up of a party to antagonize the incoming administration, to persecute Union
                        men and Republicans, whether settlers or natives, and to place their State
                        in the hands and under the control and guidance of men who shall be
                        obnoxious to the national authorities, by reason of their violence, their
                        vindictiveness, then opposition to national sentiment, or their political
                        antecedents. As far as my information extends these are pre-requisites,
                        which will not be dispensed with, and I believe that Virginia can only get
                        the terms above indicated by complying with these conditions. It is for the
                        people of that State to determine for themselves. I am here to take
                        observations and to communicate them to your readers and I want them to
                        understand precisely how they stand and what they have to expect."</p>
                    <p>The Washington correspondent "E" of the Balt. <emph rend="italic"
                        >Gazette</emph> under date of February 2nd says:</p>
                    <p>"This special meeting of the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, held a few
                        evenings since to consider the propositions submitted to them by the
                        Richmond Committee of Nine, resulted in satisfying the Conservative members
                        of that committee that nothing was to be done to relieve Virginia from the
                        embarrassment of having either to adopt the Underwood Constitution or to
                        continue under military rule. Senator Hendricks had expressed a strong
                        belief that the committee would inaugurate the movement desired by the
                        Richmond gentlemen, but yesterday he assured his friends that the
                        proposition was hopeless and advised them to abandon the whole thing. The
                        result has been that the committee from Virginia have returned.</p>
                    <p>It is due to Mr. Conkling of New York, to say that he was the only Radical on
                        the committee who was disposed to listen to the statements made by Colonel
                        Baldwin and others, and who expressed any sympathy for Virginia or
                        Virginians. It is now understood among the Radicals that the constitutional
                        fight in Virginia is to be a desperate one, and that the first legal act of
                        the new Administration will be to throw its whole weight and influence in
                        favor of adopting the Underwood Constitution by which the larger portion of
                        the white population of the State will be disfranchised. In a discussion
                        to-day at the room of the Radical Executive Committee, Mr. Schenck, the
                        chairman of the committee, declared that Virginia was to be the battle-field
                        of the new President, and the party could soon determine whether <emph
                            rend="italic">President</emph> Grant's purpose was to stand by his party
                        as firmly as <emph rend="italic">General</emph> Grant did."</p>
                    <p>The above should be taken, we suspect, <emph rend="italic">cum grano
                        salis.</emph></p>
                    <p>The following is an extract from the Editorial Correspondence of the Richmond
                            <emph rend="italic">Whig</emph> dated Washington Feb 2nd:</p>
                    <p>"It is questioned by none that, in consequence and by reason of the efforts
                        of the Committee of Nine, Congress is more liberally disposed towards
                        Virginia than it was before these efforts were made. Of course no one can
                        undertake to say what precise form this new-born liberality will take.
                        Congress may or may not act finally on the subject during the present
                        session -- and we certainly can afford to wait a few weeks for the relief we
                        have been so slow in asking. Some think that the Virginia propositions as
                        they stand, will be acceded to. Others think that modifications of them will
                        be made. There are those who anticipate that Congress may remit Virginia to
                        a territorial condition, which would devolve upon the President (General
                        Grant) the appointment of a Governor, Territorial Secretary, Marshal,
                        Judges, &amp;c. A Legislature would then have to be elected by the
                        people to frame a constitution of State government -- and suffrage and
                        eligibility would be subject only to such restrictions as are imposed by the
                        Fourteenth Amendment, and such general Federal laws as are in operation. I
                        give you the skeleton and leave you to fill it up. -- There is on the part
                        of some an idea that our military commander may be given full jurisdiction
                        over the subject, with instructions to submit the constitution to some
                        prescribed form or forms. Whatever may be done, of one thing you and your
                        readers may feel assured -- things have been foreborne by Congress in
                        consequence of the Virginian movement that would certainly have been done
                        without it -- and Virginia will get more liberal terms by reason of it than
                        were possible without the efforts made."</p>
                    <p>The following are extracts from the last letter of the Editorial Washington
                        Correspondent of the Richmond <emph rend="italic">Whig;</emph></p>
                    <p>There is no disposition among the Virginians now here to press the movement
                        to a finality during the present session. One formidable difficulty that
                        would have to be encountered in such an effort, would arise from the vast
                        secamulation of business that is pressing upon the two Houses, and that has
                        precedence over this. I think that our friends here will all be perfectly
                        content if they can get a favorable report from the Senate Judiciary
                        Committee. It will by no means stun or dishearten them if they get no report
                        at all. Their thoughts are now chiefly directed to the incoming
                        administration, and there are many reasons why they should be so directed.
                        In one month General Grant will be inaugurated.</p>
                    <p>* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>"It is believed, and there is good ground for the belief, that he will use
                        his influence to promote the success of our Virginia movement, and to
                        procure for us all, if not more than we have asked. Such is the confidence
                        felt in General Grant's good wishes and purposes that there are few, I am
                        inclined to think, who would not willingly submit it to him to prescribe
                        terms, to take a sheet of paper and write down his own form of adjustment.
                        Under such circumstances the proper policy would seem to be to forbear any
                        attempt to hurry up the present Congress, however favorably it may be
                        supposed to regard this movement. If it choose to act of its own motion so
                        well, if not let Virginia wait patiently and hopefully for General Grant's
                        succession. She has more to hope than to fear from it."</p>
