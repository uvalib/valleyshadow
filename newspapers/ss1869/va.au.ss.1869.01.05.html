<b>The Condition of Virginia</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A response to a letter to the editor of the Richmond Whig, which urged the
                    Conservatives of Virginia to concede the issue of universal suffrage in hopes of
                    gaining universal amnesty. Claims that the experience of Arkansas and Georgia
                    show that such concessions are unlikely to dampen Radical misrule.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Christmas day a communication signed "Senex" appeared in the Richmond Whig, advocating a change of policy by the
                        Conservatives of this State. The writer, who is understood to be a gentleman
                        of distinction and influence, takes the ground that the Underwood
                        Constitution will probably be forced upon us unless we avert the calamity by
                        agreeing to universal suffrage. He thereupon proposes that a Constitution
                        unbodying "universal suffrage and universal amnesty" be presented to the
                        Congress with a request that it, as well as the other instrument, be
                        submitted to the vote of the people of Virginia. Another correspondent of
                        the Whig, who signs himself "Augusta," expresses
                        the belief that a majority of the people of this county will approve the
                        scheme proposed by "Senex." In the absence of the editor of the Spectator, we do not feel at liberty to say more
                        than that we think "Augusta" is mistaken in regard to the sentiment of our
                        people. The Washington correspondent of the Baltimore Gazette, in his letter
                        of the 29th, says:</p>
                    <p>"The condition of Virginia, beyond peradventure, is critical, and there are
                        some gentlemen now here whose conservative status and general intelligence
                        are unquestioned, who seem inclined to think that the people of that State
                        have it in their power to prevent greater wrongs by anticipating some of the
                        certain and unavoidable demands of their oppressors. The immediate
                        concession of negro suffrage by the Legislature, it is thought by these
                        gentlemen, (whose views are fairly represented by the writer of the recent
                        editorials upon this subject in the Intelligencer
                        -- himself a Virginian,) would mollify the bitterness of Radical hatred.
                        Alas! the history of the past three years furnishes indubitable evidence
                        that concessions but whet the edge of Radical
                        vengeance.</p>
                    <p>The case of Georgia is in point. The people there complied with every demand of Congress. They adopted a
                        Constitution recognizing negro suffrage to the fullest extent, and carrying
                        but literally and equitably the whole infernal Congressional system of
                        "reconstruction." The Constitution as adopted was submitted to Congress, and
                        adopted by it without a syllable of objection. Yet the State did not bow
                        down to heathen gods, and what do we see! Arkansas even went further. She
                        not only did all that was required by the legislation of
                            Congress, but (if the election returns are to be credited) actually voted the Radical "national" ticket. Did
                        this subserviency save her from the deliberate inauguration of asystem of robbery, arson, murder and wholesale
                        rape, committed by negro troops under the auspices, if not under immediate
                        command of Federal military satraps!</p>
                    <p>But it may be imagined that an utter abandonment of the last vestige of
                        manhood might operate favorably upon what is termed here the "Conservative"
                        wing of the Republican party in Congress. Vain hope! These men are the mere
                        echoes of Northern hate, fanaticism and revenge."</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An editorial from the Dispatch denying the Radicals' criticism of President
                    Johnson's ineffectiveness. Says such criticism is hypocritical because the

                    <p>Was there ever before in the world such a party as the present Radical party
                        of this country? Mr. Van Wyck makes a report to Congress upon the subject of
                        frauds committed upon the Government in the matter of collecting the revenue
                        or evading the payment of the same, and can find no one to blame but the
                        President. Mr. JOHNSON is the cause of "all our woes." Congress has passed a
                        tenure-of-office law which deprives him of the power of removing incompetent
                        and dishonest officials, or of appointing competent and honest ones; yet Mr.
                        Van Wyck censures him because he has not collected as much revenue as he
                        would have collected if he had been left untrammeled.-- This is the Radical
                        idea of justice and fair dealing. -- Dispatch.</p>

<b>The Richmond Conference</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A meeting was held in Richmond to discuss ways to prevent the proposed
                    constitution from being adopted. The group decided to accept suffrage for
                    African-Americans but to modify the constitution if possible. "If we adopt the
                    Constitution, our condition will be intolerable, because we will be under the
                    absolute domination of adventurers and the worst classes of our population. If
                    we reject it, we shall probably be regarded as contumacious, and be subjected to
                    a harsh and coercive provisional government."<br>(Names in announcement:  A. H. H. Stuart, Gen. J. Echols,  Thomas J. Michie, Maj. H. M. Bell,  N. K. Trout)</blockquote>

                        executions, or shall dispose, or attempt to dispose of the same to the
                        prejudice of his creditor, it shall be lawful and right for such creditor to
                        apply to any circuit court, or to any judge thereof in vacation, giving
                        reasonable notice of such application to the debtor, and said court or judge

                        such application, with costs to either party, as the said court or judge

                        not to impair the rights of the creditor, but to preserve and enforce the
                        same by subjecting the whole personal estate which is now exempt by the stay
                        law to the lien of the creditor's execution, and at the same time enforce a
                        prompt payment of a part of the debt, and an early payment of the remainder.</p>
