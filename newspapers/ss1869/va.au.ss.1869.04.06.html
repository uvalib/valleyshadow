                    <p>For the Staunton Spectator. STAUNTON, March 27th, 1869.<br> MESSRS. MAUZY
                        &amp; CO.<br></p>
                    <p>Permit me through the columns of your valuable paper, to say a few words to
                        the Distillers and Liquid Dealers of our community -- those Commissaries and
                        Quartermasters in King Alcohol's army.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen -- By the laws of our State, you are permitted to engage in a
                        traffic which fills our land with beggars, widows, orphans, and crimes --
                        the world of wo, with victims of despair, and our grave yards
                        with premature cause of more crimes, suffering and distress than all other
                        causes combined -- but can you do so without violating the laws of humanity?</p>
                    <p>Love worketh no ill to his neighbor. Love will not burn a neighbor's barn, or
                        poison his food, or blast his reputation or destroy his soul. I ask you, in
                        all sincerity, do you not by your traffic often help to do all these? Does
                        not property, reputation, health, life and salvation fall before the fell
                        destroyers?</p>
                    <p>It is no excuse for you to say that you do not destroy maliciously -- for the
                        certainty of evil is as great, as if you should fire in the dark upon a mass
                        of human beings, when it was certain that death would be the consequence to
                        some. The fact that they who purchase your liquors are free agents, does not
                        make you guiltless. Would you sell arsenic to your neighbor to destroy
                        himself because he is a free agent and can, if you refuse, get it elsewhere?
                        No! gentlemen you would not, and you are really as accountable as if you
                        were certain that he was not a free agent and that he could not obtain his
                        poison elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Your trade employs and sustains many families, and the profits in some
                        instances are appropriated to useful purposes. But cannot these same
                        families be supported in some other way? Cannot the capital be employed in
                        some useful avocation? Are the useful avocations so overstocked that you
                        cannot find any other way to make a livelihood but by dealing poison to your
                        fellow-mortals? Because the business is lucrative, must you destroy immortal
                        souls? Beware how you act in this matter -- one soul is of more value than
                        all the capital employed in your sinful traffic -- preserve the former if,
                        to do so, it is necessary to destroy the latter. Where is the good produced
                        by the traffic in ardent spirits to balance the enormous evil?</p>
                    <p>Every year, thousands of families are robbed of fathers, brothers, husbands
                        and friends -- every year widows and orphans are multiplied and gray hairs
                        are brought with sorrow to the grave. No trade blasts so many hopes,
                        destroys so many lives and causes so many mourners to go about the streets,
                        because man has gone to his long home. Is not the desperate wickedness of
                        the heart sufficient without artificial excitement?</p>
                    <p>If your trade was inseparable from the great and good ends of our social
                        being, we might endure the evil for the sake of the good, and they only be
                        accountable who abuse themselves, but the effects of your trade are evil
                        only and that continually increasing two-fold the energies of human
                        depravity. Everything needful to a perfect state of society can exist
                        without it, and with it such a state can never be attained. What drop of
                        good does it pour into the ocean of misery which it creates?</p>
                    <p>Who can estimate the hatred of God, of his word and worship and of his
                        people, or number the oaths and blasphemies it causes to be uttered? How
                        many thousands does it detain every Sabbath day from the house of God -- who
                        are found so uniformly in the ranks of irreligion than the intemperate? How
                        broad the road, which intemperance alone opens to hell, and how thronged
                        with travellers? Are you not hourly and daily increasing the numbers of
                        these travellers to the world of wo? Without mocking God, can you
                        pray while you are engaged in this traffic "Lead us not into temptation?"</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, for the sake of humanity, either close your establishments, or
                        post over your doors in flaming capitals, THIS IS THE ROAD TO DEATH -- that
                        they may warn off and inspire with consternation and fear the heedless
                        traveller to destruction.</p>
                    <p>Remember that "to him who knoweth to do good and doeth it not, to him it is
                        sin."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>So far, the people of this country, and especially of the South, have been
                        totally at a loss to understand what President Grant meant by the
                        expression, "Let us have peace." It seems, verily, in one sense, to be the
                        "peace that passeth all understanding." The National
                            Intelligencer, which seems, like other journals, to be at a loss
                        to understand it, says:</p>
                    <p>"General Grant was either sincere or insincere. If sincere, let him, to the
                        best of his power, make good his promise, now that the opportunity is upon
                        him. If insincere, let him take his place among the tricksters and
                        demagogues of the day. We do not wish to think harshly of him. We do not
                        wish to treat him with severity or unkindness. We are quite willing to
                        believe him honest in the peace which he has promised. We opposed his
                        election on broad grounds of public policy, and because of his associations
                        with and candidacy of the Radical party -- a party many of whose political
                        tenets we abhor. But if General Grant should prove himself a faithful,
                        upright, and efficient Chief Magistrate, the fact that we did not support
                        him in his Presidential pretensions will not in the least bias us against
                        him, and he will find, in so far as he is right, a cordial support at our
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>But what did General Grant mean by his oft-repeated and ever-approved saying,
                        "Let us have peace?" We are inclined to take it for granted that he did not
                        intend to play the trickster. This, we cannot but think, would be a new
                        character for him, and that he meant what he was saying. Then what did he
                        mean? In coming to the Presidency he found, under the management of the
                        Radical party -- the party whose candidate he was -- the Union disrupted,
                        civil subordinated to military rule in several of the States, hundreds of
                        thousands of white citizens disfranchised -- deprived virtually of
                        citizenship -- a prodigious and augmenting public debt, industry paralyzed,
                        monopolies everywhere in the ascendant, the public mind depressed,
                        unparalleled and monstrous corruption in every branch of the Government and
                        taxation, too heavy to be borne, resting upon the shoulders of the people.
                        By the promise of peace did General Grant mean to enter upon a course that
                        would lead to and accomplish, as far as possible, the correction of these
                        evils? If he did there was something -- some wholesome meaning -- in his
                        phrase. If he did not, it was a hollow and heartless mockery. If he did, he
                        will, in so far as his efforts are directed to this end, receive the hearty
                        cooperation and approval of every Democrat and every Conservative in the
                        land. If he did not, General Grant and General Grant's administration will
                        be the most conspicuous and ignoble of all failures. Many not Radicals, not
                        even Republicans, voted for Grant in the belief that he had at once the
                        power and the disposition, if elected to the Presidency, to heal the wounds
                        of the nation, reunite the divided States under the Constitution, unmanacle
                        the hundreds of thousands of his fellow-citizens which Radicalism had
                        enthralled, set the Southern States in their old orbits and the Southern
                        people on their feet again, and restore fraternal feeling between the long
                        alienated North and South. Had not such views been entertained of General
                        Grant, such a consummation confidently looked for at his hands, he would
                        never have been elected.</p>
                    <p>General Grant must be persuaded, any one of reflection must be persuaded,
                        that peace and the adjuncts of peace cannot be brought by any process of
                        tyranny, or by putting the grinding heel on the necks of proud and
                        high-spirited men, or by bearing down upon such the strong arm. This Union
                        can never be kept together, and this people never live together in peace, by
                        holding any portion of the people as a conquered people and as inferior, and
                        deprived of like rights with the rest. In giving all the people of all the
                        sections all the rights which belong to them under the Constitution lies the
                        only safe and peaceful course; and this is all that any people of any
                        section ever asked. To take self-government from States is not only
                        criminal, but suicidal, for which there is nowhere found a warrant. To send
                        strangers among them who have no sympathies with them, whose feelings are
                        harsh and unkind towards them, to whom they are as mere strangers and
                        foreigners, to hold the offices and rule over them, is a monstrous
                        injustice, and unnatural beyond expression; and it is no wonder that the
                        people of the depressed and poverty-stricken South rebel instinctively
                        against such treatment. These Southern States are either in the Union or out
                        of the Union. If they are cut out of the Union, it is a most inexplicable
                        and marvelous thing, remembering how the war closed. If they are in the
                        Union, they are entitled to all, and should not be denied any of the rights
                        which that Union promises them, and which it gives to other States. This,
                        indeed, is the pith of the whole trouble of the country at this time, and
                        has been for years past. Had the Radical party had the statesmanship or
                        patriotism to acknowledge this, (for they could not but have seen it from
                        the commencement,) and gone about removing the cause of complaint, all would
                        have been well long ago. But they had not the patriotism. They lived solely
                        and singly and selfishly for themselves, and to perpetuate their supremacy
                        and their powers has been their only aim, disregarding wholly, through long
                        and suffering years, while myriads of hearts were beating in anguish for
                        redress, the welfare of a stricken country. Does General Grant propose that
                        this same heartlessness and cruelty and sordid ambition of the Radical
                        party, with neither justice nor mercy in it, shall continue? If he does, he
                        has risen to eminence to be eminently and long hated. If he does not, and he
                        proposes to bring alleviation, of these ills, and redress to his bereaved
                        and harshly treated brethren of the South, not for their sake alone, but for
                        the sake of one common country, of which they are a part, then does every
                        American citizen with a heart in his bosom, and everyone who believes that,
                        in mutual forgiveness and fraternity there is peace, and that in peace there
                        is prosperity and happiness, bid him God speed.</p>

                        may then be able to indulge a rational hope of a speedy return of peace and
                            prosperity.--Lynch. Virginian.</p>
