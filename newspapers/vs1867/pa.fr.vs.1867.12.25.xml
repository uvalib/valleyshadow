                <transcript>
                    <p>The National Council of the Union Leagues of America met at Washington on the
                        11th inst. for the purpose of taking measures to unite with the Grand Army
                        of the Republic in an endeavor to secure the triumph of Radical principles
                        at the coming Presidential election. It is claimed that these two
                        organizations represent a million and a half of voters. The following
                        resolution was unanimously adopted amid the wildest enthusiasm, and it was
                        ordered "that a copy be sent to every member of the subordinate councils and
                        to the Commanders of the Grand Army of the Republic."</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the National Council Union League
                        of America is utterly opposed to any departure from the sacred principles of
                        its organization or from those of the republican party, and that we do
                        hereby respectfully but earnestly and firmly urge the National Republican
                        Convention to place no man in nomination for the President of the United
                        States in 1868 who is not in himself an irreversible guarantee that he is a
                        true friend of the cause of Union and liberty, <emph rend="italic">the equal
                            rights of all men before the law and of universal manhood
                        suffrage.</emph></p>
                    <p>How the impatience of the Radical party is exhibiting itself against the
                        effort to sell out its principles for the prospect of success! How restless
                        it is becoming under the attempt to chain it, with all its cherished hopes
                        for the elevation of the African, to the car of expediency! How it chafes at
                        the suggestion of surrendering the object of its earnest longings, after
                        having surmounted almost insurmountable barriers, merely because it is
                        thought that one man is possessed of sufficient personal popularity to carry
                        the Presidential election, and because that one man is not only suspected of
                        holding conservative principles, but positively refuses to avow what his
                        political opinions are!</p>
                    <p>This resolution is the rod of terror by which it is expected, or hoped to
                        frighten General Grant into a declaration in favor of "the equal rights of
                        all men before the law and to universal manhood suffrage." If he desires the
                        Radical nomination, he must make such a declaration. That party will not
                        take him as both candidate and platform. There may be a portion of Radicals
                        who would be willing to risk him, but they are the minority. The majority
                        have "universal manhood suffrage: on the brain, and nothing short of an
                        unequivocal declaration in favor of it will satisfy them. If he refuses to
                        throw himself unreservedly into the arms of the Radicals, he must remain
                        where he is and relinquish his hope of being President. If he accedes to
                        their wishes and announces himself in favor of negro suffrage and negro
                        equality, not al [UNCLEAR] the prestige of his great name--not all the
                        eminent services which he has rendered to the National Government--not all
                        his military achievements which have given his name such an honorable place
                        in history, and brought down upon the nation the admiration and wonder of
                        the world, can avail to save him from an overwhelming defeat. The tide which
                        is running over our whole country will sweep everything before
                        it.--Principles will be far stronger than men in the next Presidential
                        campaign. The antipathy of the masses to this odious doctrine of negro
                        equality is so intense, that everything else will be considered of minor
                        importance in comparison with it. The instinctive pride of the American
                        people in the Anglo-Saxon race will assert itself and crush any and every
                        man who writes "universal manhood suffrage" upon his banner.</p>
                    <p>We are glad to see this evidence of a determination of the Radicals not to
                        surrender principle to expediency. We want an open and fair fight. We want
                        to run Democratic principles alongside of and against Radical principles. We
                        care not who the candidates are so that they are honest and capable. We want
                        the people to have an opportunity to decide between the doctrines of the two
                        parties. We would like to have the contest stripped of all outside issues.
                        If General Grant desires to be made President, and has not the manly
                        independence to declare his political sentiments, we trust that the Radical
                        party will have the independence to leave him where he is. They need not
                        fear that he will be nominated by the Democratic party. There is no
                        intention on the part of our organization to nominate and man whose position
                        on National questions is at all doubtful. We must have a candidate who has a
                        clean Democratic record and who is willing and at all times ready to avow
                        his opinions. Our nominee must be a man who is outspoken in his denunciation
                        of the Congressional policy of reconstruction and the doctrine of universal
                        manhood suffrage. If the Democratic candidate shall be elected, we desire it
                        to be regarded as a triumph over military governments and negro equality.
                        The times call for no half-way measures. There is not middle way now. The
                        negro will either vote or he will not. The Southern States will either be
                        admitted, with their "rights, dignity and equality unimpaired," or they will
                        be held under military governments until they consent to negro supremacy.
                        The next President will be elected by one of the two great parties of the
                        country. There is no such thing possible--with principles as clearly and
                        sharply defined as they are now--as an election by a people's or citizen's
                        party. A Democrat or a Radical will occupy the next Presidential chair.
                        General Grant's fate is sealed unless he opens his mouth. He must declare
                        either for or against universal manhood suffrage.</p>

                <summary>Reports that representatives from the Union Leagues of America and the
                    Grand Army of the Republic met on Dec. 11th and passed a joint resolution urging
                    the National Republican Convention to select a Presidential candidate who
                    believes in the "equal rights of all men before the law" and "universal manhood
                    suffrage." The editors of the Valley Spirit applaud this development because
                    they feel it will force Gen. Grant to make public his sentiments on black
                    suffrage (and might therefore cause dissent within the Republican ranks) and
                    because they feel it will draw clear distinctions between the platforms of the
                    respective parties in the upcoming election.</summary>

                    to it but was struck on the leg, breaking the bone just below the knee. He also
                    injured his spine. Schlichter was carried to Oyler's house below Greenvillage
                    and was attended to by Dr. Senseny and Huber. Schlichter was in the process of

                    the House of Representatives had reported adversely upon the petition of
                    citizens of Chambersburg for indemnity for damages sustained by the burning of
                    the town by the rebel General McCausland. Desiring to obtain more information in

                    account given in newspapers, one of the editors of the SPIRIT wrote to the Hon.

                <transcript>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec 18, 1867.</p>
                    <p>J. M. COOPER, esq.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">My Dear Sir</emph>:--Yours of the 16th ult. has just
                        reached me, and I hasten to reply. The reason that the Committee on Claims
                        acted so soon on the petition was that they have had the same question
                        before them in other cases, and after a careful examination of it, they are
                        unanimously of the opinion that such claims cannot be allowed. Numerous
                        cases from the States of Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and the border States
                        generally, have been before them for damages done not only by rebels, but by
                        our own soldiers during the war, and in all of them the Committee refuse to
                        make any allowance. I send you a list of the Committees, by which you will
                        see that Mr. Bingham, one of the first lawyers, [UNCLEAR] the House, is
                        Chairman of the Claims Committee. He tells me that great damage was done in
                        his District by Morgan, in his raid through Ohio, in the destruction of a
                        train of cars, which were loaded with tobacco; the robbery of the contents
                        of a safe; and the burning of the station house and other buildings, and he
                        is decidedly against allowing any claim of this kind. </p>
                    <p>I am authorized by Messrs. Bingham and Wahsburn to say, that if your people
                        desire it; with the knowledge that the Committee have thoroughly examined
                        the question involved, and are unanimously against the allowance of claims
                        of this kind--they will give me a hearing in the matter.</p>
                    <p>It looks to me as though there was but little hope, yet I am willing and
                        anxious to do all I can in the matter. I would add that as soon as the
                        Committee reported, I made the arrangement for a hearing provided your
                        people desired it.</p>
                    <p>Yours respectfully,</p>
                    <p>W. H. Koontz.</p>
                    <p>This letter contains information so important to our people that we have
                        taken the liberty of publishing it without waiting to obtain its author's
                        permission. Our own opinion is that it is not worth while to put Gen. Koontz
                        to the trouble of discussing our claim to indemnity before that Committee.
                        No matter how ably or how earnestly he might argue our cause, they would
                        still report against us, for their minds are made up. But as we said last
                        week, it is competent for Congress to an act for the relief of Chambersburg
                        in spite of the adverse report of the Committee, and if our citizens desire
                        it, they can doubtless obtain a vote on the question.</p>
