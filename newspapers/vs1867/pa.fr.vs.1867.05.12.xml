                <summary>The editor urges Democratic journals around the country to abandon the
                    recent move to label the Republicans as "Blockheads." Instead, they should
                    continue to call them by the name given by the New York Herald: Black
                    Rebublicans. This "designation," he insists, "is peculiarly appropriate and
                    truthful."</summary>

                    state of corruption among members of the Legislature," the editor urges citizens
                    to "read, ponder, and reflect, and then go earnestly to work to apply the remedy
                    at the polls next fall."</summary>
