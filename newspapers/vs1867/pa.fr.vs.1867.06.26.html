<b>Opinion Of The Attorney General As To The Powers Of The Military Commanders In
                    The South</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>According to the editors, the U. S. Attorney General disputes the
                    constitutionality of the Reconstruction Act, specifically those provisions that
                    provide the military commanders in the South with the authority to remove
                    "proper officers of the State" or to interfere with the criminal courts.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Attorney General of the United States has given to the President his
                        opinion upon the powers of the Southern military commanders. The opinion is
                        quite lengthy, and we give Mr. Stanbery's conclusions, omitting his
                        arguments, which would not interest the general reader.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General after citing the provisions of the original
                        Reconstruction act (the Supplementary act relating merely to the duties of
                        the military officers in the matter of registration and elections, and no
                        question having arisen under it), says: We see clearly enough that this act
                        contemplates two distinct governments in each of these ten States-the one
                        military, the other civil. The civil government is recognized as existing at
                        the date of the act. The military government is created by the act. Both are
                        provisional, and both are to continue until the new State constitution is
                        framed and the State is admitted to representation in Congress. When that
                        event takes place, both these provisional governments are to cease. In
                        contemplation of this act, this military authority and this civil authority
                        are to be carried on together. The people in these States are made subject
                        to both, and must obey both in their respective jurisdictions.</p>
                    <p>Under the Reconstruction act, the powers granted to the military commander
                        are: the power or duty to "protect all persons in their rights of person and
                        property, to suppress insurrection, disorder and violence, and to punish or
                        cause to be punished, all disturbers of the public peace and criminals;" and
                        he may do this by the agency of the criminal courts of the State, or, if
                        necessary, he may have resort to military tribunals.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General sees in the Reconstruction act, no authority, nor any
                        shadow of authority, for the interference with any other courts or any other
                        jurisdiction than criminal courts in the exercise of criminal jurisdiction.
                        There is no provision, even under the plea of necessity, to establish, by
                        military authority, courts or tribunals for the trial of civil cases, or for
                        the protection of such civil rights of persons as come within the cognizance
                        of civil courts as contradistinguised from criminal courts. In point of
                        fact, there was no foundation for such a grant of power, for the Civil
                        Rights act and the Freedmen's Bureau act neither of which is superceded by
                        this act, made ample provision for the protection of all merely civil rights
                        where the laws or courts of these States might fail to give full, impartial
                        protection.</p>
                    <p>He finds no authority anywhere in this act for the removal by the military
                        commander of the proper officers of a State, either executive or judicial,
                        or the appointment of persons to their places. On the contrary, the act
                        clearly enough forbids it. They, too, have rights which the military
                        commander is bound to protect, not authorized to destroy.</p>
                    <p>We find in the concluding clause of the sixth section of the act that these
                        officials are recognized, and express provision is made to perpetuate them.
                        It is enacted that "in all elections to any office under such provisional
                        governments, all persons shall be entitled to vote, and none others, who are
                        entitled to vote under the provisions of the fifth section of this act; and
                        no person shall be eligible to any office under such provisional governments
                        who would be disqualified from holding office under the provisions of this
                        act."</p>
                    <p>This provision not only recognizes all the officers of the provisional
                        governments, but in case of vacancies very clearly points out how they are
                        to be filled, and that happens to be in the usual way, by the people, and
                        not by any other agency or any other power, either State or Federal, civil
                        or military.</p>
                    <p>He finds it impossible under the provisions of this act to comprehend such an
                        official as a Governor one of these States appointed to office by one of
                        these military commanders. The law takes no cognizance of such an official,
                        and he is clothed with no authority or color of authority.</p>
                    <p>What is true of the Governor is equally true as to all the other legislative,
                        executive and judicial officers of the State.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General goes on to say:</p>
                    <p>I must not be understood as fixing limits to the power of the military
                        commander in case of an actual insurrection or riot. It may happen that an
                        insurrection in one of these States may be so general and formidable as to
                        require the temporary suspension of all civil government, and the
                        establishment of martial law in its place. And the same thing may be true as
                        to local disorder or riot in reference to the civil government of the city
                        or place where it breaks out. Whatever power is necessary to meet such
                        emergencies the military commander may properly exercise.</p>
                    <p>In the suppression of insurrection and riot the military commander is wholly
                        independent of the civil authority. So, too in the trial and punishment of
                        criminals and offenders he may supercede civil jurisdiction. His power is to
                        be exercised in these special emergencies, and the means are put into his
                        hands by which it is to be exercised: that is to say, "a sufficient military
                        force to enable such officer to perform his duties and enforce his
                        authority," and military tribunals of his own appointment to try and punish
                        offenders. These are strictly military powers, to be executed by military
                        authority, not by the civil authority or by civil officers appointed by him
                        to perform ordinary civil duties.</p>
                    <p>If these emergencies do no happen, if civil order is preserved, and criminals
                        are duly prosecuted by the regular criminal courts, the military power,
                        though present, must remain passive. Its proper function is to preserve the
                        peace, to act promptly when the peace is broken, and restore order.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General is of the opinion that a military commander has no power
                        under the act to change the laws in force. He says the military commander is
                        made a conservator of the peace, not a legislator. His duties are military
                        duties-executive duties, not legislative duties. He has no authority to
                        enact or declare a new code of laws for the people within his district under
                        any idea that he can make a better code than the people have made for
                        themselves. Congress saw fit to change these laws in certain grave
                        particulars, leaving the other laws in full force, and reserving to "the
                        paramount authority of the United States" to modify or abolish the same.</p>
                    <p>There is no legislative power given under this military bill to establish a
                        new criminal code. The authority given is to try and punish criminals and
                        offenders, and this proceeds upon the idea that crimes and offences have
                        been committed; but no person can be called a criminal or an offender for
                        doing an act which, when done, was not prohibited by law.</p>
                    <p>But as to the measure of punishment, it is left altogether to the Military
                        authorities with only this limitation, that the punishment to be inflicted
                        shall not be cruel or unusual.</p>
                    <p>As to the crimes or offences against the laws of the United States, the
                        military authority can take no cognizance of them, nor in any way interfere
                        with the regular administration of justice by the appropriate Federal
                        courts.</p>

<b>The Issue</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In the upcoming election, contend the editors, the key issue will be black
                    suffrage. Should the majority of voters declare themselves in favor of granting
                    blacks the ballot, the editors suggest that the Democrats will "submit" to the
                    will of the people. But should the measure not pass, Congress has no right to
                    foist it upon Pennsylvania whites.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is grand characteristic of the Democratic party, that it fights for
                        victory by an open avowal of its principles. It does not dodge an issue. It
                        does not conceal its sentiments. It prefers frankness to equivocation;
                        honesty to double dealing. It challenges the enemy to a fair fight, and it
                        can afford to do this. The party that supports the Constitution, which was
                        framed by the wisdom of our forefathers, is never obliged to resort to
                        concealment The principles which these wise men engrafted into our
                        government will stand the test of time. They may be assailed vigorously by
                        the enemies of republican institutions for awhile, but they cannot be
                        destroyed. They have taken root in the hearts of the American people, and
                        that people is not ready to surrender them at the bidding of the advocate of
                        military despotism. Constitutional liberty cannot be crushed out upon this
                        continent without a struggle , fiercer and far more bloody than that which
                        has just closed, and it is high time that this simple lesson should be
                        learned. There are rights belonging to the States, never granted to the
                        General Government, but held by them in reservation, which cannot be
                        stricken down with impunity. The people of the North may not open their eyes
                        to the truth while ten States of the South are governed by the mandates of
                        Congress, but whenever Congress attempts to trample upon the right of one of the Northern States, by assuming power which
                        does not belong to it, a howl of indignation will be heard, which, if not
                        heeded, will be the precursor of civil strife. Men do not feel the wrongs of
                        others as they do their own. They are naturally selfish; they fight harder
                        in self-defence than in defence of their fellow man. It would seem as though
                        an attack upon the rights of Northern States, similar to that made upon the
                        rights of the Southern States were needed to fire the Northern heart and
                        arouse it to a proper understanding of the intentions of the party in power. </p>
                    <p>Let it once be distinctly understood by the people that this party claiming
                        to be based upon great moral ideas, intends to build up a monster central
                        government, which shall control the domestic affairs and institutions of
                        each State, which shall made Governors mere servants of the President, which
                        shall coerce the while man into political, and (if desirable), social
                        equality with the black man, and then will come a healthy, vigorous reaction
                        which will consign it to everlasting infamy.</p>
                    <p>Against such unwarranted Congressional interference, the Democratic party of
                        Pennsylvania has entered its protest in language which cannot be
                        misunderstood. It declares the "Federal Government supreme within its
                        Constitutional limits." This is right and proper. It was the idea intended
                        by the framers of the Constitution. The officers of the Federal Government,
                        for everything they desire to do, must scarch in that instrument for their
                        warrant, either expressly given, or by clear implication, and whenever they
                        exercise authority for which they can not find such a warrant, to that
                        extent they become usurpers and forfeit their claim to the confidence and
                        allegiance of the people.</p>
                    <p>The historian who, in after years, shall bring to his work an unbiased
                        unprejudiced mind, will faithfully record the assumptions of arbitrary
                        powers and gross violations of the fundamental law which we now charge upon
                        the party in power.</p>
                    <p>It is a source of regret that these institutions of the Constitution do not
                        belong wholly to the past. Had they only been attributable to a state of
                        civil war, in which the passions of men usually run riot, they might have
                        been forgiven and perhaps forgotten. But it is not so. The whole country is
                        in a state of peace, and yet, this lawless disposition remains unsubdued and
                        further infringements upon the rights of the States are proposed-nay are
                        actual being made. In ten States South, the elective franchise is controlled
                        by Congress, and it has some notion of attempting to regulate it in our own
                        State and the other States of the North. When that attempt is made it must
                        be met unflinchingly.-The right of the State to regulate the elective
                        franchise within its limits, must be maintained peaceably if we can forcibly
                        if we must. Our platform utters no uncertain sound in this particular. The
                        forth resolution is as follows:</p>
                    <p>4. Each State having under the Constitution the executive right to prescribe
                        the qualifications of its own electors, we proclaim as a usurpation and an
                        outrage the establishment of negro suffrage in any of the States by the
                        exercise of Federal power; and we shall resist to the last resort the
                        threatened measures of the leaders of the Republican party to interfere by
                        acts of Congress with the regulation of the elective franchise in the State
                        of Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that the Republican Convention in session this day, will
                        have the candor and courage to disclose itself in favor of negro-suffrage in
                        Pennsylvania.-Their brethren of Ohio have done so unequivocally. Why not
                        make it an issue here? We hope that the Convention will do this for the
                        reason that we are "ready for the question"-shall the negro vote in
                        Pennsylvania? And we are ready to submit to the fairly expressed will of the
                        majority of the electors of this commonwealth. If our citizens desire
                        negro-suffrage, let them have the opportunity to say so. They are anxious
                        for the opportunity. If a majority shall declare in favor of it, bitter as
                        the pill will be, we will swallow it.</p>
                    <p>But if it shall be rejected by our people at the polls, and Congress shall
                        attempt to force it upon us, we will not swallow the pill, nor will we
                        advise others to do so.-Congress must be taught that the sovereign people
                        will not wink at the subversion of their Constitution by their
                        servants.-This question must be submitted fairly to the people of the State
                        before negro-suffrage will be tolerated. Hence we hail with special
                        commendation this resolution of our Convention and bespeak for it the
                        careful earnest consideration of all conservative men. It is an issue which
                        must be met. The question will, sooner or later, come before you for your
                        decision and you ought not wish to shirk if. The responsibility upon you is
                        great. The prosperity of our grand old commonwealth, and the stability of
                        our National Government may be endangered by the introduction of this new
                        element into our political system. Pennsylvanians! are you willing that
                        Congress shall force you to live on terms of perfect equality with the
                        negro? Get yourselves ready form the question.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The writer, in company with Judge Kimmell, W. S. Stenger and C. M. Duncan,
                        Esqs., as was announced to our readers, recently made a tour of observation
                        through the famous Shenandoah Valley, in the State of Virginia. We left home
                        on Monday morning, the 10th inst., were absent just nine days, and
                        penetrated the Valley to Staunton, the county seat of Augusta county,
                        distant 192 miles from Chambersburg by the turnpike road. Traveling in a
                        two-horse private conveyance, the company being congenial, the weather being
                        remarkably fine, and the face of nature presenting a most gorgeous aspect
                        arrayed in her robe of deep green, intermingled with variegated colors of
                        richest hue, all conspired to fill that measure of enjoyment and pleasure
                        which was anticipated from the journey. There was naught to mar the pleasure
                        of the trip, and everywhere on our route we were greeted by the citizens of
                        the "old Dominion" with that open-hearted kindness and generous hospitality
                        for which Virginians have been so pre-eminently distinguished from time
                        immemorial.</p>
                    <p>As our readers are doubtless anxious to hear something about the region of
                        the country through which we passed, we will proceed to give them a hasty
                        sketch of our tour. First then the</p>
                    <p>UPWARD TRIP.</p>
                    <p>The evening of the first day at our journey found us snugly quartered at the
                        United States Hotel, in Martinsburg, the county seat of Berkeley county.
                        Here me met Major E. S. Troxell, our old friend David C. Byers, and others,
                        formerly of Franklin county. They all expressed themselves well satisfied
                        with their new location, and seemed to be flourishing pecuniarily. Major
                        Troxell holds the position of Clerk of the Circuit Court, quite a lucrative
                        position.-After partaking of a bountiful supper to satisfy the craving
                        demands of our "inner man," and feeling refreshed and re-invigorated
                        thereby, we took a stroll around town to see the sights, accompanied by our
                        attentive and gentlemanly friend, Major Troxell. The magnificent residence
                        of the Hon. Charles J. Faulkner, Ex-Minister to France, and Ex-Member of
                        Congress, first attracted our attention. It is located immediately adjoining
                        the town, on the South side, and has 800 acres of excellent limestone land
                        attached, most of which has a fine crop of wheat upon it. The house stands
                        in from the road several hundred yards, is a plain and substantial building,
                        the architectural style of which is somewhat ancient.-Its beauty consists in
                        its surroundings. The stately forest trees, clean gravel walks and beautiful
                        flower gardens, in the front and on either side, with the hundreds of acres
                        of waving grain tinted with the golden rays of the setting sun, stretching
                        far to the Westward, presented a prospect to our view which was truly grand
                        and beautiful. Such a combination of the useful and the beautiful is rarely
                        seen. Mr. Faulkner is a lawyer of extensive practice and is universally
                        esteemed as an affable, kind and benevolent gentleman. The famous rebel spy,
                        Belle Boyd, resides here. She occupies a genteel looking house on one of the
                        principal streets of the place. The shops belonging to the Baltimore and
                        Ohio Railroad Company, which road runs by the town, are located at this
                        point, in which hundreds of hands are at work. We were told that the company
                        pays out every month at this point upwards of $40,000 which naturally
                        stimulates trade and makes Martinsburg, quite a brisk town. It certainly
                        gives evidence of rapid improvement and seems to be extending itself
                        Northward from the railroad. We heard the prediction made by some of its
                        citizens that in three or four years its population will be doubled. It is
                        now about four thousand.</p>
                    <p>The next morning we bade adieu to our host of the "United States," Mr. Ramer,
                        who, by the way is a clever gentleman and knows how to keep a hotel, and
                        took our departure for "Winchester town," twenty-two miles distant, where we
                        landed about noon, and "put up" at the Taylor Hotel,--Here we met hosts of
                        friends and congenial spirits who vied with each other in their efforts to
                        make our stay in their midst as pleasant as possible. Meeting with such
                        agreeable and intelligent social companions as Robert W. Hunter, Esq.,
                        editor of the Times , Major Harry K. Douglas,
                        formerly a class-mate of Mr. Stenger, Mr Coffroth, our whilom friend Charlie
                        Hensel, whose genial face greeted us so cordially shortly after our arrival,
                        and others whose names we cannot now recall, conduced to make our stay in
                        Winchester exceedingly pleasant. In the afternoon, accompanied by some of
                        our friends, we visited the Cemeteries and other points of interest. There
                        are two large cemeteries here, adjoining each other, for the reception of
                        the remains of soldiers who died or were killed in battle in the Valley of
                        Virginia during the war-one for the Federal and the other for the
                        Confederate dead. They are both handsomely laid our and the graves made to
                        range in regular rows. The Confederate Cemetery was gotten up by the private
                        subscription, under the superintendence of a lady of Winchester, whose name
                        we have forgotten, who devotes her whole time and attention to its
                        ornamentation. It was but recently dedicated, Hon. Henry A. Wise delivering
                        the dedicatory oration. The Federal Cemetery will be a fine affair when it
                        is completed, the cost of which, of course is paid out of the National
                        Treasury. A burial corps is still actively engaged in bringing in the
                        remains of the dead and depositing them in their last resting place. The
                        spring West of town, from which it is supplied with water, is a mammoth
                        affair. The waste water thrown off, after supplying the town, would be
                        sufficient to supply several other towns of the same size. Winchester is a
                        beautiful country town, in general appearance not unlike Chambersburg before
                        the burning, lying in the midst of a fertile region of country, and
                        surrounded by numerous handsome private residences.-There is considerable
                        wealth here and the people are noted for their intelligence and refinement. </p>
                    <p>The third day's travel brought us to New Market, a pleasant village of about
                        eight hundred inhabitants, in Shenandoah county, forty-nine miles South of
                        Winchester, where we remained overnight. The vicinity of New Market was the
                        scene of a severe battle during the war, between "Stonewall" Jackson and
                        General Seigel, in which Seigel was badly whipped. On this day we stopped at
                        Woodstock for dinner, which is located about mid-way between Winchester and
                        New Market, and is the county seat of Shenandoah county. It has the
                        appearance of being a very old town, and is scarcely larger than New Market.
                        Here we met several very clever gentlemen among whom were Capt. Fountaine,
                        who informed us that he had visited our town in the summer of 1863, as an
                        officer in Lee's army, Robert Bragonier, Esq., an acquaintance, and formerly
                        a class-mate of C. M. Duncan, and Dr. Krebs, formerly of Adams county, Pa.
                        These gentlemen all treated us with great kindness and civility. The route
                        of this day's travel brought us over historic ground, having passed the
                        battle-fields of Kernstown, Cedar Mountain, Fisher's Hill, Mt. Jackson and
                        New Market to the latter of which we have already alluded. Many evidences of
                        the bloody strife are still plainly visible.</p>
                    <p>Our next objective point was Harrisonburg, the county town of Rockingham
                        county, eighteen miles form New Market. Here we were greeted most cordially
                        and entertained most hospitably as by a genial and clever set of gentlemen
                        as it has ever been our good fortune to meet anywhere.-Messrs. Warman
                        &amp; Yost of the Register , Cushen &amp;
                        Sheiry, of the Old Commonwealth, J. D. Price,
                        Esq., and others whom we met there, will please consider our whole party
                        their debtors for their kindly greeting and the assiduous attentions they
                        bestowed upon us during the brief period we remained in their midst. We were
                        only sorry that we could not remain longer. Harrisonburg is a pleasant town
                        of probably 5,000 inhabitants. It is expected that the Manassas Gap Railroad
                        will be rebuilt, and completed to this point before long, when a new impetus
                        will be given to the trade of the place which must result in the rapid
                        improvement of the town and the developments of the material resources of
                        the surrounding country. We consider this one of the best points in the
                        Valley for the investment of capital. Good limestone land in this country
                        can be bought at from forty to eighty dollars per acre, according to
                        locality and improvements. Our Pennsylvania farmers, who contemplate
                        emigrating to Virginia, would do well to visit this part of the Valley
                        before purchasing. On invitation, we visited the office of Mr. J. D. Price,
                        who showed us specimens of copper and iron ore, procured in the adjacent
                        mountains, probably as rich as any to be found on the globe. He also showed
                        us some fine specimens of bituminous coal. Mr. Price is the owner of large
                        tracts of these mineral lands. He is also an agent for the sale of real
                        estate, and is doing an extensive business in that line. Persons desiring
                        information in regard to lands in this portion of the Valley should address
                        Mr. Price, at Harrisonburg. </p>
                    <p>Bidding adieu to our good friends at Harrisonburg, after several hours of
                        most pleasant intercourse, we resumed our winding way for Staunton, the
                        extreme Southern point of our journey, where we arrived about seven o'clock
                        the same evening.-Here we took up our abode for the time being at the
                        American Hotel, a first class Hotel kept by a first class man-Col. Charles
                        T. O'Ferrall, one of natures true noblemen. Col. O'Ferrall is an intelligent
                        accomplished gentleman and show us every attention necessary to make our
                        stay at his house pleasant and agreeable. His narration of certain thrilling
                        incidents of the late war, in which he was a prominent actor, was highly
                        interesting and entertaining to our party.</p>
                    <p>Staunton is a handsome, thriving town of some six thousand inhabitants,
                        surrounded by a succession of high hills, which completely overlook the
                        place, giving it a most romantic and picturesque appearance.-There are many
                        fine buildings in the town and we noticed many evidences of energy and
                        business activity among the inhabitants. It is located on the Virginia
                        Central Railroad, running to Richmond, which makes it a trading point of
                        considerable importance. The State Lunatic Asylum and Deaf, Dumb and Blind
                        Institution are both located here and are said to be the finest institutions
                        of the kind in the country. There are about six hundred inmates in both
                        institutions at the present time. The buildings immediately adjoin the town
                        and are large and elegant structures with spacious and handsomely ornamented
                        grounds attached. We had the pleasure of meeting Capt. Garber, one of the
                        editors of the "Valley Virginian," and Mr.
                        Hotchkiss, topographical engineer, both elegant gentlemen, who placed us
                        under obligations for the kind attention. We regret that we did not get to
                        see our editorial brethren of the "Spectator "
                        and "Vindicator ." We had specially designed upon
                        them but our morning walk around town was extended to such a length, viewing
                        the various points of interest, that when we returned to the hotel we felt
                        too much fatigued and oppressed with heat to renew it. We trust our friends
                        will accept this apology for our apparent neglect, taking the will for the
                        deed. Augusta County is one of the largest as well as one of the richest
                        counties in the State. The land is somewhat more rolling than that of the
                        counties through which we had passed, but equally as good if not superior.
                        The bar at this place is said to be the ablest in the State. Hon. A. H. H.
                        Stuart, Hon. John B. Baldwin, and others, equally eminent in their
                        profession, reside here. </p>
                    <p>HOMEWARD BOUND.</p>
                    <p>After spending a night and half a day most pleasantly in a pleasant town
                        among pleasant people, we took our departure from Staunton on our homeward
                        journey. Here we left the turnpike for the first time, heading to the North
                        Eastward, on a clay road for Weyer's cave, 17 miles distant from Staunton,
                        where we arrived on Friday evening-the fifth day of our trip-and were
                        hospitably entertained overnight by a genial and clever gentleman named
                        Mohler.-Mr. Mohler at one time had a large house near the cave and
                        maintained an extensive establishment for the accommodation of visitors, but
                        unfortunately a year or two ago his house was burned, having caught fire
                        accidentally. It is his intention to rebuild and refit his establishment as
                        soon as he can procure the necessary means. Accompanied by a guide and with
                        torch in hand we made an exploration of the cave the same evening. This cave
                        is truly a wonderful natural curiosity. It extends under a high hill a
                        distance of half a mile, branching off in various directions in caverns of
                        immense proportions with stalactite and stalagmite formations, of every
                        conceivable shape and size, overhanging the arches, piled up on either side
                        and raising their grotesque heads from the floors beneath, altogether
                        presenting a scene of varied grandeur and beauty unequaled by anything in
                        nature or art which we had ever witnessed. These stalactites are formed by
                        the dripping of the water from the ceiling of the cave, leaving a part of
                        its substance in a hardened form attached to the rock above. Stalagmites are
                        formed in the same manner only beginning on the floor where the water falls
                        and forming upwards. The process of formation is very slow, and some of the
                        immense stalagmites found in this cave must have been millions of years in
                        forming. The various apartments of the cave are designated by different
                        names.-For instance one room is called the "Cathedral" with a large
                        stalactite hanging in the centre, shaped like a chandelier, and a large
                        formation on the rocks to the right as you enter, resembling an organ,
                        which, by running a stick over it, gives distinctly all the musical sounds
                        in the scale. Another room is called the "bridal chamber." Here the outlines
                        of a bed are clear and well defined, with other formations giving a
                        tolerably accurate representation of a bed chamber. The largest room in the
                        cave is called "Washington Hall," named so we presume from the fact that in
                        the centre stands an immense stalagmite, some eight or ten feet high, and
                        which, when viewed at some distance, has the appearance of a marble statue
                        of General Washington. This Hall is 300 feet in length, running in a
                        straight line, has an average width of about 20 feet, and the ceiling is
                        about 25 feet high. In former times it was the custom of the people in this
                        section of Virginia to celebrate the 4th of July in the cave, on which
                        occasions this hall would be brilliantly illuminated. Another large room is
                        called the "ball-room." But we must forbear. Anything like an adequate
                        description of this wonderful curiosity of nature would fill a volume. We
                        have neither the space or ability for the task.-We would simply add, that to
                        be appreciated it must be seen, and that it will amply repay anyone to
                        travel several hundred miles to see it.</p>
                    <p>Bidding adieu to our kind host at the cave, we turned our faces towards
                        Harrisonburg, in order to regain the turnpike. Passing the battle-fields of
                        Port Republic and Cross Keys on our route, where Jackson whipped Fremont and
                        Shields in turn on two successive days, we arrived in Harrisonburg in time
                        for dinner. After again spending an hour or two in social intercourse with
                        our friends there, we resumed our homeward journey, passing over the same
                        route to Winchester, which we traveled on the upward trip. Stopping over
                        Saturday night at Mt. Jackson, a small village in Shenandoah county, we
                        arrived in Winchester on Sunday evening in time to attend service in the
                        Episcopal Church, beneath which rest the remains of Lord Fairfax, one of the
                        pioneers of the Valley of Virginia. Here we were again most cordially
                        greeted by our friends whose acquaintance we formed on our upward trip.</p>
                    <p>Leaving Winchester on Monday morning we took the Berryville and Charlestown
                        pike, passing through Frederick, Clark and Jefferson counties to
                        Shepherdstown, on the Potomac river, now the county seat of Jefferson
                        county, where we arrived the same evening. We stopped at Charlestown for
                        dinner. This is a pleasant town of probably two thousand inhabitants and was
                        formerly the county seat. It was here that old John Brown and his
                        confederates in crime were imprisoned, tried, and executed. The jail and
                        Court House in which these criminals were confined and tried were almost
                        totally demolished during the war by northern soldiers. Whether this was
                        done by authority or not, it was an exhibition of petty malice anything but
                        creditable to our soldiery.</p>
                    <p>During our brief stay in Charlestown we took occasion to call upon B. F.
                        Beall, Esq., the talented and spicy editor of the Spirit
                            of Jefferson, and his estimable little wife, whom we knew in our
                        youthful and happier days, many long years ago, when we were a bashful
                        country lad and she a timid blushing maiden just ripening into womanhood.
                        Though the lapse of years has somewhat dimmed the sparkling eyes and faded
                        the blooming cheeks of youthful memory, we were nevertheless gratified to
                        find her so well preserved in person, and surrounded with all the comforts
                        of domestic life, including her husband, Mr. Beall, and some half a dozen
                        "little Bealls."-May she live to present her husband with "half a dozen
                        more." </p>
                    <p>Shepherdstown, where we stayed the last night of the trip, is a rickety old
                        place, apparently of no great importance. The new Court House is quite
                        handsome building though not large. The new jail is also a neat structure.
                        In the evening here we tried fishing for bass in the Potomac, but owing to
                        the scarcity of bait-fish, we did not succeed. Mr. Duncan caught one  about six inches
                        long. Leaving Shepherdstown on Tuesday morning, and coming by way of
                        Sharpsburg and Hagerstown, we arrived at home about 5 o'clock that evening,
                        feeling somewhat fatigued but greatly pleased with our excursion, having
                        traveled all that distance without meeting the slightest accident of any
                        kind. </p>
                    <p>We have thus hastily and imperfectly noticed the leading points touched on
                        our route. Next week we shall make some general observations on the region
                        of country through which we passed-its topography, the character of the
                        soil, the ravages of the late war, the political sentiments of the people,
                        &amp;c. For the present we must desist for want of space.</p>
                    <p>H.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In the Internal Revenue service there are about two hundred and forty
                        Assessors and the rame number of Collectors-all at high salaries. Each one
                        of these has a number of Assistants at good salaries, besides a main office
                        stocked with well-paid clerks-Then there is office rent; the heaviest kind
                        of stationery bills; inspectors, detectives, and other incidentals. Many
                        million dollars are thus annually consumed in collecting the revenue, whilst
                        by another process, the great bulk of the expense might be saved, and the
                        army of taxgatherers allowed to enter into the ranks of productive industry,
                        where their labor is so badly needed.</p>
                    <p>If the Federal Government would annually levy upon each State for its
                        proportionate share of the public debt and interest, and leave the
                        collection entirely with the states, an immense saving of money would be the
                        result. It costs the people of Pennsylvania much less to collect the various
                        taxes than it does the Government to collect a similar amount; and a slight
                        addition to salaries and a small increase in the number of the ordinary
                        assessors and collectors is all that would be required. Of course a
                        modification of the method of laying and collecting the taxes would result.
                        The petty system of stamps, upon a block of matches &amp;c. would be
                        abrogated, Property and wealth of every kind would be taxed in bulk and not
                        in trifling detail, thereby economizing the collection and nowise preventing
                        the dissemination of the burdens equally among the taxable inhabitants
                        according to their business and means.</p>
                    <p>A system such as the present, requiring tow sets of officials and half or
                        quarter of the collections to pay the expenses is entirely wrong, and should
                        be done away with-The burdens of the people are entirely too great now to
                        warrant adhesion to the extravagant and costly bureaus and departments which
                        sprung up during the reckless period of war. Business of all kinds is
                        shackled and kept down by the taxgatherer. The growth of material wealth has
                        been so check- that the revenues have fallen off from thirty to seventy-five
                        per cent. within the past year. Still the expenses collection have not
                        decreased in the least. It has become necessary, therefore, to consult
                        economy in every department of the Government, and unless the present rulers
                        in the Rump Congress shall shortly become inspired with reason and honesty
                        enough to abandon their political aggrandizement schemes and institute
                        economical measures in public affairs, the people will cast them off
                        forever. Extravagance, recklessness and folly have had their day. The people
                        now want retrenchment and economy. and they are determined to elect no men
                        who are not honest and sensible upon this question.-Patriot &amp; Union</p>

                        which the above reward will be promptly paid, viz: One Silver Communion Set,
                        consisting of 11 pieces, engraved as a donation to "Selon Presbyterian

                    <p>These articles, with at least five times their value in other materials of

                        A. Three hundred dollars will be paid for the communion Set, (which only

                    <p>The New York World  commenting on this
                        advertisement says: "Within the past two years, our New Orleans and other
                        Southern correspondents have more than once written to the World  that responsible persons were willing to pay
                        handsome rewards-in most instances far exceeding the pecuniary value of
                        these stolen goods, for the return of plate, pictures, libraries and
                        souvenirs of all sorts, which were stolen from private houses of the South
                        during the war. New England villages are full of such plunder, and in some
                        instances these stolen articles are brazenly paraded as "rebel relics," or
                        "secession trophies." It is time these things were restored to their owners.
                        There is an opportunity in many instances to receive more than their value,
                        and the money can be safely pocketed as a "reward of loyalty," There may be
                        a time when a search warrant will strip some of these New England houses of
                        "relics" and "trophies," and place the unlawful possessors in an unpleasant
