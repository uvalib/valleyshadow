                    <p>Permit me, through the columns of the central organ of the Democracy of
                        Pennsylvania, to add another to the number of good names already brought
                        forward for the nomination of Judge of the Supreme Court. The name I have to
                        propose is that of Hon. Francis M. Kimmell, of Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>Judge Kimmell has had the advantage of ten years experience on the Common
                        Pleas bench, together with an active practice at the bar, both before his
                        elevation to the bench and since his retirement from it. He ranks among the
                        ablest lawyers in central Pennsylvania. To a very vigorous intellect he adds
                        a fine physical constitution, and he is not yet so far advanced in years as
                        to leave room for the least apprehension that his mental or physical powers
                        would experience any decline during the judicial term for which it is
                        proposed to nominate and elect him.</p>
                    <p>Judge Kimmell is a gentleman of fine personal appearance and engaging
                        manners, and is very popular wherever he is known. His political principles
                        are sound, and he is in all respects worthy to be selected as the standard
                        bearer of Democracy in the approaching contest.</p>

<b>Radical Progress</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor ruminates against the Radicals' continued attempts to foist
                    "social equality" upon the people of Pennsylvania. As an example, he cites the
                    bill recently introduced in the legislature that would require churches and
                    other public assemblies, theaters, and opera houses to "be open to all classes,

                    <p>Scarcely a day passes but we have some fresh evidence of the predominating
                        principle of the Radical party-what their designs are and what their
                        continuance in power will result in. Their efforts are untiring to force
                        their colored brethren into social equality, and a bill giving them
                        preference in the cars is already enacted into a law until some new and
                        equally disgusting measure is hatched out. The following bill was introduced
                        by Mr. Mann, a member from Potter [unclear] county, and will doubtless meet
                        with the same success that the negro car bill did. It will be decidedly
                        refreshing, during the coming summer, to have a "sweet-scented" darkie
                        posted up beside you in church, on a hot Sunday afternoon, or in any public
                        assembly have them forcing their way into prominence, as they never fail to
                        do, in assertion of their new rights. For all these blessings [unclear] we
                        have to thank a Radical legislature. The voters of the State should not
                        forget this. The follow is the substance of the bill:</p>
                    <p>That all churches, public assemblies, theatres, and opera houses shall be
                        open to all classes, without distinction of color, and
                            every officer or employee interfering with any person without
                            distinction of color, from occupying any seat in such church, theatre or
                            opera house, such person or persons so offending upon conviction
                            thereof, shall undergo an imprisonment in the county prison of not less
                            than six months, nor more than two years, and the corporation whose
                            agent or employee hath so offended shall pay a fine of not less than
                            five hundred dollars, nor more than one thousand dollars, at the
                            discretion of the court.</p>

<b>The Democratic Party and the Future</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article criticizes politicians who claim to be opposed to the "extreme
                    measures of the Radicals," yet refuse to join the Democrats on the grounds that
                    the party can "never hope to attain success" in the future because of its
                    position during the war. Without the party, the piece explains, the
                    "Conservative masses have no efficient organization ... to discipline the
                    anti-Radical forces of the nation, and make them effective at the polls."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a class of politicians in the country whose mouth-piece is the New York Times, who profess to be opposed to the
                        extreme measures of the Radicals, but whose prejudices will not allow them
                        to co-operate with the Democratic party against them and in support of the
                        wise and conciliatory measures of the President.-They affect to believe that
                        the Democratic party became so odious during the war that it can never hope
                        to attain success; hence they argue the necessity of abandoning the
                        Democratic organization and forming, a conservative party under another
                        name, whose principles and aims would be the same. Now this is all nonsense.
                        In the first place, it is not true that the Democratic party became odious
                        during the war.-History will vindicate the soundness of its principles and
                        the correctness of its position during that period. And the recent
                        Connecticut election most emphatically disproves the allegation that it
                        cannot attain success under its present organization. In the second place,
                        it would be very impolitic to disband an old and well-drilled organization
                        to make room for a new party, necessarily but imperfectly organized and
                        equipped, in order to do battle in behalf of the same cause. The proposition
                        lacks the first principles of common sense. It has been well said that "it
                        would be just as sensible to look for community of purpose and action on the
                        field from the use of militia, as for successful political action to be had
                        against a party so thoroughly drilled as the Republican party is, by a party
                        disbanded, under a new name." </p>
                    <p>On this subject the Age reasons in the following
                        pertinent language: "It is very evident that Radical rule can only be broken
                        by a union of all the friends of republicanism upon a common ground and for
                        a common purpose. That purpose must be to reinstate the Constitution as the
                        supreme law of the land, to restore the States to their old places in the
                        Union, to repeal the obnoxious military reconstruction bill, and to allow
                        the people of all portions of the Union representation in the councils of
                        the nation. This is a platform on which all true friends of the Republic can
                        certainly unite. As to minor details, there may and will be differences of
                        opinion. Local causes may induce the people of the East and West to desire
                        that the tariff and revenue laws should be presented in certain aspects, but
                        on the great fundamental question of reconstruction, they need not be
                        separated, if they will take counsel of their patriotic impulses and not
                        lend themselves to the arts of the demagogue, or the uncertain guides of
                        passion and prejudice. </p>
                    <p>How can such a union of patriotic men, for such a high and holy purpose be
                        effected, but upon the platform and through the agency of the Democratic
                        party? What other organization can they trust? What other party can present
                        such a record of devotion to the great fundamental principles upon which the
                        hopes of the Republic rest? The Radical organization has thrown overboard
                        the Constitution, and is drifting upon the tide of popular passion. They can
                        promise nothing for the future but discord, contention, and anarchy. The
                        Conservative masses have no efficient organization by means of which to
                        discipline the anti-Radical forces of the nation, and make them effective at
                        the polls. The regular army which is to confront the party in power, and
                        contend for the union of the States, the perpetuation of civil government
                        and the life of the Republic, is the Democratic party, and that fact is more
                        and more indisputable and apparent as the day of battle approaches.</p>
                    <p>The elections in all parts of the Union testify to the life and vitality of
                        the Democratic party, and also prove that the masses are looking to that
                        organization as the only hope for the future. There are no signs of decay in
                        the old constitutional party of the country. Its principles are those which,
                        if carried into practice, will re-united the States and make the nation a
                        unit from Maine to Texas, and the utility of its organization "one of the
                        chief elements of success in the canvass which is now opening, to close only
                        with the next Presidential election." The future of the nation is
                        inddissolubly wedded with that of the Democratic party, and if we are true
                        to principles, the people will into suffer them to be divorced.</p>

                    <p>The Legislature of Pennsylvania has adjourned sina
                        die. For that, God be praised! High noon of Thursday, the 11th day of
                        April, found that miserably corrupt and venal body in
                            articulo mortis. By set limitation it then expired, and a
                        majority of the members returned to their homes to render up an account to
                        constituencies which the had outraged and betrayed. Many left the State
                        Capitol with pockets well lined with "greenbacks," the bribery and fruit of
                        their shame. An honest few went forth un-enriched by any bas barter of their
                        integrity, and with their honor as men and their fair fame as
                        representatives untarnished.-We have neither time nor inclination to revert
                        in detail to the many dark transactions of this deceased Legislature. We
                        Tried, from time to time, to lay bare the corrputions of the living body;
                        but to dissect the dead and putrid carcass would be more than our nerves and
                        the olfactories of our readers could stand. </p>
                    <p>Corruption and bribery in the Legislature of Pennsylvania has come to be the
                        rule since the triumph of the Radical party-honesty and integrity the
                        exception. For a number of years past the matter has been growing constantly
                        worse. "The ring" has become a recognized institution, and the question with
                        the majority of the members has not been, not is proposed measure right, but
                        "will it pay." Venal fanatics and mousing politicians have crept into the
                        seats once occupied by honorable men, and the halls of the Senate and the
                        House has each come to be regarded as a kind of political shamble, in which
                        professed law-makers are openly bought and sold by any man, clique or
                        corporation that can afford to offer bribes. Almost every bill brought
                        forward in the Legislature which has just adjourned was made to pay toll,
                        and when ill-gotten gains grew scarce, some member of the ring would
                        introduce an act framed for the very purpose of extorting money from a
                        wealthy corporation or institution which had been created by former
                        Legislatures. Thus did a majority of the men who composed the recent
                        Legislature of Pennsylvania sit from day to day, devising schemes for
                        filling their pockets, and utterly disregarding the interests of the public.</p>
                    <p>How shall we rank them upon honor's leaves?</p>
                    <p>Fanatics fierce and blind, a pack of greedy thieves,</p>
                    <p>All they stole in service of the commonweal</p>
                    <p>Is naught to what they were disposed to steal.</p>
                    <p>The Democrats were largely in the minority in both branches of the recent
                        Legislature, and to their honor be it said, the "rings" were made up without
                        them. The Democratic leaders in both Houses constantly opposed the corrupt
                        and pernicious acts of the majority, and did the Senate good domestic
                        service by acting as a check upon the dominant faction. The public morality
                        of the Democratic party has always been of a more elevated standard than
                        that of the party now in power. With the advent of Know Nothingism, the
                        fearful corruption in the ranks of the party which stood opposed to the
                        Democracy began, and it has continually increased from year to year. If
                        there has been a lowering of the high tone of the Democratic party of
                        Pennsylvania we have not seen it, and we believe it is as ready now as ever
                        to repudiate with scorn and loathing any public man who dares to contaminate
                        his fingers with a base bribe. We hope and believe it will never lose the
                        high sense of honor which has always characterized it in the past.</p>
                    <p>The people of all parties are alike interested in seeing to it that there is
                        a speedy end put to the disgraceful scenes which marked the career of the
                        Legislature which is now happily defunct. Let them resolve, sternly to
                        effect a complete and permanent reform. As for the venal wretches who so
                        disgrace the State, if their constituents are not utterly lacking in public
                        virtue, they</p>

                    <p>An act was passed at the late session of the Legislature, incorporating a
                        company under the above name and style and title, for the purpose of
                        erecting a Market House and Public Hall in this place. The capital stock is
                        not to exceed $40,000-divided into shares of twenty-five dollars each. After
                        five hundred shares shall have been subscribed for, by not less than ten
                        persons, and ten per centium paid on said subscriptions, the stockholders
                        are authorized to elect six Directors, and organize the company. The act
                        authorizes the company to borrow money to the extent of twenty thousand
                        dollars, at such rate of interest as they shall deem expedient, and issue
                        bonds therefor. It also authorizes and empowers the Burgess and Council to
                        sell at public or private sale, the lot and building on the corner of Queen
                        and Second streets, and invest the proceeds in the bonds or stock of the
                        company. T. B. Kennedy, Jacob Zuck, D. O. Gehr, Jacob Stoffer, J. M. Sharpe,

<b>Local and Personal--Court Proceedings</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The April Term for Franklin county began on the eighth. "Quarter Session.
                    Com. vs. K. Shannon Taylor--Charge of obtaining $502 from Sheriff Doebler by
                    false pretenses; verdict, not guilty but the deft. to pay the costs of
                    prosecution. Com. vs. David B. Little--Gambling. The Deft. had set up an
                    establishment at public sales in the County, somewhat of the nature of a gift
                    enterprise, having received an Internal Revenue license to carry on that
                    business. The Court, after argument by the Counsel, were of the opinion that it
                    came within the act of Assembly prohibiting the setting up of any game of device
                    of address or hazard, and so instructed the jury. Verdict Guilty. In view,
                    however, of the fact that the Deft. had received a license to carry on this
                    business and was of the opinion that he had a right to do so, the Court made the
                    punishment as mild as possible. The Deft. was therefore sentenced to pay a fine
                    of one cent and the costs of prosecution and to be imprisoned in the County jail
                    for one day. Com. vs. Joseph Smith--Larceny of fence rails. The difficulty in
                    this case was to show that the rails had been separated from the freehold before
                    the carrying away, for such length of time as to make it larceny in law. The
                    Court was of the opinion that the proof was not clear enough. Verdict not
                    guilty. Com. vs. James Wilson and Book Bible--Larceny of one coat of the value
                    of twenty dollars from the clothing store of A. J. &amp; H. M. White.
                    Verdict, guilty. Defendant James Wilson sentenced to imprisonment in Eastern
                    Penitentiary for one year and six months; Book Bible sentenced to imprisonment
                    in Eastern Penitentiary for one year. Com. vs. Book Bible--Larceny of a silver
                    watch valued at $30 from E. Aughinbaugh's jewelry store. Verdict guilty.
                    Sentenced to two years in Eastern Penitentiary, to be completed from expiration
                    of sentence in the foregoing case. Com. vs. Benjamin Jackson--Larceny of Fence
                    Rails, property of Dr. A. H. Senseny. The jury not being able to agree was
                    discharged. Com. vs. John Anderson--Larceny of suit of clothing worth fifty
                    dollars, the property of John Middleton. Verdict guilty. Sentenced to
                    imprisonment in Eastern Penitentiary for one year and six months. Com. vs. Titus
                    Adams--Larceny of twenty chickens from the hen roost of D. S. Leisher. Verdict
                    guilty. Sentenced to imprisonment in Eastern Penitentiary for one year and six
                    months. Com. vs. Man. Hamilton--Larceny of a coat of the value of twenty dollars
                    form William Cunningham. Verdict guilty. Sentenced to imprisonment in Eastern
                    Penitentiary for one year and six months. Com. vs. Isaac Hetrick--Resistance to
                    Officer Houser and Assault and Battery with intent to kill. Verdict not guilty
                    on ground of insanity, whereupon the Court made an order sending the Defendant
                    to the Pennsylvania Lunatic Hospital. Com. vs. A. S. Clarke, alias J.
                    Long--Larceny of Postage Stamps and money of the value of $130. On the night of
                    the 25th of December, 1866, the post office at Waynesboro was entered and stamps
                    and money were stolen. The defendant was arrested in Gettysburg on this charge,
                    and brought here for trial. The evidence was entirely circumstantial but very
                    conclusive and the jury returned in a short time with a verdict of guilty. The
                    Court sentenced the defendant to imprisonment in the Eastern Penitentiary for
                    the period of two years. Com. vs. Richard Duncan--Surety of the Peace for

                    absence the defendant seduced his wife from the path of virtue, and begot a
                    child upon her body. Verdict for plaintiff for $600. Motion for a new trial on
                    the ground of excessive damages filed. Philip Long vs. George S. Crist, Executor
                    of William Crist, dec'd--Assumpsit. This suit was brought to recover for
                    services rendered by Rosanna Shaffer, now the wife of the plaintiff, during the
                    last illness of William Crist. Verdict for plaintiff $119, the amount claimed.
