<b>Lovely Women</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article focuses on the changing standards of beauty for women.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The old definition of beauty in the Roman school was the "multitude in
                        unity," (i. e. a harmony of the graces,) which is certainly a very correct
                        definition of that charming attribute, which so many of the "fair sex" sigh
                        for in vain. Of the many gifts imparted to the human family by God, that of
                        beauty is the most frequently desired, and when possessed is cherished with
                        the utmost care. We earnestly believe, that if all women could obtain a
                        certain thing, which they might desire, three-fourths would, like Paris, the
                        shepherd of Mount Ida, decide in favor of beauty. You will, therefore, we
                        hope, not be surprised, nor deem the sentiment one of infidelity, when we
                        say that mullions of Christians are now as much the adorers of the lovely
                        Goddess-Venus, as were those ancient Pagans, who bowed before images of that
                        celestial divinity, centuries ago. As some of our readers may not understand
                        the above sentence, we here say that it is merely figurative language,
                        employed to express our opinion concerning the universal estimation of
                        beauty.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, few women possess a real classical beauty, and less yet a
                        beauty which would be at all stylish or attractive, minus the assistance of
                        magnificent attire, or the extravagant use of cosmetics for facial
                        decoration, which is supposed to impart fascination; therefore we often see
                        persons of bad taste resorting to art, expecting to produce beauty, where
                        nature failed. Powder is applied to whiten and hide blemishes on a face not
                        too fair, rouge is also delicately used to impart a rose-tint to the cheeks,
                        whilst it heightens the charms of the countenance and has a similar effect
                        in "throwing out" the eyes and giving them extreme brightness. Little
                        triangles of Indian-ink are also often added around the outer corners of the
                        eyes, to give brilliancy as well as apparent size to those organs. This
                        custom, we suppose, is borrowed from the Greek or Turkish women, who were
                        wont to put round their eyes a black tincture which, at a distance, or by
                        candle-light, added very much to the blackness of them.</p>
                    <p>Actresses understand the mystery of adding "beauty spots" and toilet making
                        in a nice degree, yet even they are sometimes prone to use cosmetics to
                        excess, when the effect is palpably ridiculous. It has been said that some
                        women wear false lips, made of pink India-rubber, which are attached to thin
                        lips in a manner which defies detection, and which give a pretty pouting
                        appearance to the mouth. Whether this is correct we are unable to say, never
                        having seen any, but we can say that we received the information from a
                        reliable source.-Fine dress likewise absolutely increases the attractiveness
                        of some plain faces, and vice versa, it ofttimes
                        robs really pretty ones of their charms. Hence very few women of the
                        pristine ages were considered remarkably lovely, because the hideous
                        costumes of those antique days became few forms.-Fancy for a moment how
                        homely the majority of ancient women must have been when robed in the
                        Grecian tunic  or the Roman stola , with the hair dyed a bright yellow, after the Roman
                        mode, and bound back over the ears with ornaments of gold. </p>
                    <p>Now society requires its fair members to appear as bewitching as they
                        possibly can, and they are privileged to follow that fashion which is best
                        adapted to their complexion and form. It is, therefore, not surprising that
                        ancient history does not tell us of two beautiful Helens, or more than one
                        splendid Cleopatra; when ancient ladies had not the advantage of a variety
                        of fashions, but were compelled to wear apparel which rendered many of them
                        perfectly hideous.</p>
                    <p>But thank Jupiter even fashions change. What was deemed a graceful and
                        exquisite toilet during the medieval ages, would now, if worn by any one,
                        establish their suitability to become an inmate of an insane asylum. The
                        surcoat of cloth of gold tissue, raised with pearls, and the stomacher of
                        purple gold, similarly raised, with the large open sleeves lined with
                        chequered tissue, which was worn in the time of Anne Bolyn; or the coiffures
                        of the Revolutionary era would hardly be worn in America now if they were again heralded in Europe. Thus we may
                        live to hear what we now deem elegant and tasteful as dress, spoken of as
                        being ridiculous by those who will be living fifty years hence. </p>
                    <p>Beautiful women are growing more and more numerous every year for just this
                        reason. Mothers are now paying more attention to the development of
                        intellectual culture in their daughters, and have also come to the sensible
                        conclusion to permit them to exercise it in the open air, to skate, to dance
                        and to become equestrians, which must sooner or later render them more
                        healthful, and consequently bring the rose tint to their cheeks and
                        development to their forms. A faultlessly beautiful form is oftimes more
                        admired, than the most lovely face, because it indicates healthfulness,
                        which is always found united to loveliness. Men's ideals of beauty, however,
                        differ materially. While one may worship a pretty face mounted on a pair of
                        tongs, another of better judgement admires a symmetrical form which,
                        perhaps, bears a homely face. There are also various types and styles of
                        beauty, pertaining to various types and styles of beauty, pertaining to
                        various countries and nations. The Ionian queens of Izniir are magnificent
                        types of a beauty whose loveliness is irresistible, while the women of the
                        delightful Isle of Cyprus who are tall and stightly formed, with a gentle
                        and graciously beautiful expression of countenance-although less bewitching
                        than their brilliant sisters of Smyrna, and less magnificient than the
                        splendid Ionian women-are yet fascinatingly beautiful.</p>
                    <p>The Roman ladies were also renowned for their stately forms and classical
                        faces, and we should think deservedly so, if many of them were like Lady
                        Beatrice Cenci. Who has not had his or her thought lifted above mortal
                        beauty, when gazing upon a portrait of the immaculate face of Lady Beatrice.
                        Its wondrous beauty, sublimity of expression and look of sadness, caused by
                        misfortune, never fails to gain the admiration and sympathy of the
                        beholder.-Never was beauty more perfect, nor more magnificently developed
                        than in the splendid form and most wonderful countenance of that illustrious
                        Roman maiden. Her portrait, painted by Guido Henri, from a pencil sketch by
                        the young Florentine artist Ubaldini. Ubaldini is now preserved in the place
                        of the Princess Barberini, at Rome-a possession which neither love nor money
                        could purchase. But we must return to the original subject. Whilst some
                        women have golden hair and pale blue eyes-a style that we generally see in
                        any of the Southern States-others have hair of almost raven darkness and
                        magnificent eyes of lustrous blackness like those of the women of Italy. And
                        again, altitude is supposed to effect beauty. It is thought by many that
                        small women, as a general thing have more beautiful faces and finer forms
                        than their larger sisters of the masculine cast. This, we believe, however,
                        is merely a matter of opinion which will be doubted or believed, according
                        to the reader's taste. In like manner, what pleases the fancy of one person
                        as beau ideal, another deems hideous. It is also
                        plain that a mediumly beautiful person is seldom attractive, and is
                        therefore seldom sought after. Thus, ladies, you that are handsome are often
                        admired solely on account of your beautiful faces, and not because you have
                        attended to intellectual cultivation and refinement, which, together with a
                        noble heart, is more worthy of man's appreciation than all the charms and
                        graces Venus ever possessed. Remember this, and whilst you strive to grow
                        beautiful in form, and to preserve that loveliness when attained, remember
                        likewise, that mental and bodily beauty should attain ideal perfection
                        together; unless they do you are not truly lovely. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Only let a woman be sure that she is precious to her husband-not useful, not
                        valuable, not convenient simply, but lovely and beloved; let her be the
                        recipient of his polite and hearty attention, let her feel that her care and
                        love are noticed, appreciated and returned, let her opinion be asked, her
                        approval sought, and her judgement respected in matters of which she is
                        cognizant; in short, let only be loved, honored and cherished, in
                        fulfillment of the marriage vow, and she will be to her husband, her
                        children, and society, a well-spring of pleasure. She will bear pain, and
                        toil and anxiety, for her husband's love to her is a tower and a fortress.
                        Shielded and sheltered therein, adversity will have lost its sting.-She may
                        suffer, but sympathy will dull the edge of sorrow. A house with love in
                        it-and by love I mean love expressed in words, in looks, and deeds, for I
                        have not one spark of faith in love that never crops out-is to a house
                        without love, as a person to a machine; one is life, the other is
                        mechanism-the unloved woman may have bread just as light, a house just as
                        tidy as the other, but the latter has a spring of beauty about her, a
                        joyousness, and aggressive, penetrating and pervading brightness to which
                        the former is a stranger. The deep happiness in her heart shines out in her
                        face. She gleams over it. It is airy, and graceful, and warm and welcoming
                        with her presence; she is full in devices and plots, and sweet surprise for
                        husband and family. She has never done with the romance and poetry of life.
                        She herself is a lyric poem setting herself to all pure and gracious
                        melodies. Humble household ways and duties have for her a golden
                        significance. The prize makes her calling high, and the end sanctifies the
                        means, "Love is Heaven, and Heaven is Love."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As previously announced, the undersigned have sold THE VALLEY SPIRIT
                        establishment to Messrs. J. M. Cooper, W. S. Stenger and Augustus Duncan,
                        possession to be given on the 1st day of September 1867.-Our connection with
                        the paper will, therefore, cease with this issue. It may be proper here to
                        remark that, whilst the transfer is only to be made on the 1st of September,
                        according to the terms of the sale the ownership of the incoming proprietors
                        really dates from the 1st of July last-the commencement of the present
                        volume-from which time the proceeds go the business of the office go to the
                        new firm. All accounts for subscription, advertising and job work,
                        therefore, will be collected by them from that date.</p>
                    <p>During the eventful period in which we had the control and management of the
                        SPIRIT, we labored earnestly, and to the best of our abilities, for the
                        dissemination of sound political truths among the people, and for the
                        perpetuation of that grand system of Constitutional Government founded by
                        WASHINGTON and his compeers, and transmitted by them to us as our richest
                        and most precious inheritance. In maintaining principles to this end we
                        necessarily advocated the policy and measures of the Democratic party, which
                        is the only party now existing in the country whose principles are in
                        harmony with those underlying our Republican system of Government. If our
                        efforts have contributed in the least degree towards bringing back the
                        administration of the Government to the principles of its founders, and to
                        the re-establishment of the Constitution as the supreme law of the land, we
                        shall consider ourselves amply rewarded.</p>
                    <p>Having taken charge of the paper in the midst of a bloody civil war, when the
                        freedom of the press was virtually suppressed by the military tyranny
                        emanating form the war Department at Washington and the spirit of violence
                        which prevailed among a portion of the people all over the country, our
                        pathway was beset from the start with more than ordinary difficulties. To
                        doubt the wisdom of the war policy of the Administration was then considered
                        treason, and a bold and fearless defense of the Constitution was regarded as
                        a crime. He who had the boldness to exercise his rights as freeman, in the
                        discussion of the political questions of the times, was in constant danger
                        of suffering the horrors of a Bastile or the vengeance of the mob. Under
                        these adverse circumstances we commenced our editorial career. But conscious
                        of the justice of our cause and the purity of our purpose, we went straight
                        forward in the line of duty, regardless of the threats of power, or the
                        howlings of the rabble. With fidelity to principle as the guiding star of
                        our action, we could at all times say, in the language of St. Paul when
                        persecuted in like manner: "None of these things move us."</p>
                    <p>But "time at last sets all things even." The passions and prejudices
                        engendered by the war are rapidly becoming extinct. The "sober second
                        thought" has returned to the people, and reason, in a great measure, has
                        resumed its sway. Freedom of speech is again tolerated, and the press is no
                        longer threatened with mobs and dungeons. Under these favorable auspices we
                        resign the paper into the hands of our successors. They have our best wises
                        for their success and prosperity, and the paper under their management, we
                        hazard nothing in saying, will maintain fully its high standing as a first
                        class country newspaper.</p>
                    <p>The new proprietors are all well known to the people of Franklin county.
                        Anything we could say in their behalf, would therefore be superfluous. Mr.
                        Cooper was one of the founders of the paper, and edited it for many years
                        most ably and successfully. Mr. Stenger's known abilities as a ready and
                        vigorous writer will add great strength to the paper, and Mr. Duncan's
                        abilities as a financier cannot fail to make its business operations a
                        pecuniary success.</p>
                    <p>In taking formal leave of our patrons, we desire to return them our thanks
                        for the generous support and many acts of kindness which we received at
                        their hands, during our connection with the paper. We bespeak for our
                        successors a continuation of that generous patronage and sympathy which was
                        so liberally bestowed upon us.</p>

<b>The Radical County Ticket</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>At the Radical County Convention held on August 20th, candidates for the
                    upcoming county elections were selected. The Republican ticket is dominated by
                    members of the McClure faction and, say the editors, "is essentially a weak
                    one."<br>(Names in announcement:  Theodore McGowan,  W. W. Paxton,  S. F. Greenawalt,  A. H. Etter,  John E. Maclay,  Addison Imbrie,  N. M. Witherow,   McClure, Col.  Stumbaugh)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radical County Convention met in the Court House, on Tuesday, the 20th
                        inst., and put in nomination the following ticket:</p>
                    <p>For Assembly, Theodore McGowan, of Fayetteville; for Associate Judge, W. W.
                        L. Paxton, of Chambersburg; for Treasurer, S. F. Greenawalt, of
                        Chambersburg; for Commissioner, A. H. Etter, of Green; for Director of the
                        Poor, John E. Maclay, of Lurgan; for Jury Commissioner, Addison Imbrie, of
                        Antrim; for Auditor, N. M. Witherow, of Metal.</p>
                    <p>The ticket is essential a weak one. The closest contest was for Treasurer.
                        This was a fight between the "Grand Army of the Republic," the "Good
                        Templars" and "Sons of Temperance" on the one side, and the anti-temperance
                        element on the other. The "G. A. R's and "Good Templars" were beaten on the
                        eleventh ballot, and Saml. F. Greenawalt received the nomination by a bare
                        majority. The action of the various temperance organizations in the county
                        on this nomination will show whether their loud professions mean anything,
                        or whether they are mere empty sound.</p>
                    <p>The Convention was controlled exclusively in the interest of the McClure
                        faction.-The Cameron men had no show at all. Col. Stumbaugh's name was not
                        even mentioned in the Convention. The nomination of McGowan for Assembly,
                        was doubtless intended as a special rebuke to Cameron and his friends, he
                        having been the President of the anti-Cameron Convention which met here last
                        fall and voted instructions to Col. Stumbaugh on the Senatorial
                    question.</p>

                    <p>Should Grant accept the assignment to the War Department in the interest of
                        Johnson, for the purpose of deposing Mr. Stanton, and becoming the
                        Instrument in the hands of a corrupt administration for the disgracing of
                        the brave officers, who gained their glory under him and reflected no mean
                        share of their own fame upon their Commander-in-chief;--if, we say, General
                        Grant could show himself capable of such meanness, he has not renown enough
                        to save him from the just indignation of the people, who love and honor him
                        for the services he rendered the country, and would abandon him as soon as
                        he proved false to his own good name. The cause is higher than any man,
                        however famous, and whosoever opposes it will go down</p>
                    <p>That is, the Radical cause of disunion is higher than the cause of the Union
                        for which Grant fought. Hence, any man, however high his name, who will not
                        worship the false Gods set up by the Radical party, must be put "down." Such
                        is the spirit of Radicalism. Is it not astounding that any decent man in the
                        country should be found willing to affiliate with so infamous a party?</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>IN April last the Anti-Slavery Standard predicted
                        a split in the Radical party, and the signs of the times indicate a
                        realization of the prediction. The July session of Congress witnessed
                        certain croppings out of Radical dissatisfaction, and Mr. Stevens proclaimed
                        his belief that the fall election in this State would show a defeat of the
                        party now in power. Fessenden and Sherman came in for a full share of abuse
                        from the managers of the party machine, and each gave blow for blow in
                        hearty, downright earnest. The negro policy rampant in Tennessee, and
                        applauded by a portion of the Radicals headed by Brownlow, is repudiated and
                        denounced by another portion of the party. And now we have the news from
                        California that the Radical party is split there. The Radical Convention at
                        Sacrament nominated a regular ticket.-This was followed by an opposition
                        Radical Convention, which nominated a "Republican Union" ticket, which meets
                        support form the most influential Radical journals of San Francisco and
                        Sacramento. In our own State the anti-repudiators in Allegheny county, and
                        other portions of the State, are clamoring against Judge Williams, and
                        demanding that he shall give his views upon the question of repudiation,
                        while Stevens and the Anti-Stevens wing of the party are tugging at each
                        other's throats in mortal strife. The "cohesive power of public plunder"
                        still keeps the Radical party in seeming union, but the end is fast
                        approaching. The true friends of the country should take heart from this
                        fact, and push on the column of attack with courage, zeal and
                    determination.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the last session of our State Legislature a company was incorporated under
                        the name of the Chambersburg Market and Hall company". The object of the
                        creation of this company, at plainly indicated by its name, was the erection
                        of a Market House and Public Hall is this borough. No one we presume, will
                        question the propriety, or deny the necessity, for the establishment of such
                        an institution in this place. While other towns of less population have good
                        markets, well regulated and well stocked with everything required by the
                        necessity and luxury of its citizens, chambersburg has been without one, and
                        its people been obligated to forage through the country for vegetables,
                        butter, eggs, fowls, &amp;c or gather them up from hucksters on the
                        street at whatever price may be demanded. The old Market House on the corner
                        of Second and Queen Streets, owing to its miserable plan of construction,
                        and out of the way situation has never answered the purpose of its erection,
                        and very soon after it was opened it degenerated into a big butcher shop, a
                        resort for rowdy boys and loafers; becoming finally a nuisance instead of a
                        convenience to the public.</p>
                    <p>The wants and necessities of our people require just such an establishment as
                        is contemplated in the act incorporating the Company we have spoken of. It
                        is conceded by all, that a closed, comfortable House, would bring more
                        Farmers with their products to our market, and consequently more articles
                        for sale, thus inducing competition and enabling our citizens to purchase
                        their marketing cheaper, as well as enabling them to get what they want. The
                        design of the gentlemen named in the act of incorporation, was to erect such
                        a building in the central portion of the town, with a public Hall in the
                        upper story for lectures theatrical performances and other exhibitions which
                        it calculated would produce considerable revenue to the company. The
                        corporators, we believe, held a meeting sometime since with a view to
                        opening books for subscriptions to the Stock; but the project, from some
                        cause, received a check and nothing more was done. We would say to these
                        gentlemen "why not urge the project?" If the borough council will not
                        dispose of the butcher shop on the corner of Second and Queen streets, and
                        invest in the funds in the stock of the new market company, go ahead anyhow.
                        We feel confident that our citizens will respond by taking stock sufficient
                        in amount of the purpose. Several excellent locations for a Market House
                        could now be obtained, which may not long be available for that purpose. The
                        "Franklin House" lot or the "Mansion House" lot, on the Diamond, are in
                        every respect suitable, and could now be obtained at a reasonable price.
                        Owing to the unsuitableness of the present location, a new Market House
                            must  be built sometime, and why not now,
                        when a good location can be secured? We hope our citizens will interest
                        themselves in the matter and push on the project. </p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In light of the law passed by the Assembly last year requiring a census of
                    the children to be taken in each district, the article asks whether Franklin's

                    result in the county being deprived of its rightful appropriation.<br>

                    <p>The negroes of Greencastle and some of the neighboring towns, had a grand
                        time at that place on Saturday last. The money to defray the expenses of the
                        occasion, we are told, was contributed by the leading Radicals of the place.
                        Two military companies, one belonging to Greecastle and the other to
                        Mercersburg, dressed in full uniform, paraded the streets early in the
                        morning. The chief marshall of the procession, an elevated darkey on
                        horseback, wore a Lieutenant Colonel's uniform, said to have been borrowed
                        form the president of the late Radical County Convention. After marching and
                        contermarching for some time, the "nigs" proceeded to Moss Spring where they
                        held a picnic. In the afternoon the crowd of black and white "niggers"
                        assembled, was addressed by the Rev. William Highland Garnett, of New York,
                        (colored), the Hon. William Corten, of Philadelphia, (colored), followed by
                        George W. Zeigler, Esq., of Greencastle, (white). In the evening the
                        procession marched to town and resolved itself into a mass meeting in front
                        of Ziegler's store, where Messrs. Garnett and Corten delivered extreme
                        radical speeches, which were loudly applauded by the black and white
                        radicals present.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday evening the Rev. Garnett occupied the pulpit of the German Reformed
                        Church, on the invitation of Mr. A. B. Wingerd, a Ruling Elder of that
                        church, who, in the absence of the pastor, took the responsibility of
                        inviting the "show" into the house of the Lord. The Rev. Mr. Wightman, the
                        Presbyterian minister, revoked an appointment of his own in order to be
                        present and give the weight of his influence and the light of his
                        countenance to this darkey performance. Mr. Wightman escorted the Reverend
                        colored gentleman into the pulpit and conducted the introductory exercises
                        himself. We are told that he made a very long Radical prayer, to the
                        infinite disgust of all right-minded people. Thus ended the miserable farce.
                        Can there be a doubt any longer as to where the Radical party stands on the
                        negro question?</p>
