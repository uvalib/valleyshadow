<b>The Presidency</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Although they have received numerous letters soliciting their endorsement
                    for candidates in next year's presidential election, the editors have opted to
                    withold their preference because it is too early to make a decision. They do,
                    however, offer a vague sense of what characteristics a candidate would have to
                    possess to earn their backing: he will have to be "a high toned gentleman and a
                    sound Democratic" as well as a "highly intellectual statesman."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>At Last</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In the last issue of the Repository, the article informs readers, Col.
                    McClure, the editor of the Republican organ, made clear his, and his party's,
                    position relative to granting blacks the vote when he inscribed "Manhood
                    Suffrage" as the newspaper's banner.<br>(Names in announcement: Col.  McClure)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Repository</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Repository, in its last issue, flings to the
                        breeze its banner on which is inscribed, "Manhood Suffrage." Its senior
                        editor has written this inscription upon it, and henceforth, our assertion
                        that the leaders of the Radical party in this country are in favor of that
                        doctrine, will certainly not be denied, as it was all through the late
                        campaign.--Such unblushing effrontery--such open, reckless defiance of the
                        popular will has scarcely ever been exhibited before. From that far-off
                        Territory, which but recently, in spite of Col. M'Clure's most strenuous
                        efforts, thundered its denunciation of this doctrine, he writes to a county
                        in which Radicalism, after a series of unbroken successes covering a period
                        of ten years, has been repulsed, for the simple reason that the people
                        believed that it was secretly carrying them in that direction. Rebuked here
                        and there, he refuses to be bound by the popular verdict, and plants his
                        standard far in advance of the foremost position which his party has had the
                        hardihood to assume here. The stone which the builders rejected has become
                        the corner. In the future, therefore, citizens of Franklin county, the issue
                        will be a plain one. For manhood suffrage, or against
                            it, is the question.--Hereafter, the Repository as an organ of the Radical party, will advocate the
                        right of the negro to vote. The VALLEY SPIRIT as the organ of the Democratic
                        party, will continue to oppose this monstrous doctrine. There is no middle
                        way--choose ye between us. </p>
                    <p>Col. M'Clure enumerates different causes which contributed to the defeat of
                        his party in Pennsylvania and the other Northern States. But, strange to
                        say, his judgement is so completely blinded that he fails to perceive the
                        real issue. Nay, so infatuated is he, that he insists that the source of
                        their weakness in the late elections is to be the pillar of strength in the
                        future. The truth is, that the overwhelming reverses which the radical party
                        has suffered are mainly if not altogether attributable to the fact that they
                        had linked themselves to the negro and were engaged in a fruitless attempt
                        to draw him up to an equality with the white man. It was because of this
                        belief that such a ruinous apathy took possession of large numbers of
                        Republicans. It was on this account that many who had never faltered before
                        in their fealty to that organization, broke loose from it altogether and
                        cast their lot with our own party. And yet, he insists that his party must
                        cling to this fanatical idea, and predicts that the negro "will vote again
                        in every State within the next decade." He says:</p>
                    <p>The issue may be defeated for a time, and each defeat will but strengthen it.
                        Men may fall who have the manhood to advocate it; but all who have abiding
                        faith in the fidelity with which the people will perfect the mighty
                        revolution now in progress in this nation, will look hopefully, confidently
                        for this great consummation. It is founded on the principles of eternal
                        justice that those who are governed, and taxed and required to defend the
                        country's honor and flag with their lives, shall have a vote in their
                        government, and it cannot fail without shattering our boasted structure of
                        Universal Freedom.</p>
                    <p>To what "mighty revolution" does he refer? Does he mean that the Democratic
                        tornado which has lately swept over the whole country? Surely, that is the
                        only "mighty revolution now in progress in this nation." We cherish and
                        "abiding faith in the fidelity with which the people will perfect" it, but
                        we do not "look hopefully, confidently, for this
                        great consummation" of negro suffrage. On the contrary, we believe that this
                        Radical party which has inscribed negro suffrage upon its banner, will be
                        swept clean out of existence by the mighty masses of the people rising in
                        their majesty, and proclaiming their fixed determination to maintain the
                        freedom of the Republic, by forever preventing the negro from participating
                        in the work of its government. Our free institutions are jewels to precious
                        to be entrusted to the hands of men who have never shown any capacity for
                        self-government. </p>
                    <p>But he tells us that "100,000 sable heroes died to defend our free
                        institutions." Prey, when and where? Perhaps he counts all the negroes who
                        were in the army as so many "dead ducks," in view of the late elections.
                        Surely, the compositor must have added a cypher to the manuscript. The
                        Colonel can not be serious. If so, we must insist upon seeing "the papers."
                        The senior editor of the Repository has been so
                        accustomed to victory that he does not know how to take defeat. He will not
                        be admonished. Much whipping hath made him mad. He exhibits the courage and
                        the rashness of desperation. If the people will not be led, they must be
                        driven. If they will not be coaxed, they must be coerced. If they will not
                        allow themselves to be deceived, they must be compelled openly to quaff the
                        bitter cup of negro equality to its dregs. What say you? Get ready for the
                        plain issue. It is before you. You must meet it. Meet it like men.--Meet it
                        like white men. </p>

<b>Gen. Grant's Prospects For The Radical Nomination Ruined</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gen. Grant, say the editors, was the likely choice to become the
                    Republicans' candidate in the upcoming Presidential election. The chances of
                    this occcuring were dashed, however, when he appeared before the Judiciary
                    Committee on July 18th and offered several opinions that the "ultras" within the
                    party found objectionable. In particular, the editors contend, his neutral stand
                    on black suffrage ruled out any possiblity of compromise on his candidacy.<br>

                    a Sorghum Mill on his land free of charge. The only thing he requested was a
                    signature attesting that they had an agreement. That was the last the farmer
                    heard of the swindler until Jeremiah Rodarmer presented him with a $150 note
