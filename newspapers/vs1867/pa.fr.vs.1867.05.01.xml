				<head>Negro Suffrage in the North</head>
				<origin>Age</origin>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>Forcing negro suffrage upon the same platform of political rights with white
						citizens by the bayonet is one thing, but persuading white men to
						voluntarily accept him as their equal at the ballot-box, a totally different
						affair. This the leaders of the Radical party are beginning to understand.
						Congress, by the assumption of extraordinary and unconstitutional powers,
						has destroyed the civil governments of ten States. The people in that
						section of the Union are prevented from fixing and determining the
						depositories of their own political power. The great American idea that all
						just and rightful authority proceeds from the people, has been trampled in
						the dust, and Congress not only says who shall be citizens, but how those
						citizens shall manage their state and local affairs. Under the lead of this
						monstrous perversion of the theory of a republican form of government, negro
						suffrage has been made a portion of the law governing the reconstruction of
						the late revolted States, and the black man is being registered in all the
						election districts South of the Potomac. No one pretends that this
						adulteration of the elective franchise meets the approval of the legal
						voters in that section. The change was made by the Radicals for political
						purposes. They need the negro vote to build up a party there, and hence the
						pilgrimage of Wilson, the formation of secret political societies, in which
						the negroes are to be trained to act with the dominant organization of the
						country, and the establishment of negro suffrage as one of the indispensable
						conditions of Southern reconstruction.</p>
					<p>This being the course pursued at the South, an attempt is no being made to
						force negro suffrage upon the people of the Northern States through the
						agency and discipline of the Radical party. All the leading orators,
						counselors, managers, and presses of that party are clamoring for "manhood
						suffrage." In many of the States movements are already initiated to strike
						the word "white" from their constitutions, and thus put the negro upon the
						same political platform with white men.-</p>
					<p>The Washington <emph rend="italic">Chronicle </emph> declares that there is
						"just as absolute a necessity upon the North to adopt negro suffrage as upon
						the South," and notifies the people of New York, Maryland, New Jersey, and
						the other Northern States, that they must give the ballot to the negro, and
						thus "represent a progressive republic, whose vital principles are freedom
						and equality." But the voice of the Radical party, through its leaders, is
						not so potential in the Northern States as it is in the South, when enforced
						by acts of Congress and the military power of the nation. The Legislature of
						New Jersey would not endorse negro suffrage. In Ohio the people are
						indisposed to accept the dusky platform. In Wisconsin, the masses of the
						Radical party revolt at the tyranny and despotism of their leaders, and in
						this State they shrink from mooting an issue which is as distasteful to
						white men as it is dangerous to the stability of our political institutions.
						But the managers of the Radical party see the necessity for continued
						agitation upon the negro question, and they are determined that their
						followers shall go forward. To stop at this point is destruction. They need
						the votes of the negroes in the North, and to obtain them, and at the same
						time maintain their hold upon the fanatical element in this section, the
						issue of "universal manhood suffrage" will be pressed into the forground of
						all political contests, and the country will be convulsed, business impeded
						and the general prosperity of the nation injured to a ruinous extent. </p>
					<p>If the masses [UNCLEAR] of the North will not agree to follow the
						negro-suffrage party, what then? Will the dominant faction yield to the will
						of the people? Will they allow the majority to rule? They have discarded
						this principle to the South, and elevated Congress into a Dictator. Will
						this be done in the North? The <emph rend="italic">Chronicle </emph>, in
						alluding to the recent defeat of the negro suffrage party in Connecticut,
						which, it is said, will retard the work of freedom and keep a portion of the
						population under the dominion of a caste, remarks, "this will, however, all
						give way yet to Senator Wilson's bill which we hope to see introduced and
						passed over the inevitable veto immediately after the next meeting of
						Congress." When it is remembered that the bill of Senator Wilson here
						referred to, forces negro suffrage upon all the States, the coming programme
						of the Radical party can be clearly seen and fully understood. If the people
						will not agree to put the ballot in the hands of the negro in this and other
						States at the North, it will be placed there by Congress, and a passage-way
						cleared for him by bayonets to the ballot-box. Thus is the "poisoned
						chalice" about being returned to the lips of those who filled it for others.
						The supremacy of Congress over the Southern States established their
						attention is now turned to this section, and the civil rights of white men
						here are about to be made the sport and jest of a political faction as
						fierce, remorseless, and corrupt as that which disgraced France when that
						nation tottered in the throes of her great revolution. The end of this negro
						agitation is not yet, and the people must look at the threatened danger, and
						be prepared to meet it in a proper manner when it comes.-<emph rend="italic"

					<p>The State Appropriation Bill, as originally gotten up and passed by the
						House, appropriated more than one million dollars in excess of the estimated
						receipts. At the last hour the Senate cut it considerably, so as to make the
						expenses a little more than the receipts $4,095,394. For the education of
						soldiers' orphans, the amount was reduced from $450,000 to $300,000. The pay
						of members was reduced to $1,000 for the session instead of $1,500, as
						originally contemplated. The Dixmount appropriated was cut down from $66,
						082 to $50,000; for the House of Refuge, from $47,000 to $2,700; for St.
						Paul's Orphan Asylum from $15,000 to $8,000. The law granting pensions to
						the soldiers of 1812 and their widows was repealed. The Penitentiary
						appropriation was fixed at $20,800, the usual sum. The project of extension
						of the prison has been abandoned for the present.</p>

				<commentary>"We would respectfully call the attention of every taxpayer of
					Pennsylvania to the following Radical testimony in regard to prevailing
					corruption and knavery among the law makers of Congress and a number of the
					State Legislatures:"</commentary>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p> A large number of our legislators-enough to corrupt legislative action-are
						purchasable." -<emph rend="italic">New York Times</emph>, </p>
					<p>"With a depth and infamy of Legislative corruption never before known, we are
						falling into a practice of wholesale and shameless bribery at elections, and
						that, too, in New England-in the 'land of steady habits' itself,"-<emph
							rend="italic">Boston Transcript</emph>. </p>
					<p>"The corruption at Washington and Albany are debauchers of the young; they
						are traitors, * * vermin, who are crawling under the foundations and
						destroying by corruption the vital powers of the Government,"-<emph
							rend="italic">Henry Ward Beecher</emph>. </p>
					<p>"The Legislature of 1867 is no more. It has fought its last fight-it has won
						its last stake. * They have passed sixteen hundred laws, 'pinched' others by
						the score, and finally, after three months of rioting, rotating, pinching,
						plundering, and pocketing, their time has come, and they go out as a rule,
						to return no more forever.-<emph rend="italic">Chambersburg
						Repository</emph>. </p>
					<p>"Bad as has been the character of our Legislature for years, it seems to be
						generally conceded that the body just adjourned was even more untrustworthy
						than any of its predecessors * All the Christian people in the State should
						join in thanks to the Throne of Grace that it did no more harm than it did.
						Another such Legislature would sink us."-<emph rend="italic">Somerset
						Herald</emph>. </p>
					<p>"Our Legislators are rascals. No decent man would like to win an 'Hon.' for
						his name in such company."-<emph rend="italic">Chicago Post</emph>. </p>
					<p>The New York Legislature, alluded to, stood: Senate-Radicals 27; Democrats 5;
						House-Radicals 82; Democrats 46. R<emph rend="italic">adical majority on

					<p>By those large controlling majorities the legislation of the States and
						nation was performed. If it is corrupt and infamous-and we have abundant
						Radical testimony, other than the foregoing that it is-the people cannot
						fail to place the responsibility where it justly belongs. Having done so, it
						is for them to apply the corrective which it is their privilege to use, by
						electing, hereafter, none but honest and pure men, and so balancing party
						power as to make one a check upon the other, It is useless to look for
						purity or correct legislation when and where one political party holds so
						large a preponderance of power as is indicated above in the Congress and
						Legislatures of 1867. Equalize the political power, and each party will find
						it necessary to act honestly and purely in order to gain favor with the
						people. If the people are wise, they will at once curtail the corruptly
						wielded power of the Radical leaders.-<emph rend="italic">Patriot and

				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>The Conservative State Convention, which met at Nashville on the 16th, inst.,
						and nominated Emerson Etheridge for Governor, was composed of whites and
						blacks.-Some difficulty was experienced upon the negro question-the old
						slaveholders maintaining that the negro should have the right to hold office
						as a necessary result of emancipation and the right to vote. The East
						Tennesseeans, who had been loyal throughout the war, and Northern Democrats,
						who had settled in Memphis and elsewhere since the war, strongly opposed
						action in that direction, but finally their objections were waived through
						the persuasions of the so-called "rebel" element, and, when a motion to that
						effect was made, the colored delegations were unanimously admitted.
						Resolutions were passed claiming for the negroes full equality in all
						political rights-including, of course, the right to hold office.</p>
					<p>During the session a conservative negro named Joe Williams, it is stated,
						made a speech of considerable length in good sensible English, which was
						loudly applauded:</p>
					<p>"He started out by saying that he had fought for the Union, and was for the
						freedom of his race. He was a Conservative because he believed the
						Conservatives were the best friends of his race in Tennessee.-For being a
						Conservative, the Radicals threatened to assassinate him; but he did not
						care. He might as well live in the interior of Africa as to try to live
						among these Radicals. He saw Radicals who had been in the rebel army; he saw
						Radicals who had been nigger-traders; and the Radical candidate for Governor
						was the worst enemy of the colored race in Tennessee, who had written worse
						books and newspapers against abolition than any other man. He couldn't vote
						for any such man, who had been all his life the enemy of the colored race,
						and was its enemy now, only he wanted its votes."</p>
					<p>After the adjournment the negroes marched through the streets preceded by a
						negro brass band. During the march they were attacked by a mob of Radical
						darkies, but the police soon put the latter to flight.</p>
					<p>The Conservatives are now decidedly ahead of the Radicals on the negro
						question. The latter refused to admit the negroes as delegates to their
						convention, held a short time before, and they deny the negroes the right to
						hold office whilst at the same time they are asking them for their votes.
						The Brownlow party are now known as copperheads. This action of the Southern
						or "rebel" element of the Conservative convention will compel the Radicals
						to alter their programme, and deal justly by the negroes. They gave the
						blacks the ballot merely to use them in electing Radicals who could not be
						elected on white votes, and had no intention of benefiting the negroes in
						any way whatever. They must and will be brought to the acknowledgement that
						the right to vote carries with it, always, the right to be voted for. The
						fanatical negro revolution will not stop until the United States Senate and
						the White House have had negro occupants.-<emph rend="italic">Patriot

				<summary>The Conservative State Convention of Tennessee met on April 16 in Nashville
					where delegates nominated Emerson Etheridge for Governor. According to the
					article, the meeting was plagued by fractious debate over the issue of black
					suffrage. On one side stood the "old slave holders," who maintained that "the
					negro should have the right to hold office as a necessary result of
					emancipation." On the other stood the delegates from the war-time unionist
					strongholds in East Tennessee who "strongly opposed" any move to grant the
					freedmen political rights. Ultimately, the Black Belt planters persevered,
					demonstrating that "the Conservatives are now decidedly ahead of the Radicals on
					the negro question."</summary>
