<b>The Southern States</b><br> (Column 8)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In his letter, B. F. Perry, ex-governor of South Carolina, criticizes a
					proprosal to grant blacks the vote in the Palmetto state, which, he alleges,
					would result in "the establishment of the most atrocious government and horrible
					state of society that a civil people were subjected to." Southern whites, he
					contends, appear willing to permit black suffrage because they are under the
					impression that their land will be seized should they not. Perry insists that

					<p>Gentlemen, I shall not attend your meeting this evening. I have an engagement
						out of town, and shall keep it. I do not recognize you as capable of
						judging, or even fully apprehending me. You evidently regard me as a weak
						sentimentalist, misled by a mandlin philosophy. I arraign you as
						narrow-minded blockheads who would like to be useful to a great and good
						cause, but don't know how. Your attempt to base a great enduring party on
						the hate and wrath necessarily engendered by a bloody civil war, is as
						though you should plant a colony on an iceberg which had somehow drifted
						into a tropical ocean. I tell you here, that out of a life earnestly devoted
						to the good of human kind, your children will select my going to Richmond
						and signing that bail-bond as the wisest act, and will feel that it did more
						for freedom and humanity than all of you were competent to do, though you
						had lived to the age of Methuselah.</p>
					<p>I ask nothing of you, then, but that you proceed to your end by a direct,
						frank, manly way. Don't sidle off into a mild resolution of censure, but
						move the expulsion you proposed, and which I deserve, if I deserve any
						reproach whatever. All that I care for is, that you make this a square,
						stand-up fight, and record your judgement by yeas and nays. I care not how
						few vote with me, nor how many vote against me; for I know the latter will
						repent it in dust and ashes before three years have passed. Understand, once
						and for all, that I dare you, and defy you, and that I propose to fight it
						out on the line that I have held since Lee's surrender. So long as any man
						was seeking to overthrow our government he was my enemy; from the hour in
						which he laid down his arms, he was my formerly erring countryman. So long
						as any at heart opposed to the national unity, the Federal authority, or to
						that assertion of the equal rights of all men, which has become practically
						identified with loyalty and nationality, I shall do my best to deprive him
						of power; but, whenever he ceases to be thus, I demand his restoration to
						all the privileges of American citizenship. I give you fair notice that I
						shall urge the re-enfranchisement of those now proscribed for rebellion so
						soon as I feel confident that this course is consistent with the freedom of
						the blacks and the unity of the Republic, and that I shall demand a recall
						of all now in exile only for participating in the Rebellion, whenever the
						country shall have been so thoroughly pacified that its safety will not
						thereby be endangered. And so, gentlemen, hoping that you will hencefore
						comprehend me somewhat better than you have done, I remain,</p>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Lancaster Intelligencer</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>That history repeats itself says the Lancaster Intelligencer , has time and again been illustrated, but nowhere
						more strikingly than in the recent affair at Mobile, where Kelly, according
						to the New York Tribune , "laid down flat on his
						face" at the first fire of the mob. Centuries, however, generally intervene
						between these repetitions, and it must be a fast age and a fast people that
						can boast of two similar historic events within a little more than a quarter
						of a century, with two such redoubtable heroes as Stevens and Kelley for
						their leading actors. </p>
					<p>Stevens at Harrisburg, cracking his lash over his subservient partisans,
						advising them to throw "conscience to the devil" and trample upon the will
						of the people; Kelley at Mobile with the 15th United States Infantry at his
						back and the whole army besides, insulting his white fellow citizens and
						inciting a motley crowd of negroes to deeds of violence and plunder. Stevens
						driven from the halls of the Capitol through a back window by an indignant
						and outraged people; Kelly falling "flat on his face" at the very first fire
						of a mob of his own creating, provoked beyond endurance by his insolent and
						boastful harangue. Ye Gods! What heroes! What a theme for some loyal poet
						and for Harper's pictorial. Can not the Poet Laureate of the Union League
						invoke the muse to aid him in recording the deeds of these valorous men in
						rhythm? Can not Harper find an artist who can give the proper expression of
						the "Great Commoner" when leaping out of the back window of the State
						Capitol, and who can portray the beautiful physique of Kelley "lying flat on
						his face" with an imaginary crowd of excited negroes rushing to his rescue.
						Certainly these similar historic events, in which so great bravery was
						displayed, ought to inspire the most melodious strains of the Poet, and call
						forth the finest penciling of the Artist. By all means let us have these
						redoubtable heroes and their heroic actions done up in poetry and painting.
						Perhaps too, some Sculptor's chisel might be brought into requisition and
						the cold marble be made to speak of the courage of the hero of the "Buckshot
						War," and of the intrepidity of the chivalrous Knight of Mobile!</p>

					<p>It is estimated that the tour of Wilson Kelly and other Radicals through the

						productive interest of that section to the amount of fifty millions of

						South, relieve the laboring men of the North from the payment of that sum.
						Besides this, the present Radical policy of governing the South directly

						Think of these things tax ridden people of the North, when you are obliged
						to pay two prices for a pound of sugar, a gallon of molasses, a yard of

					<p>Meeting of the New your "Loyal" League --The Verdict of Davis Ball Case.</p>
					<p>A special meeting of the Union League Club was held at its house, No 29 Union
						Square, last evening, John Jay, Esq., in the chair.</p>
					<p>The meeting having been called by the Executive Committee at the request of
						more than twenty-five members, for the purpose of considering what action
						the club should take in reference to the conduct of Hon. Horace Greeley in
						becoming a bondsmand for Jefferson Davis, there was a large attendance of
						members.</p>
					<p>Mr. George W. Blunt offered the following preamble and resolutions:</p>
					<p>Whereas , It is declared in the articles of
						association of the Union League Club, that "the primary object of the
						association shall be to discountenance and rebuke, by moral and social
						influences, all disloyalty to the Federal government," and that "to that end
						the members will use every proper means in public and private; and </p>
					<p>Whereas , Jefferson Davis has been known by all
						loyal men as the ruling spirit of that band of conspirators who urged the
						Southern States into rebellion; as the chief enemy of the Republic, not more
						from the position which he occupied in the Southern Confederacy, than from
						the vindictive character of his official acts and utterances during four
						years of desolating war, and as one who knew of, if he did not instigate, a
						treatment of prisoners of war unwarranted by any possible circumstances,
						unparalleled in the annals of civilized nations, and which, there is
						abundant evidence to prove, was devised for the purpose of destroying them;
						and </p>
					<p>Whereas , Horace Greeley, a member of this club,
						has seen fit to become a bondsman for this man whose efforts were for many
						years directed to the overthrow of our government; therefore </p>
					<p>Resolved , That this club would do injustice to
						its past record, and to the high principle embodied in its articles of
						association should it fail to express regret that one of its members had
						consented to perform an act of this nature. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That this club, while ready and anxious
						to vindicate the law of the lond, cannot forget that there is also a sense
						of public decency to which it must defer; and that no one of its members,
						however eminent in his service may have been in the cause of liberty and
						loyalty, can give aid and comfort to Jefferson Davis without offering a
						cruel insult to the memory of the thousands of our countrymen who perished,
						the victims of his ambition. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That these resolutions be published in
						the newspapers of the city, and that a copy of them be sent to Mr. Greeley. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That the Union League Club diapprove of
						the act of Horace Greely in becoming the bondsmen of Jefferson Davis. </p>
					<p>On these resolutions Mr. Blunt made a few remarks, and followed by Judge
						Coles, who contended that the resolutions were objectionable so far as they
						referred specifically to any member of the club. He believed, that while
						agreeing with the general sentiment of the resolutions, that the act of Mr.
						Greely did not come properly within the notice of the organization. He
						concluded by a motion to adjourn, which was seconded, but lost by a decided
						majority.</p>
					<p>A motion was then made to lay the subject on the table, which was lost by a
						vote of 86 yeas to 103 nays.</p>
					<p>Colonel Van Buren next addressed the meeting, indulging in a much invective
						against aid to rebels generally, but discoursed at considerable length on
						the treason and political crimes of Jefferson Davis.</p>
					<p>Several amendments were offered to the preamble and the resolutions, which
						were lost, and on their discussion a stormy and violent debate ensued, and
						many questions of parliamentary rules were noisily contested.</p>
					<p>The original resolutions were finally rejected, but a substitute by Colonel
						Van Buren, condemning the act of bailing Jefferson Davis, and one by Dorman
						P. Eaton, to the effect that the club had no legitimate authority in
						condemning the act of Horace Greeley, were both passed.</p>
					<p>These read as follows:</p>
					<p>The Verdict. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That the Union League Club of new York
						decidedly disapproves and condemns the bailing of Jefferson Davis, the head
						of the late bloody rebellion, believing that he has been guilty of
						unparalleled crimes against his country and humanity; and a decent regard
						for the patriotism of the people, for the sacrifices of the war, and for the
						sacredness of justice, required that he should be detained in prison until
						tried for his crimes. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That there is nothing in the action of
						the Hon. Horace Greeley relative to the bailing of Jefferson Davis which
						calls for any proceeding on the part of this club. </p>
					<p>The meeting, at a very late hour, adjourned, after the adoption of the above
							resolutions.-New York papers of Friday. </p>
