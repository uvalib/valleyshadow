				<head>The "Bread and Butter Brigade"</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>Our readers will remember with what words of bitterness and contempt our
						Republican friends spoke, during last fall's campaign, of the "bread and
						butter brigade"-meaning the office-holders under President Johnson. It was
						the standing text for every stump speech, upon which Radical orators waxed
						warm and eloquent, as they attempted to depict the ineffable meanness of the
						men who could so far forget their self-respect as to accept office from a
						"recreant President." Every radical newspaper editor made it the subject of
						his leading editorials, in which this class of men were held in utter
						abhorrence. We were told that no man, and especially no Republican, could
						accept an office from the President without a total sacrifice of his honor
						and manhood. Nothing could be more dishonorable and disgraceful, in the eyes
						of these pious patriots, than to be a member of the "bread and butter
						brigade." They could not be induced to join it under any circumstances. Oh
						now! They would break stones, or do anything else for a living, rather than
						sacrifice their dear "honor" and "manhood" and "self-respect."</p>
					<p>But what think you, dear reader when we tell you that these same
						disinterested patriots are at this very time literally crowding the
						Departments at Washington, in their anxiety for admission into this same
						"bread and butter brigade." The newspapers inform us that Washington is
						over-run with Radical office-seekers who are there "boring" the President
						and heads of departments for appointments. During the last two or three
						weeks the "brigade" has been reinforced by thousands of recruits from the
						Radical ranks, and the "cry is, still they come." Even our own goodly town
						has furnished more than its full quota. We could name at least half a dozen
						of our most respectable Radical fellow citizens who, not having the fear of
						McClure before their eyes, have already been on to Washington and had their
						names entered on the "slate" for one of the vacant appointments in this
						District. So utterly demoralised, on this "bread and butter" question, has
						the radical party of this vicinity become that it is said the demoralisation
						has even extended itself to the pure and hallowed atmosphere of the sanctum
						of the <emph rend="italic">Repository </emph>. Rumor has it that an attache
						of that establishment, being suddenly seized with a voracious appetite for
						something to eat, and thinking that "bread and butter" would sit more
						lightly on his stomach than beef-steaks and pan-cakes, started, post-haste,
						for Washington, to pick, if possible, a crumb from the Presidential table,
						in the shape of Assessorship for this district. But unfortunately for our
						friend, he had a double difficulty to encounter. Not only was a "recreant
						President" to be conciliated, but there stood with "glaring eyeballs" the
						mortal enemy of his house, waiting to be avenged. Simon said
						"wiggle-waggle," and the aforesaid attache wiggle-waggled accordingly-minus
						the expected Presidential "crumb" spread with Senatorial "butter." </p>
					<p>But to be serious, what a commentary is this scramble for office among
						radical politicians on their own professions during the late campaign. The
						very men who are now most anxious to accept office under the federal
						government were loudest then in their denunciations of others for the same
						thing. A great "change seems to have come over the spirit of their dreams."
						What was "corruption" then, is pure and unadultered virtue now. What was
						then regarded as "dishonorable," has become the highest type of honor! Such
						is the consistency of the great "God and morality" party!</p>

				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>Of each pretended "finality" proposed by the Radicals to keep up the pretense
						that they wish to restore the Union, we have always foreseen this: that the
						first sign of acquiescence at the South would be instantly met with fresh
						exactions, devised solely with the aim of postponing and preventing a final
						settlement. The Radicals are not reconstructionists; they are not
						constructionists of any sort-they are <emph rend="italic"
						>de</emph>srtuctionists. They destroyed the old Union and no new one will
						ever be formed with their consent, in which the free opinion of the whole
						American people can find expression through the ballot-box. To their first
						proposal, the constitutional amendment reducing Southern representation,
						they tacked a clause of disfranchising all who had taken part in the
						rebellion after swearing to support the Constitution of the United States.
						They did not directly impose this disfranchisement; they were too cunning
						for that. They required the Southern people to adopt it themselves by their
						own votes. To this there was some demur, as was expected and it was also
						argued at the South, that as the political controversy that led to the civil
						war was upon the true interpretation of the Constitution of the United
						States, those that took the Southern view did not consciously or willfully
						violate the oath in question. </p>
					<p>But in spite of all this, leading men and journals at the South began to
						recommend the proposed amendment, as something to be accepted, as a matter
						of necessity: and, therefore, the Radicals abandoned it. They brought in a
						"reconstruction bill," giving forthwith, the suffrage to all the negroes
						though the "amendment" just proposed had formally admitted that the matter
						was for the determination of each State at the south, as it was at the
						North. When this Radical "reconstruction bill," establishing military
						despotism and negro suffrage was finally passed over the veto of the
						President, there was again a frank effort made at the South to meet its
						requirements. Governor Brown, of Georgia, and other leading men, argued most
						cogently that as the so-called "reconstruction" was to be put at once in
						operation by military force, it were better for the whole country that the
						Southern States should not be reorganized solely on an African basis.
						Southern with men were urged to accept the situation, and to take their part
						in a work that would otherwise go on without them. To counteract this view,
						the Radicals have brought forward their "supplemental reconstruction
						bill."-In this, they seek to take away the incentive to Southern action by
						providing that a State may be kept out of all its federal relations if the
						majority of its voters fail to vote. Then they are deterred from voting by
						new impositions. Another test oath is provided; they are made to swear not
						merely allegiance to the United States but that they are "<emph
							rend="italic">sincerely </emph> attached to the government;" a
						government that is present to them only in the form of absolute military
						power; a form for which no free-born American was bred to feel "sincere
						attachment." To give full scope to intimidation and persecution, it further
						provided, "that persons taking the oath falsely shall be subject to all the
						pains and penalties of perjury." Then, there is a large increase of the
						proscribed class; not only those who once took an oath to support the
						Constitution are disfranchised for "rebellion," but all State officers,
						whether they took the oath or not. </p>
					<p>Finally, a change is made that so clearly discloses the ulterior purposes
						that prompt it, that it seems superfluous to do more than simply to point to
						it as the best confirmation of our charge, that the whole design of the
						Radicals is conceived in deceit and perfidy.</p>
					<p>A provision providing for the admission of a State, on its framing a new
						Constitution, "if the said Constitution shall be declared by Congress to be
						in conformity with the previous act to which this is supplemental," has been
						"amended." It now reads "if the said Constitution <emph rend="italic">shall
							be approved by Congress</emph>." This is the grand reserve of the
						Radicals: if everything shall be done "in conformity" with their
						requirements their "approval" may still be withheld. No State shall come in
						as a free State on any terms, if they can help it. To establish and keep up
						a sheer, gross military despotism, this is their intent-this is their crime
						against freedom, civilization, and the American people.-<emph rend="italic"

					<p>SECTION 1. <emph rend="italic">Be it enacted, &amp;c</emph>. That the

						for, by the supervisors of the townships in said County respectively, for
						the period of one year and no longer, and the contract price therefore shall
						be paid the purchaser or contractor during the year in which the work is
						done and performed. </p>
					<p>SECTION 2. That no drains or ditches shall be required in the specifications
						in selling or letting said roads, when the bed of the road is solid by
						reason of rock or slate, or has been piked.</p>
					<p>SECTION 3. That the provisions of the fifth section of the act, to which this
						is a supplement, shall not apply in any roads running along or through the
						mountains in said County, except so far as relates to removing of loose
						stones.</p>

				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>A meeting of the trustees of the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania, was
						held at the office of the State society at Harrisburg, on Wednesday, March
						13, 1867. Present Messrs. F. Watts, John W. Geary, Francis Jordan, A. Boyd
						Hamilton, H. N. McAllister, Jas. Miles, A.O. Heister, Moses Thompson and
						John Frazer. During the session it was decided to publish a monthly journal
						of agriculture to be edited by the faculty of the college, the grant by the
						State of the U. S. Land Scrip was accepted, and after some debate during
						which remarks were made by Gov. Geary, Judge Heister, Col. Jordan, Mr.
						McAllister and Gen. Fraser, a plan was decided upon for the purchase of
						lands, one tract for a farm west of the mountains and one East of
						Harrisburg, to be cultivated as a model and experimental farms under the
						care of the Institution as provided for in the recent act of the
						Legislature; the farms so purchased or obtained to consist of about one
						hundred acres each.</p>
					<p>Motions for a smaller minimum area were lost. It was agreed that the affairs
						of the college are now placed upon a permanent foundation, and with the
						enlarged and capable faculty promises as high a degree of success as has
						ever been claimed for it by its warmest friends. The improvement of the
						magnificent farm around the college claimed the attention of the board, and
						measures were adopted to insure its future improvement and productiveness.
						If any of our readers wish to see the mountain country of Pennsylvania in
						all its grandeur, a trip to the college, in Centre county, will afford an
						opportunity to do so, and at the same time he will traverse some of the most
						beautiful alleys of Pennsylvania.</p>
