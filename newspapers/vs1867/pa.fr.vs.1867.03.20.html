<b>The Senate and the Appointing Power</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Asserting the Radicals' behavior is a testament to their tyrannical rule,
					the article accuses the Radicals in the Senate of usurping President Johnson's
					authority to appoint public officials.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>If any evidence were wanting to prove the factious character of the
						Republican majority in Congress, it might be found in the action of the
						Senate respecting appointments to Federal office. Instead of exercising the
						appointing power concurrently with the President with single reference to
						the welfare of the public service, the Republican Senators are rejecting all
						nominations which are not made in the interest of their party rather than in
						the interest of the country. They are illustrating, in a most remarkable
						manner, their adoption of the maxim that "to the victors belong the spoils,"
						and that they mean to make the patronage of the Government completely
						subservient to purely partisan ends. Although the National Constitution
						gives to the President exclusively the right to nominate public officers,
						and allows the Senate to confirm or reject a nomination with a view to
						prevent an abuse of the power by the Executive, the country beholds the
						Senate usurping, in effect, the whole function of appointment, and
						prostituting it to the base uses against which its advisory authority in the
						matter was intended, by the Constitution, to guard the high and responsible
						trust. They are carrying their proscription to such an extent, that the
						Executive right to nominate officers is made, practically and absolutely an
						empty privilege, unless exercised in abject obedience to the factious
						purposes and despotic caprice of a Senatorial cabal. No question is made as
						to the personal fitness of a nominee for a position. There is no inquiry
						whether he is honest and capable.</p>
					<p>The sold consideration with the Senate is, whether the person named for any
						place by the President is a Radical Republican, favorable to the policy of
						that party as expressed in the action and measures of its representatives in
						both Houses of Congress or whether he is not. If he is, he is confirmed at
						once, without much, if any, regard to his qualifications otherwise; if he is
						not, he is rejected. And the Senate has abused its discretion in this
						respect in so shameless a manner, as to keep hundreds of important public
						offices filled with subordinate and irresponsible officials, thereby greatly
						impeding the public service and endangering the public interests.</p>

<b>The Northern Interest</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>All has been said, perhaps, that can be said of the ferocious legislation of
						the late Congress, as it affects the South. The newspapers of the Southern
						States, which are the only representatives allowed to them, express, more in
						sorrow than in anger, deep sense of the evils that are wantonly inflicted on
						that that section of our country. The President's veto of the reconstruction
						bill exhibits its atrocious features with a force and clearness to which
						nothing can be added.-But it seems almost vain to appeal in times like
						these, to the ancient principles of religion and justice. There is a too
						evident indifference to them in the public mind. It is vain to demonstrate
						that the course of the Radical leaders towards the South violates the
						dictates of Christian charity as well as of wise policy. It is vain to cite
						the Divine command to "forgive our enemies," when the political party
						dominant at the North cannot rise even to the elevation of the old Pagan
						morals, which enjoined the victor "to spare the vanquished"-parcere subjectis. Let us hope, however, that in
						the ruling party there are numbers too intelligent to sacrifice their own
						interests at the bidding of the Radical despots. Can any man born an
						American freeman, fail to see that his and his children's interests fall,
						when all the great barriers of law and justice, painfully reared around
						civil liberty, are leveled and trampled to the ground? The interests of he
						North are just a little more remote than the South's-that is all-in the
						present great struggle between free government and despotism.--It is the old
						story; old as history; old as recorded time. Ambitious men grasping at
						unlawful power are appealing to the bad passions of a part of the people to
						get their acquiescence in the oppression of the rest-the end is, the
						oppression of all. Tyranny and free government cannot sit, cheek by jowl, on
						the same seat. One must subvert the other. States, some free and others
						subjugated cannot take the place of the old Federal Union. The Abolitionists
						once held that it was no free country, if any Africans were kept in domestic
						slavery; how is it then if part of the white race be reduced to political
						slavery? History teaches but one lesson. With Liberty consist public virtue
						and prosperity and all the national greatness. The palmy days of Graeco and
						of Rome, of England and of our own once happy country, attest this. Tyranny
						brings with it cruelty, rapacity, corruption, the decay of enterprise and
						public spirit and to them the historian traces the swift decline and fall of
						empires. Shall then the great and complete structure of free constitutional
						government reared by Washington and Franklin and Madison and their compeers,
						be overthrown by Stevens and Butler and Sumner and Wade, and their
						co-conspirators for despotism? Shall the States be blotted out, the Supreme
						Court be silenced, the President be impeached, that this clique of
						desperate, reckless radicals may rule the American people with no restraint
						from laws or constitutions? Nations have surrendered their liberty to the
						sword of some great warrior-a Caesar or a Cromwell; but it is only in Danton
						and Robespierre and Marat, who ruled in the French Convention, and so ruled
						France with a rod of iron-it is only in them that we can find a parallel for
						the Congressional clique that now aspires to rule our country. </p>
					<p>Let no man nourish a blind confidence, a foolish incredulity for the future.
						How much have not these very men already succeeded in doing, in the teeth of
						public sentiment and established law? At this moment they are enforcing by
						the bayonet the "negro suffrage," which six months ago was repudiated by
						their own party at the polls. Everything is possible to them, if public
						sentiment be, indeed, as debased as they believe-and here, we trust, is
						their mistake. The old American spirit of the better days of the
						Republic-the love of freedom, the hatred of oppression-is not dead, but
						sleepeth. And why should we desert the perfect and apt frame of Federal
						government which carried us to the pinnacle of national prosperity and
						honor?-The North cherishes it; for it fought and conquered in its name. The
						South cherishes it-never more than now-for it opens a shelter and a haven.
						Under the Constituion we can again have the sole true government-a
						government by consent. Nor is there, as the Radicals pretend, the slightest
						inadequacy in that great instrument to meet the requirements of the times.
						Its war powers in time of invasion or insurrection; the power to enforce the
						abolition of slavery, [UNCLEAR] added by amendment; the ample jurisdiction
						of the Federal Courts, and the right of each branch of Congress to judge the
						qualifications of its members; supply in full measure, the lawful authority
						to do all that prudence or policy demands. It is false that we must seek
						refuge in a military despotism, with its monstrous, new fangled scheme of
						bureaus and brigadiers, because our form of civil government fails in its
						purpose. It is a slander, foul and false, upon the patriots and statesmen
						who framed the Constitution of the United States. They framed it for all
						time, and all weather; for storms as well as calms; and rebellion and civil
						war have only tested and proved its strength and its value. What do the
						Radicals give us in place of it? They give us no military despotism-sheer
						military despotism; with trade paralized, confidence shaken, public liberty
						sacrificed-and all, that clique may rule.-But, we have not yet lost our
						confidence in the intelligence of the American people; we believe they will
						yet choose wisely, if liberty of choice is left to them.--Age </p>

<b>Involuntary Bankruptcy</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article discusses key aspects of the new bankruptcy bill and lists a
					number of clauses contained within the proposed measure that would grant
					creditors considerable power over their debtors' finances.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Inquirer</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>In the provisions of the new Bankrupt bill, so far as they effect voluntary
						applications, are now generally understood, but those which give to
						creditors the power of proceeding to make their debtors bankrupts are not so
						well known. They are much more extensive than like provisions in former
						acts, which have been in force in this country, and they are important to be
						understood. The causes which will authorize a creditor to proceed against
						his debtor are as follows:</p>
					<p>First. The voluntary departure of the debtor from the State, district, or
						Territory of which he is an inhabitant, with intent to defraud his
						creditors.</p>
					<p>Second. Concealment by a debtor, to avoid the service of a legal process, in
						any action of debt or upon demand.</p>
					<p>Third. Concealment or removal of property, to prevent its being attached,
						taken or sequestered on legal process.</p>
					<p>Fourth. The assignment, gift, sale, conveyance or transfer of estate property
						rights or credits, in this country or abroad, with intent to delay, defraud
						or hinder creditors.</p>
					<p>Fifth. Being arrested and held in custody under [UNCLEAR] process of
						exclusion for a debt valid and provable under the Bankrupt law exceeding one
						hundred dollars, if such process is not discharged by payment or by law
						within seven days.</p>
					<p>Sixth. Actual imprisonment by process in a civil action upon a demand
						exceeding in a civil action upon a demand exceeding one hundred dollars,
						founded on 'contract, for more than seven days.'</p>
					<p>Seventh. The payment, gift or transfer, sale or conveyance of property or
						money to any person in contemplation of bankruptcy, the party being bankrupt
						or insolvent at the time.</p>
					<p>Eighth. Giving a warrant to confess judgement, in contemplation of
						bankruptcy.</p>
					<p>Ninth. Suffering property to be taken execution, or on legal process, with
						intent to give a preference to one or more creditors.</p>
					<p>Tenth. Suffering property to be taken execution or on legal process, with
						intent to give a preference to indorsers, bail [UNCLEAR] sureties, with
						intent to delay or to defer the operations of the act.</p>
					<p>Eleventh. The fraudulent stoppage or suspension by a banker, trader or
						merchant of payment of his commercial paper, [UNCLEAR] resumed within
						fourteen days.</p>
					<p>Any person thus liable for the acts designated may be made a bankrupt within
						[UNCLEAR] months after their perpetration, on the [UNCLEAR] of one or more
						of his creditors, [UNCLEAR] aggregate of whose debts amount to $250
						[UNCLEAR] Nor is this all. The transaction which caused the bankruptcy is
						void, and the [UNCLEAR] may recover back property transferred or money paid
						by the bankrupt; provided, that the person receiving it had reasonable cause
						to believe that a fraud was intended, or that the debtor was insolvent. And
						furthermore, such person so implicated in the fraud, if a creditor, shall
						not be allowed to prove his debt against the bankrupt, and must lose it
						altogether.</p>
					<p>It will thus be seen that this act not only gives to the debtor who has been
						honest but unfortunate the means of relieving himself from his burden, but
						it guarantees to the creditor a remedy against fraudulent practices; renders
						dispositions of property in favoritism and preference void, and punishes not
						only the party making such preference, but him who is to receive the
						benefit. Against involuntary bankrupts, [UNCLEAR] of arrest and imprisonment
						may be issued and they may be either confined or made to give bail for their
						appearance. The regulations may affect business very [UNCLEAR] and it is the
						duty of every one having transactions with others to make himself master of
						the directions of the law, so that he shall not render himself innocently
						liable to punishment.-Inquirer. </p>
