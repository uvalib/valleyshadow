<b>To The Patrons Of The Valley Spirit</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In an article introducing themselves to readers, the new editors of the
					Valley Spirit lay out their political views and principles, which, for all
					intents and purposes, are the same as those held by the former owners of the
					journal.<br>(Names in announcement:  John M. Cooper,  Augustus Duncan,  W. S. Stenger)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>As has been already announced, we have become the owners and proprietors of
						the VALLEY SPIRIT. It will hereafter be under our exclusive management and
						control.</p>
					<p>In taking charge of this time-honored journal, it is due to its subscribers
						and patrons, that we should declare "the faith that is in us," and also be
						able and willing at all times to give a reason for that faith.</p>
					<p>Since the year 1848, this paper has been the mouth-piece of the Democracy of
						Franklin County. It has been the faithful expounder of Democratic
						principles. Always turning a deaf ear to the blandishment of traitors to the
						Democratic cause, it has sought, by steady adherence to its well-established
						doctrines, to deserve and command the support of the Democratic party.</p>
					<p>In the glad days of peace, when unbounded happiness and prosperity were the
						blessings vouchsafed to our land by the Almighty, it was the upholder and
						defender of all the great Democratic measures, in accordance with which the
						National Government was so successfully administered. During all the unhappy
						days of our late civil strife, it proclaimed itself the champion of
						Constitutional liberty, and whilst the silence of fear fell upon many lips
						which ought never to have been sealed, its notes of defiance to the mailed
						hand of despotic power ever rang out loud and clear. It must ever be a
						source of the utmost gratification to its late proprietors, that when the
						shouts of the mob were ringing in their ears, and the threatening orders of
						an arrogant "Lieutenant and Provost-Marshal" were laid upon their table,
						they disregarded them all, and, unawed by the threats and the gloomy
						prospect of fortress walls, maintained the unflinching determination the
						perfect freedom of the press.</p>
					<p>Through all the years of its existence, this journal has regarded the
						Constitution of the United States as the supreme law of the land. It has
						labored to impress its provisions upon the people as the true, fundamental
						doctrines of a republican form of government. It has held the duties
						enjoined by that instrument to be binding upon all the citizens of the
						Republic, and has always insisted upon a strict construction of it. It has
						maintained that the Federal Government is only warranted in exercising that
						power which is given to it by express grant in the Constitution, and that
						"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
						prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or
						to the people." It has denounced the idea of a "higher law" which would
						substitute the ever-changing will of the people as expressed in the popular
						elections, for our written Constitution. It has looked upon this doctrine,
						recently so warmly espoused in certain quarters, as in the highest degree
						revolutionary, and the "fruitful source of all our woes." As it has been in
						the past, so will it be in the future. We intend to devote its columns to
						the dissemination of Democratic truths. We will labor to show.</p>
					<p>"By what unseen and unsuspected arts</p>
					<p>The Serpent Error twines round human hearts."</p>
					<p>If possible, we will unmask our opponents and lay bare "the unsuspected arts"
						by which they are seeking to deceive and entrap the honest masses into the
						support of their grave political errors.</p>
					<p>The cause of the Democratic party is our cause. We are proud of its
						record-not garbled, or misrepresented as it often is by our opponents-but
						entire, full of praiseworthy deeds and high resolves. Proud of its grand,
						historic memories-and of its honored, patriotic dead-proud of its
						inexhaustible vitality and unbroken spirit in the face of defeat-of its
						unfaltering trust in honesty, integrity and "sober second thought" of the
						people-of its lofty purposes-of its championship of the freedom of speech
						and of the press-of its condemnation of "unreasonable searches" of houses
						and seizures of persons-of its attachment to that great bulwark of our
						liberties, the trial by jury-of its opposition to a large standing army in
						time of peace-of its absolute horror of military commissions, "organized to
						convict' and dooming their victims to life-long imprisonment or death-of its
						unmitigated hatred to the military despotisms established by Congress in the
						Southern States-of its resistance to the attempt now being made, as in the
						days of our Colonial existence, "to make the military independent of, and
						superior to the civil power"-of its antagonism to the efforts of the
						Radicals to clothe the negro with all the political rights of the whites to
						degrade the white race to the level of the black-proud of its unselfish love
						for the Union of all the States-of its entire devotion to the Constitution
						which Washington, Jefferson and Jackson loved so well.</p>
					<p>These fundamental tenets of the Democratic party have made this Government
						what it has been in the past, and we believe can alone rescue it from the
						perils to which it is at present environed.</p>
					<p>Adhering closely to these principles we feel assured that our patrons will
						not find this paper to be what so many of the journals of the present day
						are, an "over-bubbling spring of endless lies," but on the contrary a
						fountain from which all may drink pure, unadulterated, wholesome
						truths.-Having the approval of our judgements as to the rectitude of our
						political faith, we shall labor, earnestly we know, effectively we trust-to
						disseminate the principles upon which that faith is founded.</p>
					<p>To the people is intrusted the weighty duty of seeing to it, that "the
						Republic receive no detriment." Their action at this critical juncture of
						our national affairs is very important. It must be either for good or evil.
						This government will either be "administered by white men for the benefit of
						white men," or it will be under the control of negroes, administered for
						their benefit. It will doubtless be our duty, as faithful watchmen upon the
						walls, to utter the warning of approaching danger. We ask you to aid us so
						that our words may reach as large a number as possible. Every man should use
						his utmost exertions to awaken the masses from their apathy.-Urge them to
						read, and especially to read your own paper. Our circulation is large, but
						it should be larger. Seek to extend it; give us your hearty co-operation,
						and thus together we will animate the lukewarm, induce the sluggish to shake
						off their lethargic chains, and re-invigorate the already active, so that
						the "old Green Spot" may be redeemed from Radical rule, and contribute its
						share to the work of "reconstructing" the National Government upon
						Democratic principles.</p>

<b>A Sample Of Radical "Truth"</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors ridicule the preamble of a resolution passed at the late
					Republican County Convention, which declares that "all political power is of the
					people," and chide the author of the passage, Dr. Samuel G. Lane.<br>(Names in announcement: Dr. Samuel Lane)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Repository</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"The following is the firt section of the preamble to the resolutions
					which the Repository informs us "were offered in the late Republican County
					Convention by Dr. Samuel G. Lane, chairman of the Committee on Resolutions, and
					unanimously adopted:"<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>WHEREAS, This Convention recognizes the indisputable truth that all political
						power is of the people, and that no party has a right to exist which is not
						in harmony with the will of the people and is not maintained by their
						approbation; and that is the duty of all organizations seeking public favor
						to enunciate distinctly the principle sand policy that govern them.</p>
					<p>If this preamble had been "unanimously adopted" by a Convention made up of
						"Blockheads" of the Loyal League of New York, who undertook to regulate the
						conduct of Horace Greeley, we should, perhaps, have had but little occasion
						to be surprised at it. But it is surprising that it should have been adopted
						by a Convention composed of citizens of this enlightened county of Franklin,
						and we confess ourselves perfectly astonished that it should have been
						written by such a highly intelligent gentleman as Dr. Samuel G. Lane.</p>
					<p>This preamble affirms that "no party has a right to
						exist which is not in harmony with the will of the people and is not
						maintained by their approbation." The "will of the people" must here be
						taken to mean the will of the majority; and the plain meaning of Dr. Lane''
						preamble is, that no minority party has even the poor right to exist. It is
						not enough that the minority shall be excluded from all share in the
						legislation of the State. They must be "wiped out," Their very existence (as
						a party) must be put an end to. </p>
					<p>Admit and enforce the rule of party existence laid down by Dr. Lane and his
						Convention, and what would be the result? There could be no Democratic party
						in Lancaster and other Republican counties, and no Republican party in Berks
						and other Democratic counties! But perhaps the Doctor did not intend that
						the "indisputable truth" of which he unquestionably is the original
						discoverer, and of right ought to be the sole patentee, should be applied to
						such small political divisions as counties. It is, however, equally
						monstrous, whether applied to counties, to states, or to the whole country.</p>
					<p>It must be within the knowledge of Dr. Lane and the other members of the
						Republican County Convention that stamped this newly-discovered and
						"indisputable truth" with the seal of their unanimous approbation, that in
						1856 the Republican party did not find itself "in harmony with the will of
						the people." Under their own doctrine, it had no right
							to exist after the defeat of Fremont. Why, then, did they keep it
						up? Why did the political doctors who had it in charge continue to stimulate
						it with doses of "bleeding Kansas," when, under the doctrine they now
						enunciate, they should have contented themselves with seeing the decently
						buried? </p>
					<p>Do the members of this Convention believe the "indisputable truth" they are
						represented as affirming unanimously? If the next election should show that
						they are "not in harmony with the will of the people" of Franklin county,
						will they admit that they have no longer a right to exist as a party in the
						county? If beaten, will they again assemble in Convention and vote to
						disband?</p>

					<p>On motion, all the nominations were confirmed unanimously. RESOLUTIONS.</p>
					<p>Mr. J. C. Snyder, Chairman of the Committee, then reported the following
						preamble and resolutions, which were unanimously adopted:</p>
					<p>WHEREAS, it was of vital importance at the termination of the late rebellion,
						both for the interests of the people and the prosperity of our republican
						institutions, that the harmonious relations of the rebellious States to the
						Union, should have been restored at the earliest practical moment, and that
						the efforts of enlightened statesmeanship should have been put forth for
						that purpose, therefore:</p>
					<p>Resolved , That this convention condemns the
						policy of reconstruction adopted by the last and the present Republican
						Congess as not promotive of that end for the following reasons; </p>
					<p>1st. Because the principles of that policy find no warrant, and meet no
						sanction in the Constitution of the United States, as has been frankly
						conceded by Mr. Stevens who is to a large extent its author.</p>
					<p>v2d. Because it takes from the States, powers plainly conferred by our
						present Constitution, thus tending to centralization.</p>
					<p>3d. Because the elective franchise is thereby extended to the negro, which,
						in the opinion of this Convention, will result in the social equality, and
						finally, in the amalgamation of the races.</p>
					<p>4th. Because the military is thereby rendered "independent of, and superior
						to the civil power."</p>
					<p>Resolved , That we give our hearty approval to the
						action of the President of the United States in removing Edwin M. Stanton
						from the position of Secretary of War-a man who held his place and sought to
						retain it for the purpose of shamelessly betraying the secrets of the
						Cabinet-and we hereby express our detestation of the recklessness of a
						partisan majority which seeks to control the Chief Executive in the
						selection of his Constitutional advisers. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That the Hon. George Sharswood, our
						candidate for the Supreme bench, we recognize the high-toned gentlemen, the
						able and eminent jurist, the patriotic statesman, and the devoted Christian;
						that by a life in private marked with unsullied purity, and in public, with
						the strictest integrity, he deserves the support of all good citizens of
						this Commonwealth. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That the notorious corruption and
						reckless extravagance of our last State Legislature have so disgraced the
						people of Pennsylvania, that their own interests and reputations demand that
						the next Legislature should be composed of better men. </p>
					<p>Resolved , That we hereby pledge our earnest
						support to the tickets this day nominated. </p>
					<p>Wm. McLellan, Esq., then addressed the Convention, exposing the evils that
						would result form the adoption of negro suffrage.</p>
					<p>On a motion, the President of the Convention was authorized to appoint the
						usual County Committee for the ensuing year.</p>
					<p>Hon. George W. Brewer, in response to the loud calls, then addressed the
