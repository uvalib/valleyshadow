                    <p>The "Border State Republican Convention, held at Baltimore on Thursday last,
                        made no distinction on account of race or color. White men and black men on
                        its floors on terms of perfect equality, and as we read in a Republican
                        newspaper printed in this State, "letters were read from white and colored
                        distinguished politicians," That mean white Tenesseean, Horace Maynard,
                        acted as President, and that mean white Yankee, Charles Sumner, wrote a
                        letter to the ring-streaked and speckled assemblage, in which, after stating
                        his inability to be present, he says:</p>
                    <p>Congress will leave undone what it ought to do if it fails to provide
                        promptly for the establishment of equal rights, whether political or civil,
                        everywhere throughout the Union. This is a solemn duty which cannot be
                        shirked or postponed. The idea is intolerable that we may, under any
                        pretension of State rights, set up a political oligarchy within its borders,
                        and then call itself a Republican government. I believe with all my soul
                        that such a government must be rejected as inconsistent with the
                        requirements of the declaration of independence. Fraternally yours,</p>
                    <p>CHARLES SUMNER.</p>
                    <p>Resolutions in accordance with the views expressed by Sumner were adopted by
                        the Convention. They declare it to be "the duty of Congress to protect the
                        equal voting rights of all loyal American citizens, without regard to
                        complexion," and suggest "the presentation to the States of a constitutional
                        amendment providing that no State shall disfranchise any citizen because of
                        race or color,"</p>
                    <p>The rank and file of the Republican party of Pennsylvania are loth to believe
                        that their leaders intend bind them hand and foot with the negro. The
                        purpose to do so has been concealed and even denied. But what, let us ask
                        them, will result from the holding of such black and White Conventions as
                        the one that met in Baltimore on Thursday last, if they do not pronounce at
                        the polls against the Radical proposition to break down all distinctions
                        founded on color? They may rely on it that if Sumner and his negro-loving
                        associates are not rebuked by the popular voice of Pennsylvania in October
                        next, Congress will do just what Sumner says it ought to do, and the white
                        men whose brains and muscle have elevated the "old Keystone" to the high
                        rank she occupies among her sister States, will be compelled to stand on the
                        same level with negroes or <emph rend="italic">fight </emph> to maintain
                        their long-established supremacy. </p>
                    <p>It is time for all to look this question squarely in the face; and it is time
                        for those Republicans who profess to be opposed to negro equality-who say
                        they don't want to sit on juries with negroes, and don't want their children
                        to have negroes for companions at school-we say it is time for all such to
                        act up to their professions. The question of negro equality is upon us.
                        Blacks and whites have met together in Convention on our very borders. Every
                        member of that Convention is the friend of Judge Williams, and would hail
                        his election with joy. Those who are determined never to submit to be put on
                        a perfect level with negroes have two courses open to them. One is to <emph
                            rend="italic">vote </emph> against negro equality-the other is to <emph
                            rend="italic">fight </emph> against it hereafter. Believing the former
                        mode of settling the question is to be infinitely preferable to the latter,
                        we exhort every white man who believes in and desires to maintain the
                        superiority of his own race, to come out and vote for Judge Sherwood. </p>

                    where speech after speech advocated equal access to the ballot for blacks, the
                    article begs local white Republicans to consider their party's "purpose." Though
                    they "are loth to believe it," white rank and file Republicans must accept the
                    fact that their leaders endorse black suffrage, in spite of the various attempts
                    to conceal and deny this truth.</summary>

                    <p>Col. McClure, who went to Montana to "prospect' for political petroleum, has
                        "made a strike." that must not be very agreeable to him. Canvassing the
                        Territory at the request of the Republican Convention, he has had the bad
                        luck to strike a "flowing well" of Democracy! Establishing his "headquarters
                        in the saddle" like Gen. Pope, he has like that redoubtable hero of
                        high-sounding words, been unhorsed and left sitting with his hind-quarters
                        on the ground. His "seed-bag" is bursted and his "oil of joy" all run out.
                        His derrick wasn't strong enough to hoist the negro up to the level of the
                        sturdy white miners of Montana. The "old red sandstone" of Democracy proved
                        too hard for his drill. Like Johnny Beitler, the white men to whom he
                        preached negro equality said "hands up, Col.," and up went both his hands
                        and his heels!</p>
                    <p>We believe the Colonel intends to come home sometime between now and "next
                        grass." In view of the negro-equality doctrines he has unsuccessfully
                        endeavored to instill into the minds of white voters of Montana, and as the
                        result must be a great bore to him, we suppose he may be expected to come by
                        what returned Californians, whose pronunciation was slightly inaccurate,
                        used to call the "Nigger-anger" route.</p>

                    <p>NO. 738 SANSOM STREET,</p>
                    <p>PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 9th 1867.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">To the people of Pennsylvania</emph>: </p>
                    <p>The Radicals attempt to evade the practical issues of the canvass and to
                        delude you into the support of their candidates.</p>
                    <p>They alone are accountable for the prostration of your business interests.
                        They have deliberately sacrificed them in order to place in the hands of
                        Southern Negroes the balance of power in the Republic and thus preserve
                        their own rule. More than two years have passed since peace was restored,
                        and we still look in vain for the increased products from the South to aid
                        us in paying the interest on our debt, and for her prosperous customers to
                        buy our woolen, iron, and other manufactures.</p>
                    <p>Instead of receiving aid to pay our debt, we are taxed to maintain a
                        freedman's bureau and a standing army in the South.-Instead of prosperous
                        customers to increase our trade, every business interest languishes.</p>
                    <p>Radical mismanagement, a negro policy, and Radical extravagance, with down
                        our energies and fetter our resources.</p>
                    <p>The whole expense of the War Department in 1860 was sixteen and a-half
                        millions, whilst in 1867 it is estimated by the Treasury at forty-seven
                        millions, both being periods of peace. To give the Negro the power to rule
                        us, therefore, costs the nation annually thirty millions, Of this amount,
                        Pennsylvania's share is at least one-tenth, and your industry must annually
                        pay three millions of dollars to support a policy that closes your woolen
                        mills and stops your factories.</p>
                    <p>In your State affairs, mismanagement, corruption and extravagance are the
                        rule. In 1860, under Democratic power the whole amount of money appropriated
                        and expended, independent of funded debt and military expenses, as shown by
                        the Treasury, was <emph rend="italic">nine hundred and ninety-eight thousand
                            dollars</emph>. In 1864, excluding the same items, the Radicals
                        appropriated and expended one million five hundred and seventy-nine thousand
                        dollars. In 1865, excluding the same items, the Radicals appropriated and
                        expended one million five hundred and nineteen thousand dollars, and in
                        1866, excluding the same items, they appropriated and expended <emph
                            rend="italic">two millions and eleven thousand dollars</emph>. The
                        reports of the Auditor General show these facts, and prove that <emph
                            rend="italic">in six years of Radical rule, your cash expenses have more
                            than doubled</emph>. </p>
                    <p>The men who have thus wasted your subsistence, prate on their loyalty and
                        their sacrifices, and would maintain their hold upon the public treasury by
                        fixing your attention upon other issues. You are oppressed by taxation
                        through internal revenue and other machinery, as no other people ever were.
                        It takes from you your legitimate profits and gives you no customers. It
                        compels you to stop manufacturing and to discharge your workmen. Your goods
                        remain unsold and your operatives suffer.-Can you expect relief from this
                        grinding taxation, so long as these enormous expenditures continue. Relief
                        can only come through economy in public affairs, a reduction in your
                        expenses, and the discharge of corrupt and extravagant officials.</p>
                    <p>It is their purpose to violate the great principle, "that each State has the
                        right to determine the qualifications of its own electors," and give the
                        negroes of Pennsylvania the balance of power between the two great political
                        parties. Negro suffrage is to be forced upon you by Congressional enactment,
                        and your "Supreme Court is to be placed in harmony" with that law, by
                        electing Judge Williams, who is relied upon to decide a right which you and
                        your organic laws deny him. In the Senate of the United States in July last,
                        the recognized lender of the Radicals of this State, voted to proceed to
                        consider a bill that was introduced by Wilson of Massachusetts, to effect
                        this infamous purpose.</p>

                        many churches a disposition in pastors to indulge in politics that detracts
                        considerably, in my estimation from their usefulness, if not from the
                        clerical propriety expected in a high-minded clergyman. As the practice will
                        be admitted to be reprehensible I submit, to the people of this and other
                        districts whether it would not be advisable, for the purpose of teaching a
                        true decorum in the pulpit, and that it be not disparaged by party politics,
                        that the true friends of the Christian faith should at once rise from their
                        seats and leave the church to those who favor such proceeding. </p>
