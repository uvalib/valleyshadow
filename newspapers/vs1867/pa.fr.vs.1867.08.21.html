<b>Startling Revelations--Conover Turns On Ashley and Exposes His Plots</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Contains a copy of a report sent to President Johnson from Acting Attorney
                    General Binckley, implicating Gen. Butler, J. Holt, and J. M. Ashley in a scheme
                    to frame President Johnson as a key figure in Lincoln's assassination. The
                    allegations in the report are based upon evidence provided by Charles Dunham
                    (alias Sanford Conover), a felon and one of the key prosecution witnesses in the
                    Surratt trial. Dunham maintains that he was "forced into association" with the
                    Radicals plotting the conspiracy.<br>

                    <p>A friend sends us a circular printed at the office of the Washington Chronicle , which is being largely circulated
                        through this Congressional District, under the frank of Hon. W. H. Koontz,
                        M. C., as a Radical campaign document. It is headed 'The position of the
                        Republican and Democratic parties, and purports to pe "a dialogue between a
                        white Republican and a colored citizen," and is addressed specially to the
                        "colored citizens," urging them to form themselves into "Leagues," and to
                        vote the Republican ticket. The following are a few of the questions and
                        answers contained in the circular, the "colored citizen" asking the
                        questions and the "white Republican' answering them: </p>
                    <p>Question. With which party should the colored man vote?</p>
                    <p>Answer. The Union Republican party.</p>
                    <p>Q. Why should the colord man vote with that party?</p>
                    <p>A. Because that party has made him free and given him the right to vote.</p>
                    <p>Q. Who abolished slavery in the District of Columbia?</p>
                    <p>A. A Republican Congress and Abraham Lincoln, a Republican President.</p>
                    <p>Q. Who freed the slaves in the South?</p>
                    <p>A. Abraham Lincoln, the Republican President by proclamation.</p>
                    <p>Q. Who passed the Freedman's Bureau Bill?</p>
                    <p>A. A Republican Congress by more than a two-thirds vote over the veto of
                        Andrew Johnson, the leader of the Democratic or Conservative party.</p>
                    <p>Q. Who gave us the Civil Rights Bill?</p>
                    <p>A. The same Republican party.</p>
                    <p>Q. What party gave us the right to vote?</p>

                    <p>Q. To what party do the leading colored men belong?</p>
                    <p>A. Without exception they belong to the Republican party/</p>
                    <p>Q. What are the most prominent principles advocated by the Republican party?</p>
                    <p>A. Equal rights before the law and at the ballot box for all men without
                        regard to race or color; that is, that every man shall have the same rights
                        and liberties as any other man.</p>

                        suffrage and negro equality? Here in this circular, issued from the office
                        of the leading Radical newspaper of Washington City, and circulated through
                        this district by General Koontz, the Radical member of Congress, we have the
                        doctrine laid down in its broadest and most unqualified form. These
                        documents are now being sent through Pennsylvania by the cart load by
                        Radical Congressmen, by means of which it is hoped to educate the masses of
                        the party up to the true New England standard on the question. Having forced
                        negro suffrage upon the people of the South against their will, they are now
                        preparing the minds of their followers in the North to accept Sumner's
                        pending bill to force the same obnoxious measure upon Pennsylvania and the
                        other Northern States. Negro suffrage is the issue to be decided in
                        Pennsylvania at the approaching fall election. Are you for or against it?

<b>General Grant</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Republicans, say the editors, are "perplexed" by Gen. Grant's decision to
                    accept a position in Johnson's Cabinet. According to the editors, however, his
                    rationale is quite simple. Grant took the offer because he endorses the
                    President's "policy of speedy reconstruction."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals are sorely perplexed just now about the position of General
                        Grant.-His prompt acceptance of the vacancy commissioned by the suspension
                        of Stanton from the War office, puzzles them amazingly.-They could stand
                        Stanton's removal, but Grant's acceptance of a seat in "A. J's" cabinet
                        drives them almost mad. This is "the most unkindest cut of all." They are
                        well aware that with Grant against them they are doomed as a party. Some of
                        their papers affect to draw comfort from the fact that General Grant, on
                        assembling the duties of the War Department, addressed Stanton a polite
                        note, in which he alluded to the "zeal, ability and patriotism" with which
                        he had  discharged the duty of Secretary of War,
                        which, in a formal note between officials, means about the same as "with
                        distinguished consideration, I am yours truly" Others undertake to justify
                        Grant by alleging that he was simply obeying a command
                         from his superior officer. This position is sheer nonsense from the
                        fact that the office of Secretary of War is a civil office and Grant was at
                        perfect liberty either to accept or reject it, which the correspondence
                        between him and Stanton and the President amply proves. But the New York
                            Tribune , more honest than the rest, boldly
                        assails Grant and takes the ground that his acceptance of the portfolio of
                        the War Department can only be construed to mean sympathy with the President
                        in his policy of speedy reconstruction. So think we. How do you like it
                        Radicals?</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors: -In the nomination of candidates
                        at our next County Convention, soon to be held, it is, I believe, conceded
                        by the country districts, that the candidates for Associate Judge and County
                        Commissioner should come from this Borough.-This is conceded, because in the
                        event of election, for all purposes at all times we would have a Judge
                        here-as well as County Commissioner-to transact business. </p>
                    <p>Now, on the other hand, it is also generally conceded that all the other
                        candidates to be nominated should com from the country districts, and among
                        them will be a candidate for Assembly. Without disparagement to the claims
                        of the others who may aspire to said nomination, we would, of our own
                        motivation, respectfully suggest to the Democracy of the country, as a
                        person in every way qualified for said position, the name of Hon. James B.
                        Orr, of Orrstown. From the experience of a few years in the Legislature;
                        from the able manner in which he represented us in said body during the
                        years 1855 and 1856; from the unblemished reputation he sustained during
                        those two years, retiring at the expiration of his second session, by the
                        party custom, with not a breath of suspicion resting upon his character.
                        Judging, I say, therefore, from all this, he is one of the few men who have
                        passed through those legislative halls without the taint of corruption upon
                        his fair name. He is one of the few men who have the moral courage to
                        withstand allurements and seductions to which a member is subjected; one of
                        the few who can pass the ordeal and not fail, as many do, a disgrace and a
                        dishonor to himself and a lasting dishoner to himself and a lasting dishoner
                        and stigma upon the party who sent them.</p>
                    <p>Let us, then, have a candidate whose honesty and integrity has been tried-an
                        honorable, high-toned gentleman as our candidate.</p>
                    <p>I need not speak further of the claims of Hon. J. B. Orr. It is enough to say
                        that Orrstown is the Gibraltar of the Democracy of Franklin county. Our
                        majority has been gradually increasing in the Orrstown district for the last
                        six or eight years. Other districts fall off in their majorities, but in it
                        our strength is always on the increase; there is no falling off-no faltering
                        in the ranks. But he is not only the faithful representative man of a large
                        connection, or of a township, but throughout the county, he is known
                        favorably, for he is one of the few of our Legislative nominees who has ever
                        reached the halls of legislation. With a fair prospect of success, let us
                        have a fair, , honest, true and tried candidate, and such, in my judgement,
                        we will have in Hon. James B. Orr.</p>

<b>Delegate Election</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>

                    <p>MESSRS. EDITORS:--I would suggest to our Democratic friends in this town and
                        throughout the county, the propriety of voting by ballot
                         at the approaching delegate elections instead of marking  as heretofore. This mode, many think, will prove more
                        expeditious and convenient, and will have the effect of bringing out a
                        larger number of Democrats to the delegate elections, as well as saving much
                        confusion, and defeating the trickery and deception, getting somewhat
                        common, in our primary elections. I would therefore respectfully suggest to
                        our Democratic friends to go to the delegate election, with the names of
                        those for whom he wishes to vote, written, or printed, upon a ticket,
                        properly headed, and insist on changing the mode of electing delegates from
                            marking  to vote by ballot .-Should this change be made, I feel confident it will
                        prove beneficial. </p>

                    <p>Several weeks since we commenced the publication of the taxable incomes of
                        Franklin county, giving Chambersburg and Guilford township, and this week we
                        give the remainder of the county. From every return there has been deducted
                        the allowance of $1000, which, by law, is untaxed; also losses incurred by
                        fire, and income reported in previous years but which has proved during 1866
                        to be worthless; house rent actually paid,
                        interest falling due, taxes paid during 1866, and all
                            income from banks, railroads and other incorporations which withhold the
                            income tax. It will be observed that all incomes will thus exceed
                        the amount published by at least $1000.-Repository

                    who died after drinking a large quantity of vitriol oil at Markle's paper mill.
                    The events leading to Beason's death began in Pittsburgh where he "indulged
                    rather freely" in liquor before being placed on train for home by some good
                    samaritans. Beason was attended to by the conductor for much of the trip but at
                    West Newton he snuck off the train and wandered about until he entered Markle's
                    place of business. There, he saw the pitcher of oil, which he mistook to be
                    water, and swallowed a large quantity of it. Beason was found several hours
                    later and was once again sent homeward. He died, however, en route at Layton's
                    Station.<br>
