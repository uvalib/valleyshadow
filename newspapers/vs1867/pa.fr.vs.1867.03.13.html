</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>To the House of Representatives: </p>
					<p>I have examined the bill "To provide for the more efficient government of the
						rebel States," with the care and anxiety which its transcendent importance
						is calculated to awaken. I am unable to give it my assent, for reasons so
						grave that I hope a statement of them may have some influence on the minds
						of the patriotic and enlightened men with whome the decision must ultimately
						rest.</p>
					<p>The bill places all the people of the ten States therein named under the
						absolute domination of military rulers, and the preamble undertakes to give
						the reason upon which the measure is based, and the ground upon which it is
						justified. It declares that there exists in those States no legal
						governments, and no adequate protection for life or property, and asserts
						the necessity of enforcing peace and good order within their limits. Is this
						true as a matter of fact?</p>
					<p>It is not denied that the States in question have each of them an actual
						government, with all the power, executive, judicial and legislative, which
						properly belong to a free State. They are organized like the other States of
						the union, and like them, they make, administer, and execute the laws which
						concern their domestic affairs. An existing de-facto government, exercising such functions as these, is itself
						the law of the State upon all matters within its jurisdiction. To pronounce
						the supreme lawmaking power of an established State illegal is to say that
						law itself is unlawful. </p>
					<p>The provisions which these governments have made for the preservation of
						order, the suppression of crime, and the redress of private injuries, are in
						substance and principle the same as those which prevail in the Northern
						States and in other civilized countries. They certainly have not succeeded
						in preventing the commission of all crime, nor has this been accomplished
						anywhere in the world. There, as well as elsewhere, offenders sometimes
						escape for want of vigorous prosecution, and occasionally, perhaps, by the
						inefficiency of courts, or the prejudice of jurors. It is undoubtedly true
						that these evils have been much increased and aggravated, North and South,
						by the demoralizing influences of civil war, and by the rancorous passions
						which the contest has engendered. But that these people are maintaining
						local governments for themselves, which habitually defeat the object of all
						government and render their own lives and property insecure, is in itself
						utterly improbable, and the averment of the bill to that effect is not
						supported by any evidence which has come to my knowledge. All the
						information I have on the subject convinces me that the masses of the
						Southern people and those who control their public acts, while they
						entertain diverse opinions on the questions of Federal policy, are
						completely united in the effort to reorganize their society on the basis of
						peace, and to restore their mutual prosperity as rapidly and as completely
						as their circumstances will permit.</p>
					<p>The bill, however, would seem to show upon its face that the establishment of
						peace and good order is not its real object. The fifth section declares that
						the preceding sections shall cease to operate in any State where certain
						events shall have happened. These events are:</p>
					<p>First . The selection of delegates to a State
						Convention by an election, at which negroes shall be allowed to vote. </p>
					<p>Second . The formation of a State Constitution of
						a provision which will secure the right of voting at all elections to
						negroes, and to such white men as may not be disfranchised for rebellion or
						felony. </p>
					<p>Third . The insertion into the State Constitution
						of a provision which will secure the right of voting at all elections to
						negroes, and to such white men as may not be disfranchised for rebellion or
						felony. </p>
					<p>Fourth . The submission of the Constitution for
						ratification to negroes and white men not disfranchised, and its actual
						ratification by their votes. </p>
					<p>Fifth . The submission of the State Constitution
						to Congress for examination and approval, and by the actual approval of it
						by that body. </p>
					<p>Sixth . The adoption of a certain amendment to the
						Federal Constitution by a vote of the Legislature elected under the new
						Constitution. </p>
					<p>Seventh . The adoption of said amendment by a
						sufficient number of other States to make it a part of the Constitution of
						the United States. </p>
					<p>All these conditions must be fulfilled before the people of any of these
						States can be relieved from the bondage of military domination; but when
						they are fulfilled , then immediately the pains and penalties of the bill
						are to cease, no matter whether there be peace and order or not, and without
						any reference to the security of life or property. The excuse given for the
						bill in the preamble is admitted by the bill itself not to be real. The
						military rule which it establishes is plainly to be used, not for any
						purpose of order or for the prevention of crime, but solely as a means of
						coercing the people into the adoption of principles and measures to which it
						is known that they are opposed, and upon which they have an undeniable right
						to exercise their own judgement.</p>
					<p>I submit to Congress whether this measure is not in its whole character,
						scope, and object, without precedent and without authority, in palpable
						conflict with the plainest provisions of the Constitution, and utterly
						destructive to those great principles of liberty and humanity for which our
						ancestors on both sides of the Atlantic have shed so much blood and expended
						so much treasure.</p>
					<p>The ten States named in the bill are divided into five districts. For each
						district an officer of the army not below the rank of Brigadier General is
						to be appointed to rule over the people, and he is to be supported with an
						efficient military force to enable him to perform his duties and enforce his
						authority.</p>
					<p>Those duties and that authority, as defined by the third section of the bill
						are "to protect all persons in their rights of person and property, to
						suppress insurrection, disorder, and violence, and to punish or cause to be
						punished, all disturbers of the public peace or criminals."</p>
					<p>The power thus given to the commanding officer over all the people of each
						district is that of an absolute monarch. His mere will is to take the place
						of all law.-The law of the States is now the only rule applicable to the
						subjects placed under his control, and that is completely displaced by the
						clause which declares all interference of State authority to be null and
						void.</p>
					<p>He alone is permitted to determine what are rights of person or property, and
						he may protect them in such way as, in his discretion, may seem proper. It
						places at his free disposal all the lands and goods in his district, and he
						may distribute them without let or hindrance to whom he pleases. Being bound
						by no State law and there being no other law to regulate the subject, he may
						make a criminal code of his own, and he can make it as any recorded in
						history, or he can reserve the privilege of acting upon the impulse of his
						private passions in each case that arises. He is bound by no rules of
						evidence; there is indeed no provision by which he is authorized or required
						to take any evidence at all. Everything is a crime which heich he chooses to
						call so, and all persons are condemned whom he pronounces to be guilty. He
						is not bound to keep any record or make any report of his proceedings. He
						may arrest his victims wherever he finds them, without warrant, accusation
						or proof of probable cause. If he gives them a trial before he inflicts the
						punishment, he gives it of his grace and mercy-not because he is commanded
						to do so.</p>
					<p>To a casual reader of the bill, it might seem that some kind of trial was
						secured by it to persons accused of crime, but such is not the case. The
						officer "may allow local civil tribunals to try offences;" but, of course,
						this does not require that he shall do so. If any State or Federal court
						presumes to exercise its legal jurisdiction by the trial of a malefactor
						without his special permission, he can break it up and punish the judges and
						jurors as being themselves malefactors. He can save his friends from
						justice, and despoil his enemies contrary to justice.</p>
					<p>It is also provided that "he shall have power to organize military
						commissions or tribunals."</p>
					<p>But this power he is not commanded to exercise. It is merely permissive and
						is to be used only when in his judgement it may be necessary for the trial
						of offenders.-Even if the sentence of a commission were made a prerequisite
						to the punishment of a party, it would be scarcely the slightest check upon
						the officer who has authority to organize it as he pleases, prescribe its
						mode of proceeding, appoint its members from among his own subordinates, and
						revise all its decisions. Instead of mitigating the harshness of his single
						will, such a tribunal would be used much more probably to divide the
						responsibility of making it more cruel and unjust.</p>
					<p>Several provisions, dictated by the humanity of Congress, have been inserted
						in the bill, apparently to restrain the power of the commanding officer, but
						it seems to me that they are of no avail for that purpose.-The fourth
						section provides, first, that trials shall not be unnecessarily delayed, but
						I think that I have shown that the power is given to punish without trial,
						and if so, this provision is practically inoperative.</p>
					<p>Second . Cruel or unusual punishment is not to be
						inflicted; but who is to decide what is cruel and what is unusual? The words
						have acquired a legal meaning by long use in the courts. Can it be expected
						that military officers will understand or follow a rule expressed in
						language so purely technical, and not pertaining, in the least degree, to
						their profession? If not, then, each officer may define cruelty according to
						his own temper, and if it is not usual, he will make it usual. Corporal
						punishment, imprisonment, the gag, the ball and chain, and the almost
						insupportable forms of torture invented for military punishment, lie within
						the range of choice. </p>
					<p>Third . The sentence of a commission is not to be
						executed without being approved by the commander, if it affects life or
						liberty, and a sentence of death must be approved by the President. This
						applies to causes in which there has been a trial and a sentence. </p>
					<p>I take it to be clear under this bill that the military commander may condemn
						to death without even the form a trial by a military commission. So that the
						life of the condemned may depend upon the will of two men instead of one.</p>
					<p>It is plain that the authority here given to the military officer amounts to
						absolute despotism. But to make it still more unendurable, the bill provides
						that it may be delegated to as many subordinates as he chooses to appoint,
						for it declares that he shall "punish or cause to be punished." Such a power
						has not been wielded by any monarch in England for more than five hundred
						years. In all that time, no people who speak the English language have borne
						such servitude. It reduces the whole population of the ten States-all
						persons of every color, sex and condition, and every stranger within their
						limits to the most abject and degrading slavery. No master ever had a
						control so absolute over his slaves as this bill gives to the military
						officers over both white and colored persons.</p>
					<p>It may be answered to this that the officers of the army are too magnanimous,
						just, and humane to oppress and trample upon a subjugated people. I do not
						doubt that army officers are as well entitled to this kind of confidence as
						any other class of men.-But the history of the world has been written in
						vain if it does not teach us that unrestrained authority can never be safely
						trusted in human hands. It is almost sure to be more or less abused under
						any circumstances, and it has always resulted in gross tyranny where the
						rulers who exercise it are strangers to their subjects, and come among them
						as the representatives of a distant power and more especially when the power
						that sends them is unfriendly.-Governments closely resembling that here
						proposed have been fairly tried in Hungary and Poland, and the suffering
						endured by these people roused the sympathies of the whole world. It was
						tried in Ireland, and though tempered at first, by principles of English
						law, it gave birth to cruelties so atrocious, that they are never recounted
						without just indignation. The French Convention armed its deputies with this
						power, and sent them to the Southern departments of the republic. The
						massacres, murders and other atrocities which they committed show what the
						passions of the ablest men in the most civilised society will tempt them to
						do when wholly unrestrained by law.</p>
					<p>The morn of our race in every age, have struggled to tie up the hands of
						their Governments and keep them within the law, because their own experience
						of all mankind taught them that rulers could not be relied on to concede
						those rights which they were not legally bound to respect. The head of a
						great empire has sometimes governed it with a mild and paternal sway, but
						the kindness and irresponsible deputy never yields what the law does not
						extort from him. Between such a master and the people subjected to his
						domination, there can be nothing but enmity; he punishes them if they resist
						his authority, and if they submit to it he hates them for their servility.</p>
					<p>I now come to a question which is, if possible, still more important. Have we
						the power to establish and carry into excution a measure like this? I
						answer, certainly not, if we derive our authority from the Constitution, and
						if we are bound by the limitations which it imposes.</p>
					<p>This proposition is perfectly clear, that no branch of the Federal
						Government, executive, legislative, or judicial, can have any just powers
						except those which it derives through and exercises under the organic law of
						the Union. Outside of the Constitution we have no legal authority more than
						private citizens, and within it we have only so much as that instrument
						gives us. This broad principle limits all our functions, and applies to all
						subjects. It protects not only the citizens of States which are within the
						Union, but it shields every human being who comes or is brought under our
						jurisdiction.</p>
					<p>We have no right to do in one place more than another that which the
						Constitution says we shall not do at all. If, therefore, the Southern States
						were, in truth, out of the Union, we could not treat their people in a way
						which the fundamental law forbids.</p>
					<p>Some persons assume that the success of our arms in crushing the opposition,
						which was made in some of the States to the execution of the Federal law,
						reduced those States, and all their people, the innocent as well as the
						guilty, to the condition of vassalage, and gave us a power over them which
						the Constitution does not bestow, or define, or limit.</p>
					<p>No fallacy can be more transparent than this. Our victories subjected the
						insurgents to legal obedience, not to the yoke of an arbitrary despotism.
						When an absolute sovereign reduces his rebellious subjects, he may deal with
						them according to his pleasure, because he had that power before. But when a
						limited monarch puts down an insurrection, he must still govern according to
						law. If an insurrection should take place in one of our States, against the
						authority of the State government, and end in the overthrow of those who
						planted it, would that take away the rights of all the people in the
						counties where it was favored by a part of a majority of the population?
						Could they for such a reason be wholly outlawed, and deprived of their
						representation in the Legislature? I have always contended that the
						Government of the United States was sovereign within its Constitutional
						sphere, that it executed its laws like the States themselves by applying its
						coercive power directly to individuals, and that it could put down
						insurrection with the same effect as a State, and no other. The opposite
						doctrine is the worst heresy of those who advocated secession, and cannot be
						agreed to without admitting that heresy to be right. Invasion, insurrection,
						rebellion, and domestic violence were anticipated when the government was
						framed, and the means of repelling and suppressing them were wisely provided
						for in the Constitution; but it was not thought necessary to declare that
						the States in which they might occur should be expelled from the Union.</p>
					<p>Rebellions, which were invariable suppressed, prior to that of which these
						questions grow. But the States continued to exist, and the Union remained
						unbroken. In Massachusetts, in Pennsylvania in Rhode Island, and in New York
						at different periods in our history, violent and armed opposition to the
						United States was carried on. But the relations of those States with the
						Federal Government were not supposed to be interrupted or changed thereby,
						after the rebellious portions of their population were defeated and put
						down. It is true that in these earlier cases there was no formal expression
						of a determination to withdraw from the Union. but it is also true that in
						the Southern States the ordinances of secession were treated by all the
						friends of the Union as mere nullities, and are now acknowledged to be so by
						the States themselves. If we admit that they had any force or validity, or
						that they did, in fact, take the States out of the Union, we sweep from
						under our feet all the grounds upon which we stand in justifying g the use
						of Federal force to maintain the integrity of the Government. This is a bill
						passed by Congress in time of peace. There is not, in any one of the States
						brought under its operation, either war or insurrection. The laws of the
						States, and of the Federal Government are all in undisturbed and harmonious
						operation.-The courts, State and Federal, are open and in full exercise of
						their proper authority. Over every State comprised in these five military
						districts, life, liberty, and property are secured by State laws and Federal
						laws, and the National Constitution is everywhere obeyed. What, then, is the
						ground upon which this bill proceeds? The title of the bill announces that
						it is intended for the more efficient government of these ten States. It is
						recited by way of preamble, that no legal State governments, nor adequate
						protection for life or property exist in these States, and that peace and
						good order should be thus enforced.</p>
					<p>The first thing which arrests attention, upon these recitals which prepare
						the way for martial law, is this: That the only foundation upon which
						martial law can exist, under our from of government, is not stated or so
						much as pretended; actual war, foreign invasion, domestic insurrection-none
						of these appear, and none of these, in fact, exist. It is not even recited
						that any sort of war or insurrection is threatened.-Let us pause here to
						consider, upon this question of constitutional law and the power of
						Congress, a recent decision of the Supreme court of the United States in
							ex parte Milligan. I will first quote from
						the opinion of the majority of the court; "Martial law cannot arise from a
						threatened invasion. The necessity must be actual and present, the invasion
						real, such as effectually closes the courts and deposes civil
						administration." We see that martial law comes in only when actual war
						closes the courts and deposes the civil authority. But this bill, in time of
						peace, makes martial law operate as though we were in actual war and become
						the cause instead of the consequence of the abrogation of civil authority.
						One more quotation: </p>
					<p>"It follows from what has been said on this subject that there are occasions
						when martial law can be properly applied. If in foreign invasion or civil
						war the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer
						criminal justice according to law, then, on the theatre of active military
						operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a
						substitute for the civil authority thus overthrown, to preserve the safety
						of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is
						allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free
						course." I now quote from the opinion of the minority of the court,
						delivered by Chief Justice Chase: "We by no means assert that Congress can
						establish and apply the laws of war where no war has been declared or
						exists. Where peace exists the laws of peace must prevail." This is
						sufficiently explicit. Peace exists in all the territory to which this bill
						applies. It asserts a power in Congress in time of peace to set aside the
						laws of peace and to substitute the laws of war. The minority concurring
						with the majority declares that Congress does not possess that power. Again,
						and if possibly more emphatically, the Chief Justice with remarkable
						clearness and condensation sums up the whole matter as follows: "There are
						under the Constitution three kinds of military jurisdiction, one to be
						exercised both in peace and war; another to be exercised in time of foreign
						war without the boundaries of the United States, or in time of rebellion and
						civil war within States or districts occupied by rebels, treated as
						belligerents, and a third to be exercised in time of invasion or
						insurrection within the limits of the United States, or during rebellion
						within the limits of the States maintaining adhesion to the National
						Government, when the public danger requires its exercise. The first of these
						may be called jurisdiction under military law, and is found in acts of
						Congress prescribing rules and articles of war, or otherwise providing for
						the government of the national forces. The second may be distinguished as
						military government, superseding, as far as may be deemed expedient, the
						local law, and exercised by the military commander, under the direction of
						the President, with the express or implied sanction of Congress.-While the
						third may be denominated martial law proper, and is called into action by
						Congress, or temporarily, when the action of Congress cannot be invited, and
						in the case of justifying or excusing peril, by the President; in times of
						insurrection or invasion; or of civil or foreign war within districts or
						localities where ordinary law no longer adequately secures public safety and
						private rights." It will be observed that of the three kinds of military
						jurisdiction which can be exercised or created under our Constitution, there
						is but one that can prevail in peace, and that is the code of laws enacted
						by Congress for the government of the national forces. That body of military
						law has no application to the citizen, nor even the citizen, soldier
						enrolled in the militia in time of peace. But this bill is not a part of
						that sort of military law for that applies only to the soldier, and not to
						the citizen, while contrariwise the military law provided by this bill
						applies only to the citizen and not to the soldier.</p>
					<p>I need not say to the representatives of the American people that their
						Constitution forbids the exercise of judicial power in any way but one, that
						is, by the ordained and established courts. It is equally well-known that in
						criminal cases a trial by jury is made indispensable by the express words of
						that instrument. I will not enlarge on the inestimable value of the right
						thus secured to every freeman, or speak of the danger to public liberty in
						all partsof the country, which must ensue from a denial of it anywhere or
						upon any pretense. A very recent decision of the Supreme Court has traced
						the history, vindicated the dignity, and made known the value of this great
						privilege, so clearly that nothing more is needed. To what extent a
						violation of it might be excused in time of war or public danger, may admit
						of discussion. But we are providing now for a time of profound peace, when
						there is not an armed soldier within our borders, except those who are in
						the service of the government. It is in such a condition of things that an
						act of Congress is proposed, which, if carried out, would deny a trial by
						the law courts and juries to nine millions of American citizens and to their
						posterity for an indefinite period.-It seems to be scarcely possible that
						any one should believe this consistent with a constitution which declares in
						simple, plain and unambiguous language, that all persons shall have that
						right, and that no person, shall ever, in any case, be deprived of it. The
						Constitution also forbids the arrest of the citizen, without judicial
						warrant founded on probable cause. This bill authorizes an arrest without
						warrant, at the pleasure of a military commander. The Constitution declares
						that "no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous
						crime, unless on presentment by a grand jury." This bill holds every person
						not a soldier answerable for all crimes and all charges without any
						presentment. The Constitution declares that "no person shall be deprived of
						life, liberty or property, without due process of law." This bill sets aside
						all process of law, and makes the citizen answerable, in his person and
						property, to the will of one man, and as to his life, to the will of two.
						Finally, the Constitution declares that "The privilege of the writ of habeus corpus shall not be suspended unless when in
						case of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it;" whereas
						this bill requires martial law, which of itself suspends this great writ in
						time of peace, and authorizes the military to make the arrest, and give to
						the prisoner only one privilege, and that is a trial without unnecessary
						delay. He has no hope of release from custody, except the hope, such as it
						is, of release by acquittal before a military commission. The United States
						are bound to guarantee to each State a republican form of government. </p>
					<p>Can it be pretended that this obligation is not palpably broken, if we carry
						out a measure like this, which wipes away every vestige of republican
						government in ten States, and puts the life, property, liberty and honor of
						all the people, in each of them under the domination of a single person
						clothed with unlimited authority. The Parliament of England, exercising the
						omnipotent power which it claimed, was accustomed to pass bills of
						attainder; that is to say, it would convict men of treason and other crimes
						by legislative enactment. The person accused, had a hearing, sometimes and a
						patient and fair one, but generally party prejudice prevailed instead of
						justice. It often became necessary for Parliament to acknowledge its error,
						and reverse its own action. It acknowledges its error, and reverse its own
						action. The fathers of our country determined that no such thing should
						occur here. They withheld the power from Congress, and thus forbade its
						exercise by that body, and they provided in the Constitution that no State
						should pass any bill of attainder. It is therefore impossible for any person
						in this country to be constitutionally punished for any crime by a
						legislative proceeding of any sort. Nevertheless, here is a bill of
						attainder against nine millions of people at once. It is based upon an
						accusation so vague as to be scarcely intelligible, and found to be true
						upon no credible evidence; not one of the nine millions was heard in his own
						defense. The representatives of the doomed parties were excluded from all
						participation in the trial. The conviction is to be followed by the most
						ignominious punishment ever inflicted on large masses of men. It
						disfranchises them by hundreds of thousands, and degrades them all, even
						those who are admitted to be guiltless, from the rank of free men to the
						condition of slaves. The purpose and object of the bill, the general intent
						which pervades it from beginning to end, is to change the entire structure
						and character of the State governments and to compel them by force to the
						adoption of organic laws and regulations which they are unwilling to accept,
						if left to themselves. The negroes have not asked for the privilege of
						voting; the vast majority of them have no idea what it means.-This bill not
						only thrusts it into their hands, but compels them, as well as the whites,
						to use it in a particular way.</p>
					<p>If they do not form a Constitution with prescribed articles in it, and
						afterwards elect a Legislature which will act upon certain measures in a
						prescribed way, neither black nor white can be relieved from the slavery
						which the bill imposes upon them. Without pausing to consider the policy or
						impolicy of Africanizing the Southern part of our territory, I would simply
						ask the attention of Congress to the manifest, well known and universally
						acknowledged rule of constitutional law which declares that the Federal
						government has no jurisdiction, authority, or power to regulate such
						subjects for any State. To force the rights of suffrage out of the hands of
						the white people, and into the hands of the negroes, is an arbitrary
						violation of this principle. This bill imposes martial law at once, and its
						operation will begin as soon as the general and his troops can be put in
						place. The dread alternative between its harsh rule, and compliance with the
						terms of this measure, is not suspended nor the people afforded time for
						deliberation. The bill says to them-Take martial law first; then deliberate.
						And when they have done all that this measure requires them to do, other
						conditions and contingencies, over which they have no control, yet remain to
						be fulfilled; before they can be relieved from martial law, another Congress
						must first approve the Constitutions, made in conformity with the will of
						this Congress, and must declare these States entitled to representation in
						both houses. The whole question thus remains open and unsettled, and must
						again occupy the attention of Congress; and in the meantime the agitation
						which now prevails will continue to disturb all portions of the people.</p>
					<p>The bill also denies the legality of the governments of ten of the Sates
						which participated in the ratification of the amendments to the Federal
						Constitution abolishing slavery for ever within the jurisdiction of the
						United States, and practically excludes them from the Union. If this
						assumption of the bill be correct, their concurrence cannot be considered as
						having been legally given; and the important fact is made to appear that the
						consent of three-fourths of the States, the requisite number, has not been
						constitutionally obtained to the ratification of that amendment, thus
						leaving the question of slavery where it stood before the amendment was
						officially declared to have become a part of the Constitution. That the
						measure proposed by this bill does violate the Constitution in the
						particulars mentioned, and in many other ways, which I forbear to enumerate,
						is to clear to admit of the least doubt.</p>
					<p>It only remains to consider whether the injunctions of that instrument ought
						to be obeyed or not. I think they ought to be obeyed, for which I will
						proceed to give as briefly as possible. In the first place, it is the only
						system of free government which we can hope to have as a nation; when it
						ceases to be the rule of our conduct, we may, perhaps, take our choice
						between complete anarchy, a consolidated despotism, and a total dissolution
						of the Union. But national liberty, regulated by law, will have passed
						beyond our reach. It is the best frame of government the world ever saw; no
						other is, or can be, so well adapted to the genius, habits, or wants of the
						American people, combining the strength of a great empire with unspeakable
						blessing of local self-government, having a central power to defend the
						general interests; and recognizing the authority of the States as the
						guardians of authority of the States as the guardians of industrial rights.
						It is "the sheet anchor of our safety abroad, and our peace at home." It was
						ordained "to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic
						tranquillity, promote the general welfare, provide for the common defense,
						and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity."
						These great ends have been attained heretofore, and will be again by
						faithful obedience to it; but they are certain to be lost if we treat with
						disregard its sacred obligations. It was to punish the gross crime of
						defying the Constitution, and to vindicate its supreme authority, that we
						carried on a bloody war of four years' duration.</p>
					<p>Shall we now acknowledge that we sacrificed a million of lives, and expended
						billions of treasure, to enforce a Constitution which is not worthy of
						respect and preservation? Those who advocated the right of secession,
						alleged in their own jurisdiction that we had no regard for law, and that
						their rights of property, life and liberty would not be safe under the
						Constitution, as administered by us. If we now verify this assertion, we
						prove that they were in truth and in fact fighting for their liberty. And
						instead of branding their leaders with the dishonoring name of traitors
						against a righteous and legal government, we elevate them in a history to
						rank of self-sacrificing patriots; consecrate them to the admiration of the
						world, and place them by the side of Washington, Hampden and Sydney. No. Let
						us leave them to the infamy they deserve. Punish them as they should be
						punished according to law, and take upon ourselves no share of the odium
						which they should bear alone. It is a part of public history, which can
						never be forgotten, that both Houses of Congress, in July, 1861, declared,
						in the form of solemn resolution, that the war was, and should be carried on
						for no purpose of subjugation, but solely to enforce the Constitution and
						laws; and that when this was yielded by the parties in rebellion, the
						contest should cease, with the constitutional rights of the States, of
						individuals unimpaired.</p>
					<p>This resolution was adopted and sent forth to the world, unanimously, by the
						Senate, and with only two dissenting voices in the House. It was accepted by
						the friends of the Union, in the South as well as in the North, as
						expressing honestly and truly the object of the war. On the faith of it,
						many thousands of persons, in both sections, gave their lives and their
						fortunes to the cause. To repudiate it now, by refusing to the States and to
						the individuals within them the rights which the Constitution and laws of
						the Union would secure to them, is a breach of our plighted honor, for which
						I can imagine no excuse, and to which I cannot become a party.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We publish on our first page to-day the great message of President Johnson
						vetoing the military despotism bill. It is perhaps the ablest state paper
						which ever emanated from the executive department of the government. The
						position it assumes on the grave constitutional questions involved in the
						bill is incontrovertible, and its masterly logic unanswerable. No radical
						has yet been found bold enough to undertake to deny the one or answer the
						other. This great document should be read and pondered by every American
						citizen. If it  will not arouse the people from
						the dangerous apathy into which they have fallen, then nothing will. If this
						tide of revolution which is rapidly sweeping away all the safe-guards of
						liberty be not speedily checked-if the warning voice of the President be not
						heeded by the American people-this message will, in all probability, go down
						to history as the funeral oration of the once great American Republic. The
						Richmond Times  very pertinently speaks of the
						message "As an able, earnest, and eloquent protest against the complete
						demolition of that constitutional form of government which has heretofore
						existed in this country, it will live in history as the most remarkable
						state paper connected with the annals of this short-lived republic. Congress
						having annihilated the civil rights and liberties of ten millions of people
						and created the most frightful and absolute military despotism of modern
						times, the Commander-in-Chief of the army
						protests against being converted, by statute, into a Czar, with limitless
						powers to murder and pillage the people of ten States.-The veto of a bill
						which transforms an officer, whose powers are limited by the Constitution,
						into a military despot, is the President's refutation of the charge that he
						is seeking to rob Congress of its powers.-Congress places the lives and
						liberties of ten millions of people at the feet of Andrew Johnson, and he
						refuses to exchange his constitutional powers for the unrestricted authority
						of a despot. We search in vain the pages of ancient, medieval, and modern
						history for a more splendid instance of exalted patriotism.</p>
