<b>The Radical Line Breaking</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In reaction to the Republicans' lack of unity on several key issues
                    currently being debated in Congress, the editor suggests that the "culminating
                    point of venality and tyranny has at last been reached." Accordingly, he
                    predicts an imminent demise for the party's radical faction.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The power of the Radical leaders is at last beginning to break. Sings of the
                        disintegration of this monstrous and corrupt party are becoming more and
                        more apparent every day. It would seem from present appearances that they
                        cannot hold together much longer-that the culminating point of venality and
                        tyranny has at last been reached, and that henceforth its career will be
                        downward, followed and driven by the execrations of the American people
                        whose liberties it attempted to destroy, until it sinks irretrievably in the
                        gulf of its own infamy. They can no longer agree among themselves in
                        Congress. The lash of Stevens is no longer potent to bring the refractory
                        into line. The more timid amount them are becoming alarmed at the enormity
                        of their own crimes. They hear the distant mutterings of an indignant and
                        outraged people and tremble for their safety, as well they may. Hence the
                        distraction in the radical ranks at Washington, at the present moment.</p>
                    <p>For nearly two years they have kept the country in a state of doubt and
                        uncertainty by hindering the judicious policy devised by a patriotic
                        President for the speedy restoration of the constitutional relations of the
                        seceded States, and now when the people absolutely demand peace and
                        reconciliation in some shape they find themselves all at [UNCLEAR] totally
                        unable to agree upon anything even looking towards restoration.-The pet
                        measure of Mr. Stevens for the "reconstruction" of the Southern States
                        introduced in the early part of the session was buried in the "tomb of the
                        capulets," a short time ago by a decided vote, to the infinite chagrin of
                        the "great commoner." Another bill introduced by him as Chairman of the
                        Committe on Reconstruction, and doubtless intended as a substitute for the
                        former bill, providing for the establishment of a military despotism over
                        the Southern States, is likely to meet with no better fate. When, on Friday
                        last, moved the previous question on this bill intending to force it through
                        under the party lash, there were but 61 votes cast to sustain him to 98
                        (including the Democrats) against him. So the previous question was not
                        seconded.</p>
                    <p>The power of Stevens and his fellow conspirators is evidently breaking. This
                        will be hailed as good news by all the true friends of liberty in this
                        country. The death of the radical party will be the salvation of the nation.
                        Courage, then, freemen, there is hope ahead-the priceless heritage of
                        liberty bequeathed to us by our fathers may yet be saved. The incubus which
                        has been weighing down the people and crushing out the vital principles of
                        the Republic is destined soon to be rooed off by the weight of its own
                        corruption. Heaven speed the day of deliverance.</p>

<b>Political Fanatacism</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>

<b>Governor Geary and the Pardoning Power</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>After taking pains to lay out an official policy for granting pardons, the
                    governor, says the article, ignored his own mandate when he freed an election
                    judge who had been convicted for refusing to accept the vote of an alleged
                    deserter. Accordingly, Geary's rules and regulations regarding pardons should be
                    viewed as an attempt "to deceive the masses."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The present Chief Magistrate of this Commonwealth made a special point in his
                        inaugural address with reference to the pardoning power, its use and abuse.
                        Promises of care and circumspection in the exercise of this important
                        function of the Governor were pushed prominently into the foreground of his
                        first official communication with the people, and the Radical press was
                        filled will allusions to the reforms that were to be made in this
                        particular. Since that time the Governor caused to be published certain
                        rules concerning the issuing of pardons, in order that the public might
                        acquainted with his reformatory intentions.-Under these rules those desiring
                        that a pardon may be extended to a certain individual, convicted and
                        sentenced must give notice in the papers that a pardon is to be asked for.
                        They must also serve a notice of that publication upon the attorney who
                        prosecuted and the judge who tried the case, in order that they may take
                        part in the issue, if they desire to do so. But this is not enough to
                        satisfy the tender and exacting conscience of the Governor. After these
                        things are done in accordance with the commands of the State Executive, then
                        the legal documents and records of the trial must be filed, with full notes
                        of the evidence; grounds on which the interposition of the Governor is
                        solicited; recommendations from responsible persons in the prisoner's
                        vicinity as to his former character, a recommendation of mercy from the jury
                        that heard the case and rendered the verdict, and lastly, letters from the
                        judge and prosecuting attorney joining in the desire for a pardon. This is
                        the channel through which the Governor publicly announces that official
                        clemency and mercy can reach and offender. The door to the mercy seat can be
                        opened in no other way.</p>
                    <p>This being the position assumed with such ostentatious persistency by
                        Governor Geary, the following manner in which his Excellency constructs and
                        acts upon his new rules is full of refreshing interest: Jonathan Bieber, a
                        Judge of Elections, in Bucks County, was recently tried in that county for
                        misdemeanor, in having refused to receive the vote of Samuel Reinert, an
                        alleged deserter, at the October election, and on trial was convicted. That
                        fact was laid before the Governor by the political friends of the prisoner,
                        and when he was called up for sentence, his attorney presented to the Court
                        a full and free pardon from Governor Geary; and Mr. Bieber was accordingly
                        liberated.-In this case the Governor violated the principles laid down in
                        his inaugural, as well as the regulations issued since that time with
                        reference to the granting of pardons, in the most flagrant manner. He
                        exacted none of the testimony which is said to be necessary before a pardon
                        will be issued. The judge was not notified, nor the attorney, nor was a
                        letter from the jury required. He even pardoned the prisoner in advance of
                        the imposition of sentence. Nor was the case one in which the prisoner acted
                        from a mistaken conception of his duty. The Supreme Court of the State,
                        before the October election, had declared that a man was not a "deserter" in
                        the eyes of the law until he had been tried and convicted before a competent
                        tribunal. This fact was well known in all parts of the State, and yet, in
                        defiance of this decision of the highest judicial tribunal of the State, Mr.
                        Bieber refused the vote of a citizen accused of being a deserter. For this
                        he was properly convicted, and yet Governor Geary pardons him in the manner
                        stated, thus breaking his own regulations, insulting the Supreme Court, by
                        the eagerness he displays to make their decision in the "deserter" cases of
                        no practical effect.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore, certain that all Governor Geary's rules and regulations with
                        reference to the granting of pardons are merely intended to deceive the
                        masses. He does not intend they shall apply to his political friends. If a
                        half-starved man takes a loaf of bread, and is convicted, a compliance with
                        all the rules will be exacted. The pound of flesh will be demanded. But if a
                        Radical judge of elections steals the elective franchise from a maimed
                        soldier, and is tried and convicted for the offense, not one of the
                        regulations are enforced, and the offender is pardoned even before the
                        sentence. In this manner Governor Geary discharges the duties of his high
                        office. He is a mere partisan ruler, and will bend all the powers of his
                        station to aid the Radical in and out of the State.-Age. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>TUESDAY FEB. 3</p>
                    <p>The following petitions were presented:</p>
                    <p>Messrs. Connell, White, Shoemaker, Worthington, Cowles and others presented
                        petitions in favor of allowing colored persons to ride in public conveyance.</p>
                    <p>An act to punish by fine any railroad company that excludes colored persons
                        from its cars was considered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wallace (Democrat) moved to amend by changing the section so as to allow
                        colored persons to occupy seats at the ends of the cars.</p>
                    <p>Mr White, (Republican) favored the bill, but held that it was illegal to
                        indict a corporation for misdemeanor. Some amendment seemed to be needed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wallace held that the duty of the corporation was done when it furnished
                        comfortable seats, and held further that the colored persons had no right to
                        intrude themselves upon the seats devoted to white persons.</p>
                    <p>The amendment of Mr. Wallace was lost by 14 ayes to 16 nays.</p>
                    <p>A running discussion took place as to the wording of the section-whether the
                        language made the corporation liable or merely its agents. There appeared to
                        be a technical difficulty in convicting a corporate body of a misdemeanor.
                        The matter was finally adjusted by a proposition of Senator Cowles to make
                        the company which shall permit persons to be excluded liable to all action
                        of debt to the person aggrieved in the sum of $500. This proposition was
                        agreed to by 17 ayes and 14 nays.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Searight (Democrat) offered an amendment releasing the penalty in case
                        any company shall set apart separate cars for colored persons or separate
                        seats at the end of a car. Lost by a party vote of 16 Republicans to 13
                        Democrats.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wallace (Democrat) offered the following: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to compel
                        the admission of negroes into berth in sleeping cars, or to punish any one
                        for the exclusion of persons of color from cars set apart for the use of
                        ladies. Lost 17 yeas to 14 [?] nays. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Brown, (Republican), of Mercer, offered an amendment, as follows: Provided, That nothing in this act shall be so
                        construed as to prohibit any officer, agent or conductor of any railroad in
                        this Commonwealth whose cars are now drawn by steam power from setting apart
                        certain cars for the accommodation of particular classes of passengers:
                            Provided further, That no distinction shall
                        be made on account of race or color. </p>
                    <p>Various Republican senators urged the withdrawal of this amendment, and it
                        was accordingly withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Donovan (Democrat) moved to amend by making the penalty $100 due for
                        excluding a negro, and imprisoning the party who offends until Fred Douglas
                        is elected President of the United States and Thaddeus Stevens Vice
                        President, (Laughter.) Ruled out of order.</p>
                    <p>Mr. M Conaughy (Republican) moved to refer the bill back to the committee, in
                        order that it might be perfected.</p>
                    <p>The subject was interrupted by the hour of adjournment, and was held over.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Searight, of Fayette, read an act to inflict the death penalty upon
                        negroes and mulattos who may be convicted of certain heinous crimes.</p>

                        night last week when he decamped. Sometime in the evening he removed his
                        baggage clandestinely, and about 12 o'clock attempted to let himself out of
                        the house by means of a false key but on being discovered hastily retreated
                        to his room, followed by Mr. McGrath who demanded immediate payment of his
                        bill. On failure to respond to this preemptory demand, he was locked in his
                        room, but sometime during the night effected his escape by picking the lock
                        and letting himself down from the balcony by means of the sheet of his bed.
                        His escape was discovered soon thereafter, and pursuit made, but without
                        success. The Sheriff however secured the trunk of the rascal at Seller's
                        Hotel, where it had been left for transportation to Gettysburg. The
                        gentleman has since been arrested in Gettysburg, and incarcerated in the
                        jail at that place, on a charge of having robbed the Waynesboro Postoffice
                        some months since. We learn that he figured in the latter place as Mr.
                        Clarke a teacher of penmanship, and left about the time of the robbery.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have very frequently in the columns of our paper warned the public against
                        catching at the numerous tempting baits presented to them through swindling
                        circulars sent by mail. These are generally of the "lottery" character, but
                        the ordinary dodge has become so generally known that it fails to bring the
                        usual amount of pelf into the pockets of the sharpers. A new and more
                        seductive scheme has been devised, which consists in first sending a prize
                        ticket to the party intended to be victimized, with a request to send on the
                        prize of the ticket (ten dollars) that the prize might be paid, following
                        this up by a "private and confidential" circular, which runs in this wise:
                        "Dear Sir; Your ticket has drawn a prize of $200, but as you have not paid
                        for it, you can obtain the prize only in this way: Write me a letter dated
                        on the day of drawing and enclose ten dollars, the price of the ticket, as
                        soon as received. I will go to the mangers and open it in their presence,
                        saying this letter was mailed in the post office, but the money and date are
                        correct. They do not know that your ticket drew a prize, and will take the
                        money and send you a certificate.-Write nothing about this letter, as the
                        rule is, when an order arrives after the drawing to take it to the managers
                        before opening. The money must be enclosed and the letter mailed from your
                        office. I can alter the date of the postmark. On receipt of prize money
                        please show it to your friends, and advise them to purchase tickets from my
                        office. My object is to create an excitement in your place and sell many
                        tickets for the next drawing. Send immediately."</p>
                    <p>The circular is signed by a fictitious name, and the party, is requested to
                        address him at the headquarters of the "lottery," wherever they may be
                        located. Of course the object is to bag the ten dollars, after which the
                        poor dupe may whistle for his "prize." We feel sure that, should such a
                        circular fall into the hands of any of our readers, they will not suffer
                        themselves to be diddled by it, but quietly treat it as much waste
                    paper.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A large and fashionable audience were in attendance at the Hall on last
                        Thursday evening, to witness a magnificent spectacle to be given by the
                        Chambersburg Cornet Band. The public had been made aware of the fact by the
                        extravagant puffery in the form of bills, posted upon ruined walls, pumps
                        and tree-boxes, which was enough to disgust people by their ridiculous
                        details, yet on the night of the 7th the Hall was filled with people eager
                        to behold the performance. Whether that audience were really agreeably
                        entertained with the ludicrous display of unripeness of intellect, evinced
                        in many ways by the performers, I cannot say, but it was evident that some
                        who were present were pleased, if clapping of hands and stamping of feet was
                        any indication of their appreciation.</p>
                    <p>The music was acknowledged to be wretched, the playing of the band being dull
                        and wearisome, they having selected just such music as did not suit the
                        occasion, nor that they could render with effect; and when the quartette
                        were sung it was done by voices extremely weak. But that part of the
                        entertainment could be overlooked. Inferior music was expected, but great
                        was our surprise to behold a man appear upon the stage, robed in female
                        attire, acting the part of a negress-"Young Rose of Wolfstown." How
                        disgusting he appeared, those who were present well know. What motive
                        prompted the band to present so vulgar a character we cannot conceive,
                        unless they desired to display their very unrefined taste in the most
                        conspicuous manner. If such was their object, we heartily congratulate them
                        upon their consummate success.</p>
                    <p>Finally the curtain rose for the third time to reveal to our wondering gaze
                        what was intended to be-the enchanting scene of the Elfin Grotto, a Fairy
                        Grotto, near Edinburg, Scotland, as the programme informed us. Now we must
                        confess that the scenery was remarkably well arranged and had the play been
                        good, and the actors have exhibited any talent in its presentation, the
                        serio-comic Parlor Entertainment might have been sufficiently interesting to
                        have been listened to for a short time: but as it was, we think the whole a
                        striking combination f errors, which could not be otherwise than apparent to
                        any one not entirely devoid of taste.</p>
                    <p>The invention of the plot would have been creditable to a school boy who
                        desired to amuse his school-fellows with an original composition, but not as
                        the production of men could it be deemed of any importance. A prominent
                        feature of that "drama of impossibilities: was a Goatherd sleeping on a
                        chest in a Grotto; that surely was a very singular idea. We were not aware
                        that the Scotch had chests placed where their Goatherds kept watch over
                        their flocks; but probably the good people living in the castle over the
                        lake, had sent the chest over for the young gentleman's accommodation, the
                        Scotch sometimes do such queer things. And again a great stretch of the
                        imagination is necessary to conceive how one of Adam's sons could be
                        transformed into a Fairy, it is supposed that Fairies very frequently assist
                        human beings in certain undertakings; but we must confess ourself ignorant
                        of the fact that any author of cabalistic philosophy affirms that those
                        creatures of the elements, surpassing human beings in knowledge and power,
                        have the power to impart to the man their wisdom of things occult; therefore
                        the transformation of the Goatherd was one of the many absurdities,
                        conspicuous in the band's comedy. Finally we would ask the band if Fairies
                        are frequently torn to pieces by Irishmen and Dutchmen, "stuck agin rocks
                        that people may dink the friz to death," then live again and torment their
                        destroyers by making invisible imps visible, together with their fiery
                        Dragons! How silly this display appeared in connection with a Fairy scene,
                        only those who were present at the Hall on last Thursday evening can
                        appreciate.</p>
                    <p>FRANCISCO.</p>
