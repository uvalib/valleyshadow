					<p>READ IN CONGRESS DECEMBER 3d, 1867.</p>
					<p>FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:</p>
					<p>The continued disorganization of the Union, to which the President has so
						often called the attention of Congress, is yet a subject of profound and
						patriotic concern. We may, however, find some relief from that anxiety in
						the reflection that the painful political situation, although before untried
						by ourselves, is not new in the experience of nations. Political science,
						perhaps as highly perfected in our own time and country as in any other, has
						not yet disclosed any means by which civil wars can absolutely prevented. An
						enlightened nation, however with a wise and beneficent constitution of free
						government, may diminish their frequency and mitigate their severity by
						directing all its proceedings in accordance with fundamental law.--When
						civil war has been brought to a close it is manifestly the first interest
						and duty of a State to repair the injuries which war has inflicted and to
						secure the benefit of the lessons it teaches as fully and speedily as
						possible. This duty was upon the termination of the rebellion promptly
						accepted, not only by the Executive Department, but by the Insurrectionary
						States themselves, and restoration in the first moment of peace was believed
						to be as easy and certain as it was indispensable. These expectations,
						however, then so reasonably and confidently entertained, were disappointed
						by legislation from which I felt constrained by my obligations to the
						constitution, to withhold my assent. It is therefore, a source of profound
						regret that, in complying with the obligation imposed upon the President by
						the constitution, to give Congress from time it time information of the
						state of the Union, that I am unable to communicate any definite adjustment
						satisfactory to the American people of questions which since the close of
						the rebellion have agitated the public mind. On the contrary, candor compels
						me to declare that at this time there is no Union as our fathers understood
						the term, and as they meant it to be understood by us; the Union which they
						established can exist only where all States are represented in both houses
						of Congress, where one State is as free as another to regulate its internal
						concerns according to its own will, and where the laws of central
						government, strictly confined to matters of national jurisdiction, apply
						with equal force to all the people of every section. That such is not the
						present state of the Union is a melancholy fact; and we all must acknowledge
						that the restoration of the States to their proper legal relations with the
						federal government and with one another, according to the terms of the
						original compact, would be the greatest temporal blessing which God in his
						kindest Providence could bestow upon this nation. It becomes our imperative
						duty to consider whether or not it is impossible to effect this most
						desirable consummation. The Union and constitution are inseparable; as long
						as one is obeyed by all parties and the other will preserved, and if one is
						destroyed both must perish together. The destruction of the constitution
						will be followed by the other and still greater calamities. It was ordained
						not only to form a more perfect union between the States, but to "establish
						justice, insure domestic tranquility, providefor the common defence, promote
						general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
						prosperity." Nothing but implicit obedience to its requirements in all parts
						of the country will accomplish these great ends. Without that obedience we
						can look forward only to continual outrages upon individual rights,
						incessant breaches of public peace, national weakness, financial dishonor,
						the total loss of our prosperity, general corruption of morals and the final
						extinction of popular freedom. To save our country from evils so appalling
						as those we should renew our efforts again and again. To me the process of
						restoration seems perfectly plain and simple. It consists merely in a
						faithful application of the constitution and the laws. The execution of the
						laws is not now obstructed or opposed by physical force; there is no
						military or other necessity, real or pretended, which can prevent obedience
						to the constitution, either North or South. All rights and all obligations
						of the States and individuals can be protected and enforced by means
						perfectly consistent with the fundamental law. The courts may be everywhere
						open, and if open their process would be unimpeded, and crimes against the
						United States can be prevented or punished by proper judicial authorities in
						a manner entirely practicable and legal. There is, therefore, no reason why
						the constitution should be disregarded and violated at the mere naked will
						of the government, or of some one or more of its branches. Is there any
						obstacle that can exist to a perfect Union of all the States on this
						momentous question and some of the measures growing out of it? I have had
						the misfortune to differ with Congress, and have expressed my conviction
						without reserve, though with becoming deference to the opinion of the
						legislative department.--Those convictions are not only unchanged, but
						strengthened by subsequent events and further reflection. The transcendent
						importance of the subject will be a sufficient excuse for calling your
						attention to some of the reasons which have so strongly influenced my own
						judgement. I hope that we may all finally concur in a mode of settlement
						consistent at once with our true interests and with our sworn duty to the
						constitution, which is too natural and too just to be easily relinquished.
						It is clear to my apprehension that the States lately in rebellion are still
						members of the national Union. When did they cease to be so? The ordinances
						of secession adopted by a position --in most of them a very small
						portion--of their citizens were mere nullities. If we admit now that they
						were valid and effectual for the purpose intended by their authors, we sweep
						from under our feet the whole ground upon which we justified the war. Were
						those States afterwards expelled from the Union by war? The direct country
						was averred by this government to be its purpose, and was so understood by
						all those who gave their blood and treasure to aid in its prosecution. It
						cannot be that a successful war waged for the preservation of the union had
						the legal effect of dissolving it. The victory of the nation's arms was not
						the disgrace of her policy; the defeat of secession on the battlefield was
						no triumph of its lawless principle, nor could Congress, with or without the
						consent of the Executive, do anything which would have the effect directly
						or indirectly, of separating the States from each other. To dissolve the
						Union is to repeal the constitution which holds it together, and that is the
						power which does not belong to any department of this government or to all
						of them united. This is so plain that it has been acknowledged by all
						branches of the federal government. The Executive (my predecessor as well as
						myself) and heads of all the departments have uniformly acted upon the
						principle that the Union is not only undissolved, but indissoluble.</p>
					<p>Congress submitted an amendment to the Constitution to be ratified by the
						Southern States, and accepted their acts of ratification as necessary and
						lawful exercise of their highest functions. If they were not States, or were
						States out of the Union their consent to change the fundamental law of the
						Union would have been nugatory [UNCLEAR]and Congress in asking it committed
						a political absurdity. The Judiciary has also given the solemn sanction of
						its authority to the same view of the case. The Judges of the Supreme Court
						have included the Southern States in their circuits, and they are constantly
						in banc and elsewhere exercising jurisdiction which does not belong to them
						unless those States are States of the Union. If these Southern States are
						component parts of the Union, the Constitution is the supreme law for them,
						as it is for all the other States. They are bound to obey it, and so are we.
						The right of the federal government, which is clear and unquestionable, to
						enforce the constitution upon them implies correlative obligation on our
						part to observe its limitations and execute its guarantees. Without the
						constitution we are nothing; by, through and under the constitution we are
						what it makes us. We may doubt the wisdom of the law; we may not approve of
						the law; we may not approve of its provisions, but we cannot violate it
						merely because it seems to confine our powers within limits narrower than we
						could wish. It is not a question of individual, or class or sectional
						interest much less of party predominance, but of duty, of a high and sacred
						duty, which we are all sworn to perform. If we cannot support the
						constitution with the cheerful support and the constitution with the
						cheerful alacrity of those who love and believe in it, we must give to it at
						least the fidelity of public servants, who act under solemn obligations and
						commands which they dare not disregard.</p>
					<p>There is another consideration which though of minor importance, is yet of
						great weight. On the 22d of July, 1861, Congress declared, by an almost
						unanimous vote of both houses, that the war should be conducted solely for
						the purpose of preserving the Union, and maintaining the supremacy of the
						federal constitution and laws, without impairing the dignity, equality, and
						rights of the States, or of individuals, and that when this was done the war
						should cease. I do not say that this declaration is personally binding on
						those who joined in making it, any more than individual members of Congress
						are personally bound to pay a public debt created under a law for which they
						voted. But it was a solemn, public, official pledge of the national honor,
						and I cannot imagine upon what grounds the repudiation of it is to be
						justified, if it be remembered that this promise was not made to rebels
						only. Thousands of true men in the South were drawn to our standards by it,
						and hundreds of thousands in the North gave their lives in the belief that
						it would be carried out. It was made on the day after the first great battle
						of the war had been fought and lost. All patriotic and intelligent men then
						saw the necessity of giving such an assurance, and believed that without it
						the war would end in disaster to our cause. Having given that assurance in
						the extremity of our peril, the violation of it now, in the day of our
						power, would be a rending of that good faith which holds the moral world
						together.--Our country would cease to have any claim upon the confidence of
						men. It would make the war not only a failure but a fraud.</p>
					<p>Being sincerely convinced that these views are correct. I would be unfaithful
						to my duty if I did not recommend the repeal of the acts of Congress which
						place ten of the Southern States under the domination of military masters.
						If calm reflection shall satisfy a majority of your honorable bodies that
						the acts referred to are not only a violation of the national faith, but in
						direct conflict with the constitution, I dare not permit myself to doubt
						that you will immediately strike them from the statute book.</p>
					<p>To demonstrate the unconstitutional character of these acts, I need do no
						more than refer to their general provisions. It must be seen at once that
						they are not authorized to dictate what alteration shall be made to the
						constitution of the several States. To control the election of State
						legislators and State officers, and members of Congress and electors for
						President and Vice President, by arbitrarily declaring who shall vote and
						who shall be excluded from that privilege; to dissolve State Legislatures or
						prevent them from assembling; to dismiss judges and appoint others without
						regard to State law; to organize and operate all the political machinery of
						the States; to regulate the whole administration of their domestic and local
						affairs according to the mere will of strange and irresponsible agents sent
						among them for that purpose,--these are powers not granted to the federal
						government, or to any one of its branches. Not being granted, we violate the
						constitution in the face of a positive interdict, for the constitution
						forbids us to do whatever it does not affirmatively authorize--either by
						express words or by clear implication. If the authority we desire to use
						does not come through the constitution, we can exercise it only by
						usurpation, and usurpation is the most dangerous of all political crimes. By
						that crime the enemies of free government in all ages have worked out their
						designs against public liberty and private right. It leads, directly and
						immediately, to the establishment of absolute rule, for undeleted power is
						always unlimited and unrestrained. The acts of Congress in question are not
						only objectionable for their assumption of ungranted power, but many of
						their provisions are in conflict with the direct provisions of the
						Constitution. The constitution commands that a republican form of government
						shall be guaranteed to all the States; that no person shall be deprived of
						life, liberty or property, without due process of law, arrested without a
						judicial warrant, or punished without a fair trial before an impartial jury;
						that the privilege of <emph rend="italic">habeas corpus</emph> shall not be
						denied in time of peace, and that no bill of attainder shall be pushed even
						against a single individual. Yet the system of measures established by these
						acts of Congress does totally subvert and destroy the form as well as the
						substance of republican government in the ten States to which they apply. It
						binds them hand and foot in absolute slavery, and subjects them to a strange
						and hostile power more unlimited and more unlikely to be abused than any
						other now known among civilized man. </p>
					<p>It tramples down all those rights in which the essence of liberty consists,
						and which a free government is always most careful to protect. It denies the
							<emph rend="italic">habeas corpus</emph> and the trial by jury. Personal
						freedom, property and life, if assailed by the passion, the prejudice, or
						the rapacity of the ruler have no security whatever. It has the effect of a
						bill of attainder or a bill of pains and penalties not upon a few
						individuals, but upon whole masses, including the millions who inhabit the
						subject States and even their unborn children. These wrongs being expressly
						forbidden, can not be constitutionally inflicted upon any portion of our
						people no matter how they may have come within our jurisdiction, and no
						matter whether they live in States, Territories or districts. </p>
					<p>I have no desire to save from the proper and just consequences of their great
						crime, those who engaged in rebellion against the government, but as a mode
						of punishment, the measures under consideration are the most unreasonable
						that could be invented. Many of these people are perfectly innocent. Many
						kept their fidelity to the Union untainted to the last. Many were incapable
						of any legal offence. A large proportion of the persons able to bear arms,
						were forced into rebellion against their will, and of those who are guilty
						with their own consent, the degree of guilt are as various as the shades of
						their character and temper.</p>
					<p>But these acts of Congress confound them altogether in one common doom.
						Indiscriminate vengeance upon classes, sects and parties, or upon whole
						communities for offences committed by a portion of them against the
						governments to which they made obedience, was common in the barbarous ages
						of the world, but Christianity and civilization have made such progress that
						recourse to a punishment so cruel and unjust would meet with the
						condemnation of all unprejudiced and right minded men. The primitive justice
						of this age, and especially of this country, does not consist in stripping
						whole States of their liberties, and reducing all their people, without
						distinction, to the condition of slavery. It deals separately with each
						individual, confines itself to the forms of law, and vindicates its own
						purity by an impartial examination of every case before a competent judicial
						tribunal.</p>
					<p>If this does not satisfy all our desires with regard to Southern rebels, let
						us console ourselves by reflecting that a free constitution, triumphant in
						war, and unbroken in peace, is worth far more to us and our children than
						the gratification of any present feeling. I am aware it is assumed that this
						system of government is to be only provisional, but it is through this
						temporary evil that a greater evil is to be made perpetual. If the
						guarantees of the constitution can be broken provisionally, to serve a
						temporary purpose, and in part only of the country, we can destroy them
						everywhere and for all time. Arbitrary measures often change, but they
						generally change for the worse.--It is the curse of despotism that it has no
						halting place. The intermitted exercise of its power brings no sense of
						security to its subjects, for they can never know what more they will be
						called to endure when its red right hand is armed to plague them again. Nor
						is it possible to conjecture how or where power unrestrained by law may seek
						its next victims. The States that are still free may be enslaved at any
						moment. For if the constitution does not protect all, it protects none.</p>
					<p>It is manifestly and avowedly the object of these laws to confer upon the
						negro the privilege of voting, and to disfranchise such white citizens as
						will give the former a clear majority at all elections in the Southern
						States. This, to the minds of some persons, is so important that a violation
						of the constitution is justified as a means of bringing it about. That
						morality is always false which excuses a wrong because it proposes to
						accomplish a desirable end.--We are not permitted to do evil that good may
						come. But in this case the end itself is evil as well as the means. The
						subjugation of the States to the negro domination would be worse than the
						military despotism under which they are now suffering. It was believed
						beforehand that the people would endure any amount of military oppression
						for any length of time rather than degrade themselves by subjection to the
						negro race. Therefore, they have been left without choice. Negro suffrage
						was established by act of Congress, and the military officers were commanded
						to superintend the process of clothing the negro race with the political
						privileges torn from white men.</p>
					<p>The blacks in the South are entitled to be well and humanely governed and to
						have the protection of just laws for all their rights of person and
						property. If it were practicable at this time to give them a government
						exclusively their own, under which they might manage their own things in
						their own way, it would become a grave question whether we ought to do so,
						or whether common humanity would not require us to save them from
						themselves. But under the circumstances this is only a speculative point. It
						is not proposed merely that they shall govern themselves, but that they
						shall rule the white race, make and administer State laws, elect Presidents
						and members of Congress, and shape to a greater or less extent the future
						destiny of the whole country.--Would such a trust and power be safe in such
						hands?</p>
					<p>The peculiar qualities which should characterize any people who are fit to
						decide upon the management of public affairs for a great State have seldom
						been combined. It is the glory of white men to know that they have had these
						qualities in sufficient measure to build upon this continent a great
						political fabric, and to preserve its stability for more than ninety years,
						while in every other part of the world all similar experiments have failed.
						But if any thing can be proved by known facts, if all reasoning upon
						evidence is not abandoned, it must be acknowledged that in the progress of
						nations, negroes have shown less capacity for government than any other race
						of people. No independent government of any form has ever been successful in
						their hands.--On the contrary, whenever they have been left to their own
						devices, they have shown a constant tendency to relapse into barbarism. In
						the Southern States, however, Congress has undertaken to confer upon them
						the privilege of the ballot. Just released from slavery, it may be doubted
						whether as a class they know more than their ancestors how to organize and
						regulate civil society. Indeed, it is admitted that the blacks of the South
						are not only regardless of the rights of property, but so utterly ignorant
						of public affairs that their voting can consist in nothing more than
						carrying a ballot to the place where they are directed to deposit it.</p>
					<p>I need not remind you that the exercise of the elective franchise is the
						highest attribute of an American citizen, and that when guided by virtue,
						intelligence, patriotism, and a proper appreciation of our free institutions
						it constitutes the true basis of a democratic form of government in which
						the sovereign power is lodged in the body of the people. A trust
						artificially created, not for its own sake, but solely as a means of
						promoting the general welfare, its influence for good must necessarily
						depend upon the elevated character and true allegiance of the elector. It
						ought, therefore, to be reposed in none except those who are fitted morally
						and mentally to administer it well; for if conferred upon persons who do not
						justly estimate its value and who are indifferent as to its results, it will
						only serve as a means of placing power in the hands of the unprincipled and
						ambitious, and must eventuate in the complete destruction of that liberty of
						which it should be the most powerful conservator.</p>
					<p>I have therefore, heretofore urged upon your attention the great danger to be
						apprehended from an untimely extension of the elective franchise to any new
						class in our country, especially when the large majority of that class in
						wielding the power placed in their hands, cannot be expected correctly to
						apprehend the duties and responsibilities which pertain to suffrage.
						Yesterday, as it were, four millions of persons were held in a condition of
						slavery that had existed for generations. To-day they are freemen, and are
						assumed by law to be citizens. It cannot be presumed from their previous
						condition of servitude that, as a class, they are as well informed as to the
						nature of our government as the intelligent foreigner who made our land the
						home of his choice. In the case of the latter, neither a residence of five
						years and the knowledge of our institutions which it gives, nor attachment
						to the principles of the constitution, are the only conditions upon which he
						can be admitted to citizenship. He must prove, in addition, good moral
						character, and thus give reasonable ground for the belief that he will be
						faithful to the obligations which he assumes as a citizen of the Republic.
						Where a people, the source of all political power, speak by their suffrages
						through the instrumentality of the ballot box, it must be carefully guarded
						against the control of those who are corrupt in principle and enemies of
						free institutions. For it can only become to our political and social system
						a safe conductor of healthy popular sentiment when kept free from
						demoralizing influences. Controlled through fraud and usurpation by
						designing, anarchy and despotism must inevitably follow. In the hands of the
						patriotic and worthy, our government will be preserved upon the principles
						of the Constitution inherited from our fathers.</p>
					<p>It follows, therefore, that in admitting to the ballot box a new class of
						voters not qualified for the exercise of the elective franshise, we weaken
						our system of government, instead of adding to its strength and durability.</p>
					<p>I yield to no one in attachment to that rule of general suffrage which
						distinguishes our policy as a nation. But there is a limit, wisely observed
						hitherto, which makes the ballot a privilege and a trust, and which requires
						of some classes a time suitable for probation. To give it indiscriminately
						to a new class, wholly unprepared by previous habits and opportunities to
						perform the trust which it demands, is to degrade it and finally destroy its
						power, For it may be safely assumed that no political truth is better
						established than that such indiscriminate and all-embracing extension of
						popular suffrage must end at last in its overthrow and destruction.</p>
					<p>I repeat the expression of my willingness to join in any plan within the
						scope of our constitutional authority which promises to better the condition
						of the negroes in the South, by encouraging them in industry, enlightening
						their minds, improving their morals, and giving them protection to their
						just rights as freedmen, but the transfer of our political inheritance to
						them, would, in my opinion, be an abandonment of a duty which we owe alike
						to the memory of our fathers and the rights of our children.</p>
					<p>The plan at putting the Southern States wholly, and the general government
						partially into the hands of negroes is proposed at a time peculiarly
						unpropitious. The foundations of society have been broken up by civil war.
						Industry must be re-organized, justice re-established, public credit
						maintained, and order brought out of confusion. To accomplish these ends
						would require all the wisdom and virtue of the great men who formed our
						institutions originally. I confidently believe that their descendants will
						be equal to the arduous task before them, but it is worse than madness to
						expect that negroes will perform it for us; certainly we ought not to ask
						their assistance until we despair of our own competency. The great
						difference between the two races in physical, mental and moral
						characteristics will prevent an amalgamation or fusion of them together in
						one homogeneous mass. If the inferior obtains the ascendancy over the other
						it will govern with reference only to its own interests, for it will
						recognize no common interest, and create such a tyranny as this continent
						has never yet witnessed. Already the negroes are influenced by promises of
						confiscation and plunder. They are taught to regard as an enemy every white
						man who has any respect for the rights of his own race. If this continues,
						it must become worse and worse until all order will be subverted, all
						industry cease, and the fair fields of the South grow up into a wilderness.</p>
					<p>Of all the dangers which our nation has yet encountered none are equal to
						those which must result from the successes of the effort now making to
						Africanize the half of our country.</p>
					<p>I would not put consideration of money in competition with justice and right,
						but the expenses incident to reconstruction under the system adopted by
						Congress aggravate what I regard as the intrinsic wrong of the measure
						itself. It has cost uncounted millions already, and, if persisted in, will
						add largely to the weight of taxation, just complaint, and may finally
						reduce the treasury of the nation to a condition of bankruptcy. We must not
						delude ourselves. It will require a strong standing army and probably more
						than two hundred millions of dollars ($200,000,000) per annum to maintain
						the supremacy of negro governments after they are established. The sum thus
						thrown away would, if properly used, form a sinking fund large enough to pay
						the whole national debts in less than fifteen years. It is vain to hope that
						negroes will maintain their ascendancy themselves.--Without military power
						they are wholly incapable of holding in subjection the white people of the
						South. I submit to the judgement of Congress whether the public credit may
						not be injuriously affected by a system of measures like this. With our debt
						and the vast private interests which are complicated with it, we cannot be
						too cautious of a policy which might possibly impair the confidence of the
						world in our government. That confidence can only be regained by carefully
						inculcating the principles of justice and honor on the popular mind, and by
						the most scrupulous fidelity to all our engagements of every sort. Any
						serious breach of the organic law, persisted in for a considerable time,
						cannot but create fears for the stability of our institutions. Habitual
						violation of prescribed rules which we bind ourselves to observe, must
						demoralize the people. Our only standard of civil duty being set at naught,
						the sheet anchor of our political morality is lost, the public conscience
						swings from its moorings and yields to every impulse of passion and
						interest. If we repudiate the Constitution, we will not be expected to care
						much for mere pecuniary obligations. The violation of such a pledge as we
						made on the 22d day of July, 1861, will assuredly diminish the market value
						of our other promises. Besides, if we now acknowledge that the national debt
						was created, not to hold the States in the Union as the tax-payers were led
						to suppose, but to expel them from it and hand them over to be governed by
						negroes, the moral duty to pay it may seem much less clear. I say it may
						seems so; for I do not admit that this or any other argument in favor of
						repudiation, can be entertained as sound; but its influence on some classes
						of minds may well be apprehended.</p>
					<p>The financial honor of a great commercial nation largely indebted, and with a
						Republican form of government, administered by agents of the popular choice,
						is a thing of such delicate texture, and the destruction of it would be
						followed by such unspeakable calamity, that every true patriot must desire
						to avoid whatever might expose it to the slightest danger. The great
						interests of the country require immediate relief from these enactments.
						Business in the South is paralyzed by a sense of general insecurity, by a
						terror of confiscation and the dread of negro supremacy. The Southern trade,
						from which the North would have derived so great a profit under the
						government of law, still languishes, and can never be revived until it
						ceases to be fettered by the arbitrary power which makes all its operations
						unsafe. That rich country, the richest in natural resources the world ever
						saw, is worse than lost if it be not soon placed under the protection of a
						free constitution. Instead of being, as it ought to be, a source of wealth
						and power, it will become an intolerable burden upon the rest of the nation.</p>
					<p>Another reason for retracing our steps will doubtless be seen by Congress in
						the late manifestations of the public opinion upon this subject. We live in
						a country where the popular will always enforces obedience to itself, sooner
						or later. It is vain to think of opposing it with anything short of legal
						authority backed by overwhelming force.--It cannot have escaped your
						attention that from the day on which Congress fairly and formally presented
						the proposition to govern the Southern States by military force, with a view
						to the establishment of negro supremacy, every expression of the general
						sentiment has been more or less adverse to it. The affections of this
						generation cannot be detached from the institutions of their ancestors.
						Their determination to preserve the inheritance of free government in their
						own hands, and transmit it, undivided and unimpaired, to their own
						posterity, is too strong to be successfully opposed. Every weaker passion
						will disappear before that love of liberty and law for which the American
						people are distinguished above all other in the world. How far the duty of
						the President to preserve, protect and defend the constitution, requires him
						to go in opposing any unconstitutional act of Congress, is a very serious
						and important question, on which I have deliberated much, and felt extremely
						anxious to reach proper conclusion. Where an act has been passed according
						to the forms of the constitution by the supreme legislative authority, and
						is regularly enrolled among the public statutes of he country, Executive
						resistance to it, especially in times of high party excitement, would be
						likely to produce violent collision between the respective adherents of the
						two branches of the government. This would be simply civil war, and civil
						war must be resorted to only as the last remedy for the worst of
						evils.--Whatever might tend to provoke it should be most carefully avoided.
						A faithful and conscientious magistrate will concede very much to honest
						error, and something even to perverse malice, before he will endanger the
						public peace, and he will not adopt forcible measures, or such as might lead
						to force, so long as those which are peaceable remain open to him or his
						constituents.--It is true that cases may occur in which the Executive would
						be compelled to stand on its rights and maintain them regardless of all
						consequences. If Congress should pass an act which is not only in palpable
						conflict with the constitution, but will certainly, if carried out, produce
						immediate and irreparable injury to the organic structure of the government,
						and if there be neither judicial remedy for the wrongs it inflicts, nor
						power in the people to protect themselves without the official aid of their
						elected defender; if, for instance, the legislative department should pass
						an act, even through all the form of law, to abolish a co-ordinate
						department of the government; in such a case the President must take the
						high responsibilities of his office and save the life of the nation. At all
						hazards the so called reconstruction acts, though as plainly
						unconstitutional as any that can be imagined, were not to be within the
						class last mentioned. The people were not wholly disarmed of the power of
						self-defence. In all the Northern States they still held in their hands the
						sacred right of the ballot, and it was safe to believe that in due time they
						would come to the rescue of their own institutions. It gives me pleasure to
						add that the appeal to our common constituents was not taken in vain, and
						that my confidence in their wisdom and virtue seems not to have been
						misplaced.</p>
					<p>It is well and publicly known that enormous frauds have been perpetrated on
						the Treasury, and that colossal fortunes have been made at the public
						expense. This species of corruption has increased--is increasing, and if not
						diminished will soon bring us into total ruin and disgrace. The public
						creditors and the tax-payers are alike interested in an honest
						administration of the finances, and neither class will long endure the large
						handed robberies of the recent past. For this discreditable state of things
						there are several causes--some of the taxes are so laid as to present an
						irresistible temptation to evade payment; the great sums which officers may
						win by connivance at fraud create a pressure which is more than the virtue
						of many can withstand and there can be no doubt that the open disregard of
						constitutional obligations avowed by some of the highest and most
						influential men in the country has greatly weakened the moral sense of those
						who serve in subordinate places. The expense of the United States, including
						interes on the public debt, are more than six times as much as they were
						seven years ago. To collect and disburse this vast amount requires careful
						supervision as well as systematic vigilance. The system, never perfected,
						was much disorganized by the "Tenure of Office bill," which has almost
						destroyed official accountability. The President may be thoroughly convinced
						that an officer is incapable, dishonest, or unfaithful to the Constitution;
						but under the law which I have named, the utmost he can do is to complain to
						the Senate and ask the privilege of supplying his place with a better man.
						If the Senate be regarded as personally or politically hostile to the
						President, it is natural and not altogether unreasonable for the officer to
						expect that it will take his part, as far as possible, restore him to his
						place, and give him a triumph over his executive superior. The officer has
						other chances of impunity, arising from accidental defects of evidence, the
						mode of investigating it, and the secresy of the hearing. It is not
						wonderful that official malfeasance should become bold in proportion as the
						delinquents to learn to think themselves safe. I am entirely persuaded that
						under such a rule the President cannot perform the great duty assigned to
						him of seeing the laws faithfully enforced, and that it disables him most
						especially from enforcing that rigid accountability which is necessary to
						the due execution of the revenue laws. The constitution invests the
						President with authority to decide whether a removal should be made in any
						case. The act of Congress declares in substance that he shall only accuse
						such as he supposes to be unworthy of their trust. The constitution makes
						him sole judge in the premises. But the statute takes away his jurisdiction,
						transfers it to the Senate, and leaves him nothing but the odious, and
						sometimes impracticable, duty of becoming a prosecutor. The prosecution is
						to be conducted before a tribunal whose members are not like him responsible
						to the whole people, but to separate constituent bodies, and who may hear
						his accusation with great disfavor. The Senate is absolutely without any
						known standard of decision applicable to such a case. Its judgement cannot
						be anticipated, for it is not governed by any rule. The law does not define
						what shall be deemed good cause for removal. It is impossible even to
						conjecture what may or may not be so considered by the Senate. The nature of
						the subject forbids clear proof. If the charge be incapacity, what evidence
						will support it? Fidelity to the constitution may be understood or
						misunderstood in a thousand different ways, and by violent party men in
						violent party times unfaithfulness to the constitution may even come to be
						considered meritorious. If the officer be accused of dishonesty, how shall
						it be made out? Will it be inferred from acts unconnected with public duty,
						form private history, or from general reputation? or must the President
						await the commission of an actual misdemeanor in office? Shall he in the
						meantime, risk the character and interest of the nation in the hands of men
						to whom he cannot give his confidence? Must he forbear his complain until
						the mischief is done and cannot be prevented? If his zeal in the public
						service should impel him to anticipate the over act, must he move at the
						peril of being tried himself for the offence of slandering his subordinate?</p>
					<p>In the present circumstances of the country some one must be held responsible
						for official delinquency of every kind. It is extremely difficult to say
						where that responsibility should be thrown, if it be not left where it has
						been placed by the constitution.</p>
					<p>But all just men will admit that the President ought to be entirely relieved
						from such responsibility if he cannot meet it by reason of restrictions
						placed by law upon his action. The unrestricted power of removal from office
						is a very great one to be trusted even to a magistrate chosen by the general
						suffrage of the whole people and accountable directly to them for his acts.
						It is undoubtedly liable to abuse, and at some periods of our history
						perhaps has been abused.</p>
					<p>If it be thought desirable and constitutional that it should be so limited as
						to make the President merely a common informer against other public agents,
						he should at least be permitted to act in that capacity before some open
						tribunal independent of party politics, ready to investigate the merits of
						every case, furnished with the means of taking evidence, and bound to decide
						according to established rule.--This would guarantee the safety of the
						accuser when he acts in good faith, and at the same time secure the rights
						of the other party.</p>
					<p>I speak, of course, with all proper respect for the present Senate; but it
						does not seem to me that any legislative body can be so constituted as to
						insure its fitness for these functions. It is not the theory of this
						government that public offices are the property of those that hold them.
						They are given merely as a trust for the public benefit, sometimes for a
						fixed period--sometimes during good behavior; but generally they are liable
						to be terminated at the pleasure of the appointing power, which represents
						the collective majesty and speaks the will of the people. The forced
						retention in office of a single dishonest person may work treat injury to
						the public interests. The danger to the public service comes not from the
						power to remove but from the power to appoint. Therefore it was that the
						framers of the constitution left the power of removal unrestricted, while
						they gave the senate a right to reject all appointments which in its opinion
						were not fit to be made. A little reflection on this subject will probably
						satisfy all who have the good of the country at heart, that our best course
						is to take the constitution for our guide, walk in the path marked out by
						the founders of the republic, and obey the rules made sacred by the
						observance of our great predecessors. The present condition of our finances
						and circulating medium is one to which your early consideration is invited.
						The proportion which the currency of any country should bear to the whole
						value of the annual produce circulated by its means is a question upon which
						political economists have not agreed. Nor can it be controlled by
						legislation, but must be left to the irrevocable laws which everywhere
						regulate commerce and trade. The circulating medium will ever irresistibly
						flow to those points where it is in greatest demand. The law of demand and
						supply is as unerring as that which regulates the tides of the ocean, and
						indeed, currency, like the tides, has its ebbs and flows throughout the
						commercial world. At the beginning of the rebellion, the bank note
						circulation of the country amounted to not much more than two hundred
						millions of dollars. Now the circulation of national bank notes and those
						known as legal tenders is nearly seven hundred millions. While it is urged
						by some that this amount should be increased, other contend that a decided
						reduction is absolutely essential to the best interests of the country. In
						view of these diverse opinions, it may be well to ascertain the real value
						of our paper issues when compared with metallic or convertible currency. For
						this purpose let us inquire how much gold and silver could be purchased by
						the seven hundred millions of paper money now in circulation. Probably not
						more than half the latter, showing that when our paper currency is compared
						with gold and silver, its commercial value is compressed into three hundred
						and fifty millions. This striking fact makes it the obvious duty of the
						government, as early as may be consistent with the principles of sound
						political economy, to take such measures as will enable the holder of its
						notes and those of the national banks to convert them without loss into
						specie or its equivalent. A reduction of our circulating medium need not
						necessarily follow.--This, however, would depend upon the law of demand and
						supply, though it should be borne in mind that by making legal tender and
						bank notes convertible into coin or its equivalent, their present specie
						value in the hands of their holders would be enhanced one hundred per cent.
						Legislation for the accomplishment of a result so desirable is demanded by
						the highest public considerations. The constitution contemplates that
						circulating medium of the country shall be uniform in quality and value. At
						the time of the formation of that instrument of the country had just emerged
						from the war of the revolution and was suffering from the effects of a
						redundant and worthless paper currency. The sages of that period were
						anxious to protect their posterity from the evils which they themselves had
						experienced. Hence, in providing a circulating medium, they conferred upon
						Congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof, at the same
						time prohibiting the State from making anything but gold and silver a tender
						in payment of debts. The anomalous condition of our currency is in striking
						contrast with that which was originally designed.--Our circulation embraces,
						first, notes of the national banks which are made receivable for all dues to
						the government, excluding imports, and by all its creditors, excepting in
						payment of interest upon its bonds and the securities themselves; second,
						legal tender notes issued by the United States and which the law requires
						shall be received as well in payment of all debts by citizens as of all
						government dues excepting imports; and third, gold and silver coin.--By the
						operation of our present system of finance, however, the metallic currency,
						when collected, is reserved only for our own class of government creditors
						who, holding its bonds, semi-annually receive their interest in coin from
						the national treasury.--They are thus made to occupy an invidious position
						which may be used to strengthen the arguments of those who would bring into
						disrepute the obligations of the nation in paying off all its debts plighted
						faith of the government should be inviolably maintained, but while it acts
						with fidelity towards the bondholder who loaned his money that the integrity
						of the Union might be preserved, it should at the same time observe good
						faith with the great masses of the people who, having rescued the union from
						the perils of rebellion, now bear the burden of taxation that the government
						may be able to fulfill its engagements. There is no reason which will be
						accepted as satisfactory by the people , why those who defend us on the land
						and protect us on the sea, the pensioner upon the gratitude of the nation,
						bearing the scars of wounds received while in its defence, the public
						servants in the various departments of the government, the farmer who
						supplies the soldiers of the army and the sailors of the navy, the artisan
						who toils in the nation's workshops, or the mechanics and laborers who build
						its edifices and construct its forts and vessels of war, should in payment
						of their just and hard earned dues receive depreciated paper, while another
						class of their countrymen, no more deserving are paid in coin of gold and
						silver. Equal and exact justice requires that all the creditors of the
						government should be paid in a currency possessing a uniform value. This can
						only be accomplished by the restoration of the currency to the standard
						established by the constitution, and by this means we would remove a
						discrimination which may, if it has not already done so, create a prejudice
						that may become deep rooted and wide spread, and imperil the national
						credit. The feasibility of making our currency correspond with the
						constitutional standard may be seen by reference to a few facts derived our
						commercial statistics. The production of precious metals in the United
						States, from 1849 to 1857, inclusive, amounted to $579,000,000; from 1858 to
						1860, $137,500,000; from 1861 to 1867, inclusive, $467,000,000, making the
						grand aggregate of products since 1849, $1,174,000,000. The amount of specie
						coined from 1849 to 1857, inclusive was $429,000,000, from 1858 to 1860,
						inclusive, $125,000,000, and from 1861 to1867, inclusive, $310,000,000
						making the total coinage since 1849 $874,000,000. From 1849 to 1857,
						inclusive, the net exports of specie amounted to $271,000,000, from 1858 to
						1861, $148,000,000, and from 1861 to 1867, inclusive, $322,000,000, making
						the aggregate of net exports since 1849 $741,000,000. These figures show an
						excess of product over net exports of $438,000,000. There are in the
						treasury $111,000,000 in coin, something more than $40,000,000 in
						circulation on the Pacific Coast and a few millions in the national and
						other banks, in all about $460,000,000. This however taking into account the
						specie in the country prior to 1849, leaves more than three hundred millions
						of dollars which have not been accounted for by exportation, and therefore
						may yet remain in the country. These are important facts, and show how
						completely the inferior currency will supersede the better; forcing it from
						circulation among the masses, and causing it to be exported as a mere
						article of trade to add to the money capital of foreign lands. They show the
						necessity of retiring our paper money that the return of gold and silver in
						the avenues of trade may be invited and a demand created, which will cause
						the retention at home of at least so much of the productions of our rich and
						inexhaustible gold-bearing fields as may be sufficient for purposes of
						circulation. It is unreasonable to expect a return to sound currency, so
						long as the government continues to issue irredeemable notes and fills the
						channels of circulation with depreciated paper. Notwithstanding a coinage by
						our mints since 1849 of eight hundred and seventy four millions of dollars,
						the people are now strangers to currency which was designed for their use
						and benefit; and specimens of the precious metals bearing the national
						device are seldom seen except when produced to gratify the interest excited
						by their novelty.</p>
					<p>If depreciated paper is to be continued as the permanent currency of the
						country, and all our coin is to become a mere article of traffic and
						speculation to the enhancement in price of all that is indispensable to the
						comfort of the people, it would be wise economy to abolish our mints, thus
						saving the nation the care and expense incident to such establishments, and
						let all our precious metals be exported in bullion.</p>
					<p>The time has come, however, when the government and national banks should be
						required to take the most efficient steps and make all necessary
						arrangements for a resumption of specie payments at the earliest practicable
						period. Specie payments having been once resumed by the government and
						banks, all notes or bills of paper issued by the United States of a less
						denomination than twenty dollars should by law be excluded from circulation,
						so that the people may have the benefit and convenience of a gold and silver
						currency, which in all their business transactions will be uniform in value
						at home and abroad. Every man of property or industry, every man who desires
						to preserve what he honestly possesses, or to obtain what he can honestly
						earn, has a direct interest in maintaining a safe circulating medium; such a
						medium as shall be real and substantial; not liable to vibrate with
						opinions; not subject to be blown up or down by the breath of speculation,
						but to be made stable and secure. A disordered currency is one of the
						greatest political evils. It undermines the virtues necessary for the
						support of the social system and encourages propensities destructive of its
						happiness. It wars against industry, frugality and economy, and it fosters
						the evil spirits of extravagance and speculation. It has been asserted by
						one of our profound and most gifted statesmen that "of all the contrivances
						for cheating the laboring classes of mankind none has been more effectual
						that that which deludes them with paper money." This is the most effectual
						of inventions to fertilize the rich man's fields by the sweat of the poor
						maris brow. Ordinary tyranny, oppression, excessive taxation, these bear
						lightly on the happiness of the mass of the community, compared with a
						fraudulent currency and the robberies committed by depreciated paper. Our
						own history has recorded for our instruction enough, and more than enough,
						of the demoralizing tendency, the injustice and the intolerable oppression
						on the well-disposed of a degraded paper currency, authorized by law or in
						any way countenanced by government. It is one of the most successful devices
						in times of peace or war, expansion or revulsions, to accomplish a transfer
						of the precious metals from the great mass of people into the hands of the
						few, where they are boarded in secret places or deposited in strong boxes
						under bolts and bars, while the people are left to endure all the
						inconveniences, sacrifice and demoralization resulting from the use of a
						depreciated and worthless paper-money.</p>
					<p>The condition of our finances and the operations of our revenue system are
						set forth and fully explained in the able instructive report of the
						Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
					<p>On the 30th of June, 1866 the public debt amounted to $2,783,425,879; on the
						30th June last it was $2,692,199,215, showing a reduction during the fiscal
						year of $91,226,664. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1867, the
						receipts were $490, 694,010, and expenditures $346,729,129, leaving an
						available surplus of $143,904,880. It is established that the receipts for
						the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868, will be $417, 161, 928 and that the
						expenditures will reach the sum of $303,269,226, leaving in the Treasury a
						surplus of $23,892,702. For the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1869, it is
						estimated that the receipts will amount to $381,000,000 and that the
						expenditures will be $372,000,000 showing an excess of $9,000,000 in favor
						of the government.</p>
					<p>The attention of Congress is earnestly invited to the necessity of a thorough
						revision of our revenue system. Our internal revenue laws and impost system
						should be so adjusted as to bear most heavily on articles of luxury, leaving
						the necessities of life as free from taxation as may be consistent with the
						real wants of the government economically administered. Taxation would not
						then fall unduly on the man of moderate means, and while none would be
						entirely exempt from assessment, all, in proportion to their pecuniary
						abilities, would contribute towards the support of the state.</p>
					<p>A modification of the internal revenue system by a large reduction in the
						number of articles now subject to tax, would be followed by results equally
						advantageous to the citizen and the government. It would render the
						execution of the law less expensive and more certain, remove obstructions to
						industry, lessen the temptations to evade the law, diminish the violations
						and frauds perpetrated upon its provisions, make its operations less
						inquisitorial, and greatly reduce in numbers this army of tax gatherers
						created by the system, who "take form the mouth of honest labor the bread it
						has earned." Retrenchment, reform and economy should be carried into every
						branch of public service. That the expenditures of the people may be
						reduced, and the people relieved from oppressive taxation, a sound currency
						should be restored, and the public faith in regard to the national debt
						sacredly observed. The accomplishment of these important results, together
						with the restoration of the union of the States upon the principles of the
						constitution, would inspire confidence at home and abroad in the stability
						of our institutions and bring to the nation prosperity, peace, and good
						will.</p>
					<p>The report of the Secretary of War <emph rend="italic">ad interim</emph>
						exhibits the operations of the army and the several bureaus of the War
						Department. The aggregate strength of our military force on the 30th of
						September last was 56,315. The total estimate for military appropriations is
						$77,124,707, including a deficiency in last year's appropriation of
						$13,600,000. The payments at the treasury on account of the service of the
						War Department from January 1 to October 29, 1867, a period of ten months,
						amounted to $109,807,000. The expenses of the military establishment, as
						well as the numbers of the army, are now three times as great as they have
						ever been in times of peace, while the discretionary power is vested in the
						Executive to add millions to the expenditure by an increase of the army to
						the maximum strength allowed by the law. </p>
					<p>The comprehensive report of the Secretary of the Interior furnishes
						interesting information in reference to the important branches of the public
						service connected with his department. The menacing attitude of some of the
						warlike bands of Indians inhabiting the district of the country between
						Arkansas and Platte rivers, and portions of Dakota Territory, required the
						presence of a large military force in that region. Instigated by real or
						imaginary grievances, the Indians occasionally committed acts of barbarous
						violence upon emigrants and our frontier settlements, but a general Indian
						war has been providentially averted. The Commissioners, under the act of the
						20th of July, 1867, were invested with full power to adjust existing
						difficulties, negotiate treaties with the disaffected bands, and select from
						them reservations remote from the traveled routes between the Mississippi
						and the Pacific. The entered without delay upon the execution of their
						trust, but have not yet made any official report of their proceedings. It is
						of vital importance that our distant Territories should be exempt from
						Indian outbreaks, and that the construction of the Pacific Railroad, an
						object of national importance should not be interrupted by hostile tribes.
						These objects, as well as the material interests and the moral and
						intellectual improvement of the Indians, can be most effectually secured by
						concentrating them upon portions of the country set apart for their portions
						of the country set apart for their exclusive use, and located at points
						remote from our highways and encroaching white settlements.</p>
					<p>Since the commencement of the second session of the Thirty-ninth Congress
						five hundred and ten miles of road have been constructed on the main line
						and branches of the Pacific Railway. The line from Omaha is rapidly
						approaching the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, whilst the terminus of
						the last section of constructed road in California, accepted by the
						government on the 24th day of October last, was but eleven miles distant
						from the summit of the Sierra Nevada. The remarkable energy evinced by the
						companies offers the strongest assurance that the completion of the road
						from Sacramento to Omaha will not be long deferred.</p>
					<p>During the last fiscal year 7,041,114 acres of public land were disposed of,
						and the cash receipts from sales and fees exceeded by one-half million
						dollars the sum realized from these sources during the preceding year.</p>
					<p>The amount paid to pensioners, including the expenses of disbursements, was
						$18,619,958 and 36,482 names were added to the rolls.--The entire number of
						pensioners on the 30th of June last was 155,474.</p>
					<p>Eleven thousand six hundred and fifty-five patents and designs were issued
						during the year ending September 30, 1867, and at that date, the balance in
						the Treasury to the credit of the Patent Fund was $286, 607.</p>
					<p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy, states that we have seven squadrons
						actively and judiciously employed, under efficient and able commanders, in
						protecting the persons and property of American citizens, maintaining the
						dignity and power of the government, and promoting the commerce and business
						interests of our countrymen in every part of the world. Of the two hundred
						and thirty-eight vessels composing the present navy of the United States
						fifty-six carrying five hundred and seven guns, are in squadron service.
						During the year the number of vessels in commission has been reduced twelve,
						and there are thirteen less on squadron duty than there were at the date of
						the last report. A large number of vessels were commenced and in the course
						of construction when the war terminated, and, although Congress had made the
						necessary appropriations for their completion, the department has either
						suspended work upon them or limited the slow completion of steam vessels, so
						as to meet the contracts for machinery made with private establishments.</p>
					<p>The total expenditures of the Navy Department for the fiscal year ending June
						30, 1867, were $3,034,011. No appropriations have been made or required
						since the close of the war for the construction and repair of vessels, for
						steam machinery, ordinance, provisions and clothing, fuel, hemp, etc., the
						balances under these several heads having been more than sufficient for the
						current expenditures. It should also be stated to the credit of the
						department that besides asking no appropriations for the above objects for
						the last two years, the Secretary of the Navy, on the 30th of September
						last, in accordance with the act of May 1st, 1820, requested the Secretary
						of the Treasury to carry to the surplus fund the sum of sixty-five millions
						of dollars, being the amount received from the sales of vessels and other
						war property, and the remnants of former appropriations.</p>
					<p>The report of the Postmaster-General shows the business of the Post-office
						Department and the condition of the postal service in a very favorable
						light, and the attention of Congress is called to its practical
						recommendations. The receipts of the Department for the year ending June 30,
						1867, including all special appropriations for sea and land service and for
						free mail matter were $19,978,693. The expenditures for all purposes were
						$19,235,483, leaving an unexpended balance in favor of Department of
						$743,210, which can be applied towards the expenses of the Department for
						the current year. The increase of postal revenue independent of specific
						appropriations, for the year 1867 over that of 1866 was $850,040. The
						increase of revenue from the sale of stamps and stamped envelopes was
						$783,404. The increase of expenditures for 1867 over those of the previous
						year was owing chiefly to extension of the land and ocean mail service.
						During the past year new postal conventions having been ratified and
						exchanged with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Belgium, the
						Netherlands, Switzerland, the North German Union, Italy, and the Colonial
						government of Hong Kong, reducing very largely the rates of ocean and land
						postages to and from and within those countries.</p>
					<p>The report of the Acting Commissioner of Agriculture concisely presents the
						condition, wants, and progress of an interest eminently worthy the fostering
						care of Congress, and exhibits a large measure of useful results achieved
						during the year to which it refers.</p>
					<p>The re-establishment of peace at home, and the resumption of extended trade,
						travel, and commerce abroad, have served to increase the number and variety
						of questions in the Department of Foreign Affairs. None of these questions,
						however, have seriously disturbed our relations with other states. The
						Republic of Mexico, having been relieved of foreign intervention, is
						earnestly engaged in efforts to re-establish her constitutional system of
						government. A good understanding continues to exist between our government
						and the republics of Hayti and San Domingo, and our cordial relations with
						the Central and South American States remain unchanged.</p>
					<p>The tender, made, in conformity with a resolution of Congress, of the good
						offices of the government, with a view to an amicable adjustment of peace
						between Brazil and her allies on one side and Paraguay on the other, and
						between Chili and her allies and Spain on the other, though kindly received
						has in neither case been fully accepted by the belligerents. The war in the
						Valley of Parana is still vigorously maintained. On the other hand, actual
						hostilities between the Pacific States and Spain have been more than a year
						suspended. I shall, on any proper occasion that may occur, renew the
						conciliatory recommendations which have been already made. Brazil, with
						enlightened sagacity and comprehensive statesmanship, has opened the great
						channels of the Amazon and its tributaries to universal commerce. One thing
						more seems needful to assure a rapid and cheering progress in South America.
						I refer to those peaceful habits without which states and nations cannot in
						this age well expect material prosperity of social advancement.</p>
					<p>The exposition of Universal Industry at Paris has passed and seems to have
						fully realized the high expectation of the French government. If due
						allowance be made for the recent political derangement of industry here, the
						part which the United States has borne in this exhibition of invention and
						art may be regarded with very high satisfaction. During the Exposition a
						conference was held of delegates from several nations, the United States
						being one, in which the inconveniences of commerce and social intercourse
						resulting from the diverse standards of money value were very fully
						discussed, and plans were developed for establishing, by universal consent,
						a common principle for the coinage of gold. These conferences are expected
						to be renewed, with the attendance of many foreign states not hitherto
						represented. A report of these interesting proceedings will be submitted to
						Congress, which will, no doubt, justly appreciate the great object, and be
						ready to adopt any measure which may tend to facilitate its ultimate
						accomplishment.</p>
					<p>On the 25th of February, 1862, Congress declared by law that Treasury notes
						without interest authorized by that act should be legal tender in payment of
						all debts, public and private, within the United States. An annual
						remittance of thirty thousand dollars, less stipulated expenses, accrues to
						claimants under the convention made with Spain in 1834. These remittances,
						since the passage of that act, have been paid in the passage of that act,
						have been paid in such notes. The claimants insist that the government ought
						to require payment in coin. The subject may be deemed worthy of your
						attention.</p>
					<p>No arrangement has yet been reached for the settlement of our claims for
						British depredations upon the commerce of the United States. I have felt it
						my duty to decline the proposition of arbitration made by Her Majesty's
						government, because it has hitherto been accompanied by reservations and
						limitations incompatible with the rights, interests, and honor of our
						country. It is not to be apprehended that Great Britain will persist in her
						refusal to satisfy these just and reasonable claims, which involve the
						sacred principle of non-intervention, a principle henceforth not more
						important to the United States than to all commercial nations.</p>
					<p>The West India Islands were settled and colonized by European States
						simultaneously with the settlement and colonization of the American
						continent. Most of the colonies planted here became independent nations in
						the close of the last and be beginning of the present century. Our own
						country embraces comminutes which at one period were colonies of Great
						Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Sweden and Russia. The people in the West
						Indies, with the exception of those of the Island of Hayti, have neither
						attained nor aspired to independence. Nor have they become prepared for self
						defence. Although possessing considerable commercial value, they have been
						held by the several European States, which colonized or at some time
						conquered them chiefly for purposes of military and naval strategy in
						carrying out European policy and designs in regard to this continent. In our
						revolutionary war, ports and harbors in the West India Islands were used by
						our enemy to the great injury and embarrassment of the United States. We had
						the same experience in our second war with Great Britain. The same European
						policy for a long time excluded us even from trade with the West Indies,
						while we were at peace with all nations. In our recent civil war the rebels
						and their piratical and blockade-breaking allies found facilities in the
						same ports for the work which they too successfully accomplished, of
						injuring and devastating the commerce which we are now engaged in
						rebuilding. We labored especially under the disadvantage, that European
						steam vessels, employed by our enemies found friendly shelter, protection,
						and supplies in West Indian ports, while our own usual operations were
						necessarily carried on from our own distant shores. There was then a
						universal feeling of the want of an advanced naval outpost between the
						Atlantic coast and Europe.--The duty of obtaining such an outpost peacefully
						and lawfully, while neither doing nor menacing injury to other states,
						earnestly engaged the attention of the Executive Department before the close
						of the war and it has not been lost sight of since that time. A not entirely
						dissimilar naval want revealed itself during the same period on the Pacific
						Coast. The required foot-hold there was fortunately secured by our late
						treaty with the Emperor of Russia, and it now seems imperative that the more
						obvious necessities of the Atlantic coast should not be less carefully
						provided for. A good and convenient port and harbor, capable of easy
						defence, will supply that want. With the possession of such a station by the
						United States, neither we nor any other American nation used longer
						apprehend injury or offence from any trans-Atlantic enemy. I agree with our
						early statesmen that the West Indies rationally gravitate to and may be
						expected ultimately to be absorbed by the Continental States, including our
						own. I agree with them also that it is wise to leave the question of such
						absorption to this process of national political gravitation. The Islands of
						St. Thomas and St. Johns, the Virgin Islands, seemed to offer advantages
						immediately desirable, while their acquisition could be secured in harmony
						with the principles to which I have alluded. A treaty has therefore been
						concluded with the King of Denmark for the secession of those Islands, and
						will be submitted to the Senate for consideration.</p>
					<p>It will hardly be necessary to call the attention of Congress to the subject
						of providing for the payment to Russia of the sum stipulated in the treaty
						for the cession of Alaska. Possession having been formally delivered to our
						commissioner, the territory remains for the present in the care of military
						force, awaiting such civil organization as shall be directed by Congress.</p>
					<p>The annexation of many small German States to Prussia, and the reorganization
						of that country under a new and liberal constitution, having induced me to
						renew the effort to obtain a just and prompt settlement of the long vexed
						question concerning the claims of foreign states for military service of
						their subjects naturalized in the United States. In connection with this
						subject, the attention of Congress is respectfully called to a singular and
						embarrassing conflict of laws. The Executive Department of this government
						has hitherto uniformly held, as it now holds, that naturalization in
						conformity with the constitution and laws of the United States, absolves the
						recipient from his native allegiance. The courts of Great Britain hold that
						allegiance to the British Crown is indefensible and is not absolved by our
						laws of naturalization. British Judges cite courts and law authorities of
						the United States in support of that theory against the position held by the
						Executive authority of the United States. This conflict perplexes the public
						mind concerning the rights of naturalized citizens, and impairs the national
						authority abroad. I called attention to this subject in my last annual
						message, and now again respectfully appeal to Congress to declare the
						national will unmistakably upon this important question.</p>
					<p>The abuse of our laws by the clandestine prosecution of the African slave
						trade from American ports, or by American citizens, has altogether ceased
						and under existing circumstances no apprehensions of its renewal in this
						part of the world are entertained. Under these circumstances it becomes a
						question whether we shall not propose to her Majesty's Government a
						suspension for discontinuance of the stipulation for maintaining a naval
						force for the suppression of that trade.</p>

				<head>The President's Message</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>We commend the annual message of the President to our readers. It will richly
						repay a careful perusal. Its tone is lofty, its language is strong and
						forcible, its treatment of Congress is courteous, although terribly
						scathing, and its arguments are irresistible. It is presented to the country
						at a time when the House of Representatives has under consideration of the
						propriety of impeaching the President. And yet, there is nothing to be found
						in this whole paper which looks like an effort to conciliate the Radicals
						who are clamoring form his removal from office.--There is no acknowledgement
						of error as to the course pursued by him in regard to reconstruction. There
						is no petition for forgiveness. There is no promise to do better, in case
						Congress will have the kindness to overlook past offences. On the contrary,
						the President repeats his former counsels, announces that his opinions,
						hitherto presented, have become solemn convictions, and that, in his
						judgement, all the legislation of Congress, by virtue of which the South is
						now held in military subjection, ought to be blotted from our statute books.
						He advises the repeals of the reconstruction laws, on the ground of their
						unconstitutionality. While partisan prejudice will hoot at this part of the
						message, and, perhaps, stiffen its neck and harden its heart and declare
						that it will not hearken to his counsel, the sober judgement of the American
						people will pronounce this advice sensible, well timed and absolutely
						essential to our permanent national prosperity. The message is not only full
						of sound argument and good counsel, but is a bold, fearless and outspoken
						document. Whilst the President is of the opinion that he had no right to
						refuse to execute the reconstruction laws, although he deemed them palpably
						unconstitutional, he seems to be clear as to his duty in case Congress
						should attempt, as has been repeatedly threatened, to suspend him from
						office during his trial, if he shall be called upon to answer articles of
						impeachment at the bar of the Senate. This is undoubtedly his meaning in the
						following passage:</p>
					<p>It is true that cases may occur in which the Executive would be compelled to
						stand on its rights and maintain them regardless of all consequences. If
						Congress should pass an act which is not only in palpable conflict with the
						constitution, but will certainly, if carried out, produce immediate and
						irreparable injury to the organic structure of the government, and if there
						be neither judicial remedy for the wrongs it inflicts, nor power in the
						people to protect themselves without the official aid of their elected
						defender; <emph rend="italic">if for instance the Legislative Department
							should pass an act, even through all the forms of the law, to abolish a
							co-ordinate department of the government--in such a case the President
							must take the high responsibilities of his office, and save the life of
							the nation at all hazards.</emph></p>
					<p>An attempt to suspend the President from office during trial is evidently
						regarded by him as one of the cases "in which the Executive would be
						compelled to stand on its rights and maintain them, regardless of all
						consequences," because it would be, in practical effect, an abolition of a
						co-ordinate department of the government. So think we, and so think the
						people. Congress had better, therefore, at once, as we have no doubt it
						will, turn its attention to matters upon which the nation is earnestly
						calling for action. Let it immediately set about the work of establishing
						the national finances upon a safe basis. Let its legislation look towards a
						speedy resumption of specie payment. The people are becoming distrustful of
						our irredeemable paper currency. They are anxious to know what is to be the
						result of these grand financial operations in which the government has been
						engaged for the last six years.</p>
					<p>The President has presented Congress with an unanswerable argument against
						the "Tenure of Office Bill." He shows that it utterly destroys all official
						accountability, and it necessarily follows that malfeasance in office will
						become "bold in proportion as the delinquents learn to think themselves
						safe." There are many other matters of great interest in the message which
						we have not space to comment upon, but which no one should fail to read.
						This document will deservedly rank among the ablest of Mr. Johnson's state
						papers. It is clear, calm, dignified, logical and true. If Congress listens
						to its words of counsel, the nation will be relieved of its intense anxiety
						about the future, and the country will enter upon a career of happiness and
						prosperity far greater than any that its most sanguine citizens have ever
						dreamed of.</p>

				<excerpt>"What a long, hopeless period of degradation awaits the people of the
					South! What an endless, delightful period of tax-paying awaits the people of the
					North!"</excerpt>
				<transcript>
					<p>We have frequently insisted, in our columns, that the negro is not possessed
						of sufficient brains to qualify him for an intelligent exercise of the right
						of suffrage.--And especially have we asserted that to be true of he Southern
						negro, who has been so long held in the bonds of slavery. Read the
						corroboration of our assertion on this subject, contained in the report of
						General Ulysses S. Grant, with reference to the Fourth Military District of
						the South, composed of the States of Mississippi and Arkansas, now under the
						command of Genera. Ord. General Grant says:</p>
					<p>The extension of suffrage to freedmen has evidently aroused a sentiment of
						hostility to the colored race, and to Northern men in many parts of the
						district, which did not exist before; and General Ord is convinced that a
						larger force than is now stationed in those States to preserve order and
						organize conventions will be required hereafter to protect them and secure
						the freedmen the use of the suffrage.</p>
					<p>In a majority of the counties of this district there are very few men who can
						take the test oath, and these are not disposed to defy public opinion by
						accepting office unless supported by a military force afterward.</p>
					<p>The will of the colored people may be in favor of supporting loyal
						office-holders, by their intelligence is not now sufficient to enable them
						to combine for the execution of their will. All their combinations are now
						conducted by white men, under the protection of the military; if the
						protection is withdrawn, the white men now controlling would withdraw with
						it; and some of the Southern people now exasperated at what they deem the
						freedmen's presumption, would not be very gentle toward them so that the
						presence of a larger military force will be required for some time to
						maintain the freedmen in the right of suffrage.</p>
					<p><lb/>To say nothing of the unconstitutional means employed by the Radicals to
						invest the negro with the elective franchise, what is to be thought of the
						expediency, looking simply to the safety of republican institutions, of such
						an investiture as will commit the interests and destinies of sovereign
						States into the hands of men "whose intelligence," according to the
						testimony of General Ord, "is not sufficient to enable them to combine for
						the execution of their will?" How can the people of the North endorse a
						policy which seeks to hold the white people of those States in military
						subjection, until the negroes become possessed of sufficient capacity to
						govern themselves and the whites also? They are now utterly incapable of
						taking care of themselves.--"All their combinations are now conducted by
						white men <emph rend="italic">under the protection of the military</emph>"
						and, we are told that "a large military force will be required for some time
						to maintain the freedmen in the right of suffrage." The people, meanwhile,
						are paying heavy taxes out of their hard earnings to keep up this grand
						military establishment, at an enormous expense, until the Almighty puts
						enough of mind into the head of the African to enable him to take care of
						himself. The "crack of doom," we very much fear, will find him just as badly
						prepared for this work as he is now. And the fiat of the Radicals has gone
						forth to the effect, that military despotisms must be upheld on Southern
						soil until the negro is permitted to vote, without let or hindrance, even if
						that should not occur before the last trump shall sound. What a long,
						hopeless period of degradation awaits the people of the South! What an
						endless, delightful period of taxpaying awaits the people of the
						North!--What a glorious privilege it is to be a negro! </p>
					<p>What say you, people of Pennsylvania? Shall such a reconstruction policy be
						carried out? Will you agree to put a ballot into the hands of the negro
						first, and then wait until he attains sufficient capacity to know how to
						exercise it intelligently? No! Let the cry of the people go up to Congress
						for a repeal of all such iniquitous legislation, and let us never cease
						agitating the subject until all the acts embodying such a policy are blotted
						from our statute books.</p>

				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>On Thursday night last a disturbance occurred in this place between some of
						our white and black citizens, which resulted in some who were not
						participating getting pretty severely hurt. We have been unable to get a
						correct account of how the difficulty originated; but from what we can learn
						it was in this wise: A number of our colored folks hand congregated on the
						corner of the diamond, in front of Messrs. Stein &amp; Co's Clothing
						Store, when James Lane, William Doyle and several other young men, threw
						stones on the crowd. Whether or no the blacks had given them any provocation
						we are unable to say; at any rate they returned the compliment and report
						sayeth that for a short time stones were flying in great profusion. During
						the melee Charles and John Fallon, sons of Mr. Michael Fallon, who were in
						front of their father's store, were both struck about the face with stones,
						and more or less hurt. Warrants were issued, and James Lane and William
						Doyle were arrested and taken before Justice Hyssong for a hearing, who in
						default of $500 bail committed them to the County prison. The other parties
						who are implicated in the affair are still, we believe, at large --<emph
							rend="italic">Mercersburg Journal</emph></p>
					<p>Some way ought to be found to break up the habit of our negroes have of
						congregating at street corners. The crowd of them that habitually collects
						at Wallace's corner, in this place, ought to be scattered by one of our
						Constables. That crowd is neither useful nor ornamental, and it has
						obstructed the north east corner of Main and Queen streets quite long
						enough. An altercation occurred between two of the sooty nuisances assembled
						there one evening last week, which might have resulted in a stone throwing
						match that would have inflicted injury on persons passing. These negroes
						have no business to stand for hours on our street corners, in squads that
						obstruct the free passage of ladies and gentlemen. We call upon the officers
						of the law to clear them out. We do not approve of stoning them, but we
						should not seriously object to the administration, by one of our Constables,
						of a few sharp raps on their shins with a moderate sized cane, if they did
						not disappear from the corner after being warned to do so.</p>
