<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Thursday last was the day appointed for paying our annual tribute to our
                        "loved and lost," who sacrificed themselves for us, and now "sleep their
                        last sleep" in the Confederate Cemetery near this place. The day was most
                        unpropitious, the rain falling in torrents during the
                        morning.--Nevertheless, a large crowd assembled at the Town Hall, and,
                        although the managers deemed it advisable to postpone the ceremonies to a
                        more pleasant day, formed a procession, headed by the famous Stonewall Band,
                        and, amid the rain, proceeded on foot and in carriages to the Cemetery. The
                        procession was composed of the Stonewall Band, Fire Companies, the Pioneers,
                        Councils of Friends of Temperance, a number of Ladies, volunteer Band and
                        citizens generally, all bearing wreaths and bouquets. Arriving at the
                        Cemetery, the Bands discoursed sweet and appropriate music and the crowd,
                        about 2000 persons, decorated the graves, not one of which but had its
                        tribute of love and affection. It was the more satisfactory to see, through
                        this most disagreeable weather, so large a crowd in attendance, and
                        evidences the fact that the heroism, devotion and self-sacrifice of those
                        who gave their all to the "lost cause," are held in the dearest remembrances
                        by those of us who live to lament it and their fall. In rain or sunshine our
                        annual tribute is due, and in rain or sunshine, our people are determined it
                        shall be paid.</p>
                    <p>The Pioneers, with shovels, spades &amp;c., proceeded to fix up those
                        graves most needing it, but, satisfied that concerted labor and means were
                        necessary to put in proper condition the last home of our buried brethren,
                        have instituted a movement, noticed elsewhere, to form an association to
                        take charge of and beautify the grounds of the Confederate Cemetery. This
                        will meet with the hearty accord of every well-wisher in the county, and we
                        hope to see the Association an immense affair.</p>
                    <p>The graves fixed up and decorated, the crowd slowly moved back to town, the
                        Bands discoursing appropriate music while passing through Thornrose Cemetery
                        and on their way back.</p>
                    <p>In the evening, the young ladies of the Deaf &amp; Dumb and Blind
                        Institution moved in procession, with flowers, headed by their Band, to the
                        Cemetery, and paid their tribute to their lamented Confederates whose
                        "Silent tents are spread on Fame's eternal camping ground." A mute and
                        touching appeal to the feelings and sympathies of all who witnessed it.</p>
                    <p>Altogether, the ceremonies of the day were most satisfactory. Although there
                        was not the usual number present, yet there was a very large number, and the
                        spirit, which induced the attendance of those present, was, itself, a most
                        appropriate tribute to their comrades and friends who fell in the great
                        struggle, in which nearly all of us participated or deeply sympathized.</p>
