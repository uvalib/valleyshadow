<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Richmond State Journal, that epitome of truth
                        (?) ha! ha!! assails us because we complained of the course of John F.
                        Lewis, U.S. Senator. He declares our article venomous and a spiteful
                        misrepresentation, and, "on the authority of John F. Lewis," asserts there
                        was not "one word of truth in it." Well, let us see.</p>
                    <p>We stated that he was elected by Conservatives, and was allied actively with
                        the ultra Radicals, that he meddled with the elections in Washington,
                        threatened the Republicans in the Legislature, opposed the nomination of
                        Akerman of Georgia and had a Confederate contract during the war to make
                        iron, with which the Confederates dealt death and destruction to his friends, and that he does not represent his
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Does he deny that he was elected by Conservatives and has acted with the
                        ultra Radicals? The first is well known and his votes in Congress attest the
                        latter.</p>
                    <p>Does he deny that he meddled with the elections in Washington? His letter on
                        the subject affirms this count.</p>
                    <p>Does he deny threatening the Republican members of the Legislature? The
                        sample letter published in the Richmond papers, and the general assertions
                        of this fact, place that beyond dispute.</p>
                    <p>Does he deny opposing the nomination of Akerman?
                        The telegraphic dispatches from Washingeon stated it, and it was
                        not denied by him until more than a week after its publication in the Vindicator and quite two weeks after it was
                        telegraphed from Washington. This is strange--surpassingly strange.</p>
                    <p>Does he deny that he took a Confederate contract during the war to make the
                        iron which was shaped into bolts to kill his Yankee friends? This is
                        notoriously true. Indeed many assert, that, in order to get the contract and
                        to retain it, he had to assure the Confederate authorities of his loyalty,
                        and some even assert that to get a contract, an oath of fidelity to the
                        Confederacy had to be taken, and that, at a time, when he was about to lose
                        his contract, a friend had to go forward and vouch, at his instance, for his
                        loyalty. But of this we do not know and draw no conclusions from it--which,
                        if we were "spiteful" we certainly could.</p>
                    <p>Does he not know that he mis-represents his people? Surely the election of
                        Walker, on whose ticket he ran, should conclusively exhibit the fact that
                        the sentiments of his people are not in accord with his ultra course, and,
                        we repeat, that knowing it, as he must, he should resign.</p>
                    <p>It would seem then, that, with the exception of the telegram concerning the
                        opposition to Akerman, which was only denied after the lapse of two weeks,
                        the Vindicator did not "spitefully
                        mis-represent," but merely stated the truth, or that to which the failure to
                        deny gave the semblance of truth. The State
                        Journal and its authority are therefore,
                        "venomously malevolent" and most "spitefully" at fault, not to use a
                        stronger expression, and the Vindicator article,
                        by their silence, on all save one point, is acknowledged by themselves to be
                        true.</p>
                    <p>We have never been disposed wantonly to assail any one, but when the man who
                        forged iron bolts for the Confederacy, and gave information and guides which
                        came near enabling Gen. Early to bag the force of Custer, at the Cave, near
                        his home, when elected to the Senate by Conservatives, not only pursued a
                        course at variance with their sentiments, but turned round and leveled
                        epithets at the men who had hoisted him into position, we thought it time to
                        let him and others hear the sentiments of the people from whose midst he was
                        so suddenly and astonishingly raised into place and power.</p>
                    <p>We therefore again assert that it would be exceedingly gratifying to the
                        people of Virginia if he would resign, and we think it a duty he owes to
                        himself to do so.</p>
