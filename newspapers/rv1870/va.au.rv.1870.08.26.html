<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The additional subscription to the stock of the Valley Railroad by the City
                        of Staunton, is a subject which should attract the earnest attention of our
                        people. Without county or town subscriptions to the amount of $100,000 this
                        road can not be secured. We need this road and cannot afford to lose it. In
                        the last election we voted to take our proportion of the proposed county
                        subscription, about $30,000. We will soon be called upon to take $20,000
                        more, ($50,000) as the only feasible plan of securing this road at an early
                        day--probably of ever securing this road through Staunton. It is a question
                        that comes home to every man. It resolves itself into this. With this road
                        secured, property will be increased in value, business will be greatly
                        stimulated, a rapid increase of population will at once commence, which will
                        aid us in paying the tax required, manufacturing establishments of various
                        kinds will be put in operation, labor will have constant employment, and in
                        fact the greatest good will result to all. Without the road, property must
                        decrease in value, business decline and our present population diminish. Can
                        we afford to hesitate at a question of increased taxation? We think not, and
                        we only, in our limited space, call attention to this subject now, that our
                        people may reflect on it and arrive at a proper conclusion, satisfied that
                        they must secure this road through Staunton, no matter what the cost.</p>
