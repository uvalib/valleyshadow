                    Particularly incensed that they substantially increased the salary of the
                    cashier when other cashiers in the country work for much less. Warns the Board

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There can be no question that Banking Institutions, conducted on fair and
                        liberal principles, are an advantage to communities where located. It is
                        only when they descend into that avaricious grasping, commonly denominated
                        shaving, but more properly slicing, that they
                        cease to be a benefit, and become a curse to community. Without any other
                        feeling in the matter than a desire for the best interest of our whole
                        people, have we, on several occasions, during the past few weeks, devoted
                        considerable editorial space to criticisms of the conduct and management of
                        one of these institutins in our midst. We felt called upon to
                        notice the seemingly unwarrantable demand of the Cashier for an increase of
                        salary from $2500 to $3000, while other Cashiers throughout the State, and
                        elsewhere, received much smaller salaries for the management of much larger
                        amounts. When the directory agreed to the demand of the Cashier and
                        increased his salary to $3000, we characterized it in such terms as we
                        deemed it deserved, and drew the only conclusion possible, taking into
                        consideration the large amount placed to the surplus fund and the large
                        dividend declared, that it was simply a license to their cashier to make the
                        most possible out of the necessities of an impoverished people, though
                        seven-tenths of the large profits realized went into the hands of parties at
                        a distance, without any possible hope for it ever to return. It was with
                        exceeding regret that we heard of the late action of the
                        Stockholders--electing the old Board of Directors, who had given the
                        cashier, by one majority, a salary equal to 3 per cent on the whole capital
                        stock, and we again called attention to the removal of the onus from the
                        shoulders of the Directory to that of the stockholders, as an additional and
                        more indicative step, than any which had preceded it, of the course
                        determined upon, as to the conduct of the Bank, and warned our readers as to
                        their becoming a party to what seemed to us nothing more nor less than
                        extortion.</p>
                    <p>In this whole affair, we have, without hatred or ill will to any, endeavored
                        to warn either side as they approached a dangerous precipice to which their
                        steps tended, ere ruin befel them. What the ultimate result may
                        be we can not know, but feel that we have at least done our duty. We leave
                        the matter, now, between the people and those interested in the bank. If the
                        former suffer themselves to be made cat's paws to draw the chestnuts from
                        the fire, it will not be because they have not been duly warned.--If, on the
                        other hand, the Bank pursues the suicidal policy, which the action of those
                        solely interested in it has seemed to indicate, it will not be because that
                        course has not been exposed in all its hideousness, and received the
                        unanimous condemnation of this community.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--SIR:--Your correspondent "A Citizen,"
                        in a recent number of your paper, has kindly endorsed the views I expressed
                        through your columns, not long since, in relation to the necessity of a
                        change in the management of our banks, or the increase of our banking
                        capital, and suggests a plan by which the object may be obtained. If his
                        views and calculations are correct, (and I have no doubt they are,) his plan
                        should, by all means, and that at once, be considered and carried into
                        effect by our merchants and business men and the unpaid stock in the
                        Virginia Insurance Company taken up.</p>
                    <p>I have made some enquiry into this subject and feel confident that, if our
                        merchants and business men will make the effort, the required amount of
                        capital can be placed in this company to largely increase our banking
                        facilities, and thereby greatly assist the legitimate business interest of
                        the town and county.</p>
                    <p>I think, as you intimate in your last issue, that the action of the
                        stockholders in the First National Bank in sustaining their Board of
                        Directors, in increasing their Cashier salary from $2500 to $3000, makes it
                        very certain that we need not look to that institution for accommodation,
                        except at ruinous rates. I think it would be well to publish a list of the
                        Baltimore stockholders, who were "so anxious to furnish us banking capital,
                        to assist us in our poverty" at the close of the war, that we might start
                        business again, so that our merchants may know who to buy goods from when
                        they go on this spring. They are not entitled to our patronage, as they have
                        shown by their course that they wish their bank stock to make them from 20
                        to 30 per cent, which they very well know no legitimate business can stand.
                        No doubt they would like to keep your trade and sell you goods on short time
                        at full market rates (a little extra for time,) and then when your bills
                        come due shave your notes, through their banks in your midst, to meet them.
                        I hope our merchants will look into this matter.</p>
                    <p>It is clear to my mind that we must do something to protect ourselves. Let us
                        try the Virginia Insurance Company; take its unpaid stock, and start it with
                        say $100,000 for banking purposes, and, I feel warranted in saying, that, in
                        a short time, she will have a deposit line equal to either of our National
                        Banks, and that she will give us as much accommodation as either of them and
                        at one-half the rates of interest now charged.</p>
                    <p>Our county friends are also interested in this matter. I know there are many
                        farmers in the county who have surplus mean, and I feel sure as in
                        investment in this stock will pay and, at the same time assist in building
                        up their county town, thereby making them a better and better home market
                        for their farm products.</p>

                    <p>The approximation to unanimity with which the Senate, after protracted
                        investigation, passed the bill incorporating the company above named, is an
                        assurance that it will meet with but little opposition in the House of
                        Delegates, where it will be considered, we understand, today. The object had

                        is the purchase of a large quantity of land and its resale to, and
                        settlement, by immigrants to be brought here by the company. As incidental
                        to this they propose to do a general exchange, loan and banking business;
                        and also insurance, this letter having especial reference to insurances for
                        their own immigrants. All that these foreign and Northern capitalists ask is
                        that their title to their property in Virginia shall be made secure by a

                        investigate fully the great inducements now held out in Virginia for the
                        permanent investment of capital and the result has been the preliminary
                        formation of this company under a New York charter,and they now seek the
                        further guarantee of a Virginia charter for the security of their capital.
                        Already measures have been taken, we are informed, to obtain a large amount
                        of English, French and German capital under this charter. Its capital is one
