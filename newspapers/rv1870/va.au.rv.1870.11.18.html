                    races. Prints a table detailing the gains and losses of both parties in each

                    <p>The result of the elections held for Members of Congress, in the various
                        States, this Fall, has astonished every one. It was expected that the
                        Democrats would gain several Members, but the perfect avalanche of
                        Democratic gains, which has rushed upon the Country, has astounded the
                        Republicans, and caused more Roosters, Giraffes &amp;c., to appear at
                        the head of Democratic papers than has been seen since 1857. The gain has
                        already reached 34 members of Congress, occasioning a change of 68 in the
                        vote of the Lower House, and further gains expected in the four States, in
                        which elections are yet to be held.</p>
                    <p>For the gratification of our readers, as well as to show them exactly where
                        this great gain has been made, we copy the following table of Democratic and
                        Republican gains:</p>

                    <p>There is another lesson to be drawn from this. In every State but Virginia
                        the firm and decided opposition to the Republican party is by the Democratic
                        party. It is this party which has won the great victory at the polls. In
                        Virginia the successful party is called the Conservative party. Since the
                        failure of Senator Lewis to co-operate with the Democratic party in
                        Congress, great care has been taken that Congressional nominees should agree
                        to co-operate with that party and, though nominated by Conservatives, they
                        stand fully committed, each and every Conservative elected, to that policy.
                        Except in name they are Democrats. What folly then to have a separate
                        organization in Virginia from that national organization, with which
                        Virginia Conservatives are pledged to co-operate?</p>
                    <p>If the Whig party had maintained its national organization, and was to-day
                        the only party in opposition to the Republican party can any man doubt where
                        life-long Democrats would stand? If any man does, we can assure them that
                        they would be found fighting Republicanism, under the Whig standard, as
                        determinedly as they did when the Old Whig and Democratic parties were in
                        full life and vigor. For ourselves we can say that we had no prejudice to
                        the name Whig, and would long since, had the condition of affairs been as we
                        supposed above, run up the Whig flag and fought the Republican party and its
                        principles along with the Whigs of the past.</p>
                    <p>We ask then that those who are prejudiced to the name Democrat shall discard
                        it, and unite, under that name, in overcoming the Republican party, which
                        has over-ridden the constitution and made it a mockery and a by-word.</p>
                    <p>When the Republican party is killed--dead, which
                        as presaged by the late elections, will not be many years, it will be time
                        enough to separate into the two grand parties, as of yore, fighting on the
                        issues of the day.</p>
                    <p>Let us then, as one man, in opposition to the Republican party, and
                        discarding all captious opposition to mere names, unite under the Democratic
                        Banner, and complete the victory which has been so successfully commenced in
                        the political contests of this Fall.</p>
                    <p>The Conservative party has had its day and accomplished its mission in this
                        State. It has lost its cohesiveness and with that all its power for good,
                        and besides it is high time, and most appropriate now, that Virginians
                        opposed to the Republican party and doctrines should be united with the only
                        National party in opposition to that party. For this reason we discard now,
                        and we trust forever, the unmeaning term Conservative, and, hoisting the
                        Democratic Standard, invite all men who revere the Constitution of our
                        fathers and love their country to rally under its ample folds.</p>

                    <p>In the following certificate of the Commissioners to canvass the votes cast
                        at the late election, the reasons are given for throwing out the votes at so
                        many of our precincts. This should be a warning for the future. Inattention
                        to the requirements of law may change the entire sentiment of the county. It
                        happens that it does not effect the election of any candidate this time, but
                        we should take care that the like never occurs again.</p>
                    <p>"We, the undersigned Commissioners appointed by the Judge of the County Court
                        of Augusta County, under section 40 of the Election Law, approved May 11th
                        1870, proceeded at the Clerk's Office of the County Court of said County, on
                        Thursday, the 10th day of November 1870, to perform our duty as such
                        Commissioners in canvassing and certifying the general result of the
                        election held on Tuesday last, 8th inst. For Congressman at Large,
                        Congressman of the 6th District of Virginia, and for County and Township
                        officers. That in making such examination, and certifying the result of said
                        election, we threw Sangersville, in North River Township, in said County,
                        upon the ground, for the want of certificates as provided in section 27, of
                        the general election law, the judges of election having failed to sign their
                        names to such certificates; the Poll Book for Folly
                            Mills, in Beverly Manor Township, Verona, in Middle River Township, Middlebrook,
                            New Port and Greenville, in Riverheads
                        Township, Sherando and Barterbrook, in South River Township, Buffalo Gap, Deerfield, Craigsville and Lebanon Springs, in Pastures Township, were thrown out on the
                        same ground. The Poll Book at Hebron Church, upon the same ground, and for
                        the further reason, that it does not appear that the Judges and Clerk, at
                        said precinct had ever been sworn as such officers.--The Poll Book at
                        Peaco's Mill in Beverly Manor was also thrown out upon the ground of
                        informality in the certificate required by said Sec. 27, and for the further
                        reason that the certificate of the number of Electors showed there were
                        twenty-five votes cast when in fact there were thirty-seven votes cast. The
                        Poll Book at Churchville in Pastures Township was not taken into count with
                        the general result, because of its having been taken from the Clerk's Office
                        of the Court to which it was returned before the meeting of the
                        Commissioners. For reasons above stated, the vote at the several places of
                        voting named in this certificate was not taken into consideration,
                        believing, as they do, that the law will not justify them in so doing.</p>
                    <p>Given under our hands this 10th day of November 1870.</p>
                    <p>WM. H. BELL,</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Saturday night last, just after dark, Mr. Joseph Black, of Keezletown,
                        Rockingham, was severely stabbed by Geo. W. Smiley, of Mt Crawford,
                        Rockingham, in the house of Mr. John W. Bush, of this place, resulting in
                        his death.</p>
                    <p>Smiley and Black were bricklayers and had been working together for some time
                        past, in the employ of Mr. Wm. Jordan; were both boarding at the house of
                        Mr. Bush, Mr. Smiley's brother-in-law, and had been noted as being very
                        intimate and warm friends.</p>
                    <p>Mayor N.K. Trout had a jury of inquest summoned immediately, consisting of
                        Messrs. John B. Scherer, S.H. Lushbaugh, F.M. Young, Jos. F. Tannebill, M.P.
                        Funkhouser, G. G. Bunch, Geo A. Smith, Y.M. Bickle, H. Ker, Wm L Balthis,
                        Jno. B. Hoge and M. Doem, who proceeded at once to hold an inquest over the
                        body of Mr. Black, and after a thorough examination, made by Dr. Hanger, and
                        a hearing of the case before the Mayor, the jury rendered a verdict that the
                        said Joseph Black came to his death from wounds inflicted with a knife by
                        one Geo. W. Smiley, and that said Geo. W. Smiley feloniously and unlawfully
                        murdered the said Joseph Black."</p>
                    <p>There was no cause shown for the killing by the evidence before the jury of
                        inquest, but, on the contrary, it was asserted that they were bosom friends,
                        and had eaten supper to-gether in the most kind and friendly manner, but a
                        short time before the killing. That after supper, Smiley left the house for
                        a short time and again re-entered the house by the front door and went at
                        once to the bureau in the front room, and, taking a large carving knife from
                        the drawer, proceeded to the dining room, where Black was in conversation
                        with Mrs. Bush, and ordered Black out of the house. Black seemed at first
                        disinclined to go, but finally said he would, and started when Smiley
                        commenced the attack upon him, and stabbed him severely above the left hip
                        bone, and again a few inches above and to the left in the bowels, and
                        cutting him severely across the left temple, from the eye to the ear,
                        severing the artery, and inflicting several other slight wounds on his body,
                        and a severe cut on the right hand, supposed to have been received in
                        warding off the cuts of Smiley. Black seized a chair in the room between the
                        dining room and front room and threw it at Smiley, who then left the house
                        by the front door, Black going out of the back door, into the yard, where he
                        fell, but a few steps from the door, and died in a few minutes thereafter.</p>
                    <p>Smiley made his escape, and though the officers and posse started at once in pursuit, nothing has been heard of him up
                        to this time.</p>
                    <p>Mayor Trout has offered a reward of $100 for his arrest, and a larger reward
                        will probably be offered by the State.</p>
                    <p>It is hard to conceive of a man killing a bosom friend without some cause,
                        and it is generally believed in this community that he had a cause, but it
                        is not proper to mention the general surmise prior to an arrest and trial,
                        when the whole truth will probably be elicited.</p>
