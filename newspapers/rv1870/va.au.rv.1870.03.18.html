<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The long talked of Radical conference, for the purpose of uniting the
                        discordant Republican elements of the State, was held in Richmond on
                        Saturday last. Messrs. Porter and Platte, members of Congress, Senator
                        Lewis, Ex-Governor Wells and other Radicals played a conspicuous part in the
                        meeting. Messrs. McKenzie, Booker and Ayer, of the lower House of Congress,
                        sent letters expressing their hearty concurrence in the movement, while
                        Senator Johnston and the other Representatives, Messrs. Gibson, Milnes and
                        Ridgway declined to have anything to do with it.</p>
                    <p>After much discussion it was determined, by resolution, that the Executive
                        Committees headed by G. K. Gilmer, C.H. Porter and Gen. Wickham should
                        appoint five from each Republican committee in the State, who should be
                        authorized to invite the adherents of the different Republican factions to
                        meet in Richmond, on the 6th of April next, to reorganize the Republican
                        party of the State.</p>
                    <p>During the discussion Messrs. Wells and Porter expressed themselves in a very
                        conciliatory way, which considering the circumstances, was quite politic,
                        Porter, though at one time, branching off to assail Gov. Walker, and through
                        him the people in the State who voted for and elected him Governor.</p>
                    <p>It was left, however, for the gentleman, who was elected Lieut. Governor on
                        the ticket with Governor Walker, to denounce the men who voted for him. Who
                        would have thought that Jno. F. Lewis could play so ungenerous a part
                        towards his friends and supporters? And yet it is reported, that the Hon.
                        Jno. F. Lewis, who holds the position of U.S. Senator to-day at the hands of
                        "Rebels," expressed himself as "deploring the day when 'Rebels' should get
                        control of the State, and pitying the 'Union' men when that occurred."</p>
                    <p>How many Radicals voted for him for the position of Lieut. Governor? Judging
                        from the vote in this section, there must have been very few, for they voted
                        here, almost to a man, for Harris the colored nominee on the ticket with
                        Wells. How many Radicals were in the Conservative caucus, which
                            proclamed him the nominee of the Conservatives of the
                        Legislature for the position of U.S. Senator? Surely there were none, or it
                        would have been blazoned to the world long ere this. Was it the Radical, or,
                        according to Congressman Platte, the "Rebel" majority in the Legislature
                        which elected him U.S. Senator? We doubt not Mr. Lewis will agree that it
                        was the "Rebel" majority, which he seems so anxious to crush by marshaling
                        the Radical cohorts, and without the aid of which he would have remained a
                        quiet tiller of the soil in Rockingham, instead of being heralded as,
                        physically, the tallest man in the U.S. Senate.
                        Then are we wrong when we say that in denouncing the "Rebels" he denounced
                        his friends--those who gave him the only political prominence he ever had,
                        and perhaps ever will have?</p>
                    <p>It was an act of the direst ingratitude, a slander upon the majority of the
                        people of Virginia, and without a parallel. He, alone, has kicked the prop
                        from under him which elevated him to position. If the fall should extinguish
                        his political existence it will be but a just a desert, and,
                        judging from the general condemnation it receives at the hands of the many
                        of all shades of political opinion, he will descend into his political
                        grave, "unwept, unhonored and unsung."</p>
