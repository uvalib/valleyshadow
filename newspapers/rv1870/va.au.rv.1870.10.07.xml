                <transcript>
                    <p>We made a local notice, in our last, of the heavy fall of rain and terrible
                        freshet of Thursday last, but did not then imagine the damage anything like
                        as great as it is.</p>
                    <p>The roads and bridges leading out of Staunton being impassable at that time
                        we were unable to learn, even in the smallest degree, the extent of the
                        damage outside of Staunton, but in the past few days, travel has been
                        resumed in various directions, and we are enabled to learn and give some of
                        the details of the damage done to our county people.</p>
                    <p>Of course our statement must be incomplete, and in some cases may be
                        incorrect, but sufficient is given for our readers to form some idea of the
                        immense damage done to Mills, Dwellings, Crops, &amp;c., in this and
                        adjoining counties.</p>
                    <p>The rain and freshet was general throughout the Valley, and in South-western
                        and South-eastern Virginia.</p>
                    <p>The streams in this and adjoining counties were higher than can be remembered
                        by the oldest citizens, and the damage to property consequently greater than
                        was ever known before.</p>
                    <p>In Staunton no such a flood was ever known. The freshet of 1860, when the
                        banks of the Creek, which runs in a southerly direction through the city,
                        were overflown, and the water poured through the principal streets, did more
                        damage to private property, while the freshet of Thursday last did far
                        greater damage to public property.</p>
                    <p>We mentioned in our last the various bridges destroyed in Staunton, but, at
                        that time, owing to the continued high state of the water, could not form
                        any very correct idea of the damage done. Especially were we mistaken as to
                        the damage done to the bridge and masonry in front of Bickle's shop, on Main
                        Street, which is far greater than we supposed, and after an examination of
                        all the damage done to public property, are satisfied that the cost, of
                        replacing and repairing, to the Corporation, will not fall short of our
                        estimate given before. The damage to private property, we are pleased to be
                        able to state, is not so great as we had supposed.</p>
                    <p>We mentioned the fact of Mr. Jas. Teabo's narrow escape last week, but had
                        not then learned of the two following incidents of the flood.</p>
                    <p>An old man caught in Mrs. Bolin's stables, on Spring Lane, remained in the
                        loft during the flood. Although parties went to his rescue, yet he persisted
                        in remaining, rather than risk the chances of getting out. Fortunately the
                        stable was not carried off and he was not subjected to the watery element
                        which he so dreaded.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Geo, Thurber, who remained in his house, just below Burke's Stables,
                        longer than proper discretion dictated, was unable to get out. The rapid
                        rise of the water forced him into the second story, from which he escaped to
                        a tree and was rescued by his friends throwing him a rope.</p>
                    <p>All along Lewis' Creek we hear of damage to crops and fences. The Fair
                        Grounds were submerged and slightly damaged but will be put in readiness,
                        easily, for the Fair.</p>
                    <p>On Middle River the destruction was greater than any other stream in the
                        County.</p>
                    <p>The Valley Mills, Phil O. Palmer's, at West View, were damaged considerably,
                        the western end being forced out. The end of his Foundry moulding room was
                        bursted out and many valuable patterns destroyed. Mr. Palmer's saw-mill was
                        washed away and his dam broken, and at the same time the bridge across the
                        Parkersburg road, and the private bridge leading from that road to Mr.
                        Palmer's Foundry. His orchards were seriously damaged.</p>
                    <p>Henry Palmer's, Mt. Vernon Mill, at Spring Hill, with about 3,000 bushels of
                        wheat and 100 barrels of flour, and his saw-mill, were swept off. A report
                        has reached us that this Mill, or a portion of it (as some say it went off
                        in sections,) lodged without being further broken to pieces, near the
                        Wheatland Mills, some miles down the stream.</p>
                    <p>Sam'l Landes Mill was damaged, some 40 or 50 barrels of flour lost, his dam
                        broken and saw-mill considerably injured.</p>
                    <p>The dam and forebay at Trimble and Hogsett's mill was damaged and 1000 feet
                        of lumber carried away.</p>
                    <p>G. A. Hundley's mill had a portion of the foundation washed out, and the
                        wheel, dam and forebay damaged, but its contents are uninjured.</p>
                    <p>John Shutterle's mill was overflowed in the basement, the forebay and part of
                        the dam and his saw mill destroyed.</p>
                    <p>The dam at Trinity Point mills was <del/></p>
                    <p><del/> turning and fitting shop was destroyed.</p>
                    <p>J. H. Argenbright's dwelling house and furniture was carried away.</p>
                    <p>Christian Cline's mill, with about 4000 bushels of wheat, and his saw mill
                        were swept away. The house of his miller, Jos. Cline, was carried away and
                        landed about 3/4 of a mile below, in the field of Saml. D. Humbert.</p>
                    <p>Saml. Cline's mill, 6 miles below Staunton, on the McAdamized Road, was
                        covered up with debris, with about 400 bushels of wheat. This wheat is said
                        to be much damaged if not a total loss.</p>
                    <p>Thos. F. Hoy's saw mill, near Mt. Meridian, was destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Robt. S. Harnsbarger's saw mill and miller's house were swept away and his
                        mill partially submerged but not damaged.</p>
                    <p>Scotts Ford mills, below Mt. Meridian gone--loss $5000.</p>
                    <p>Jno. Beam lost his dwelling and all its contents.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. G. D. Patterson lost her meat-house, smoke-house, barn and all her
                        farming implements.</p>
                    <p>J. D. Craig at Mt. Meridian lost all his out-houses, stables, straw-ricks,
                        some farming implements and about 500 bushels of corn. A dwelling on his
                        place occupied by Mr. Humphrey, with all its furniture &amp;c., was
                        swept away.</p>
                    <p>Jno. A. Patterson lost a quantity of fencing and a large quantity of wheat in
                        his granary.</p>
                    <p>Bailey Dunlap lost a quantity of corn and the corn crops of Col. W. D.
                        Anderson, Wm. Moorman and S. H. McCue were washed away.</p>
                    <p>The following are the losses on South River as far as we can hear.</p>
                    <p>Stuart's distillery damaged, mill not injured.</p>
                    <p>Wm. Blackwell's Mill, 1 mile above Waynesboro, was submerged and in danger,
                        but the dam gave way and relieved and probably saved it.</p>
                    <p>Henry A. Harner's chopping mill was carried away, but his saw-mill is left
                        standing.</p>
                    <p>Wonderlick's saw-mill and a tenant's house with furniture &amp;c., were
                        destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Jas. A. Patterson lost his saw-mill and two houses.</p>
                    <p>Jno. K. Koiner lost his saw-mill, but his flouring mill was not injured.</p>
                    <p>Patrick's Mill was submerged, but not damaged--the dam is not believed to be
                        broken.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Kerr, a widow with nine children, lost her dwelling, granary and
                        orchard.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Wm. Patterson, eight miles below Waynesboro, went out into his yard to
                        remove a log which had washed against his dwelling, and was thrown into the
                        main channel and was compelled to swim to the other side of the river to
                        save his life.</p>
                    <p>Port Republic, Rockingham, we learn was at one time fifteen feet deep in
                        water, and but few houses destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Sylvester Stover, Miller at Port Republic, and his wife and child were swept
                        away in their dwelling and supposed to be lost.</p>
                    <p>Amos Scott lost 12 fine Horses.</p>
                    <p>The Mill of Hon. Jno. F. Lewis was not damaged. His house was surrounded by
                        water two days. He saved his horses by taking them into his house.</p>
                    <p>Chas. Weaver lost his Mill, Chopping Mill, Dwelling and out houses on his
                        premises.</p>
                    <p>At Weyer's Cave the dwelling of Mrs. McCauley, containing an aged woman, Mrs.
                        Ham, was swept away. Mrs. McCauley, two daughters and two babes, two sons
                        and two negro men saved themselves by getting into trees, where they
                        remained during the night amid the storm and rain.</p>
                    <p>The damage to crops &amp;c., along South River was very great.</p>
                    <p>We have heard of the destruction of the following property on Christian's
                        Creek:</p>
                    <p>Bushong's mill badly damaged and dwelling house, occupied by Mr. Geo. Myers,
                        with its contents, and saw mill swept away. Also a number of hogs and a
                        buggy.</p>
                    <p>Sniteman's saw mill was destroyed.</p>
                    <p>Wm. Hamilton's Grist mill was carried away with its contents.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jas. Hamilton had his wheat stored in this mill.</p>
                    <p>P. T. Burkholder lost his entire crop of corn.</p>
                    <p>Henry Defenbaugh lost 3 horses and 6 cows.</p>
                    <p>Brew's mill, near New Hope was badly damaged.</p>
                    <p>Martin Yount's Fulling mill and Saw mill were washed away.</p>
                    <p>Nearly every farmer on the creek lost more or less corn in the shock.</p>
                    <p>Job. Turner lost about $800 or $1000 worth of corn.</p>
                    <p>Bates' Tilt hammer, Cabinet shop and several dwellings near by, on Meadow
                        Run, near New Hope, were swept away, and Sites dam, in close proximity, was
                        broken, but his mill not damaged.</p>
                    <p>The destruction of fences, spring houses, crops &amp;c., on Meadow Run
                        was very considerable. Mr. Adam Shuey and family were compelled to leave
                        their dwelling for a time.</p>
                    <p>Christian Michael's saw-mill in North River Gap was washed away.</p>
                    <p>The Saw-mill of Capt. Hogshead, near Stribling Springs, we learn, was carried
                        about one mile down the stream and landed without damaging it a great deal.</p>
                    <p>The house of Geo. Sherman, at Grattan's Mill, near Mt. Crawford, was carried
                        away with all its furniture &amp;c., and the mill badly damaged.</p>
                    <p>Collin's Mill, one mile this side of Greenville was damaged--a small portion
                        of the foundation being taken from under it. This, we believe, is the only
                        mill damaged in the South-western portion of the county.</p>
                    <p>The Forrer dam, on Mossy Creek, lately rebuilt, and supposed to be one of the
                        most secure in the county, is torn out worse than by the former freshet in
                        that stream.</p>
                    <p>The bridges on every road leading out of Staunton were nearly all destroyed
                        for 15 or 20 miles. The only road bed seriously damaged is that of the
                        Parkersburg Turnpike, which is badly washed in many places. It will probably
                        take $4,000 or $5,000 to restore it to its former good condition.</p>
                    <p>As far as we can hear from the county, in every direction, in the proximity
                        of streams and meadow branches there has been great loss or damage to crops,
                        and where there were no streams and there was consequently no flood, the
                        farmers are damaged by washing out of the seed in the ground and washing
                        away of the soil. In many places whole fields have been ruined and we have
                        heard of one or two farms in adjoining counties which have been washed
                        literally into gullies.</p>
                    <p>Along North River, Rockingham, immense damage was done. All the bridges were
                        swept away. The mills near Bridgewater were destroyed, and several buildings
                        in the place, including the Masonic Temple, damaged. The dwelling of Mr.
                        Hopewell on Hopewell's Island was carried away.--The large mill and
                        factories and the dwelling of J. W. Miller at Riverton were destroyed. From
                        Bridgewater to Port Republic the fields are a perfect waste.</p>
                    <p>Hon. Wm. Milnes lost his Forge, and all the buildings connected with it, at
                        Shenandoah Iron Works, Page Co., and his Storehouse and stock of goods, and
                        Rev. A. P. Boude and Messrs. Deacon &amp; Mason lost their residences.
                        The safe containing the books and papers of the company weighing 3 tons was
                        carried ten miles and landed at New Port. Mr. Milnes' residence was above
                        the overflow.</p>
                    <p>All along down the Shenandoah River we hear of immense losses of Dwellings,
                        Mills, Barns, Crops, Fencing &amp;c., and in a few instances the loss of
                        life.</p>
                    <p>Thos. Blakemore, formerly of Rockingham, lost all his family (6 or 8) except
                        himself and two small boys. The boys saved themselves by swimming out and he
                        by clinging to a tree.</p>
                    <p>Harper's Ferry was inundated, the water running into the windows of the
                        second stories. The flood came on this place in the night without a warning
                        to the inhabitants and the loss of life, in consequence, was considerable. A
                        gentleman just from there reports 47 drowned. Great damage was done to
                        property. The bridge over the Shenandoah at this place and the Railroad
                        bridge between Harper's Ferry and Hall Town were swept away.</p>
                    <p>On the Manassas Railroad between Strasburg and Manassas several bridges were
                        carried away and travel by that route suspended.</p>
                    <p>From Lexington we learn that much damage has been on the Point in that place,
                        and several houses swept off, among the number the houses, of Messrs.
                        McNutt, Alexander and Anderson. But few mills were damaged in Rockbridge,
                        though farms were badly washed and fences and crops carried away and also
                        many bridges.</p>
                    <p>In the adjoining county of Albemarle, on the Rivanna River, the destruction
                        was very great. Not a mill is left standing and there was immense loss of
                        crops. Many lives were lost in this stream.</p>
                    <p>The James River was higher than ever been known before. The loss along its
                        banks was immense. At Lynchburg the Orange House was damaged, and the R. R.
                        bridges near by and the large county bridge near the Piedmont House and the
                        two iron bridges on Southside R. R. below were carried away.</p>
                    <p>All the lower portion of the city was badly damaged--loss estimated at three
                        quarters of a million.</p>
                    <p>Fifty or sixty persons lost their lives between Lynchburg and Richmond.</p>
                    <p>All of the lower portion of Richmond was submerged, the water being four feet
                        deep in the old market, and ferries established in Main and other streets.
                        The damage to that portion of the city was immense. It has been estimated at
                        one million, but will probably exceed that amount.</p>
                    <p>Mayo's Bridge was swept away and the Danville R. R. bridge only saved by
                        being heavily weighed down.</p>
                    <p>We hear the same news all along the Potomac.</p>
                    <p>At Alexandria and Washington the water was higher than ever before known, and
                        the Railroad bridge between these places swept away. Travel however is not
                        impeded by this.</p>
                    <p>From the above scattered data, which is all we have been able to obtain,
                        owing to the delay in Mails and communication, some idea may be obtained of
                        the immense destruction which has spread over many portions of our beloved
                        old State, greater, by far, than the devastations of four years war.</p>
                    <p>Our people, however, have exhibited in the past a wonderful recuperative
                        power.--They will not be downcast now, but will bow with humble resignation
                        to the will of Heaven, and will still hope and strive for the best.</p>
