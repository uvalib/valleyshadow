<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Responds to an anonymous contributor to another paper, who is already
                    attacking the newly elected town council for heavy taxation. Editor uses figures
                    and logic to point out the flaws in the writer's arguments and demands the new
                    council be given a chance to show its merits.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A writer in the last Spectator, signing himself "Independent Ticket,"
                        produces an article, calculated to bias the minds of many and prejudice
                        them, before hand, against the new Council, just elected by a large majority
                        of the people. As the editor of a journal which reflected the views of the
                        majority, we can not permit it to pass, without a word or two of comment.</p>
                    <p>The appeal made by "Independent Ticket" is very adroitly made to the
                        Tax-payers, with an array of figures, and argument thereon, intended to
                        dismay the nervous, and intimidate the people generally. It is the same
                        blustering game played to so little effect previous to the election, and
                        will signally fail to relieve the gentlemen who were so earnest in their
                        opposition to the will of the people.</p>
                    <p>His figures are made up of $27,650, (debt created by the Council 20 years
                        since, for the payment of which no steps were taken, nor was it seriously
                        considered by previous Councils, till the majority of it became due, Jan.
                        1st 1870,) $100,000 voted by the people, by an immense majority, as the
                        amount to be subscribed to the stock of the Valley Railroad, and $43,000
                        which he assumes the new council will add to the debt. Asserting a wish not to
                        "criminate or recriminate," yet he does so in almost every line, and in the
                        assumption spoken of seeks to prejudge the action of the new council and to
                        criminate them before they enter upon their duties.</p>
                    <p>Leaving out of his count the assumed $43,000, no matter
                            what set of men were elected councilmen, the remainder ($27,650,
                        old debt and $100,000 subscription to the Valley R. R.) was necessary to be
                        met, and, as all such things are, by taxation. It will readily be seen,
                        therefore, that robbed of its bold assumption, the scare-crow raised by
                        "Independent Ticket," is only a barren pole.</p>
                    <p>The tremendous rate of taxation, which "Independent Ticket" flaunts so
                        exultantly before the public, is another scare-crow in another part of the
                        field. Property will be re-assessed and every man will pay just his equal proportion of what is necessary, and not, as for some years past, when one man paid
                        tax upon nearly full value for his property and another upon about one-fifth
                        or one-sixth of its value. Indeed, we have in our mind's eye a tax-payer,
                        who has paid taxes for a number of years upon property assessed at $1,700,
                        (not double the rent he received for it) and which he has lately sold, as we
                        learn, for over $10,000. How would 2 1/2 per cent on $1,700 compare with
                        four-tenths of one per cent on $10,000? Very favorably don't you think? But
                        perhaps it is this very equalization of taxation which Independent Ticket
                        don't like. Wonder if he is not paying taxes on some fine property at about
                        one-fifth of its cash value?</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, we feel warranted in saying that the newly elected council
                        will enter upon the discharge of their duties with a full sense of the
                        responsibility upon them, and with the best interests of the whole town at
                        heart, and we have no doubt they will manage its affairs as economically and
                        with as little burden as possible to the tax payers. They will have
                        sufficient work for a while in financiering the debt created twenty years
                        ago, and which "Independent Ticket" and his predecessors in the council took
                        no steps to meet at maturity, and we ask that the public will not allow such
                        balderdash as that emitted by "Independent Ticket" to bias their judgment,
                        but wait for the action of the new council, when it will be full early to
                        either praise or condemn.</p>
                    <p>Of one thing we think the people can rest assured, that there will be no
                        greater taxation than is absolutely necessary for the best interests of the
                        town, and that all will bear it equally.</p>
