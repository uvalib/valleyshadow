<b>Assault Upon Gen. Lee in the U.S. Senate</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Appalled by a recent Senate speech which besmirches the character of the
                    recently departed General Lee. Gave examples from antiquity and poetry in which
                    warriors speak well of the dead. Especially upset with Sumner's role in
                    attacking Lee's memory on the Senate floor.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The debate which occurred in the Senate of the United States on the 13th
                        inst., of which we publish a sketch in another column, breathes, a more
                        vindictive spirit, and is more repugnant to decency, than could possibly
                        have been looked for even from a body, in which of late years, rage has so
                        often triumphed over reason.</p>
                    <p>The proposition of Mr. McCreary, whatsoever his intentions was, in one of its
                        features--as matters now stand at Arlington--altogether unreasonable, and
                        its introduction, at this time, was, in any aspect, censurably unwise. But
                        who could have expected that the occasion would be seized upon for the
                        emptying of more than seven vials of wrath, and as many more cess-pools of
                        obloquy, upon the life and character of the now departed and ever-glorious
                        Lee.</p>
                    <p>The noble and generous in all ages have fixed limits to animosity, and have
                        set examples of forbearance and magnanimity, when death has interposed
                        between a man and his foe--examples, which the good and the chivalrous have
                        always found it in accord with their natures to follow. Thus the
                        Master-spirit of the British Drama, who knew well what touches of gentleness
                        might naturally consist with even the sternness of steel-clad warriors,
                        makes Prince Henry, after he slays Percy in battle--Percy who was a rebel in fact as well as
                        in name--pay this tribute to his fallen foe:</p>
                    <p>This earth that bears thee dead<br> Bears not alive so stout a
                        gentleman<br> If thou wert sensible of courtesy<br> I should not make so
                        dear a show of zeal:--<br> But let my favors hide thy mangled face;<br>
                        And even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself<br> For doing these fair rites of
                        tenderness.<br> Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to Heaven!"</p>
                    <p>But the Poet, equally familiar with the inglorious elements of humanity,
                        presents to us, in the next moment, Falstaff, who inflicts a fresh stab on the dead body of the hero. The play,
                        in this feature, has been recently re-acted in the Senate of the United
                        States--the great Council Chamber of the restored Union--the Falstaffs were
                        many; but to play the role of Henry there was not one!</p>
                    <p>But what shall we say of the classic Sumner on this occasion, of him who,
                        dwelling in "the Athens of America," makes Greek and Roman models his study.
                        Alas for him that the outside alone of the cup and the platter conforms to
                        the antique pattern!--He imitates, it may be, the style, but forgets
                        altogether the morals of the Roman.--In this the Pagan puts the Christian
                        (Heaven save the mark!) to the blush. Where, the other day, was his memory
                        of that oft-commended Roman maxim, "De mortuis mil nisi
                            bonum," "say nothing of the dead but what is good." Or, if his
                        memory travelled not back so far, had he forgotten the lessons of the more
                        modern tragedy, in which Zanga, the barbarian, who had been stricken "a
                        blow" by Alonzo, makes revenge the study of his after life. There is such a
                        resemblance between Zanga's wrongs, and Zanga's spirit, and those of the
                        Senator, that one might have expected him, as he has followed Zanga so
                        closely thus far in his passion of revenge--not to be outdone by the
                        barbarian in magnanimity; for even Zanga, over the dead form of Alonzo,
                        exclaims</p>
                    <p>"And art thou dead! So is my enmity.</p>
                    <p>I war not with the dust!</p>
                    <p>But we forbear; fer we feel that to point the assailants of Gen.
                        Lee to such examples as these, is to "cast pearls" before those, who,
                        swinelike, will "trample them under their feet, and turn again and read
                    us."</p>

<b>An Old Movement--Called New</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
