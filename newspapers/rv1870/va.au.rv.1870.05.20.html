<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The appointed times for the registration of voters at different points in
                        their various townships expired on the 17th. The revision of the lists will
                        take place on Tuesday and Wednesday next, May 24th and 25th, at the
                        following places.</p>
                    <p>STAUNTON--at registering place in both Wards.</p>
                    <p>BEVERLY MANOR TOWNSHIP, at Bolivar.</p>
                    <p>NORTH RIVER TOWNSHIP, at Mt. Solon.</p>
                    <p>MIDDLE RIVER TOWNSHIP, at New Hope.</p>
                    <p>SOUTH RIVER TOWNSHIP, at Waynesboro.</p>
                    <p>RIVERHEADS TOWNSHIP, at Greenville.</p>
                    <p>THE PASTURES TOWNSHIP, at Churchville.</p>
                    <p>At this revision all who are qualified to vote can register. A wrong
                        impression obtains, that those who have failed to register heretofore can
                        not register at the places of revision, without showing good cause for their
                        failure to register. This is a great mistake. The registration act requires
                        Registrars to sit two days previous to the coming election for the purpose
                        of "correcting and amending the lists, at which time any
                            qualified voter, applying and not previously registered, may be
                        added." Thus it will be seen that it is the right and privilege of
                        all qualified voters, who, for any cause, or
                            without a cause, have failed to register up
                        to this time, to meet the Registrar at the place of revision on the 24th and
                        25th, and, without a question as to the why or wherefore of their failure to
                        register before, to have their names recorded as voters.</p>
                    <p>This being the case, there is no excuse for any failing longer to register,
                        who are qualified and have not registered between the 10th and 17th
                        instants. Registration under military authority, or before the 10th inst., does not place you in the attitude of a
                        voter. The present registration is under the present Constitution and in
                        accordance with an act of our present Legislature.--Hence to be able to vote
                        you must register under the present Registrars. If you do not do this, you
                        can not vote in the coming election.</p>
                    <p>A new experiment is to be tried, as to county organization and government.
                        The best men are imperatively demanded in all positions, and to secure this
                        desideratum, it is the imperative duty of all, who are qualified, to
                        register. You who have failed thus far, should meet the Registrar on the
                        24th or 25th and register.</p>
