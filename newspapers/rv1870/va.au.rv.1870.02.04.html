<b>For the Vindicator</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Staunton" writes the Vindicator to support recent calls for development of
                    manufacturing in Augusta County. He also calls for reform in banking practice,
                    asserting that present rates of interest are usurious.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--I saw an article in a late number of
                        your valuable paper, signed "A Citizen," setting forth the importance of
                        establishing manufacturing enterprises in our town. I agree with him that it
                        is most important that we, as a community, should so shape our course as to
                        induce parties of experience and capital to invest their means here, in such
                        manufacturing enterprises as will insure permanent prosperity, and think the
                        suggestions he makes are good and should claim the attention of our leading
                        business men, so that, when we get control of our own affairs, his plans may
                        be adopted.</p>
                    <p>But this is not all that is necessary for our prosperity. Some change in the
                        management of our Banks is most important. No legitimate business can pay 12
                            per cent. for money, much less from 3 to 5
                            per cent. per month, as I understand is the
                        case in at least one of them and presume it must be so as the Board of
                        Directors now give their Cashier a salary equal to 8 per
                            cent. on their entire capital stock.</p>
                    <p>Now what we want is a Bank that will take good business paper at fair rates.
                        It may be that 6 per cent. is not enough for
                        National Banks with small capital, but I am sure that 8 per cent. would pay a dividend of 10 per
                            cent. on the capital stock, which ought to satisfy any reasonable
                        stockholder. When these Banks were established here it was understood that
                        those merchants in the Northern cities, who took stock, did so for the
                        purpose of assisting the merchants and business men in our community and not
                        to rob them by charging usurious rates for money, and make 25 per cent. annually, as they are now doing. I would
                        just say to these Northern and other stockholders, be careful or you may
                        "kill the goose that lays the golden eggs." Our merchants buy their goods in
                        Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, perhaps from some of these very share
                        holders and the time may come (by constant shaving by the Banks they have
                        established here for our benefit,) when these Staunton and Augusta county
                        merchants can not pay what they owe them for the goods purchased. Now the
                        question for them to decide is, whether they prefer to continue to sell
                        their goods and get the money, or take 30 per
                        cent. on the few shares of Bank stock they hold in our Banks.</p>
                    <p>The fact is, Mr. Editor, too many of our people are engaged in the blood
                        thirsty business of shaving. It seems to me that it pervades all classes of
                        society and that each man is trying to see how much money he can make out of
                        his neighbor's necessities. Now let me urge upon all our people, Bankers and
                        others, to be content to do a legitimate business, if it don't make quite as
                        many greenbacks. I am sure it will create a better feeling among our people
                        and improve the business prospects of our town and county. It certainly is
                        no inducement to men experienced in manufacturing, and having the means to
                        build up manufacturing establishments in our midst, to learn that 2, 3 and 5
                            per cent. per month is demanded and paid for
                        money here. The present usurious rates of interest, on the contrary, is an
                        impediment to our advancement. And with the assumption with which I started,
                        a change must be effected in the manipulations of our Banks and others. The
                        frowns of community now gather against the extortions practiced. But the
                        people must put their thoughts and feelings into practice. They have it in
                        their power to put down usury and they must do it. Then we can induce
                        capitalists to invest in our midst in legitimate business, such as "A
                        Citizen" suggests, and I am sure it will stimulate enterprise, thrift and
                        industry among our people, and start us on a sure road to wealth and
                        material prosperity.<br> STAUNTON.</p>
