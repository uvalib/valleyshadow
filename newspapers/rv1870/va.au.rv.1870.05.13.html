<b>Glad to Hear It</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reprints an article stating that a prominent Republican stated
                    that no white Virginian could be a "good Republican." The article jokes that if
                    he meant a "Sumner-Butler-Drake-Porter" Republican, then Virginia is better off.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Board of Visitors of the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institution has issued a
                    report. The school has 131 pupils including 92 deaf mutes and 39 blind. Since

                    The paper praises the principal, Maj. Covell, and the Steward, A. N.
                    Breckenridge, and declares it one of the best-managed institutions of its kind
                    in the country. "Every department is filled by accomplished and efficient
                    instructors, which is evidenced by all who visit the institution and witness the
                    exercises. The discipline, though necessarily firm, is at the same time parental
                    and kind and a consequent cheerfulness exists among the pupils, not often
                    witnessed among a less fortunate class of scholars."<br>(Names in announcement: Maj.  Covell,  A. N. Breckenridge)</blockquote>
