<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The all absorbing topic with our people now is the subject of the county
                        subscription to the stock of the Valley Railroad. This subject has been
                        written about and discussed in the papers, pro
                        and con, for a number of weeks past, and many
                        points have been brought out tending to show the greatest advantages to our
                        people from the early completion of this necessary public improvement, and as a consequence the reasons why
                        our people, should, as one man, vote for the subscription. These reasons
                        have doubtlessly been considered by many, and we know some former opponents
                        who now propose to vote for and are working to carry the county
                        subscription. We do not propose to recapitulate the arguments already
                        adduced, but to look at the subject from another stand point.</p>
                    <p>In the first place we are positively and emphatically a railroad man. We
                        believe they have advantaged every community to which they were of easy
                        access. We are in favor of all the railroads which are projected and can
                        possibly be projected through our county. We would rejoice to see the Page
                        Valley Railroad constructed and we are equally anxious to see the Valley
                        Railroad a reality. But there are some roads more advantageous to a
                        community than others. This is the case as between the above named roads.
                        Let us look at the two.</p>
                    <p>Suppose the Page Valley Railroad built to Fisherville, without a cent's cost
                        to our people, and how would it advantage them? It will open up the section
                        through which it passes. Will it do anything further? One of the great
                        advantages of Railroads is the cheap and rapid transportation of productions
                        from the producing sections to the places of demand. Will this be afforded
                        by the Page Valley Road? We think not, and we give you our reasons. It runs,
                        in connection with other roads, to Philadelphia and New York, and for every
                        transshipment, or every road over which produce passes, an additional amount
                        is added to the cost of transportation, and by the time produce from this
                        section reaches either Philadelphia or New York, the costs reduce the net
                        receipts below what would be realized in Richmond or Baltimore and that is
                        surely no advantage. But our people do not, nor are they likely to send
                        their produce to either Philadelphia or New York, and our merchants are not
                        likely to buy there and ship over this road for the same reason.</p>
                    <p>Then as to Baltimore, which is a better market for our produce than either of
                        the above. Whether the produce shipped on this road reaches Baltimore by the
                        Manassas road and its connections, or by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Road
                        from its point of connection with the Page Valley Railroad, it will be
                        subjected to local rates, at least after it leaves the Page Valley Road,
                        which will continue the present high rates of transportation, so much
                        complained of in this locality now. Look at it then calmly and judge for
                        yourselves if it can possibly be a competition likely to reduce the rates of
                        transportation and render it cheap.</p>
                    <p>Let us then view the Valley Railroad in this light. Will it be likely to
                        render transportation cheap? It will be a continuous line of railway to
                        Baltimore, and run, in all probability, by one company. The Baltimore
                        &amp; Ohio Railroad Company are anxious to run it when completed and
                        have made a proposition to do so. Produce will then be transported, without
                        breaking bulk, directly from any point in Augusta, or along the line of this
                        road, to Baltimore, thereby saving the additional costs of transshipments
                        and of extra tariffs where freight passes over several roads. Breaking bulk
                        and shipping over several roads, is very like a farmer starting a load of
                        hay to town and upsetting the wagon once or twice. By the time he has
                        re-loaded it his profits are considerably reduced, if any profits are left
                        after the operation.</p>
                    <p>But the prime question is, "will the stockholders favor low tariffs," and
                        thereby reduce the rates of transportation? This is the most important
                        aspect and from whence arises the greatest advantages to communities. The
                        stockholders are the City of Baltimore, $1,000,000, Baltimore &amp; Ohio
                        Railroad, $1,000,000, and the counties and towns along the line, $1,200,000.
                        What are their interests? Clearly Baltimore has not invested in this road as
                        a matter of speculation. She cares nothing for the dividends arising from
                        it. Her object is to help to open up another direct line of communication
                        from a rich and productive section, and to secure the transportation of its
                        productions to her limits. From the increase of her business thereby she
                        will derive ten-fold more advantage than if the road declared a dividend of
                        20 per cent, per annum. This she clearly
                        understands. It is surely not her interest to drive off trade by high rates
                        of transportation, but, on the contrary, she is directly interested to have
                        the very lowest possible rates of transportation. The people of the Counties
                        and Towns along the line are also directly interested in having low rates.
                        The People of Baltimore and the People of the Valley will own eleven-sixteenths of
                        the whole stock, and both are directly interested in low rates and they will
                        have them. It is this very thing that will secure low rates for the future
                        on this road, and force low rates on every road running through this
                        section. Stock Companies, composed of individuals, are always interested to
                        secure the greatest possible dividends, and, as owners of Railroads, are
                        continually making the effort to raise their rates and where there is no
                        competition always succeed. Where there is competition the rates are reduced
                        to the lowest possible figures. The Valley Railroad will be a competing line
                        with the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad and the only competing line it
                        will have in this section. The large majority of its stockholders are, as we
                        have shown, forever committed to low rates of transportation. This will
                        secure a lasting saving to all along its route. Then people of Augusta can
                        you afford to let this advantageous offer slip? Will you not vote the
                        subscription, or do you prefer to continue to pay in the shape of freight
                        tariffs, for the future without deriving any benefit therefor, as
                        much yearly as would pay your railroad tax for three or four years?</p>
                    <p>The farmer and merchant are directly affected by and are interested in
                        lowering freight rates. The mechanic, laborer and other consumers are,
                        though seemingly indirectly, as directly interested in the same thing. They
                        pay the original cost of articles consumed with the profit and freight
                        added. If the latter be low it is directly a saving to them. Then we are
                        all, farmer, merchant, mechanic and day-laborer, interested in this matter.
                        The Valley Railroad secures the end desired. Then let us turn out, on the
                        6th of August and accomplish the greatest good to old Augusta by voting,
                        with an unanimity unsurpassed, for the County subscription.</p>
