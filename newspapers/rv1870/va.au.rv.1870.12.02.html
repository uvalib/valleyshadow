<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The late election, resulting in Democratic triumphs, have not only thrown a
                        damper on the Republican party, but have caused the commencement of its
                        disintegration, which has so long been looked for by those who watched the
                        extravagances and the wanton persecutions of that party. It is amusing to
                        see prominent Republicans, like rats, endeavoring to escape from the sinking
                        ship.</p>
                    <p>Some of them propose to form a third party on the platform of the Revenue
                        Reformers and invite the Democracy to unite with them in securing the
                        success of principles, which Democrats have advocated and are advocating
                        today. This, like all the other efforts for a third party, will end in
                        smoke. All that is desired can be secured by uniting with the Democracy and
                        this is the destined result of the third party movement. The mountain is not
                        going to Mohamet hence Mohamet will go to the mountain. Once the moorings
                        are cut loose from the Republican party, and the Revenue and other Reformers
                        will drift away--are drifting away and will, as they must, unite with the
                        Democratic party.</p>
                    <p>This is a terrible realization to many of the prominent leaders and the
                        recipients of the patronage of that party. They are casting around already
                        to see the best means of preventing the hegira (we have alluded to above)
                        from and securing a further lease of life to the Republican party. Prominent
                        among these strugglers against the tide is Benjamin F. Butler. He presents
                        the magnificent idea, of a war, with England as the only means of preserving
                        the party.</p>
                    <p>Napoleon's war with Prussia to preserve one of the best governments France
                        ever had, has received the condemnation of the civilized world, and how much
                        more would a war with England to preserve a rotten and corrupt party, as the
                        Republican party has shown itself to be, be condemned, and how much greater
                        will be the failure of such an effort! No, the proposition of Benjamin F.
                        Butler will not win and he feels it and tremblingly proclaims, that he only
                        united with Republicans as a "war Democrat."--This is rich. With one hand he
                        holds up the Republican party and with the other topples it over with the
                        assertion that he only cooperated with them as a "war Democrat."</p>
                    <p>The hand-writing is on the wall, and is being deciphered. Indeed he that runs
                        may read. It only requires a solid Democratic front and, by the next
                        Presidential election, the Republican party will be one of the things of the
                        past, as a National party. Let us then not hesitate, but present this solid
                        front, when, with the foot of the Democratic giant on the neck of the
                        Republican Usurper, we can joyfully exclaim, forever after, in the language
                        of glorious old Virginia, "Sic Semper
                    Tyrannis."</p>
