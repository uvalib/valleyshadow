                    Answers to those who object because of a likely increased taxes that the profits
                    from the railroad and increase in personal property will more than make up for
                    it. Predicts that if the railroad is not built, Staunton will decline.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We are among those who believe that the full development of this Mountain
                        City can not be reached, and will not even be commenced, until our great
                        Valley is bisected, through its entire length, by a Railroad, in which
                        Staunton will be a point, and which will, with its connections, be one of
                        the great through-routes from New York to New Orleans. Then indeed will
                        Staunton begin to expand and develope, and increase in wealth and
                        population, and manifold advantages accrue to every county in the Valley and
                        especially to Augusta.</p>
                    <p>This we are on the eve of securing. It is necessary that a small portion of
                        the remaining stock in the Valley Railroad be subscribed by cities, towns or
                        counties. From circumstances which all understand, Staunton is called upon
                        to increase her subscription to secure not only this great good but to
                        ensure her being a point on the Valley Railroad. Objections are raised by a
                        few, who seem to dread the very mention of taxes
                        worse than death. No one pretends that increased subscription will not
                        necessitate an increase of taxation. On the contrary we all know that we
                        will pay more in the shape of taxes, and we feel that it is an outlay which
                        will come back to us in a short time in increased business and greater
                        profits, due to this very expenditure in taxes, not to say any thing of the
                        increase of wealth, due to the increased value of property consequent on the
                        construction of this road.--Acting on the principle of the gentlemen who
                        oppose the subscription, not a merchant in this place would risk a dollar in
                        a new stock, lest he might not sell at a profit.--They have, however, their
                        past experience and that of others to show the contrary, and are continually
                        investing in new stocks, and as continually increasing the amount of
                        investment and with increased profit. We have also the experience of other
                        places, favorably situated like Staunton, to clearly prove great advantages
                        to her from outlets North, South, East and West--in fact from being a great
                        railroad centre. It is true, this experience is to be seen only in isolated
                        instances in the South, for the reason that Railroad development has not
                        been carried to the extent it has in the North and West. Our railroads have
                        started from a prominent point to reach some other desirable point, but are
                        allowed to ag along their projected lines. When they have been
                        pushed through, the crossing points have exhibited just what we anticipate
                        here. As an evidence of this, we call to mind several points in our
                        knowledge--Atlanta, Ga., and Corinth and Grand Junction, Miss.--We knew them
                        thirteen years since, as but villages containing a few isolated houses,
                        while to day they are thickly populated and thriving places. Atlanta, to
                        day, probably contains two, three, and it may be four times the population
                        of Staunton, and is not only one of the prominent cities, but is the capital
                        of Georgia. Al this is due to the Railroads crossing at that point. She is
                        also largely engaged in Manufactures, with nothing like the advantages of
                        Staunton in this respect. How idle then the objection of taxation with such
                        prospective advantages! Let us then look at this thing practically and
                        remember that any taxation produced by subscription is to be spread over
                        future years, to be paid by a largely increased population, year by year,
                        while the advantages to all increase yearly in a greater proportion than the
                        increase of population.</p>
                    <p>If Staunton fails to become a point on the road, or the road fails to be
                        built, and others be built east or west of us, there will be an exodus of
                        our population and a decrease in the value of property, which will make the
                        property-holder tremble in his shoes, and wish, in vain, that he had voted
                        for the subscription. Therefore, the property-holders of Staunton are the
                        last ones who should object to taxation for such a purpose.</p>
