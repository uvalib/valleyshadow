                    <p>The following resolution was unanimously adopted as the first action of the
                        Committee:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Resolved</emph>, That the thanks of the relatives and
                        friends of the Confederate dead, who lie in the Thornrose Cemetery, are due
                        to Mrs. Robert Cowan individually, and as President of the Augusta Ladies'
                        Memorial Association, for her untiring zeal and unselfish devotion in the
                        cause of protecting, caring for, and consecrating the graves of the fallen
                        Soldiers of the South; and this Committee trusts that her health and life
                        may long be preserved, and thus her efforts in this holy cause be long
                        continued.</p>
                    <p>A Constitution prepared by order of the meeting in June last, was adopted as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>ARTICLE I</p>

                        decoration of the graves of Confederate dead, who are interred in Thornrose

                    <p>On Saturday last an election was held at the regular voting places, in
                        Staunton, on the question of an additional Subscription of $50,000 to the
                        Stock of the Valley Railroad Company and the Subscription carried by a large
                        majority, making the Subscription of Staunton to the Stock of the V.R.R.
                        Co., $150,000.</p>
                    <p>The vote stood as follows:</p>

                    <p>A three-fifth vote was necessary to carry the subscription, which it will be
                        seen, from the above figures, was obtained, with 151 votes to spare.</p>
                    <p>The opinion prevailed generally that the subscription would be carried and
                        consequently many favoring the subscription did not take the trouble to
                        vote. This accounts for the comparatively small vote cast.</p>
