<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The whole aim of the Radical party, since the war, has been the retention of
                        power. Every act of legislation by Republican Congresses pointed to this
                        end. This has incited the passage of Amendments, Test-oath laws, Manhood
                        suffrage acts and Military enforcement bills.</p>
                    <p>The seeming necessity for enactment to bolster up their party has carried
                        Republicans to the excesses which have so marked their legislation since
                        1865.</p>
                    <p>With the fall of the Confederacy the keystone of the Republican arch,
                        Slavery, also dropped out, and the crumbling away of the whole arch was
                        anticipated. Then it was that New England furnished the limbs of her
                        celebrated "Blue Law" Tree, mentioned above as Amendments &amp;c., to
                        make a frame work to support it, and to give it greater strength added a
                        prop from the South, called "citizenship of African descent." The latter
                        gave great strength for a time, but was being sapped, like the rest of its
                        props, by the moist swamp air of the South and freezing winds of the West.
                        This prop itself needing a support, the military enforcement of suffrage was
                        brought to bear. Like all the rest it proved a slender stay. New York and
                        North Carolina, to whom it was applied as a panacea for their Democratic
                        ills, have proved its utter inutility. The presence of would-be overawing
                        bayonets but confirmed them in their Democracy, and the Congressional
                        Committee is now discussing the propriety of repealing this bill. Butler is,
                        however tinkering away at lumber for additional supports, which he calls
                        "War with England," and "Amnesty (?) Bill." This he thinks will give longer
                        lease of life and power to the Republican party. When other and heavier
                        lumber has failed, what can be expected of the slender rods shaven up by the
                        inevitable Ben! All such aims have thus far failed and will continue so to
                        do, despite the efierts of such partisan Mechanics as are engaged
                        in patching the Republican fabric.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the doom of any party, which forgets the interests of the whole
                        people and only looks to the retention of the spoils, is written before
                        hand. It is thus with the Republican party. The crash of its now tottering
                        arch will be heard ere long, and the wise and wary seeing it, are getting
                        from under.</p>
