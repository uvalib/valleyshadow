<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on a recent move at a local primary to sow dissension and division
                    by setting up an "Independent Ticket". Happily says the move failed utterly,

                    winning the next election.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have never seen a more representative and harmonious meeting than that
                        held in the Court-House on Saturday night last, nor a list of nominees to be
                        selected from at a Primary Election that gave more general satisfaction. The
                        trouble was at the Primary Election, on Tuesday, with a large majority, to
                        select from the nominees any eleven of whom, taken promiscuously, would have
                        received the enthusiastic support of all.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, we have never seen a greater effort to create dissension
                        than the production of the so-called "Independent
                        Ticket" thrust before the people on Tuesday morning last, through the Spectator, several columns of which were
                        interlarded with insinuating paragraphs and low appeals to create a
                        sympathy, otherwise unattainable as the authors, and those who allowed their names to be used on that ticket,
                        supposed.</p>
                    <p>They made the charge that the ticket of Saturday night was the selection of a
                        subcommittee of five, who brought forth a ticket to control the suffrages of
                        800 voters, when they knew, if their spy gave them the correct information,
                        that it was a nomination by the committee of 21, not one of whom dissented,
                        but all of whom agreed to report it as their nominees, so satisfactory was
                        it from beginning to end.</p>
                    <p>How was it with the Independent Ticket? It was brought forth by two men, who put their own names on it as
                        candidates.</p>
                    <p>To distract attention from themselves they cried Wolf! Wolf!! but without
                        avail. The flimsy film with which they surrounded it was too transparent not
                        to be clearly seen through. The point to which they looked to for support
                        was known, and the ticket was correctly characterized during the day,
                        greatly to the disgust of those, who, in their great anxiety for office,
                        allowed their names to remain on the ticket.</p>
                    <p>Every effort was made to strengthen this ticket by sending out emissaries to
                        drum up men to run on it, some of whom kicked out of the traces, and others
                        pleaded ignorance.</p>
                    <p>To sum it up as a whole, it was a ticket gotten up by one or two, who, at all
                        hazards, desired a controlling influence in the affairs of the town. They
                        tried to strengthen their ticket by bringing to bear the influence of those
                        who were gullible enough to allow their names to be used, and looked for
                        their support to those who had none, or little or no interest in the town.</p>
                    <p>It was a most bare-faced attempt to distract and divide, and distant will be
                        the day when the names of those, who loaned themselves to this work, as
                        aiders and abetters of the so-called Independent
                        ticket, will be forgotten as the stirrers up of strife and the begetters of
                        dissension among a hitherto undivided people.</p>
