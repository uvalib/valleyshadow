<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Republicans of this State held another Convention in Richmond last week
                        which is reported in our Richmond exchanges as very rich in disorder and
                        other characteristic features. It seems to have been called with the view of
                        perfecting their organization and agreeing upon a platform of principles. In
                        this connection they adopted and put forward a platform, in which they
                        re-affirm their old "principles," assert their support of President Grant;
                        claim the present Administration as a Republican success; declare for a
                        rigid enforcement of the Free School system, and assert that the present
                        General Assembly are not to be expected to carry out the constitution in
                        this particular, nor is it to be hoped that this body will secure to the
                        masses the "fruits" of the new Constitution; denounce the "Conservatives" as
                        a contrivance to evade the issue between the Republican and Democratic
                        parties, and that their ultimate tendency is to side with the latter; give
                        the True Republicans" a rub for their faithlessness to their promises made
                        to Grant and Congress and recommend the nomination of Republican candidates
                        for county offices--All of this will be readily seen as the merest claptrap,
                        which when squeezed contains not a germ of a political principle, unless it
                        be that one general principle--the desire for the loaves and fishes of
                        office.</p>
                    <p>The great card which they play is their request of Congress to enact laws to
                        secure to the people of the State the "full benefit of the Homestead clause
                        of the Constitution and "compensation to loyal men in the South for property
                        taken for the use of the Government during the war, and the payment of all
                        claims due citizens of the South for services rendered prior to the war,
                        under such guards and restrictions as may be necessary to protect the
                        Government from imposition."</p>
                    <p>They expect much from this plank.--They declare they will make great inroads
                        on the Conservatives and this is the "principle" they put put
                        forth to accomplish the purpose. The enactment of the law by Congress to
                        compensate "Loyal" men in the South, they think, and hope, will bring into
                        their ranks many who have lost property--in some cases their all--at the
                        hands of the Government. They quietly assert, "who wouldn't be loyal when
                        they are to be paid their losses!" They will fail in their object we think.
                        They know that when a Democratic Administration comes in such a step is sure
                        to be taken. They are only stealing Democratic Thunder, and, what is more,
                        Democrats and Conservatives understand it and will hold aloof from
                        Republican alliances. It was a strong card, boldly played, but only exposes
                        the weakness of the "hand" from which it was played.</p>
                    <p>A marked feature of this Convention was the selection of Maj. Jno. A. Harman,
                        "Stonewall Jackson's Quartermaster," as the presiding officer. To see this
                        man, who aided in the swift marches of Stonewall Jackson's troops, and to
                        some extent, in keeping up the efficiency of those troops, by which they
                        struck the deadly blows against the enemy which made the name of "Stonewall
                        Jackson" famous, and an old Democrat withal, in the mixed and disorderly
                        crowd that composed that Convention--a sort of ruling spirit among them--may
                        be a cause of wonder to many, and we even now find ourselves wondering at
                        this great change of front. At all events it is so. "Stonewall Jackson's
                        Quartermaster" not only presided over the Republican State Convention, but,
                        judging from the proceedings of that body, is to-day the leading man in that
                        party. It is this very fact we desire to call attention to, for another
                        purpose. A bait has been thrown to Conservatives and Democrats, as we have
                        mentioned above, and the fact of an old Confederate now occupying the most
                        prominent position in the Republican party may have its effect. We warn all
                        against this. Be not deceived by it. The Democrats, and Conservatives are
                        gaining ground every day, and it will not be long before they are again the
                        ruling power in this country. The Republicans know this and are, on all
                        sides, by moderating their proscriptions, endeavoring to secure a permanent
                        hold of power. Every argument and device will be used to secure this. Look
                        to it then and be not deceived by tempting baits or rallying cries but rest
                        assured that the opponents of Republicanism, will, in a few brief years,
                        control this country and make the government, (in strict subjection to the
                        Constitution) really the "best government the world ever saw."</p>

                        suppose they did, representative men at each precinct. At any rate, all the

                        course, the friends of defeated candidates will do likewise.</p>
                    <p>The County Convention was a part and parcel of the Conservative organization
                        of the State. The County contest is but a skirmish preceding the great
                        battle to take place in the next election of State officers.--It therefore
                        behooves all Conservatives to give their cordial support to the
                            Consevative nominees for county offices, and thus perfect the
                        Conservative organization, in order to present an united front in opposition
                        to Republicanism in future elections.</p>

<b>For the Vindicator</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Observer" complains about the practice of forcing pupils of Staunton's
                    female schools to entrust their money to principals and teachers for purchase of
                    goods in town. This results in one or two businesses fielding all the purchase
                    requests from "two or three hundred young ladies." Allowing students to travel
                    to town to make their own purchases would increase competition and the
                    distribution of patronage. "Why not allow one or more of the teachers to
                    accompany their pupils to the several stores, and wherever their money can be
                    most judiciously expended, let it be done."<br>

<b>Augusta County Fair--A New Feature</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports with excitement that a herd of thorough-bred cattle from
                    Hardy County will be brought to Augusta to be sold at the fair. "Growing
                    thorough-bred cattle, horses, sheep and hogs may be regarded as the agricultural
                    'fine arts,' and we hope the day is not far distant when our Valley, and
                    especially our county, will be celebrated for its success in this attractive
                    department of industry."<br>

<b>Terrible Freshet</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Heavy rains caused Augusta's creeks and rivers to rise and overflow their

                    Staunton. "Houses were swept away and even Masonry, compactly put up, and had
                    stood the test of many freshets, was swept away as though it were a wooden
                    structure." The bridges over Main Street, near the railroad bridge, and near the
                    American Hotel were destroyed or badly damaged. A party of men rescued James
                    Teabo from the flood. Several bridges of the C. and O. Railroad were destroyed,
                    including those near Waynesboro, Goose Creek, Christian's Creek, and Swoope's.
                    Two trains are stuck on the tracks. No train will run into Staunton for eight to
                    ten days, and all telegraphic communication is out.<br>(Names in announcement:  James Teabo,  John B. SchererJr.,  Richard May,  Thomas P. Eskridge,   Parker,   Stafford,   Rice,   Echols)</blockquote>
