                    <p>John F. Lewis our U. S. Senator, elected by and as the nominee of the
                        conservatives of the Legislature, seems to take every opportunity to exhibit
                        his ultra opposition to the Southern people. Allied actively with the ultras
                        in Congress, meddling with the elections in Washington, threatening the
                        Republicans in the Virginia Legislature, or opposing the nomination of
                        Akerman of Georgia, because he served on Toombs' staff, while he for the
                        same reason took a Confederate contract to make the iron, which dealt death
                        and destruction to the ranks of his friends, he exhibits the same ultra
                        Radicalism, and is not by any means the Representative of the sentiments of
                        the State in the U. S. Senate. His pride should induce him to relinquish the
                        position he holds and in which he must know that he misrepresents his
                        people. Has not our Legislature sufficient back-bone to request him to
                        resign?</p>
