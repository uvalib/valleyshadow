                    committees to solicit donations. Public meetings will also be held to form
                    relief committees and raise funds. The clergy and the Young Men's Christian
                    Association are also called upon to help. The money raised should go to the
                    governor who will distribute it where needed.</summary>

                    <p>FELLOW CITIZENS:--In coming before you as an independent candidate for the
                        next Congress, it is necessary that I state some of the reasons which have
                        influenced me in assuming the position which I have thought proper to take;
                        and as the shortness of time between this and the day of election renders it
                        impossible for me to visit all the counties in so large a District, I beg
                        leave also to say something of myself through this medium.</p>
                    <p>I should cheerfully have submitted to the decision of the Harrisonburg
                        Convention which nominated Judge John T. Harris, if I believed he was the
                        choice of a majority of the Conservative votes of the District;--but as
                        several of the counties were not represented at all, and others
                        misrepresented in that Convention, and from what I know of the wishes of the
                        people in a large portion of the District, I am forced to the conclusion
                        that he was not their choice, and in a properly constituted Convention would
                        not have received the nomination. Holding these views, I claim the right
                        which belongs to every citizen, who is freed from political disabilities, of
                        offering myself as a candidate for your suffrages; and it is for you to say
                        whether or not I am entitled to your confidence and support. WIth Judge
                        Harris I am not disposed to make either personal or political issue,
                        desiring that the people decide kindly and peacefully between us as to whom
                        they prefer for the office which we both seek. In speaking of myself I will
                        simply say, that I am a farmer, and have never been in political harness;
                        that before the war I was a Whig, and am now what is termed a "Conservative
                        Whig," and am opposed to Radicalism in all its forms. I joined the army in
                        defence of Southern rights in the beginning of the late war, and served in
                        the field as long as I had the physical ability to do so; and for the
                        remainder of the four years, I devoted myself, with all the force and energy
                        I possessed, in raising supplies for the soldiers and their wives, <emph
                            rend="italic">which they received</emph>. I was born and raised on
                        Virginia soil and yield to no man in devotion to her; and, if elected, will
                        do all in my power to promote her interests.</p>
                    <p>I am more disposed to exert myself in behalf of the material interests of
                        Virginia, than to meddle with Federal <sic>polititics</sic>, but whenever
                        political issues are forced upon me, I expect to co-operate with the great
                        Democratic party of the North as being the only party that is likely to
                        favor the South. If you elect me, I give you the honest pledge of an honest
                        man, that I will serve you and my State with an earnest devotion, striving
                        hard to do credit to my constituents and to myself as the representative of
                        our lovely Valley.</p>

                    <p>HARRISONBURG, VA., Oct. 31, 1870.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Fellow-Citizens</emph>:--A few days since I announced
                        myself as an independent candidate for Congress. Since I issued my first
                        address I have visited various portions of the District and have been
                        received with the warmest manifestations of favor by the people. Gentlemen,
                        I have but little more to say to you. I have already told you that I am not
                        a politician and have never worn political harness. I have offered myself as
                        a candidate because of the outrageous frauds perpetrated on the people by
                        the <emph rend="italic">so-called</emph> Convention, held at Harrisonburg on
                        the 13th inst. That body admitted representatives without authority from the
                        people and manufactured delegates who had no authority to bind the people.</p>
                    <p>In Botetourt, my own county, the wishes of my people were outrageously
                        misrepresented and the true representative men of the county were prevented
                        by the flood from attending the Convention. I believe that the farming,
                        laboring and practical interests of the District have a right to
                        representation, and I know that it is their wish to discard <emph
                            rend="italic">broken down professional politicians</emph>. I refer to my
                        record as a Southern man as a guarantee for my conduct, should you elect me
                        as your representative. The people have a right to choose and to them I
                        appeal! I have always been true to my people and section and have "no
                        recantations to make nor palinodes to sing." I neither ask or expect Radical
                        support and the enormous Conservative majority in the District--nearly
                        12000--precludes the possibility of the election of an OPEN Radical
                        candidate with but three candidates in the field.</p>
                    <p>I come before you as an out and out Conservative, and as such am willing to
                        stand or fall.</p>
                    <p>I am of Virginia, with Virginia, for Virginia, first, last and all the time.</p>
                    <p>If I cannot be elected as a true and uncompromising representative of the
                        best interests of our native State, I do not desire to be elected at all.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>If you wish to know how John T. Harris got to be the Candidate of the
                        Harrisonburg Convention, read the following facts:</p>
                    <p>You all know that the Convention was held at a time when the great flood had
                        compelled the people of our unfortunate Valley to forget politics for the
                        time, and when all the ordinary means of travel were broken up, and that
                        many counties could not hold meetings, and others were deprived of
                        representation in the Convention by the high water and broken
                        communications.</p>
                    <p>Botetourt county had elected six delegates to the Convention, only one of
                        whom came, and contrary to the sentiment of his people, voted for John T
                        Harris, though he was instructed by his five colleagues to vote against
                        Harris under all circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Rockbridge selected five Delegates, who were committed to vote against
                        Harris, none of whom succeeded in getting to the Convention. But when two
                        gentlemen from that county presented themselves and asked to be admitted as
                        Delegates, the Convention passed a resolution that they were not entitled to
                        their seats; and in the next breath admitted them into the Convention; thus
                        creating delegates for an entire county. And the result was, that while one
                        of them voted against Harris on every ballot, the other voted one half of
                        Rockbridge county, 1060 votes for John T. Harris.</p>
                    <p>Alleghany was represented by the same one man, Dr. Graham, of Rockbridge, who
                        voted the entire county for Harris, by what authority the people of
                        Alleghany will answer at the polls.</p>
                    <p>Bath county was not represented at all.</p>
                    <p>Highland was not represented at all. Although a gentleman from that county
                        asked admission on the same principle and rule that had admitted the two
                        gentlemen from Rockbridge. This Highland man was excluded, he was not a
                        Harris man.</p>
                    <p>From one Township in Rockingham, a double delegation was admitted, one
                        anti-Harris, the other principally for Harris.--The first named was reported
                        by the committee on credentials as the regular delegation, the other by
                        being admitted, killed the vote of that Township, and gave Harris a strength
                        to which he was not entitled.</p>
                    <p>Page was represented by a delegate appointed by a warm Harris man, on the
                        recommendation of four gentlemen appointed by this same Harris man to
                        recommend delegates. This gentleman, who appointed the Page delegates was
                        himself a delegate in the Convention, nominated Harris, and voted on every
                        ballot for John T. Harris.</p>
                    <p>But two delegates from Warren reached the Convention, and they on the final
                        vote cast the entire vote of Warren for John T. Harris and against Giles
                        Cook, the most popular citizen of Warren county.</p>
                    <p>Two delegates from one township in Shenandoah who participated in the
                        Convention were appointed without authority from the people, by a gentleman
                        who had acted as chairman of a meeting held some time before. They were
                        admitted, however, into the Convention and voted for Harris.</p>
                    <p>Two Townships from this county were not represented at all.</p>
                    <p>Clarke had but two delegates in the Convention; they voted on every ballot
                        the wishes of their people, and against Harris, but were powerless.</p>
                    <p>Frederick sent four delegates, three of whom faithfully represented that
                        county, as shown by the last election, but they were unable to resist the
                        flood tide of Harris men who had gotten into the Convention.</p>
                    <p>This then, gentlemen, is the Convention whose action you are asked to
                        endorse, and whose nominee you are asked to support in the face of the fact
                        that his name was on the Radical Wells negro ticket only two years ago for
                        Congress in part of this District, at least and he was beaten overwhelmingly
                        by a stranger from Pennsylvania, who although unknown, was less
                        objectionable than this man John T. Harris to the Conservative people of the
                        Valley.</p>
                    <p>Without the vote of any one of the counties that voted for him, Harris could
                        not have been the nominee; he is, therefore, the candidate not of the
                        Districts, nor of a majority of it, but a minority nominee in every sense of
                        the word.</p>
                    <p>This man Harris, in 1868, ran against the Democratic nominee of a regular
                        Convention of the party he claimed to belong to. Will the people now
                        hesitate between Harris and Col. Corbin M. Reynolds, a true Conservative
                        Virginian who has never deceived them, and a gallant soldier who has shown
                        his devotion on the battle fields of Virginia.</p>

                        thousand eight hundred and ninety six (16,896.) The radical vote cast for
                        Wells being only five thousand three hundred and fifty three (5,353) when
                        the entire strength of the Radicals was <emph rend="italic"
                        >exhibited</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Then we see at once that Conservatives outnumber the Radicals by more than
                        three to one. If then the Conservative vote should be exactly split as
                        between Reynolds and Harris, each would receive 8,448 votes, and if Gray
                        should get the whole radical vote, that is 5,353 votes, the majority of
                        either Reynolds or Harris over Gray would be three thousand and ninety-five
                        votes(3,095).</p>
                    <p>It is then obvious, <emph rend="italic">beyond question</emph>, that although
                        both Reynolds and Harris are in the field, there is not the slightest danger
                        of Gray being elected.</p>
                    <p>All that the Conservatives have to do is, to rally to the polls, and vote for
                        their choice.</p>
                    <p>If fealty to a nominee is regarded the <emph rend="italic">watch-word</emph>
                        of Harris and his friends in this instance, to whom may his opponents look
                        for a startling precedent of utter disregard of the action of a fully
                        organized Convention, held in the town of Harrisonburg in the Spring of
                        1859, in which Col. James H. Skinner was triumphantly declared the choice of
                        that Convention?</p>
                    <p>Answer. To John T. Harris is due the honor of such precedent, and to John T.
                        Harris is due all of the consequences resulting from his treachery to a
                        party to which he had theretofore declared eternal fidelity.</p>
                    <p>Upon that occasion the present DISTINGUISHED nominee boasted that, "he had
                        throttled and killed King Caucus." Now in all charity I ask, will he and his
                        supporters not allow a like privilege to others? Oh, consistency!
                        consistency! what a jewel thou art, and how I would that the world could
                        embrace thee as with "hooks of Steel" to her inmost bosom. May God send the
                        day when honest men may at last look for consistency upon the part of their
                        fellows.</p>
                    <p>By the removal of disabilities the Conservative vote of the District has been
                        increased some 1500 or 2000.</p>
