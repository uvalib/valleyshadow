<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The power of the country, due to the results of the war, until a short time
                        since, seemed to be irretrievably in the hands of the Republican party for
                        years to come, much to the regret of those who witnessed the extravagances,
                        persecutions and proscriptions of that party, and who longed for the return
                        to that economical management of public affairs, which marked the history of
                        public functionaries until the Republican party came in power, and that
                        liberty to the individual citizen which made the United States the proud
                        boast of all peoples and the asylum for the oppressed of all countries and
                        climes. This very belief in its long-lease of power has prevented the
                        Republican party from practicing that economy, so boasted by its military
                        leader, on his elevation to the Presidency, and has led it into the
                        extravagances and persecutions which have so markedly characterized it. It
                        has signally failed, therefore, to fulfill the mission of a party in power
                        in peaceful times, and its extravagances have disgusted Republicans,
                        themselves, who calmly considered the results in the future. Hence the
                        internal feuds of the party, which must result in its loss of power and
                        ultimate utter overthrow.</p>
                    <p>Will these feuds result in a new or third party? There is not the least
                        likelihood of it. We see that some of our exchanges speak of a National
                        Conservative party, similar to the Conservative party of Virginia, to
                        accomplish the overthrow of the National Republican party. This is simply a
                        repugnance to the name Democrat, and will amount to nothing. The Democratic
                        party has been nobly contending against the Republican party for years and
                        has never succumbed to any third party, even in its days of greatest
                        adversity, and now, upon the threshold of almost certain triumph, its giving
                        place to a third party to accomplish the end, almost already attained by it,
                        is not to be expected, and will not be by those who take a calm retrospect
                        of the long struggle between Democracy and Radicalism. Besides this, the
                        very principles contended for by the several reform feuds have been
                        advocated by the Democracy, and with the success that has attended the party
                        of late. In it then the reformers find their objects combined and it is not
                        likely they will attempt the formation of a third party, to do over the work
                        accomplished by the Democracy since the war. It is, therefore, utter folly
                        to advocate a third party and only argues a prejudiced enmity to the mere
                        name of Democracy. This film is clearly seen through, and those who really
                        desire the overthrow of Radicalism would do well to discard their prejudice
                        and unite with the Democracy.--Whether they do or not, the Democratic party
                        will, at no very distant day, win that success which it has so long
                        contended for. The Republican party will go down, but it will not be by the
                        aid of a new or third party. It will be before that party, which has won the
                        victory in the late elections.--It will be before the Democratic party,
                        which contains the principles necessary to unite the reformers in its fold,
                        and all the elements necessary to secure success, besides the prestige of
                        its recent victories.</p>
                    <p>Be ye prejudiced ones warned in time, and join the victorious column of
                        Democracy, and wait for your third party until Radicalism sinks into its
                        already deeply dug grave.</p>
