                    <p>A meeting of the Stockholders of the First National Bank of Staunton was
                        held, on Thursday last and the proxies being right <emph rend="italic">this
                            time</emph>, the election of a Board of Directors took place. On motion
                        of the Cashier, so we are informed, the old Board was re-elected. The
                        reduction of the large salary of the Cashier, $3,000, was not suggested by
                        any member of the Board and consequently, by silence on this subject, the
                        previous action of the Board was ratified, and the salary of the Cashier
                        left at $3,000.</p>
                    <p>The election of the old Board of Directors, just as it stood when they voted,
                        4 to 3, to raise the salary of their Cashier from $2,500 to $3,000, removes
                        the cause of complaint, we have heretofore noticed, from the shoulders of
                        the Directory and places it upon those of the Stockholders. They have
                        virtually endorsed the action of the Board of Directors and would have us
                        understand thereby that they intend to run that Institution so as to make
                        the most they can, regardless of the interests or necessities of the public.
                        If you want money at their counter you must buy it, you can't borrow, for,
                        to receive fair rates from borrowers, they could not pay their officers and
                        other expenses now, and hence you must buy it, that is, if from 2 to 5 <emph
                            rend="italic">per cent</emph> per month is buying. A favored few may get
                        money--and even large amounts--at a fair rate <emph rend="italic">per
                        cent</emph>, but the <emph rend="italic">hoi polloi</emph>, the multitude,
                        who really need it, must pay the piper.</p>
                    <p>The Stockholders are certainly ignorant of the condition of affairs, or else
                        very callous as to the interest of our people and even themselves. They do
                        not seem to understand that a reduction in the deposit line from $108,000 to
                        $77,000 means anything, or else they think that the people are bound to or
                        will deposit with them ultimately, no matter to what excesses they run. We
                        say to them that they are mistaken. The reason for the decline in their
                        deposits to $77,000, will be the reason for a further decline. Parties will
                        not deposit with you, when you, as all must conclude, exhibit your
                        determination to fleece their neighbors who may need accommodation, and even
                        themselves should their necessities require more than they have on deposit.</p>
                    <p>This now is patent to the reflecting ones, and those who deposit their money
                        in the First National Bank of Staunton, if they see the drift of its course,
                        become <emph rend="italic">particepscriminis</emph>. Without your deposits,
                        it cuts with a Jack-Knife, but with your deposits it erects a
                    Guillotine.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>In our last issue we took the ground that political divisions among our
                        people was to be regretted at this time, when Virginia's pecuniary
                        advancement requires the undivided effort of her entire people--that the
                        stake was Virginia's greatest possible prosperity, to secure which we must
                        as one man put our shoulders to the wheel, and, without any distracting
                        divisions among ourselves, give a "long shove, a strong shove and a shove
                        all together," if we would start the old State rapidly along the road of
                        progress and prosperity. We do not as yet let go of that opinion, but
                        circumstance may drive us from our position.</p>
                    <p>We see, since our last issue, that the gentlemen, who represent reconstructed
                        Virginia in Washington, with one or two exceptions, do not rest content with
                        merely representing us in Congress. They are striking out for a stronger
                        hold on the people. They want to continue in place and perquisites, and feel
                        that to do this they must lead off with a party which will win, and continue
                        to win. They are striving to build up the Radical party by consolidating the
                        three divisions of the Republican party, as they term it, in this State.
                        They have prepared "a call for a convention at Richmond; on a day yet to be
                        named," and they have called on President Grant, to secure the influence of
                        the Government in Radicalizing Virginia. At least this is what the
                        Associated Press Dispatches from Washington report.</p>
                    <p>In their opinion, those who voted for Walker can be thimble-rigged into the
                        consolidated party, along with the two divisions into which Radicalism in
                        Virginia separated. We think they err most seriously just here. The men who
                        supported Walker, in the main, had been allied with the conservative
                        organization and, when the Withers ticket was withdrawn, took Walker as the
                        lesser of <sic>too</sic> evils. They were very far from uniting with the
                        Republican party, although they voted for Walker. They were the main, if not
                        the entire strength of the Walker support, and could just as easily, with
                        the same effort, have elected Withers, had it been thought advisable. They
                        are today as much opposed to Republicanism as when they united and organized
                        the conservative party to defeat Republicanism in Virginia. They are dormant
                        just now because they do not see the necessity for political strifes, but if
                        Senator Lewis and Representatives Platte, Ayer, Booker and others force the
                        issue, they will be as firm to their opposition to Republicanism and will as
                        cordially unite with whatever party can most successfully put them down as
                        they did to secure the lesser of evils in Walker.</p>
                    <p>That the course of the above named gentlemen will, if continued bring into
                        life and vigor, in this State, the old Democratic party, which alone of the
                        two old parties, has maintained its organization in the North in opposition
                        to Radicalism, is plain to all who notice the signs of the times.</p>
                    <p>It will hardly need a seer to prophecy what side the old time Whigs and
                        Democrats of the State will take when that issue is joined. They will be
                        found side by side in the old Democratic coach, at least, until all damaging
                        opposition is driven from the track, and then they may separate and ride in
                        conservative competing lines as in days long since.</p>
                    <p>We repent again that we would regret divisions among us at present, but may
                        for the best interests of our people be necessitated to summon them to rally
                        around the old Democratic flag, which flaunted so long at the head of these
                        columns, and under whose standard bearers the country and people progressed
                        and prospered. Should our Representatives in Washington continue to force
                        the issue, it will not be from necessity alone but with a hearty good will
                        we will enter the lists. Virginians are not to be thimble-rigged into this
                        place or that, and Virginia will teach her Senators and Representatives a
                        lesson, to attend carefully to the interests committed to them and leave
                        other matters where they belong, in the hands of the people themselves.</p>

                    in the state insist on flaunting partisan issues, the editor urges all
                    conservative voters to rally around the Democratic banner and oust the
                    Republicans from office.</summary>

                    location in the center of iron country makes it well suited to develop industry.
