<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Secretary Stanton, in his report, December, 1865, gave us the cost of the War
                        Department for peace organization, the sum of thirty-three millions of
                        dollars a year.--From official records it is shown that the War Department,
                        in three years since the close of the war, has cost six hundred and ten
                        millions of dollars, or more than six times the estimate of Secretary
                        Stanton.--The excess of expenditures over the Secretary's estimate is owing
                        to the extravagance of the Radical Congress. This body of desperate
                        political gamesters vote away the public money as if there was no bottom to
                        the public purse. They vote it and their friends get it
                            and divide with them. They vote it out of the Treasury in order
                        that a portion of it may find its way into their own pockets. Congress is
                        full of these thieves, who are in partnership with the contractors. Six
                        hundred and ten millions spent on the army in three years of peace! If
                        Stanton's estimate of the amount necessary was correct--thirty-three
                        millions per year--the thieving contractors and their thieving partners in
                        Congress have stolen five hundred and eleven millions out of the War
                        Department in three years! Is it not time to turn out the thieves?</p>

<b>The Debt Increasing</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Calls for the ouster of Republicans in the next election because of the
                    increasing debt amounted under Radical rule and the inevitable increase in
                    taxation which would follow another Republican administration.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If they had done nothing else that demanded the condemnation of the people,
                        the Radicals ought to be turned out of power for increasing the public debt
                        in time of profound peace. The official monthly report of Secretary
                        McCulloch shows that the public debt increased twelve
                            millions of dollars during the month of August just past. This is
                        at the rate of one hundred and forty-four millions per annum. If we give the
                        Radicals another lease of power and they increase the debt at the same rate
                        every year, we shall have five hundred and seventy-six millions of dollars
                        added to the public debt during the next Presidential term.</p>
                    <p>This increase of debt would render increased taxation necessary, in order to
                        avoid repudiation. Now is it possible for the people to stand an increase of
                        taxation? Are they not already taxed to the farthest limit of endurance?
                        These are questions which the people can answer for themselves. They ought
                        to consider well before they answer through the ballot box, for their answer
                        will stand for four years. They may rue it in three months, but there will
                        then be no taking it back.</p>
                    <p>It behooves the people of Franklin county especially to consider well this
                        matter of debt and taxation. After all that they have lost in the last six
                        years, they can poorly afford to pay the taxes levied on them at present.
                        Can they afford to have their taxes increased? They
                            cannot: but even if they could, they ought not to consent to it
                        when they know that the money is wasted on worthless negroes in the
                    South.</p>

                    <p>The following correspondence fully explains the purpose of Gen. Rosecrans'
                        late visit to the Virginia White Sulphur Springs, in relation to which there
                        has been so much newspaper gossip. The correspondence exhibits in a very
                        clear light the sentiments and disposition of the intelligence of the South,
                        and ought to act as an antidote to the poisonous slander of the Radical
                        press, which continually misrepresents and falsifies them:</p>
                    <p>WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W. VA.,<br> August 26, 1868.</p>
                    <p>GENERAL: Full of solicitude for the future of our country, I come with my
                        heart in my hand to learn the condition, wishes, and intentions of the
                        people of the Southern States--especially to ascertain the sentiments of
                        that body of brave, energetic, and self-sacrificing men who, after
                        sustaining the confederacy for four years, laid down their arms and swore
                        allegiance to the government of the United States, whose trusted and beloved
                        leader you have been.</p>
                    <p>I see that interpreting "State rights" to conflict with national unity has
                        produced a violent reaction against them, which is drifting us toward
                        consolidation; and also that so great a country as ours even now
                        is--certainly is to be--must have State governments to attend to local
                        details, or go farther and fare worse.</p>
                    <p>It is plain to us at the West and the North that the continuance of
                        semi-anarchy, such as has existed for the last three years in ten States of
                        our Union, largely increases the danger of concentration, swells our
                        national expenditures, diminishes our productions and our revenue, inspires
                        doubts of our political and financial stability, depreciates the value of
                        our national bonds and currency, and places the credit of the richest below
                        that of the poorest nation in Christendom.</p>
                    <p>We know that our currency must be depreciated so long as our bonds are below
                        par, and that therefore the vast business and commerce of our country must
                        suffer the terrible evil of a fluctuating standard of value, until we can
                        remedy the evil condition of things at the South. We also see other mischief
                        quite as possible if not probable to arise--such as from a failure of crops,
                        a local insurrection, and many other unforeseen contingencies--which may
                        still depreciate our credit and currency, provoke discontent and disorder
                        among our people, and bring demagogical agitation, revolution, repudiation,
                        and a thousand unnamed villaines upon us. We know that the
                        interests of the people of the South are for law and order, and that they
                        must share our fate for good and ill.</p>
                    <p>I believe--every one I know who reflects believes--that if the people of the
                        Southern States could be at peace, and their energy and good will be
                        heartily applied to repair the wastes of war, reorganize their business, set
                        the freedmen peacefully, prosperously, and contentedly at work: invite
                        capital, enterprise, and labor from elsewhere to come freely amongst them,
                        they would rebuild their ruined fortunes, multiply manifold the value of
                        their lands, establish public confidence in our political stability, bring
                        our government bonds to premium, our currency to a gold standard, and assure
                        for themselves and the whole nation a most happy and prosperous future.</p>
                    <p>Seeing this, and how all just interests concur in the work, I ask the
                        officers and soldiers who fought for the Union--every thinking man of the
                        great West and North asks--why it cannot be done?</p>
                    <p>We are told by those who have controlled the Government for the last four
                        years that the people of the South will not do it; that, if ever done at
                        all, it must be done by the poor, simple, uneducated, landless freedmen and
                        the few whites who, against the public opinion and sentiment of the
                        intelligent white people, are willing to attempt to lead and make their
                        living off the ignorant, inexperienced colored people, mostly men who must
                        be needy adventurers, or without any of those attributes on which reliance
                        for good guidance or government can be placed. We are told that this kind of
                        government must be continued at the South until six or eight millions of
                        intelligent, energetic white people give into it or move out of the country.</p>
                    <p>Now, I think, the Union army thinks, and the people of the North and West I
                        dare say believe, there must be, or there ought to be, a shorter, surer way
                        to get good government for all at the South.</p>
                    <p>We know that they who organized and sustained the Southern confederacy for
                        four years, against gigantic efforts, ought to be able to give peace, law,
                        order, and protection to the whole people of the South.</p>
                    <p>They have the interest and the power to employ, protect, educate, and elevate
                        the poor freedmen and to restore themselves and our country to all the
                        blessings of which I have just spoken. The question we want answered is:
                        "Are they willing to do it?"</p>
                    <p>I came down to find out what the people of the South think of this, and to
                        ask you what the officers and soldiers who served in the confederate army
                        and the leading people who sustained it think of these things.</p>
                    <p>I came to ask more; I want to ask you, in whose purity and patriotism I here
                        express unqualified confidence, and so many good men as you can conveniently
                        consult, to say what you think of it, and also what you are willing to do
                        about.</p>
                    <p>I want a written expression of views that can be followed by a concurrence of
                        action. I want to know if you and the gentlemen who will join you in that
                        written expression are willing to pledge the people of the South to a
                        chivalrous and magnanimous devotion to restoring peace and prosperity to our
                        common country. I want to carry that pledge, high above the level of party
                        politics, to the late officers and soldiers of the Union army and the people
                        of the North and West, and to ask them to consider it and to take the
                        necessary action, confident that it will meet with a responce so
                        warm, so generous and confiding, that we shall see in its sunshine the
                        rainbow of peace in our political sky, now black with clouds and impending
                        storm.</p>
                    <p>I know you are a representative man, in reverence and regard for the Union,
                        the Constitution, and the welfare of the country, and that what you would
                        say would be endorsed by nine-tenths of the whole people of the South; but I
                        should like to have the signatures of all the representative Southern men
                        here who concur in your views, and expressions of their concurrence from the
                        principal officers and representative men throughout the South when they can
                        be procured.</p>
                    <p>This concurrence of opinions and wills, all tending to peace, order, and
                        stability, will assure our Union soldiers and business men, who want
                        substantial and solid peace, and cause them to rise above the level of party
                        politics, and take such steps to meet yours as will insure a lasting peace
                        with all its countless blessings.</p>
                    <p>Very truly, your friend,<br> W.S. ROSECRANS</p>
                    <p>GEN. R. E. LEE, WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, WEST VIRGINIA</p>
                    <p>WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W. VA.<br> August 26, 1868.</p>
                    <p>GENERAL: I have had the honor to receive your letter of this date, and in
                        accordance with your suggestion, I have consulted with a number of gentlemen
                        from the South, in whose judgment I have confided, and who are well
                        acquainted with the public sentiments of their respective States. They have
                        kindly consented to unite with me in replying to your communication, and
                        their names will be found with my own appended to this answer. With this
                        explanation, we proceed to give you a candid statement of what we believe to
                        be the sentiment of the Southern people in regard to the subject to which
                        you refer.</p>
                    <p>Whatever opinion may have prevailed in the past in regard to African slavery
                        or the right of a State to secede from the Union, we believe we express the
                        almost unanimous judgment of the Southern people when we declare that they
                        consider that those questions were decided by the war, and that it is their
                        intention, in good faith, to abide by that decision. At the close of the war
                        the Southern people laid down their arms and sought to resume their former
                        relations with the United States Government.</p>
                    <p>Through their State conventions they abolished slavery and annulled their
                        ordinances of secession, and they returned to their peaceful pursuits with a
                        sincere purpose to fulfill their duties under the Constitution of the United
                        States which they had sworn to support. If their actions in these
                        particulars had been met in a spirit of frankness and cordiality, we believe
                        that ere this old irritation would have passed away and the wounds inflicted
                        by the war would in a great measure have been healed. As far as we are
                        advised, the people of the South entertain no unfriendly feeling toward the
                        Government of the United States, but they complain that their rights under
                        the Constitution are withheld from them in the administration thereof.</p>
                    <p>The idea that the Southern people are hostile to the negroes, and would
                        oppress them if it were in their power to do so, is entirely unfounded. They
                        have grown up in our midst, and we have been accustomed from our childhood
                        to look upon them with kindness. The change in relations of the two races
                        has wrought no change in our feeling toward them. They still constitute the
                        important part of our laboring population. Without their labor the lands of
                        the South would be comparatively unproductive. Without the employment which
                        Southern agriculture affords they would be destitute of the means of
                        subsistence, and become paupers, dependent upon public bounty.</p>
                    <p>Self-interest, even if there were no higher motives, would therefore prompt
                        the whites of the South to extend to the negroes care and protection. The
                        important fact that the two races are, under existing circumstances,
                        necessary to each other, is gradually becoming apparent to both; and we
                        believe, but for influences exerted to stir up the passions of the negroes,
                        the relations of the two races would soon adjust themselves on a basis of
                        kindness and advantage.</p>
                    <p>It is true that the people of the South, together with the people of the
                        North and West, are, for obvious reasons, opposed to any system of laws
                        which would place the political power of the country in the hands of the
                        negro race. But the opposition springs from no feeling of enmity, but from a
                        deep-seated conviction that at present the negroes have neither the
                        intelligence nor the qualifications which are necessary to make them safe
                        depositaries of political power. They would inevitably become the victims of
                        demagogues, who, for selfish purposes, would mislead them to the serious
                        injury of the public.</p>
                    <p>The great want of the South is peace. The people earnestly desire tranquility
                        and the restoration of the Union. They deprecate disorder and excitement as
                        the most serious obstacle to their prosperity.</p>
                    <p>They ask a restoration of their rights under the Constitution. They desire
                        relief from oppressive misrule. Above all, they would appeal to their
                        countrymen for the re-establishment in the Southern States of that which has
                        justly been regarded as the birthright of every American,the right of
                        self-government. Establish these on a firm basis and we can safely promise
                        on behalf of the southern people that they will faithfully obey the
                        Constitution and laws of the United States, treat the negro with kindness
                        and humanity, and fulfill every duty incumbent on peaceful citizens loyal to
                        the Constitution of their country.</p>
                    <p>We believe the above contains a succinct reply to the general topics embraced
                        in your letter, and we venture to say, on behalf of the Southern people and
                        of officers and soldiers of the late confederate army, that they will concur
                        in all the sentiments which we have expressed.</p>
