                    <p>"The administration is the Government." How this sentence carries our minds
                        back to the dark days of the rebellion! How well we all remember the answer
                        to the Democratic clamor against outrages upon American citizens, as it rang
                        out loud and clear from loyal throats--"The Administration is the
                        Government!" Times have changed since then, and men have changed with them.
                        So sacred was the person of the President in the estimation of the Loyal
                        Leaguers; so high was their appreciation of the authority of the Executive;
                        so reverential was their regard for his opinions and proclamations, that no
                        one was deemed worthy to unloose the latches of Mr. Lincoln's shoes, and the
                        place whereon he stood was thought holy ground. The occupant of the
                        Presidential chair--a man like unto other men--possessed of the weaknesses
                        of frail human nature, was looked upon as an oracle whose every word was
                        wisdom and whose slightest wish was law. What crimes were committed in the
                        name and by authority of "the Government!" When Republicans then spoke of
                        the government, they always meant the President. In him was centred all
                        power. If the Constitution was found silent as to the grant of certain
                        powers which it was desirable to exercise, Mr. Lincoln was assured that the
                        loyal hearts of the nation were in sympathy with him, and that loyal hands
                        would sustain him. Was it advisable to arrest a citizen? All the forms of
                        law were disregarded, and summary process was executed upon him. No warrant
                        was required. A military order was substituted. Was it expedient to suppress
                        a newspaper? Forthwith, some shoulder-strapped upstart with a file of
                        soldiers repaired to the office of the Editor, took him in charge, closed
                        the establishment and hurried its proprietor to one of the military
                        fortresses prepared for the reception of the nasty Copperheads. No
                        constitutional guarantee stood between the press and the tyranny of the
                        Executive. No protests were heeded. "The Administration was the Government,"
                        and everything was made to bend to its supreme authority. Never was any
                        country more completely subjected to the will of one man than was the
                        American Union to the will of Abraham Lincoln. No matter how violent the
                        measures he saw fit to adopt, his party ever stood ready to cry Amen. No
                        scheme was too wild, no stretch of power was too great, no punishment was
                        too severe. The nation surrendered itself, for the time, completely to the
                        guidance and power of Abraham Lincoln, and why not? For was he not the
                        government? Had he not sworn "to preserve, protect and defend the
                        Constitution?" And was he not to be the judge as to how that could best be
                        done? Certainly. The man who disputed that doctrine was a Copperhead--an
                        open enemy of his country.</p>
                    <p>Not only the misses of the people entertained this idea, but the rulers, and
                        persons who occupied the chief places in the loyal synagogues, vied with
                        each other to exhibit all possible respect for the Chief Executive. How high
                        was the estimation placed upon the Presidential office by that assembly of
                        loyal Governors in September 1862 at Altoona. At this day, when every effort
                        is being made to degrade the incumbent of that office and to rob the office
                        itself of its functions, how strangely reads the following which comes to us
                        from loyal Gubernatorial lips:</p>
                    <p>"We pledge without hesitation to the President of the United States, the most
                        loyal and cordial support, hereafter as heretofore, in the exercise of the
                        functions of his great office. We recognize in him the Chief Executive
                        Magistrate of the Nation, <emph rend="italic">the Commander in Chief of the
                            Army and Navy of the United States, their responsible and constitutional
                            head, whose rightful authority and power must be vigorously and
                            religiously guarded and preserved, as the condition on which all of our
                            form of government, and the constitutional rights and liberties of the
                            people themselves can be saved from the wreck of anarchy, or from the
                            rule of despotism.</emph>"</p>
                    <p>Go to the Senate of the United States, sitting as a High Court of
                        Impeachment, and you will find at least three of these loyal
                        Governors--Morton of Indiana, Yates of Illinois, and Sprague of Rhode
                        Island. What are they doing? They are engaged in the trial of Andrew
                        Johnson, President of the United States. They are sitting as his judges.
                        Surely they will "recognize in him the Chief Executive Magistrate of the
                        nation." Not so. They will not allow him the privilege and power of
                        selecting his Cabinet. They will not permit him to remove an officer in whom
                        he has no confidence. Certainly they will "recognize in him the
                        Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, their
                        responsible and constitutional head," &amp;c. Not so. They have assisted
                        in elevating Grant to a position of absolute superiority to the President.</p>
                    <p>Without doubt, they will see to it that "his rightful authority and power"
                        are "vigorously and religiously guarded and preserved." Not so. They are
                        seeking to limit his authority and restrain his power by unconstitutional
                        means, and plotting to remove him from office upon the flimsiest of all
                        possible pretexts and the silliest of all possible charges.</p>
                    <p>But the vigorous and religious guarding of "his rightful authority and power"
                        is <emph rend="italic">"the condition on which all of our form of
                            government, and the constitutional rights and liberties of the people
                            themselves, can be saved from the wreck of anarchy or from the rule of
                            despotism."</emph>! With what haste and eagerness did these loyal
                        Governors thus rush to the defence of the Executive when a long-suffering
                        people, at last grown impatient at the high-handed outrages committed by
                        authority of Mr. Lincoln, began to thunder their denunciation of his conduct
                        in his ears! The life of the Radical party then hung upon the maintenance of
                        the Executive even in the most palpable violations of the Constitution. Men
                        were thrown into dungeons without warrant--military commissions were
                        organized to murder them--all the dearest rights of American citizens were
                        wantonly invaded and trampled under foot; but not one of these, nor all,
                        constituted a "high crime or misdemeanor." "The President is the Government"
                        was the reply to every complaint--his will is law. The power of Abraham
                        Lincoln was as absolute as that of the Czar of Russia. Let the outrages
                        perpetrated in the name of "the government," by authority of Mr. Lincoln, be
                        written down and charged to the account of that martyred hero, and they will
                        form a record beside which the record of Andrew Johnson, as written by his
                        enemies in this impeachment trial, will seem as white as snow.</p>
                    <p>But times have changed, and men have changed with them. These loyal men no
                        longer think it necessary to guard vigorously and religiously the rightful
                        authority and power of the Chief Magistrate of the nation. They no longer
                        consider this as the condition by which we are to be saved "from the wreck
                        of anarchy or the rule of despotism." Andrew Johnson as President is not to
                        exercise the same authority that Abraham Lincoln did. He is entirely too
                        conservative. He does not sympathise with Radicalism. For this reason, the
                        principle that "the administration is the government" has been stricken from
                        Radical text-books. <emph rend="italic">Congress has become the
                        government.</emph> It is attempting to concentrate all power in itself. It
                        seeks to destroy, or at least to render powerless, both the Executive and
                        the Judiciary. And in order to make the Legislative Department supreme, it
                        intends to remove Andrew Johnson and put a man in his place who will be its
                        willing tool. Surely these loyal Governors, who made haste to tender their
                        earnest and cordial support to Mr. Lincoln, before they cast their votes
                        against Andrew Johnson, ought to read the address from which this passage is
                        quoted and to which they affixed their names. And having read, let them
                        strive to do justice in his case, remembering that the people, as Sydney
                        Smith has so well said, will praise, honor, and love the just judge, and
                        abhor, as the worst enemy of mankind, him who is placed there "to judge
                        after the law, and who smites contrary to the law."</p>

                <head>Let Us Have the Rail Road</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Our citizens should awake to the importance of securing a connection with
                        Waynesboro by rail road. A golden opportunity is now presented and it ought
                        not to be allowed to pass unimproved. If we have a tithe of the enterprise
                        left, which characterized our people after our beautiful town was laid in
                        ashes, we will see to it that we do not fail to realize the profits and
                        benefit of such a connection.</p>
                    <p>During the coming summer, there is little doubt but that a road will be built
                        from Waynesboro to some point on the Cumberland Valley Rail Road. A charter
                        has been secured--a route has been surveyed--the cost of building the road
                        has been ascertained, and, unless some counter movement is set on foot, the
                        probabilities are that the junction will be in the vicinity of Scotland.</p>
                    <p>The people of Chambersburg should not allow this if they have the power to
                        prevent it. The power--"the sinews of war"--the money is here in the hands
                        of certain men. Have they the inclination to use their power? That is the
                        important question. If they have, all they have to do is to say so, and the
                        road will be a thing of reality very soon. All that it needs the
                        encouragement and <sic>substantia</sic> aid of moneyed men at this end of
                        the line, for at the other end, money and enterprise are pushing it as
                        rapidly as it can be pushed. If the junction is made at Scotland, we are cut
                        off from the most wealthy section of our own county. By making this the
                        terminus of the road, we would bring to our very doors, a section of country
                        which, for fertility of soil, and density of population, can hardly be
                        surpassed in the State. The immense trade of these townships would be poured
                        into our coffers. All the products of their soil would find their way here
                        owing to the increased <unclear>facility</unclear> for transportation. Men
                        coming here to sell, would be sure to buy also. The exchange would be
                        mutually beneficial. Business would revive under its influence.</p>
                    <p>But neglect our interests in this respect--let the junction be made at
                        Scotland, and we lose all this. The trade of these townships will pass by
                        us. Shippensburg and Carlisle will reap the benefit of it. Grain dealers
                        there will buy and sell the grain of the richest portion of our County.
                        Merchants in those places will furnish our wealthiest farmers with
                        everything they need.--Nothing is more certain, for trade always runs in the
                        most convenient and easy channels.</p>
                    <p>Let our business men awake to the importance of this movement. Let our men of
                        capital make up their minds to employ some of it in this direction. We have
                        presented but one view of the subject. We have attempted only to show that
                        our own local interests are to be subserved by the building of this road. We
                        have done this for the reason that men are more likely to be incited to
                        action when they see that it is to their personal advantage to move, than
                        under any other circumstances. Let us have the road, then if for no other
                        reason than that it will bring more money into our pockets.</p>

                    <p>The election for Burgess and other Borough officers on Monday, brought out an
                        unusually large vote. The aggregate vote for Burgess was 848. The Radical
                        candidate was elected by the very uncomplimentary majority of 28.
                        Considerable "scratching" was done in voting for members of the Town
                        Council. The vote for Auditor is perhaps the best by which to judge of the
                        relative strength of the two parties. The Radical candidate has a majority
                        of 79. The result is exceedingly gratifying to the Democracy. It would have
                        been more so if we had elected our ticket. But this we did not expect. This
                        old Borough has of late years been considered good for the Radicals by from
                        150 to 200 majority. <emph rend="italic">But Radicalism is waning</emph>. On
                        the full vote of the Borough this fall, they will not beat us over a
                        hundred, and it will not surprise us if we carry the County by three
                        hundred. The following is the vote in detail:</p>

                    <p>We publish the following communication with great pleasure. We had no
                        intention, when we wrote our article of last week, to say anything that
                        would be offensive to the managers of the Bible Society, and we are glad to
                        find that no offence has been taken by the most prominent among them. We
                        thought the Report of the Society, as presented at the anniversary meeting,
                        indicated a state of inactivity which it might be well to disturb by a few
                        observations, somewhat pungent, but not designed to wound. The communication
                        annexed shows that the Report, though a fair exhibit of the work of the
                        Society, by no means covers all that has been done to put the printed gospel
                        in the hands of the destitute in this county.</p>

                        the part of the above Society, were perhaps deserved. It has certainly not
                        come up to the full measure of its duty. As a member of the executive
                        committee of that Society, I am quite willing to bear my full share of the
                        reproof, and the other members will doubtless be ready to acknowledge their
                        share of shortcomings with equal readiness and be disposed humbly to receive
                        reproof at the hands of those who have clearer apprehensions of duty,
                        greater zeal and vigor in this and every other good work. They would no
                        doubt join me in saying with a great and good man of old: "Let the righteous
                        smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let Him reprove me, it shall be an
                        excellent oil, which shall not break my head."</p>
                    <p>After freely and frankly admitting this much, it might perhaps still be a
                        question whether the writer, in his well-meant strictures, did exactly
                        perform that duty in the most perfect manner and in the spirit best
                        calculated to produce the desired result.--But we must remember that it is
                        the easiest thing in the world to see imperfections in our neighbors and to
                        overlook or palliate them in ourselves.</p>
                    <p>Had the writer of the strictures referred to, however, been aware of some or
                        all of the following facts, perhaps he would still have modified or softened
                        down some of his sentences:</p>
                    <p>1. The Franklin county Bible Society has had the subject of a new exploration
                        of the county under consideration. The usual period from one such effort to
                        another, is from 8 to 10 years. In the country the destination is
                        comparatively small, is easily ascertained and the destitution met.</p>
                    <p>2. In our own town there is, beside our own Society, the Female Bible
                        Society, who perform their full share of the duties of exploring and
                        supplying the destitute.</p>
                    <p>3. Then there are a number of Life Members of the State Bible Society, who
                        are entitled to an annual amount, each, of bibles, which these members
                        respectively distribute personally among those in need. So that a
                        considerable amount of work is performed by the members of the several
                        organizations in an unofficial or informal way, of which no official account
                        is taken. This may also be regarded as some evidence that the members of the
                        Society are not so <emph rend="italic">very</emph> anxious to make "a
                        display" as is intimated, or else they might have filled up their report in
                        a somewhat more showy manner.</p>
                    <p>4. There are, moreover, Bible Societies in Greencastle and
                        Mercersburg--consequently our field of operations is not as extensive as
                        some may be led to suppose.</p>
                    <p>This is not intended as a full or even partial justification of the members
                        or officers of the Society. Let our delinquencies be reproved--but we do beg
                        that it be done with some degree of justice and kindness. "Strike, but hear
                        me."</p>
                    <p>And now let me say, if any of our friends know of any Bible destitution, we
                        shall be glad to be informed of it, in order to remedy it. And if any, in
                        the vigor and ardor of their zeal, are willing to give a helping hand in
                        this work, by threading the lanes and alleys of our town and its suburbs, we
                        shall be most happy to welcome them as collaborators and <emph rend="italic"
                            >go with them</emph>, <emph rend="italic">work</emph> with them, <emph
                            rend="italic">learn</emph> of them or do any thing in order <emph
                            rend="italic">that we may do better hereafter</emph>. We have "grown
                        old" as a Society, and some of us have also grown old individually--perhaps
                        too old for vigorous service, although not so old, it is hoped, as to lack
                        the disposition to work.</p>

                    criticism from a Valley Spirit article from a week before. The article gives
                    some reasons for the Society's apparent slowness in distributing bibles and
