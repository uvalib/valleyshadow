<b>The Registry Law</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Points out several flaws in the new Registry Law recently passed by the
                    Legislature. Has particular trouble with section nine, which it feels can lead
                    to more fraud since only a few miscreants can potentially cause the cancellation
                    of an entire district's vote. Also has problems with the time of poll-closing
                    since it seems to disfavor workers.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In our issue of last week we published the Registry Law passed by our State
                        Legislature, and promised to point out some of its objectionable features in
                        this number of our paper. We have not found time to examine it as closely as
                        we desired, but such examination as we have been enabled to give it has
                        confirmed the unfavorable impression produced by our first reading of it. It
                        sets up a good deal of new machinery in connection with our elections, and
                        seems to have for one of its objects the giving as much trouble as possible
                        to persons claiming the right to vote. Naturalized citizens are required to
                        exhibit their certificates of naturalization to the assessor first, before
                        their name can be put on the list of voters, unless they shall have voted in
                        the same district at five preceding general elections; and then they must
                        produce the same certificates to the election officers when they offer to
                        vote, and must submit to have the fact of their voting recorded on the
                        certificate every time they vote, with the date. This is a fresh outcropping
                        of the old spirit of Know Nothingism. It is an insult to our naturalized
                        citizens, making an invidious distinction between them and native-born
                        citizens. It says to the foreign-born voter, "You are so much more addicted
                        to fraudulent voting than the native-born voter, that we must require you to
                        produce proof of you honesty whenever you offer to vote."</p>
                    <p>The ninth section, giving power to the courts, on the petition of five or
                        more citizens of the county, stating under oath that they believe frauds
                        will be practiced at the election about to be held in any district, to
                        appoint two persons to set as overseers at said election, though on its face
                        apparently well intentioned, is perhaps the worst part of the bill. It is
                        provided that if such overseers "shall be driven away from the polls by
                        violence or intimidation, all the votes polled at such election district
                        shall be rejected by any tribunal trying a contest under said election."
                        This puts it in the power of two officers or "overseers" to stifle the voice
                        of the people of any district in which they may be appointed. Take a
                        district that gives a very heavy majority, no matter for which party. Five
                        members of the minority party apply to the court for the appointment of
                        overseers, and they are appointed. Before the polls close, substantial reasons are given to them why they
                        should be "driven away from the polls by violence or intimidation;" half a
                        dozen "roughs" kick up a row and threaten the overseers, who become intimidated ("agreeably to the act of Assembly in
                        such cases made and provided,") and leave the ground; the election is
                        contested, the whole vote of the district is thrown out, and five hundred or
                        a thousand legal voters are virtually disfranchised through the rascality of
                        half a dozen persons, two of whom are overseers appointed by the court. In
                        this way Legislative and Congressional districts might be carried by the
                        minority, as the vote of a single district giving a large majority often
                        determines the result. This section holds out great inducements to fraud,
                        and will, we think, add to the already deplorable corruption of our
                        elections.</p>
                    <p>The law requires the polls everywhere to be closed at six o'clock in the
                        evening. This will compel mechanics and working men to sacrifice at least a
                        part of their day's wages or lose their votes. Six o'clock is the usual time
                        for quitting work, and if the polls were kept open till seven or eight, the
                        working men(except such as live miles away from the place of voting) could
                        finish out their day and still reach the polls before they closed. This "six
                        o'clock" provision of the law is calculated, as it may have been designed,
                        to give manufacturers and other employers closer control of their workmen.
                        If the employer finds that his workmen are disposed to vote contrary to his
                        views, he may refuse to allow them to leave the workshop before six, and
                        thus deprive them of their votes; or if they quit in time to reach the
                        polls, in opposition to his wishes, he may make this a pretext for their
                        discharge.</p>

<b>Won't Give Up the Negro</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Quotes from a Republican Philadelphia paper to highlight the key
                    differences of opinion between the Republicans and Democrats on black suffrage.
                    Says a small minority of Republicans are against black suffrage and thus urges
                    that minority to vote with the Democrats in preventing it. Ends by saying such a
                    move would allow white supremacy to continue.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Morning Post, the ablest through the smallest
                        Republican paper in Philadelphia, does not wish the public to be misled by
                        the result of the election in Ohio and Michigan on the Negro question. In
                        its issue of Friday last it says:</p>
                    <p>It is not to be taken for granted that the Republican party is opposed to
                        impartial suffrage because of the votes against it in Ohio and Michigan. In
                        each of these States it was defeated by a union of a small minority of our
                        party with the Democracy. In Ohio over 200,000 Republicans voted for the
                        measure, and in Michigan we presume not less than 50,000 out of 70,000 were
                        ready to strike the word white from the State Constitution. These statistics
                        show the progress the idea of equal rights is making, and the folly of
                        declaring that it is not a part of the Republican creed. They should teach
                        the Conservatives that, while they may defeat Impartial Suffrage by joining
                        with our enemies, they must not attempt to bully the overwhelming majority
                        of the party into political apostasy.</p>
                    <p>What the Post says is true. The Republican party
                        is not opposed to Negro suffrage. On the contrary it is in favor of Negro
                        suffrage. But a "small minority" of the Republican party is opposed to Negro
                        suffrage, and the men who make up this "small minority" are fast finding out
                        that the only way in which they can prevent the Negro from being put on a
                        level with themselves is to vote with the Democrats. It goes a little hard
                        with them to abandon their old political associates and join in with us, but
                        they see the necessity of doing so in order to preserve the white race from
                        contamination, and they are doing their duty like men.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As a political maneuver, designed to retrieve their sinking fortunes in the
                        North, the Radicals in Congress have passed a bill exempting certain
                        manufactures from taxation. They have not, however, done anything worth
                        mentioning to diminish the expenses of the government. The infamous
                        Freedmen's Bureau, through which the white men of the North are compelled to
                        maintain the negroes of the South, still continues to squander its millions
                        of the public money every month. A large army, costing an enormous sum, is
                        still maintained in a section of the Union which for three years has been as
                        peaceful and as obedient to the laws as any other. Swarms of Radical
                        office-holders, reeking with corruption, infest the whole country and
                        plunder the public everywhere. Under the tenure-of-office act the President
                        is prevented from turning out these robbers and putting honest men in their
                        places.</p>
                    <p>With expenditures undiminished, receipts decreasing and Radical
                        office-holders robbing the treasury of a large proportion of the revenue
                        justly belonging to it, how can we expect the government to escape
                        bankruptcy? The individual who goes on year after year, expending more than
                        his income, must and will finally reach the bottom of his purse, and not
                        only run out of money but get out of credit. So it is with governments.</p>
                    <p>If the Radicals in Congress were not legislating merely "for Buncombe" and to
                        tide themselves over the Presidential campaign, they would follow up the
                        repeal of the tax on manufactures by abolishing the Freedmen's Bureau,
                        reducing the Army, and cutting down the expenses of all departments of the
                            governmnet, not forgetting the legislative department, which
                        costs about five times as much as it ought to. But it is not the intention
                        of our Radical Congress to make a permanent reduction in the taxes, and
                        hence they will not reduce the expenditures. After the election they will
                        restore the taxes they have just repealed, and in all probability raise them
                        higher than ever.</p>
                    <p>Touching these matters, the financial editor of the Philadelphia Ledger gave the people some sound advice on Friday
                        last.--We make the following extract from his article:</p>
                    <p>A next important step on the part of Congress, and to fall in which it would
                        be most derelict in its duty, is to reduce the expenses of Government
                        commensurately with the reduction of taxation. Unless there is a vigorous
                        and determined resistance of the various propositions for increasing
                        expenditures, the further progress in lightening taxation will necessarily
                        stop, even if the requirements of the Treasury should not demand a
                        restoration of the taxes now proposed to be removed. Experience will soon
                        test this fact. It is sheer nonsense to take off taxes and not reduce the
                        expenditures. There are several wasteful measures now before Congress. The
                        estimated expenses of the War Department for the year are put down at one
                        hundred and twenty millions! The requisitions on the Department last month
                        were exceedingly heavy, a fact fresh in the face of Congress, inviting that
                        body to a severer purging of estimates which should be reduced thirty-three
                        if not fifty per cent. The estimated expenditures of the Navy have been
                        brought down in even greater proportion, and if the appropriations go
                        through in that shape it is believed that no interest of the country that
                        that branch of the Government is expected to serve will suffer. Talk as
                        members may it will remain as a fact that every dollar of expenditure is a
                        dollar of taxation and something more. The Secretary of the Treasury has
                        interposed objection to the bill just passed, warning Congress against it,
                        as calculated to render the Treasury short of means to meet its liabilities.
                        Congress, heedless of this warning, have, however, passed the bill in a
                        revised shape, and the advance step thus taken, to the extent that it
                        lessens taxation, can only be maintained by a determined demand on the part
                        of the taxpayers from their representatives that the appropriations shall be
                        lessened. The current revenues of the Government show a heavy deficit in the
                        amount as compared with last year, and though this occurred in advance of
                        the tax repeal, it will no doubt hereafter be used as a reason for restoring
                        what has been taken off, and perhaps, also, made an argument for the
                        imposition of additional taxes. There are all sorts of leeches about the
                        Treasury whose movements require close watching. As the industry of the
                        country has to supply the means to pay all expenditures, those that are
                        necessary and proper, as well as those that are not, let each voter hold his
                        immediate representative directly responsible for every dollar of
                        expenditure, and make him feel that it is through his agency that the charge
                        is brought home to the taxpayers door for collection.</p>

                    <p>From various sources, likely to be well-informed, we learn that money is
                        abundant in the rural districts of this county. That is, the farmers, after
                        accommodating each other on the first of April, the great pay-day in real
                        estate transactions, have a large amount of money on hand.--Proof of this

                        deposits being stated at over three hundred and thirty thousand dollars.</p>
                    <p>Whilst there is more money in the rural districts than is needed or can be
                        used there, the case is very different in this town. Here a large amount
                        might be put out at satisfactory rates to the lender. But we understand our
                        farmers who have surplus funds on hand are under the impression that loans
                        in Chambersburg are not the most secure investments. This depends upon
                        circumstances. Loans might be made here which would not be good, but at the
                        same time a large amount of money could be put out on the very best
                        security. Take, for example, a good business property on the Diamond or
                        within a couple of squares of it. The lot cost, we will say, three thousand
                        dollars, ($3,000) and the owner expended six thousand ($6,000) in the
                        erection of the building, making the total cost of the property nine
                        thousand.($9,000.) But the building was put up at a very expensive time and
                        the property might not sell for what it cost. Well, throw off one-third and
                        put down its market value at six thousand dollars; ($6,000.) Would it be
                        safe to lend the owner of such a property four thousand dollars, ($4,000)
                        and take a mortgage or judgment on the property as
                        security?--"No," says a prudent capitalist, "it would not, because the
                        building might burn down and then the lot would not sell for much more than
                        one half the claim." That is a proper answer. But suppose the building were
                        insured to the amount of four thousand dollars ($4,000) in a good company,
                        and the insurance policy were to be transferred to the holder of the
                        mortgage or judgment as collateral security, would not that make
                        the investment perfectly safe? Unquestionably it
                        would; for then if the building burned down, the holder of the mortgage or
                        judgement would draw four thousand dollars ($4,000) from the insurance
                        company, which would at once give him back the amount he had loaned, and if
                        the lot sold for no more than half its cost, there would be fifteen hundred
                        dollars over ($1,500.) This, one would suppose, would be margin enough to
                        satisfy the most prudent and cautious lender. But in most cases a wider
                        margin than this might be obtained, for few of the owners of good real
                        estate in Chambersburg would desire to borrow as large a sum as that above
                        stated.</p>
                    <p>We would not on any account induce our country friends to make bad
                        investment; but after a careful study of the whole matter, we are satisfied
                        that, by the exercise of ordinary prudence, they may invest their surplus
                        funds as safely and as profitably in this town as anywhere.</p>
