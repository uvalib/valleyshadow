<b>The Bolters Brought to Terms</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The state legislature met recently. A radical majority controls the
                    lawmaking body. Nine "incorruptible patriots" bolted the chamber upon nomination
                    of Elisha B. Davis of Philadelphia as speaker, but later swung into line and
                    supported his nomination.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Geary Snubbed</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The State Convention of the "Boys in Blue" overwhelmingly elected Andrew
                    Curtin for Vice President over Geary. "Like republics, soldiers are ungrateful.
                    The valiant warrior has been set aside, snubbed by his gallant comrades, to give
                    place to a man who never smelled powder upon the battlefield."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Losses of the Border Counties</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The newspaper demands that the legislative representative of Franklin
                    County get the legislature to issue damage payments for those who suffered
                    losses from Confederate raids. The editors call on the people of the county to
                    agitate for the same. They Repeatedly stress the loyalty and sacrifice of the
                    people of the county and that reparation payments are not only fair but just.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We call the attention of our representative in the Legislature to the article
                        which we publish to-day, taken from the Valley
                        Sentinel, entitled "The War--What the Government should do--What the
                        People Want." We know that he has the disposition to do everything in his
                        power towards procuring some remuneration for the losses which the people of
                        the border counties have sustained by the war. We call upon him to agitate the subject. There is a duty incumbent
                        upon the representatives of the border counties, and that is, to keep before
                        the people of the Commonwealth, until their mouths are stopped by payment,
                        the fact that this section of the State was overrun, and its inhabitants
                        plundered for the sole reason that it was most accessible to the enemy. The
                        raids that were made upon us, the invasion, and the terrible conflagration
                        which laid Chambersburg in ashes, have impoverished many of our citizens,
                        and imposed loads of debt upon others, under which they will stagger into
                        their graves. Our misfortunes and calamity were the salvation of the rest of
                        the State. Surely, there ought to be a general disposition to appropriate
                        money to relieve us of our burdens.</p>
                    <p>And, notwithstanding our misfortunes and losses, our people paid their share
                        of taxation without a murmur. They contributed their fall quotas of men to
                        the ranks of the Army. They were "loyal" to the government of the United
                        States. They did not falter in their allegiance to the State. The State owed
                        them protection. It did not, or could not extend it. Ought it not, now, out
                        of the common treasury, eagerly pay the losses sustained by reason of its
                        failure, whether owing to neglect or inability, to afford us the requisite
                        protection? this subject demands agitation,
                        AGITATION, AGITATION! Let our representative put
                        the ball in motion.</p>

<b>Radical Desperation</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Outlines and denounces the recent move by Radicals to transfer the power to
                    remove district commanders from President Johnson to General Grant. The paper
                    also abhors a bill prepared by the Judiciary Committee to require a 2/3 majority
                    by the Supreme Court to pass decisions on reconstruction bills. The editor
                    considers both these moves infamous and desperate schemes to keep Radicals in
                    power by usurping proper government protocol.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals are becoming more desperate every day. They seem determined to
                        strain the patience of the people to its utmost limit. Wherever they
                        discover a weak place in their infamous reconstruction bills, they set
                        themselves to work to bolster it up. Their whole reconstruction scheme has
                        in this way become a patched up job. They are now bent on taking the power
                        of removal of the district commanders from the President and lodging it in
                        General Grant. The Constitution makes the President, by virtue of his
                        office, commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, but a
                        bill has just been introduced into the House which, if passed, will rob him
                        of all authority over his subordinates and leave them free to overturn
                        republican governments as fast as they please and erect military despotisms
                        upon their ruins.</p>
                    <p>And this bill not only seeks to rob the President of this his rightful power,
                        but in one sentence, it wipes out all the civil governments now existing in
                        the late rebel states. It refuses to recognize them as valid and legal and
                        seeks not only to usurp the province of the Judiciary, but to subordinate
                        that co-ordinate branch of the government to it, by declaring that the Judiciary shall not recognize them as
                        legal.--Could fanaticism go further? yes, strange as it may seem it
                        can.</p>
                    <p>Cases are now pending before the Supreme Court of the United States which
                        involve the constitutionality of the reconstruction laws passed by Congress.
                        Rumors are afloat that that high body is likely to frustrate the whole
                        infamous scheme of the Radicals by declaring their reconstruction laws
                        unconstitutional. So nervous and fearful have they become under the
                        operation of these reports, that a telegram to a Radical paper informs us,
                        that the Judiciary Committee is preparing a bill which provides that two thirds of all the Judges of the Supreme Court shall be
                            necessary to render a decision, instead of a bare majority as the law,
                            as it now stands, requires. These men are bold and bad enough to
                        upset our whole system of government in order to accomplish their nefarious
                        objects which the people have branded with the seal of their condemnation.
                        To them, written constitutions solemnly enacted laws, time honored customs
                        and republican institutions are nothing. They respect not the rights of the
                        coordinate departments of our government.--They would infringe upon the
                        authority of the Executive and the Judiciary. Nay more, they are confessedly
                            "acting outside of the Constitution.</p>
                    <p>Forbearance will ere long cease to be a virtue, and these revolutionary
                        designs, if persisted in, must be met by a majestic uprising of the people
                        in behalf of popular government.</p>
