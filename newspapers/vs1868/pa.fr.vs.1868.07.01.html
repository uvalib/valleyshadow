<b>The National Convention</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Democratic National Convention will meet Tuesday in New York. The paper
                    pledges united support of all Democrats behind its nominees. The editors list
                    the issues they hope will be included in the platform: "A reduction of the
                    National expenses--the total abolition of the Freedmens' Bureau--the destruction
                    of all military governments--the retention of political power in the hands of
                    white men--and, by means of all these, the gradual and sure extinguishment of
                    the national debt."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Letter From Senator Sumner</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints a letter from Charles Sumner that the editors claim proves
                    the Republican Party is in favor of "admitting Negroes to Congress, to State
                    Legislatures, or to the jury box."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Great Battle of the War</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper re-fights the battle of Antietam, arguing that McLellan achieved
                    as much there as Meade did at Gettysburg.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Negro Suffrage to be Made General by Act of Congress</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article arguing that the radicals intend to "make negro suffrage the law in
                    every State by Congressional enactment if they succeed in electing Grant."<br>

<b>Normal Institute</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Franklin County Normal Institute in Strasburg ended its three month
                    session. 58 male and female pupils attended the session, most of whom hope to
                    teach in the county's common schools. "The Institute is doing a good work in
                    qualifying teachers for their important duties." It was founded by
                    Superintendent of Schools P. M. Shoemaker and assisted by Samuel Gelwix.<br>(Names in announcement:  P. M. Shoemaker,  Samuel Gelwix)</blockquote>
<b>Railroad Meeting</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses a meeting held to plan the building of a railroad to
                    Chambersburg.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Another Railroad meeting was held on Wednesday evening last, in the Court
                        House, in this borough. It was well attended, and from the spirit evinced by
                        those present, hopes were entertained that a sufficient amount would be
                        subscribed to secure the location of the Railroad to Chambersburg, but it
                        does not appear that much has been done since the meeting. One hundred and
                        three shares (in addition to those previously subscribed for by citizens of
                        the borough) were taken at this meeting.</p>
                    <p>We hope the committee will make another effort, and, if possible, canvass the
                        whole town. We have at least one hundred men in this borough who are able to
                        take ten shares or more apiece. We have two hundred more who could take from
                        two to five shares each, and two or three hundred more who could take one or
                        two shares each. Out of such abundant material, surely it ought to be
                        possible to get a thousand shares taken.</p>

<b>The Wheeling of a Wheelbarrow</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mr. Crooks pushed a wheelbarrow through town with a streamer declaring
                    "Impeachment a Failure." The spectacle was the result of a failed bet with J. A.
                    S. Creamer. Crooks, an ardent Republican, had bet that Johnson would be removed
                    from office. The victorious Creamer and the Citizens' Band followed behind the
                    disgraced Crooks.<br>(Names in announcement:   Crooks,  J. A. S. Creamer)</blockquote>
<b>Hershberger's Panorama</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
