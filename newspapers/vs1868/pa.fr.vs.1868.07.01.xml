                <summary>The Democratic National Convention will meet Tuesday in New York. The paper
                    pledges united support of all Democrats behind its nominees. The editors list
                    the issues they hope will be included in the platform: "A reduction of the
                    National expenses--the total abolition of the Freedmens' Bureau--the destruction
                    of all military governments--the retention of political power in the hands of
                    white men--and, by means of all these, the gradual and sure extinguishment of
                    the national debt."</summary>

                    session. 58 male and female pupils attended the session, most of whom hope to
                    teach in the county's common schools. "The Institute is doing a good work in
                    qualifying teachers for their important duties." It was founded by
                    Superintendent of Schools P. M. Shoemaker and assisted by Samuel Gelwix.</summary>

                    <p>Another Railroad meeting was held on Wednesday evening last, in the Court
                        House, in this borough. It was well attended, and from the spirit evinced by
                        those present, hopes were entertained that a sufficient amount would be
                        subscribed to secure the location of the Railroad to Chambersburg, but it
                        does not appear that much has been done since the meeting. One hundred and
                        three shares (in addition to those previously subscribed for by citizens of
                        the borough) were taken at this meeting.</p>
                    <p>We hope the committee will make another effort, and, if possible, canvass the
                        whole town. We have at least one hundred men in this borough who are able to
                        take ten shares or more apiece. We have two hundred more who could take from
                        two to five shares each, and two or three hundred more who could take one or
                        two shares each. Out of such abundant material, surely it ought to be
                        possible to get a thousand shares taken.</p>

                    S. Creamer. Crooks, an ardent Republican, had bet that Johnson would be removed
                    from office. The victorious Creamer and the Citizens' Band followed behind the
                    disgraced Crooks.</summary>
