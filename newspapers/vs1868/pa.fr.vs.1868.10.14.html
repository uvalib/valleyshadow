<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The election is rapidly approaching. But one day remains to you. The time is
                        short for deliberation. It is short for action.--The Radical party is
                        active. Its leaders are unscrupulous. They are using money without stint.
                        They are buying votes wherever they can get men to make a bargain with them.
                        The New England States have thrown an immense amount of money into the hands
                        of the Radical wire-pullers of this State. An attempt is being made to
                        counter-balance the loss of men of calm judgement, who have abandoned
                        Radicalism because of its fatal fanaticism, by purchasing the "floating
                        vote." They feel that the principles of the Democratic platform have
                        attracted the attention and won the approbation of Conservative men
                        everywhere. They know that the masses are longing for a change which will
                        better their condition. Men who are in the habit of reasoning in regard to
                        matters of government, as well as in relation to their own private affairs,
                        are thinking more than ever now. The Radicals do not desire any thinking to be done. They are doing everything to
                        draw the minds of the people away from the issues of the day. They are
                        endeavoring to fan into a flame the old embers of sectional hatred. The
                        appeals of their orators are all to the passions.</p>
                    <p>The Democratic party asks simply for the exercise of the calm judgment of the
                        people. It arraigns Radicalism, and asks for its condemnation because of its
                        frightful extravagance and corruption, and terrible misrule.</p>
                    <p>The figures taken from the official records show that it costs five times as
                        much per annum to administer this government under Radical rule as it did
                        during the Presidency of James Buchanan. The public monies are squandered
                        recklessly in every conceivable way. Economy never enters into their
                        calculations. They pay one hundred and twenty
                        millions per annum to keep up a standing army of sixty thousand men
                        in a time of profound peace. They pay from ten to twelve
                            millions each year to keep up the Freedmen's Bureau for the
                        purpose of feeding and clothing idle, lazy negroes whilst the poor white men
                        of the South are obliged to work for their living. They expend large sums of
                        the people's money in such useless and costly undertakings as impeachment.</p>
                    <p>In the last three years they have collected from the people fifteen hundred millions of dollars. What has
                        become of it? They are unable to account for it. Judge Black, in a speech
                        lately made at York, says that at least one thousand
                            millions of dollars have been stolen from the government during
                        that short time. No wonder the National debt is increasing. Tax payers, look
                        at these enormous figures and condemn the Radical party at the polls.</p>
                    <p>The Radical party seeks to rule this country by the force of the bayonet.
                        Congress has usurped all the power belonging to the President and the
                        Supreme Court, and is now delegating this usurped power to General Grant. He
                        holds sixty thousand men at his command whose business is now to execute his
                        will. He is the Radical candidate for the Presidency. He is making such
                        disposition of his troops in the South as will insure the casting of the
                        Electoral votes of the Southern States for him. His subordinate officers
                        have full authority to arrest men at their pleasure for any reason which
                        seems good to them. They will intimidate conservative men and thus keep them
                        from the polls. They will give, as they are giving, protection to
                        unprincipled carpet-baggers who are exciting the negroes to riotous
                        demonstrations. Grant is using the bayonet to carry his
                            own election. A huge military despotism is thus overshadowing the
                        Southern portion of the American Republic. How long will it be until it
                        casts its baneful shadow over the North? Friends of civil liberty, think of
                        this and condemn the Radical party at the polls.</p>
                    <p>The Radical party is striving to put the negro upon an equal footing with the
                        white man in this country. It seeks to clothe him with all the political
                        rights that belong to the men of our own race. Observe how the Radical
                        leaders are pushing the negro forward. He votes in the South. He sits in the
                        jury box. He holds office. He is sent to the State Legislatures. A negro presides over the Louisiana Senate. Seventy four
                            negroes and forty seven whites composed the Convention which
                        framed the present Constitution of South Carolina. These
                            seventy four blacks each paid less than fifty cents for taxes.</p>
                    <p>The Legislature of South Carolina now consists of ninety-seven negroes and fifty white men. Ninety-six of these negroes pay less than seventy cents apiece for
                            taxes.</p>
                    <p>Ninety-three negroes were elected to seats in the
                        Legislature of Georgia and held their places until a few weeks ago. Senator
                        Sumner says that the proudest day of his life will be that on which a negro
                        is sworn into the United States Senate. Senator Wilson says that the true
                        construction of the civil-rights bill is that the negro is entitled to vote
                        and hold office in the North as well as in the South.</p>
                    <p>Against the law of God, against the instincts of our nature, and against the
                        experience of the world the Radicals are thus striving to found governments
                        upon the stolid ignorance of the negro. Think of it, white men, and condemn
                        the Radical party at the polls.</p>
                    <p>The Radical party seeks to increase the actual debt of the nation seven
                        hundred and fifty millions of dollars by paying the five-twenty bonds in
                        gold. Thaddeus Stevens, Senator Sherman of Ohio, Senator Morton of Indiana,
                        Benjamin F. Butler of Massachusetts, all say that the intention of the
                        framers of the law authorizing the issue of these bonds was that they were
                        to be paid in the lawful currency of the country, whatever that might be.
                        The Treasury notes were made a legal tender by the Radicals themselves for
                        all debts, public and private, except the duties on imports and the interest of the public debt. Not a word about
                            the principal of the debt. For that the
                        treasury notes were made a legal tender.</p>
                    <p>There are fifteen hundred millions of these
                        five-twenty bonds to be paid. Buy gold at fifty per cent premium with which
                        to pay them, and it will require twenty-two hundred and
                            fifty millions to pay fifteen hundred millions. All for the love
                        of spending money. The widow and orphans and crippled or wounded soldier
                        must take "greenbacks" for their pension. The day-laborer must take
                        "greenbacks" as the reward of his toil. Why should not the bondholder take
                        "greenbacks" for his bond? The bondholder may as well make up his mind to
                        the fact that these bonds are to be paid in "greenbacks." And having so made
                        up his mind, let him vote for the party that is bound to
                            make "greenbacks" as good as gold. Let him cast his vote for the
                        party which inscribes "Retrenchment and Reform" upon its banners. Let him
                        vote to abolish the Freedmen's Bureau--to disband our large standing
                        army--to stop up every hole out of which the public money is being drawn by
                        thieves and plunderers--to put the Southern State governments into the hands
                        of white men so that they can help us to pay the debt--and he will soon
                        discover that the credit of the government will rise--"greenbacks" will run
                        up to par because the world will see our willingness and our ability to pay,
                        and the bonds of the government will be as good as
                        gold. Let him vote to continue the rule of the Radical party and he
                        will find that its terrible extravagance, unprecedented corruption and
                        frightful misrule will render the nation bankrupt and
                            his bonds will not be paid at all. Let the bondholder and the
                        poor man think of this and condemn the Radical party at the polls.</p>
                    <p>Men of Franklin County, these are the issues before you. Meet them like men
                        who love your country better than your party. Array yourselves on the side
                        of Constitutional liberty and an economical administration of the
                        government. Being so arrayed, work. Give all your time until the polls close
                        next Tuesday to your country.--Let there not be a single laggard. Be active,
                        watchful, diligent. Every thing looks bright. Let us not only maintain our
                        majority of last year, but let us increase it.--Philadelphia will give a
                        Democratic majority. The State is safe for the Democracy.--Let us help by
                        increasing activity to swell the Democratic vote so that the voice of
                        Pennsylvania may be a voice of thunder.</p>

<b>Democrats, Look Out!</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper warns Democrats to examine their tickets before voting to be sure
                    they do not mistakenly cast a ballot for John Cessna. Cessna has been publicly
                    betting that he will win 100 more votes than last election's Republican
                    candidate in Mercersburg, Peters, and Hamilton. His confidence could be an
                    indication of the existence of a plot to commit fraud.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>To supply the demand for Hon. Francis Jordan's pamphlet exposing the
                        duplicity and contemptible trickery of John Cessna, we reprint it in this
                        number of our paper. Col. Jordan was a Whig when that party was in
                        existence, and when it died out he aided in forming the Republican party to
                        which he has adhered consistently ever since. He is a gentleman of high
                        respectability and was for a long series of years the leader of our
                        political opponents in Bedford county. He is a Radical leader still, and as
                        such he warns his political friends that John Cessna is nothing but an
                        unscrupulous office hunter and ought not to be trusted by the Radical party.</p>
                    <p>The Radicals of Franklin county profess to be great admirers of Governor
                        Geary. Let them remember that Francis Jordan is Governor Geary's Secretary
                        of the Commonwealth. In official position he stands next to the Governor. He
                        was appointed to this position by Governor Geary after he had published the
                        "Address to the Union Voters of Bedford County" which we reprint to-day. The
                        Governor may therefore justly be regarded as endorsing Col. Jordan's charges
                        against Cessna. Those charges are of a very serious nature. They make out a
                        character for Cessna which it would be hard to find the counterpart of
                        anywhere outside of the purlieus of politics.</p>
                    <p>Look at Cessna's conduct. When Col. Jordan called on him in Bedford, previous
                        to the Radical nomination for Governor in 1866, he said he had no thought of
                        being a candidate himself and promised to support Jordan. But as soon as
                        Jordan got out of town, Cessna came out as a candidate and went to work with
                        all his might to defeat Jordan. Did any man in the world ever serve another
                        a more scurvy trick than this? Did any honorable
                        man ever do such a thing?</p>
                    <p>Col. Jordan exposes another dishonorable trick of Cessna's. After he had
                        promised to support Jordan, and before he announced himself a candidate, he
                        went to Jordan's friend Major Washabaugh, (Brother of the late Upton
                        Washabaugh of Chambersburg,) who had been selected to represent Bedford
                        county in the Radical State Convention, and begged the Major to substitute
                        him, "alleging that he desired to go to enable him to define his position as
                        a party man." After he got into the State Convention on this false pretence,
                        and had secured, as he supposed, the control of the Radical organization by
                        getting himself made Chairman of the Radical State Committee, he let it be
                        known that he was a candidate for Governor in opposition to Jordan, and went
                        to work to defeat Jordan's friend, Major Washabaugh, to whose generosity he
                        was indebted for the privilege of sitting in the State Convention. Did the
                        "Wickedest Man in New York" ever do anything dirtier than that? John Allen
                        must hide his diminished head in the presence of John Cessna.</p>
                    <p>But Cessna proved himself capable of a still higher flight than this in
                        scurvy political trickery. Being in Washington city, where Col. Jordan was
                        then engaged as the Agent of the State, on the 21st of December, he
                        submitted written plans to the Colonel by which a decision between them
                        might be had in Bedford county. He then posted off home as fast as steam
                        could carry him, without waiting for Col. Jordan to reply to his
                        propositions, first telegraphing to his minions in Bedford to have the
                        County Committee called together at so early a day that he supposed the
                        Colonel would not hear of the meeting till it was over! But the Colonel did
                        hear of it--not from Cessna, but through a telegram from Major Washabaugh.
                        He then went to Bedford, and before the Committee met, placed in Cessna's
                        hands a note accepting one of the plans he had proposed when in Washington.
                        This upset Cessna's nice laid scheme to obtain a snap judgment against Col.
                        Jordan, but he was equal to the emergency. He had the effrontery, in
                        replying to the Colonel's note, to assume that the Colonel had declined his
                        propositions, but expressed himself willing to take a vote under the
                        "Crawford county system.' The next day exposed his hypocrisy, for instead of
                        submitting to a vote of the party in general, he induced his pliant tools in
                        the County Committee to take another course, whereby a direct vote of the
                        party was avoided--"a plan," as Col. Jordan states, "in which a minority of
                        the party might give a majority of the delegates."</p>
                    <p>We have not the time to pursue this exposure further. Let every voter read
                        Col. Jordan's statement. Let it be remembered who and what Col. Jordan is.
                        Let it be borne in mind that at the very time when John Cessna was doing all
                        this dirty work against Col. Jordan and for his own personal benefit, the
                        Colonel was at Washington serving the soldiers of Pennsylvania who had
                        fought to save the Union. And let every citizen who values honesty, candor
                        and fair dealing, vote to rebuke and put down the demagogue and trickster
                        who has earned the disgraceful distinction of being politically the
                        Wickedest Man in Pennsylvania, John Cessna.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There was one year in the last twenty years when John Cessna was not a
                        candidate for public office. This was last year. He then accepted an
                        appointment from the State Temperance Convention to draft a Prohibitory
                        Liquor Law to be presented to the Legislature. But before presenting his
                        draft he made up his mind to run for Congress, and thinking he would need
                        the votes of distillers and hotel and restaurant keepers, he concluded to
                        let the temperance people wait awhile. To keep his hand in the temperance
                        business, however, he traveled out to Cleveland in the early part of the
                        past summer and took his seat as Temporary Chairman of the National
                        Temperance Convention. He "changed the base" of his temperance movement. He
                        passed from a State to a National arena. The Prohibitory Law which he was to
                        have presented to the Legislature he reserved for presentation to Congress
                        when he should get there.</p>
                    <p>The Radical Congress arrogates to itself the right to regulate affairs which
                        formerly were understood to belong exclusively to the States. As "one
                        renegade is worse than ten Turks," the renegade Cessna may be expected to
                        out-radical any ten Radicals in Congress if he gets there. He may,
                        therefore, be expected to claim for Congress the right to pass a Prohibitory
                        Liquor Law, and he may be expected to press upon that body the passage of
                        the law which he was to have pressed upon the State Legislature.</p>
                    <p>Judge Kimmell is as temperate a man as John Cessna, but he does not meddle
                        with other people's business and does not approve of binding freemen with
                        iron-clad laws prescribing what they shall eat, drink or wear. Let all who
                        don't want a government spy set over them to watch and report what they eat,
                        drink or wear, vote for Kimmell.</p>

                        calculated to mislead people.</p>
                    <p>James P. Barr, Democrat, was J.M. Campbell's predecessor in the office of
                        Surveyor General. He was elected in 1862 and went into office in 1863. The
                        expenses of the office for 1863 were $10,225; for 1864 $12,310; for 1865
                        $17,566--total for three years $40,101.</p>
                    <p>J.M. Campbell, Radical, was elected in 1865 and went into office in 1866. The
                        expenses of the office for 1866 were $20,648; for 1867 $23,223; for 1868
                        $24,700--total for three years $68,571.</p>
                    <p>These figures, which are from the official reports, show that Mr. Campbell,
                        the present Surveyor General and Radical candidate, has spent $28,571 more than Mr. Barr did in the same length of time.
                        Is that the way to "make the Department a source of revenue instead of
                        burden to the State?"</p>
                    <p>We may as well add another fact which the official reports will bear us out
                        in stating. It is this: Barr paid more money into the
                            State Treasury from the Land office in ONE YEAR than Campbell has paid into it from the same office
                        in THREE YEARS.</p>
                    <p>Will the Repository explain how Campbell has "made the Department a source of revenue
                        instead of burden to the State?"</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>John D. Lechrone, son of Samuel Lechrone, died on September 20th from the
                    effects of a gunshot wound. "Young Lechrone was a quiet, inoffensive young man,
                    of a religious turn of mind. Some time last winter, he attended a series of
                    meetings at Jacobs' Church, conducted by myself, when we endeavored to instruct
                    him in the way of Salvation through Christ, and as he, night after night,
                    presented himself as an anxious inquirer, receiving instructions and the benefit
                    of prayers of the church, he was enabled at last, to receive Christ as a
                    gracious savior."<br>(Names in announcement:  John D. Lechrone,  Samuel Lechrone)</blockquote>
