                    <p>The correspondence, which we publish today, between General Grant and
                        President Johnson, is of an exceedingly damaging nature to the character of
                        the distinguished hero of the War. It affords another striking corroboration
                        of the fact, hitherto so signally exemplified, that a General, in attempting
                        to play the part of a statesman, is very frequently a complete failure.
                        General Grant has evidently waded into water entirely too deep for him. Had
                        he been satisfied to rest upon the laurels won in the suppression of the
                        rebellion, he would have been honored by the American people without
                        exception. Whilst the discerning minds of the nation have failed to discover
                        a military genius in him like that of the First Napoleon, which so often
                        electrified the world by the novelty and boldness of its achievements, yet
                        even they have been silenced into acquiescence in the general tribute of
                        admiration which is always paid to a <emph rend="italic">successful</emph>
                        military hero. Not only was Grant successful in compelling a surrender of
                        the rebel armies, but the terms of capitulation extended by him, were so
                        generous and chivalric, that he was successful also in subduing for a time
                        the blood-thirsty spirit which had taken possession of a portion of the
                        Northern people. Whilst some would have preferred harsher terms, yet
                        everybody was disposed to rejoice inasmuch as the war was over, the Union
                        was preserved intact, and the honor of the National Government completely
                        vindicated. General Grant's <emph rend="italic"> honor as a soldier was the
                            first consideration with him then.</emph> The ambition to be President
                        had not then entered his mind. He had not yet become the plaything of
                        designing politicians. And, therefore, in the matter of the surrender of
                        Lee, he rose above all selfish and vindictive emotions, and acted as his
                        keen sense of honor as a soldier prompted him to act.</p>
                    <p>But hardly had the rebel soldiers reached their homes, before the mutterings
                        of discontent began to be heard among the Radical leaders, North, who regard
                        perpetual disquiet as absolutely essential to the existence of their party.
                        They began to coin libels upon the whole Southern people, and sought to
                        impugn the good faith of the surrender. General Grant then went South, and
                        on his return reported favorably as to the disposition and feeling among the
                        Southern masses. The nation saw in this action on his part, an earnest love
                        of law and order, and a strong desire to witness the people of the several
                        States of the Union united in heart as well as in name.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, President Johnson was laboring, for the accomplishment of this
                        object. But, so bitter had the Radicals become at his opposition to the new
                        schemes which they were devising for the enfranchisement of the negro to
                        perpetuate their power, that they began to cast about for ways and means to
                        retard reconstruction, and thus bring discredit upon his administration.--In
                        pursuance of this design, they resorted to the most iniquitous measures to
                        tie the hands of the President, disregarding the Constitution entirely
                        whenever it stood in their way. They passed the Tenure of Office Bill, so as
                        to keep Stanton, who was acting as a spy upon the President's movements, in
                        the Cabinet. Possessed of no delicacy or refinement of feeling, Stanton
                        remained in the War Department in opposition to the wishes of the President,
                        and even absolutely refused to surrender his portfolio after being plainly
                        requested so to do. The President then, in the exercise of his clear,
                        constitutional right, suspended Stanton, and appointed General Grant,
                        Secretary of War <emph rend="italic">ad interim</emph>.</p>
                    <p>Upon the reassembling of Congress, a movement was set on foot to restore the
                        displaced Secretary. It became necessary, in order to insure the success of
                        this scheme, to have General Grant to favor it. At once he was announced by
                        leading radical papers throughout the country as the Radical choice for the
                        Presidency. Mass meetings were called in the large cities to further his
                        nomination.--Poor Grant was tickled, gratified, and at length crazed with
                        the idea. His brain whirled at the thought of reaching such a proud
                        distinction. He saw that, if he was to obtain the nomination of the Radical
                        Convention, he must do something to promote the interests of the Radical
                        party. He therefore undertook to "carry water on both shoulders."</p>
                    <p>Secretly in sympathy with, and privy to, the Radical plot, and intending to
                        play false to the President at the most critical period, he induced the
                        President to believe that he would so act as that, in case he did not wish
                        to be involved in the controversy himself, the War Department should pass
                        under the immediate control of the President before the Senate could
                        re-instate Stanton. The allegation on the part of the President is, <emph
                            rend="italic">that General Grant, both impliedly and expressly, promised
                            him either "to hold on to the office of Secretary of War ad interim
                            against the action of the Senate", or to surrender it to the President
                            before such action was had."</emph> He did neither. On the contrary, as
                        soon as the Senate announced its action to him, he vacated the office, and
                        allowed Stanton to take possession.</p>
                    <p>Nobody of average common sense can doubt that there was such an understanding
                        between Johnson and Grant. aside from the indubitable positive testimony
                        upon the subject, it is so natural as not to admit of question. What could
                        be more reasonably conjectured than that the President, engaged as he was in
                        an open contest with Congress, having nothing favorable to expect from it,
                        would be anxious to understand General Grant's views upon the effort, which
                        was likely so soon to be made, to return Stanton to the War Office? What
                        more natural than that he should seek for information as to Grant's
                        contemplated action in view of the probable action of the Senate?</p>
                    <p>But we are not left in doubt. President Johnson says, that he read his letter
                        to four of the five members of the Cabinet who were present at the interview
                        between Grant and the President, and that they all corroborate his statement
                        that Grant admitted that he had made them promises. In the administration of
                        justice in our courts, when one witness testifies to one state of facts, and
                        five or six witnesses, of equally good standing, testify to an entirely
                        contradictory state of facts, the verdict is never in favor of the statement
                        of the single witness. And so, we apprehend, the verdict of the nation is
                        not likely to be in favor of the man distinguished though he be, who seeks
                        to conceal his hypocrisy, and willfully misrepresents his action in order to
                        attain the object of his ambition, when his hypocrisy is unmasked, and his
                        misrepresentations are exposed by four witnesses, who are entirely
                        disinterested, and who with one accord agree that General Grant has written
                        his letters to the President for political capital <emph rend="italic">at
                            the expense of the truth</emph>. How his name would have shone upon the
                        pages of history, if he had manfully resolved that he "would rather be right
                        than President"! All men love candor.--No man is more despicable than the
                        double-dealing miscreant who barters his own honor for temporary power.</p>
                    <p>The word of a man occupying the position of General Grant ought to be as good
                        as his bond. This correspondence reveals the fact that his <emph
                            rend="italic">word</emph> is not of much account. Perhaps this <emph
                            rend="italic">bond</emph> would not be much better.--It certainly was
                        not a few years ago. This violation of his plighted faith will be a lasting
                        stain upon his honor. The infamy of it will cling to him like the shirt of
                        Nessus. It will be a complete set-off to the prestige of his name, and will
                        utterly dissipate the nonsensical ideas of his availability as a
                        Presidential candidate.</p>
                    <p>When the Radicals called upon the so-called Secretary of War for a copy of
                        this correspondence, before the ink was dry upon Grant's last letter, and of
                        course before the President could frame a reply, they thought that, as Grant
                        had the last word, the people would shout Hosannah to him for his thorough
                        destruction of Andrew Johnson.--But on the contrary, Grant's admirers in
                        secret bow their heads in shame, and are awaiting, in painful silence and
                        anxiety, the answer of the President with its accompanying proof, which will
                        settle the question of Grant's duplicity beyond all cavil. The Chicago
                        Convention will certainly not present as the Radical standard-bearer, a man
                        who has been set in the pillory for all time.</p>
                    <p>But not alone is Grant guilty of breaking his promise in a matter of so much
                        moment. He is also guilty of insubordination. The President is, by virtue of
                        his office, Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.
                            <emph rend="italic">The Secretary of War is his Clerk</emph>. He has no
                        rank in the army. He is not a General, Major or Brigadier-General, Colonel,
                        Lieutenant-Colonel, Major, Captain, Lieutenant, or even a private. He has no
                        place in the army whatever. He is not, in a military sense, the superior of
                        General Grant. Now, the President, having suspended Stanton as his
                        Secretary, or Clerk, and being unwilling to recognize him in that capacity
                        at the unauthorized bidding of the Senate, commands General Grant not to
                        obey any orders issued by Stanton in the name of the President.--General
                        Grant refuses to obey, and says, that as Stanton has informed him that <emph
                            rend="italic">he</emph> has received no order from the President
                        revoking the authority, heretofore exercised by him, to issue such orders,
                            <emph rend="italic">therefore, he will assume that any such order issued
                            by Stanton has been issued by direction of the President</emph>. Could
                        presumption go further? Grant does not question the genuineness of the
                        President's order to him. He admits to genuineness. But he openly disregards
                        it, and virtually takes the position that he is not bound to obey the order
                        of the President unless it is transmitted through his Clerk, or worse still,
                        that he is bound to obey an order, issued by an aforetime Clerk in the name
                        of the President, although the Clerk has been summarily dismissed, and he,
                        Grant, has been apprised of the fact that he is no longer recognized as the
                        instrument through which the orders of the Commander-in-Chief are conveyed.
                        The position is too contemptible for argument. It refutes itself. It needs
                        only to be stated to be overthrown.</p>
                    <p>But where is all this leading us? Whither are we drifting? Congress openly
                        trampling upon the Constitution; trammeling the Executive in a way hitherto
                        never dreamed of, legislating against the judiciary and endeavoring to
                        overthrow that bulwark of our rights and liberties; seeking to invest the
                        negro with power to rule the white men of the country; and now, the General
                        of the army striking hands with Congress in this nefarious work; setting an
                        example of insubordination to every private in the army--what does it all
                        mean? Surely we are in the midst of a terrible revolution, bloodless as yet
                        it is true, but how long it is to remain so, God only knows. The conviction
                        forces itself upon our mind, <emph rend="italic">that the Radicals intend to
                            usurp power</emph>, if they can not gain it at the next Presidential
                        election. We call upon the conservative citizens of the country to awake
                        from their sluggishness. Let the press sound the alarm. We must not lie upon
                        our backs, hugging the delusive phantom of hope until our enemies have bound
                        us hand and foot. The next call that comes to our ears from Radical
                        headquarters may be a call to arms. <emph rend="italic">That call must be
                            resisted</emph>. Let us prepare to meet the crisis when it comes. Let us
                        get ready to defend our rights, and the free institutions of our country, as
                        men who have a proper appreciation of their importance and value. Republican
                        government is now on trial. We will show ourselves false to the teachings of
                        our ancestors, and unworthy to live in a free country, if we tamely, and
                        cravenly submit, and allow it to be overthrown by the reckless fanatics at
                        Washington, who would rather see the pillars of the fair fabric of the
                        American Republic broken down, than see the power, lately exercised and so
                        terribly abused by them, slip from their hands.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>It is a current rumor in Washington City, we are informed, that another
                        effort is soon to be made to impeach the President. We presume that the
                        impeachment agitators have grown bolder on account of Stanton's success in
                        remaining in the War Office, together with the fact that Grant has either
                        become so angry, or is all the time so drunk, as that he can easily be
                        persuaded to run his soldiers into the White House, and decare himself
                        dictator. There can be no doubt of the fact that the re-agitation of this
                        subject means mischief. A vote in favor of impeachment would likely be
                        followed by a resolution suspending the President from office during trial.
                        Then would come the test of the President's courage. We insist--the
                        Democratic party insists--that when that hour comes, if come it does, the
                        President shall resist the effort to suspend him from office pending the
                        trial, with all the force he can command. Let him sound the notes of
                        resistance loud and clear, and hundreds of thousands will spring up in
                        response to his call, determined to protect the Executive from the lawless
                        encroachment of the Legislative Department of the Government. We want no
                        child's play then--no mistaking his men--no reliance upon such creatures as
                        Grant, but the country will demand the exercise of wisdom and boldness. The
                        best way to fight fire is with fire. Let the President give the Radical
                        plotters to understand--the sooner the better--that every one who is
                        concerned in the plot to deprive the nation of its head, will be held to the
                        strictest account and may, ere he is aware of it, find himself looking out
                        from the windows of some gloomy fortress, a prisoner, after the manner of
                        the political prisoners of the "late lamented" Lincoln. Let him arrest the
                        conspirators summarily, and hunt up the law afterwards. In times of great
                        public peril, when the Republic is in danger, the people will applaud the
                        conduct of the brave man who strikes boldly, and saves the nation from
                        anarchy. This was the argument of the Republican party during the war. Let
                        them learn their own lesson by experience. If Andrew Johnson allows himself
                        to be suspended from the Presidential chair pending his trial, if trial
                        there be, he will deserve the execrations of mankind, and no Democrat will
                        weep to see his head severed from his body. The Democracy are growing
                        impatient at these startling attempts at revolution--they are getting tired
                        of these endeavors to frighten them into submission to the Radical policy,
                        and they will stand by the President, if he is true to himself, and the
                        dignity of his great office, to the bitter end.</p>

                <summary>Responds to the rumor of another attempt at impeachment of Johnson. The
                    paper says the next step will be Radicals suspending him from office pending a
                    trial. The people, the article asserts, will rise up and stand by Johnson to
                    prevent such a scenario should the Radicals proceed.</summary>

                    every Sunday after church. "The young men and boys form two rows outside, just
                    about far enough apart to allow a gentleman and lady (without hoops) to pass
                    between them, and, remaining in that attitude until the last inmate has passed
                    out, stare into the faces of the ladies, and occasionally make remarks upon
                    their personal appearance."</summary>
