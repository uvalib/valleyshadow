<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Convention of negroes and white men that assembled in Chicago on the 20th
                        inst., adopted a platform on which they intend to run Grant and Colfax for
                        the chief offices in the gift of the nation. It is true that platforms are
                        not of much account, especially in the estimation of the Radical party. They
                        kick them from beneath their feet with the same recklessness that they
                        display in asking Senators to perjure themselves for the purpose of removing
                        a President. What gigantic strides has that party taken since 1864, and what
                        a still more striking contrast is presented between the platform of 1860 and
                        that of 1868! And yet, the platform adopted for the coming campaign does not
                        go far enough to meet the views of the Radical leaders.</p>
                    <p>But, inasmuch as they will insist that the resolutions passed at Chicago
                        embody the principles of their party, it becomes our duty to examine them
                        and see to what doctrines they avowedly stand pledged, and what results may
                        be fairly predicted from the positions which they assumed.</p>
                    <p>There are twelve distinct resolutions.--The third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
                        ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth of these are mere glittering
                        generalities which nobody disputes.--The Convention might just as well have
                        resolved that two and two make four, or that water doesn't run up hill. They
                        do not present a single issue between the two parties. Nobody is in favor of
                        repudiation and everybody thinks that "the national honor requires the
                        payment of the public indebtedness in the utmost good faith to all creditors
                        at home and abroad, not only according to the letter, but the spirit of the
                        laws under which it was contracted."</p>
                    <p>We are all in favor of taxation being equalized, and nobody would be such a
                        fool as to object to it being "reduced as rapidly as the national faith will
                        permit."</p>
                    <p>None of us are so flush that we propose to pay off the national debt at once, and so we heartily subscribe to the
                        doctrine that it "should be extended over a fair period for redemption."
                        Believing in the profound thought uttered by the "late lamented," that "it
                        is much easier to pay a small sum than a large one," we also affirm that "it
                        is the duty of Congress to reduce the rate of interest thereon whenever it
                        can honestly be done."</p>
                    <p>No patriot will certainly have any objection to the improvement of our
                        National credit, for, Heaven knows, the Radicals have run it down to a very
                        low point, and an upward tendency would surely not hurt anybody. As to
                        "repudiation, partial or total, open or covert, threatened or suspected," we
                        don't know anything. That resolution must be striking at Stevens and Butler.
                        We knew all along that Butler is an infernally jealous scamp, and presumed
                        that as he "gobbled up" a big pile of gold in New Orleans, he did not care
                        about anybody else having more of the glittering dust than he, but we had no
                        idea that he was so utterly lost to all sense of honor as to desire to
                        repudiate the bonds, some of which were perhaps
                        given to raise money to pay him, when he was performing his far-famed
                        military exploits. The sixth resolution looks as though it were intended for
                        him.</p>
                    <p>It is entirely too late in the day for the Radicals to attempt to cozen the
                        naturalized citizens of this country into the support of their nominees.
                        This class of our citizens are not possessed of "short memories." They
                        remember well who it was that proscribed them and sought to rob them of the
                        rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and the laws. And they
                        naturally suspect the motives of men who suddenly change front and seek to
                        be converted "in the twinkling of an eye" from open enemies to loud mouthed
                        friends.</p>
                    <p>They knew well that it has ever been part of the creed of the Democratic
                        party that "naturalized citizens are entitled to be protected in all their
                        rights of citizenship as though they were native born," and the mere
                        adoption of this resolution, framed for no other purpose than to catch
                        votes, by men who at the midnight hour, years ago, met in secret conclave to
                        devise ways and means to strip naturalized citizens of their rights, will
                        fall far short of accomplishing the designs. Stealing Democratic thunder
                        even will not save the Radicals from an overwhelming defeat.</p>
                    <p>Of course, we all honor the "soldiers and seamen who endured the hardships of
                        campaign and cruise, and imperiled their lives in the service of the
                        country." We all admit the nation's obligations to pay their bounties and
                        pensions and to protect their widows and orphans. A good deal of that kind
                        of stuff is put in political platforms now-a-days to catch the votes of
                        soldiers. Everybody assents to it for their country. But it has ceased to
                        have the effect intended.</p>
                    <p>The Democracy have always said that foreign immigration "should be fostered
                        and encouraged by a liberal and just policy," and every American, would
                        blush to acknowledge that he is not in "sympathy with all the oppressed
                        people which are struggling for their rights."</p>
                    <p>This is the substance of the resolutions named, and in regard to them there
                        is no argument needed, for the reason that the Democrats do not dissent from
                        the doctrines therein announced.</p>
                    <p>The seventh resolution also, which says that "the government of the United
                        States should be administered with the strictest economy" we can heartily
                        endorse with the exception of the unjust fling at President Johnson.</p>
                    <p>We unite with the Radical Convention in deploring the tragic death of Abraham
                        Lincoln, not that he was any too good, or that he was in any sense great,
                        but on account of the manner of his "taking off."
                        But the remainder of the eighth resolution being denunciatory of the
                        administration of Andrew Johnson, and forming a tissue of the wildest
                        falsehoods and most groundless charges, we join issue on it and will, with
                        perfect confidence in the result, submit it to the people of the United
                        States for their decision. We have not the slightest fear that their
                        decision will justify the thirty five Radical Senators in voting for his
                        conviction on the impeachment articles.</p>
                    <p>The great campaign which has been opened by the nomination of Grant and
                        Colfax is not to be fought out upon these minor issues. True they will add
                        to the weight of ignominy under which the Radical party will sink, but the
                        millstones which will grind it to power are the principles embodied in the
                        first and second resolutions of the Chicago platform which are as follows:</p>
                    <p>First. We congratulate the country on the assured
                        success of the reconstruction projects of Congress, as evinced by the
                        adoption in a majority of the States lately in rebellion of constitutions
                        securing equal civil and political rights to all, and regard it as the duty
                        of the government to sustain these institutions and to prevent the people of
                        such states from being remitted to a state of anarchy.</p>
                    <p>Second. The guarantee by Congress of equal
                        suffrage to all loyal men at the South was demanded by every consideration
                        of public safety, of gratitude, and of justice and must be maintained; while
                        the question of suffrage in all the loyal States properly belongs to the
                        people of these States.</p>
                    <p>The American people believe in a republican form of government. They have a
                        hatred of despotism. They will not tolerate the "one-man power." They love
                        the symplicity and perfect freedom of democratic institutions.
                        Hence their natural aversion to large standing armies in times of peace.
                        Hence their disgust for brainless fops who strut around clad in military
                        uniforms when no danger threatens. And hence will come their withering
                        denunciation of the reckless men who have kept eleven states of this Union
                        under the shadow of military rule which has blighted the wealth of their
                        people, robbed them of their energies and placed the fetters of slavery upon
                        their limbs. The voice of the people of the United States will be raised for
                        the abolition of all military governments, and the substitution, in their
                        stead, of State governments which represent the untrammeled will of the
                        people of each State. The cry will go up for no more ballot--box stuffing
                        and no more carrying of elections at the point of the bayonet. The honest
                        masses are longing for a return to the good old days when the people of the
                        North were not taxed to maintain the governments of the
                            South.</p>
                    <p>And they hoot at the idea too, incorporated in the Constitutions which
                        Northern carpet-baggers have framed for the Southern people, that those
                        States are to be admitted to representation in Congress only upon the
                        condition that they will never deprive the negroes of the right of suffrage.
                        And this brings us to the second resolution of the platform which insists
                        upon the necessity of clothing the negro with the right of suffrage in the
                        South whilst it expressly leaves it as a question for the decision of the
                        people of the several States of the North. If the people of the North can be
                        induced to accept and endorse this doctrine, that Congress has the right and
                        power to stipulate who shall vote and who shall not in
                            any State of this Union, then we confess that our confidence in
                        the stability of this Republic is entirely swept away.</p>
                    <p>It must be borne in mind that the suffrage clause has been forced upon the
                        Southern States by a Congress in which none of these
                            States are represented. And more, by a Congress many of whose
                        members have been utterly repudiated by the people of the States voting
                        within the last year. Such members, in voting for this doctrine, have been
                        violating the clearly-expressed wishes of their constituents.</p>
                    <p>This resolution favors negro suffrage in the South but refuses to commit the
                        party to it in the North. The Convention would have liked to declare for
                        equal suffrage throughout the Union, but it lacked the moral courage to do
                        so. It was afraid of the unpopularity of the doctrine. And so it imagined
                        that while the resolution passed would satisfy the Radicals, it would also
                        hoodwink the Conservatives who are in reality opposed to negro suffrage in
                        any shape.</p>
                    <p>Now, can any one tell us why, if the negro of the South, kept in ignorance,
                        as the Radicals have always charged, by the slaveholders of the South; not
                        allowed to learn anything; totally imbruted by slavery, is fitted for the
                        exercise of the privilege to vote--can any one tell us why the negro of the
                        Northern States, free, with all the advantages of free schools, constantly
                        associating with his white Christian brethren, is not equally qualified to
                        vote? To men of common sense the qualifications of the latter would
                        certainly seem to exceed the former. And yet the black man, with little more
                        sense than the dumb brute, in the South is allowed to vote, whilst the
                        Radical Convention leaves his more intelligent brother in the North beyond
                        the pale of equal rights at the polls. A negro is a negro everywhere. If
                        qualified for the proper exercise of the elective franchise in one State,
                        men of common sense will be apt to assume that he is fit to vote in any
                        State. And if Congress has the right to confer suffrage upon him in South
                        Carolina, a logician would have difficulty in denying it the right to confer
                        it upon him in Pennsylvania.--The true doctrine is that
                            it is a question for the people of each State, North or South. That is
                            the Democratic doctrine. And when submitted to the people of a
                        State, the Democrats will vote solid against extending the ballot to the
                        black man.</p>
                    <p>There is, however, a deeper purpose in the minds of the Radical leaders. If
                        they succeed in electing their candidates, they intend
                            to kick from beneath them this plank in their platform, and insist upon
                            universal suffrage for the negro. And that, too, not by the vote
                        of the people of each State, but by Act of Congress. That body is to be
                        exalted into the supreme power of this country.</p>
                    <p>The Philadelphia Press insists upon it that the
                        platform is strongly Radical and that it commits the Radical party to equal
                        rights for the negro everywhere. The Philadelphia Post takes the same view and says:</p>
                    <p>The Republican party has pledged itself and has pledged its candidates to
                        maintain equal suffrage in the South. Pledged to this, it is in effect
                        pledged to everything.--As surely as the colored man votes in the South, he
                        will vote in the North, and that he votes anywhere is the work of the
                        Republican party. That party is the creation of the negro. It owes its
                        existence to his wrongs; it can only preserve its power by giving him his
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>It argues sensibly and truthfully that the position assumed at Chicago must
                        inevitably be followed by the grant of suffrage to the negro in the North.
                        Conservative men of Franklin County, open your eyes to the real issue. You
                        who are opposed to negro suffrage, get ready to say so by your votes.--Do
                        not allow the Radical leaders to throw dust in your eyes any longer. Rally
                        with one accord to the support of the honored old Democratic party which
                        seeks to preserve this as a white man's government for all time to come.</p>

<b>Radical Misrepresentation</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Takes offense at Radical charges that Johnson escaped conviction because
                    the cards were stacked in his favor. Compares a regular trial, where 100% of a

                    necessary. Also gives examples of states which voted Democratic recently even
                    though their senators voted to convict, revealing how Senators don't always

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals are endeavoring to give prominence to the idea that the
                        President was especially favored in the impeachment trial by the provision
                        of the Constitution which requires two-thirds of
                        the Senators present to convict him of high crimes and misdemeanors. Will
                        they be good enough to inform us in what this advantage consists as compared
                        with persons tried in our courts? The fact is that the Constitution
                        discriminates against the President of the United
                        States. Take the case of a person charged with the most trivial offence
                        known to the law. He is tried by twelve jurors and he goes free unless all the jurors unite in pronouncing him guilty.
                        Nine--yes, eleven of the jurors may advocate and vote for conviction as long
                        as they remain in consultation, but if one of the number persists in voting
                        not guilty, the jury must be discharged. It will thus be seen that while the
                        man who commits the most trivial offence can not be punished unless his
                        judges are all of the same opinion, the President
                        of the United States may be convicted of "high crimes and misdemeanors" by
                        the vote of two-thirds of those who sit in
                        judgement upon him.--All this fuss about the President having been shielded
                        from punishment by this constitutional provision, therefore, amounts to
                        nothing. The advantage was all on the side of the impeachers.</p>
                    <p>It is said, however, that the President has been convicted by the people for the reason that the number of
                        Senators voting to convict is larger than the number voting to acquit.
                        Senators are not considered the immediate representatives of the
                        people.--Their term of office is six years. It will not be denied by any
                        intelligent man that public opinion is exceedingly changeable.--The party
                        which is the victor one year becomes the vanquished the next. Men who are
                        elected for a Senatorial term are hardly secure in their seats before they
                        witness the defeat of the party that elevated them to power. They are
                        expected therefore to hold themselves above the strifes of parties.--They
                        are not placed there to be governed in their action by the ever-changing
                        current of public sentiment. Just as jurors in our courts are deemed to have
                        shut themselves up against all out-side influences, so Senators are expected
                        to consult their own judgments as to those measures which will be best for
                        the nation without regard to their bearing upon the political parties of the
                        country. The votes of Senators in a great trial like that which has so
                        happily closed, ought, therefore, not to be taken as in any sense expressive
                        of the opinions of the people of the States which sent them to the Senate.</p>
                    <p>In this connection the effort has been made to brand with infamy the seven
                        Radical Senators who voted not guilty, upon the ground that they have not
                        given expression to the public opinion in the States from which they come.
                        But looking from this Radical stand-point how stands the case on the other side? Senator Ferry, of Connecticut, a
                        stern Democrat, has been twice elected Governor of that State within the
                        last sixteen months. Senators Cattell and Frelinghuysen voted guilty, and
                        yet the Democracy carried the State of New Jersey, which they claim to
                        represent, handsomely last fall.</p>
                    <p>Senator Cameron voted against the President, and yet the gallant Democracy of
                        Pennsylvania elected George Sharswood Supreme Judge in October last.</p>
                    <p>Senators Wade and Sherman voted guilty, and yet Ohio last fall buried the
                        negro doctrine of the Radical party completely out of sight, and elected a
                        Democratic Legislature.</p>
                    <p>Senators Morgan and Conkling voted guilty, and yet the great State of New
                        York last fall rolled up a majority of almost fifty thousand against the
                        Radical party.</p>
                    <p>Bah! what stuff! When Radical Senators thus act in defiance of the will of
                        the people of the States whose servants they are, it is time that Radical
                        papers and Radical orators should cease complaining that the Senators who
                        voted for the President's acquittal failed to reflect the wishes and
                        sentiments of their constituents. Let them be consistent in making their
                        charge.</p>

                    <p>Augusta, Ga., May 29, 1868.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday six white citizens of the town of Hamburg, S.C., opposite this
                        city, were arrested for refusing to permit the negroes to hold a political
                        meeting in Union church of that town. They were taken to Aiken, where they
                        will be tried by a military commission by order of General Canby.</p>
                    <p>How long shall these military commanders be allowed to abuse the patience of
                        the American people? We are rapidly establishing a despotism in this country
                        as monstrous and oppressive as that of Spain. A correspondent of the New
                        York Observer, writing from Grenada last week,
                        informs us that between four and five hundred political prisoners are now confined within the dungeons of the
                        Alhambra, many of whom are men of great wealth and the highest intellectual
                        culture. Here we have men, citizens of a country
                        that boasts of its freedom and the safeguards thrown around the rights of
                        its people, arrested without warrant and held for trial by a military
                        commission--and for what? For refusing to allow negroes
                            to hold a political meeting in a house dedicated to the service of
                            Almighty God. Let them be convicted of this heinous offence, and
                        thrown into prison. The negroes must be allowed to do just what they please.
                        They are the pet wards of the nation and the whites have no rights which
                        they are bound to respect.</p>
                    <p>This is the character of the military governments established under the
                        reconstruction policy of Congress, upon the successful working of which the
                        Chicago Convention congratulated the nation. Let the people rise in their
                        might, and hurl from power the men who countenance such encroachments upon
                        individual rights, in order to make of the negro an ebony idol for white men
                        to worship.</p>
                    <p>Let the Democracy hang their banners on the outer walls, bearing this
                        inscription, Down with military governments and military tyrants.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We feel like venturing the prediction that Chambersburg will, in the course
                        of a very few years, become as conspicuous for the magnitude of its business
                        as it now is for the beauty of its buildings. Located in the heart of one of
                        the richest vallies in the world, and in a position to command custom from
                        points even beyond the confines of that valley, it only needed that it
                        should have business housess in the hands of thorough business men in order that it might enjoy a traffic
                        such as few other towns of its size can boast.</p>
                    <p>It takes time to effect marked changes, but no one acquainted for many years
                        with the business of Chambersburg will deny that marked changes have taken
                        place in it. For some years past young and energetic men have been putting
                        their shoulders to the wheel of trade, and as a natural consequence the
                        wheel of trade has been revolving with increased velocity.</p>
                    <p>As an example of what energy, coupled with a thorough knowledge of business,
                        will accomplish, we may refer to the Grocery of Gelwicks &amp; Burkhart.
                        There are wholesale establishments in Baltimore and Philadelphia that do not
                        keep a heavier stock on hand than may at almost anytime be found at this
                        concern. They have, too such a variety of merchandise, that they can supply
                        country merchants with anything from a hogshead of syrup down to a box of
                        matches; farmers with anything from a barrel of fish or a sack of salt down
                        to a currycomb; and housekeepers from a barrel of sugar down to an ounce of
                        tea.</p>
                    <p>But although they deal in a wide range of goods and sell in quantities to
                        suit all classes of buyers, they are directing their energies more
                        particularly to sales in bulk of the heavier articles in their line. Their
                        ambition is to do an extensive wholesale business in articles largely
                        consumed by the public in general--such as sugar, syrup, molasses, coffee,
                        fish, salt, tobacco, oil, &amp;c.,--and if as successful as their
                        present prospects seem to indicate, they may at some future date confine
                        themselves to wholesale trade alone.</p>
                    <p>Of the single article of sugar, this firm recently laid in a stock that cost
                        six thousand dollars. It must be plain to the merest tyro in business, that
                        a purchase of this magnitude will enable Gelwicks &amp; Burkhart to sell
                        sugar as cheap in Chambersburg as any wholesale grocer can sell it in
                        Philadelphia or Baltimore. The wholesale grocer in the city buys sugar from
                        the refiner. So do Gelwicks &amp; Burkhart, and thus far they stand on
                        the same level. The city dealer has no railroad freight to pay, and in this
                        particular he has the advantage of the Chambersburg grocer.--But the
                        Chambersburg grocer has a vastly lighter rent and much lighter expenses in
                        general, and thus the matter of freight is more than overcome. Thus Gelwicks
                        &amp; Burkhart, buying on terms of equality with the wholesale grocer in
                        the city, have such advantages over him, notwithstanding the freight, that
                        they can sell cheaper in Chambersburg than he can in Philadelphia or
                        Baltimore. What is true, in this respect, of the article of sugar, is true
                        also of syrup, fish, salt, coffee, and the whole range of
                        merchandize in which they deal.</p>
                    <p>From these facts it must be apparent to all that small dealers in the
                        villages and at the cross roads in the country, where it will not "pay" to
                        buy any particular article by the thousand dollar's worth at a time, can do
                        better by buying in Chambersburg than by going to Baltimore or
                        Philadelphia.--They can save railroad fare, hotel expenses and
                        freight--heavy items--and they can save time. If any one doubts this, let
                        him call at Gelwicks &amp; Burkhart's and ascertain at what price they
                        will sell him a barrel of sugar, or molasses, or fish, or a sack of coffee
                        or salt. On comparing the city prices with theirs, we are confident he will
                        find it to his advantage to purchase here.</p>
                    <p>Farmers, and especially those who live at a considerable distance from town,
                        should purchase groceries in larger quantities than they usually do. They
                        would not only save the trouble that is attendant upon laying in supplies
                        every week or two, but they would save a good round sum of money in the
                        course of a year. Gelwicks &amp; Burkhart retail everything in their
                        line as cheap as any other establishment, but they make an important
                        reduction on the retail price when a large quantity of anything is taken.</p>
                    <p>We hope this firm will succeed in their effort, to build up an extensive
                        Wholesale Grocery in Chambersburg, and we feel tolerably confident they
                            will succeed. They have gone at it in the
                        right way. They understand their business. They buy from first hands in the cities, and in quantities that enable them to
                        buy at the very lowest prices, and they sell at small profits. The building
                        they occupy,large as it is, is too small to hold their stock, a considerable
                        part of which is stored in the warehouse at the railroad. Their success will
                        benefit the town and the county.</p>
