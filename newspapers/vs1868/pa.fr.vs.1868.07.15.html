                    Christian character. During his sickness he manifested great Christian
                    resignation, being entirely resigned to the will of Him who doeth all things
                    well. He died without a struggle, with his eyes raised to Heaven, his face
                    radiant with a smile, which reminded us more of a celestial inhabitant than one
                    over whom was closing the dull curtain of mortality. In his death his bereaved
                    wife lost a kind and affectionate husband, the community an active and esteemed
                    citizen and the church an energetic member."<br>(Names in announcement:  George H. Stouffer)</blockquote>
