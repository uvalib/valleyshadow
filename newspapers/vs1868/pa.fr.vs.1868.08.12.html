<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The drift of the tide is still toward us.--Every day accessions are made to
                        the Democracy. The Radicals are discouraged, despondent, utterly
                        disheartened. From every portion of the country comes condemnation of the
                        nefarious measures of the Radical Congress. The burden of misrule has become
                        so heavy that the people everywhere are moving to shake it off. Here and
                        there, prominent Radical politicians are dropping out of their party ranks
                        and joining the forces of the united, energetic Democracy. The overwhelming
                        defeats which Radicalism has experienced during the last year have convinced
                        the most sagacious among them that the party which grew fat and strong on
                        the blood and tears of the nation is about to receive its final rout at the
                        ballot-box in November. Kentucky ratifies the nomination of Seymour and
                        Blair by the tremendous majority of eighty thousand. With a voice of such
                        terrible volume that its sound will penetrate into the remotest places of
                        the land, she has uttered her withering denunciation of the atrocious
                        measures that have well nigh destroyed the American Republic. All the States
                        in which elections have been held since the last Congress convened have
                        united in proclaiming their impatience at, and their disapproval of, the
                        manner in which Radicalism has ruled the nation.</p>
                    <p>It was not enough to break the faith so solemnly pledged in the darkest hour
                        of the war. It was not enough to refuse to fulfill the promises made when
                        our people were longing for peace and a restored Union. It was not enough to
                        decline to quench the fires of sectional hatred which burned with such fury
                        during the struggle. No. Radicalism was not content with the Union
                        preserved, slavery abolished and the national honor vindicated. It was not
                        satisfied to go back to the quiet and prosperity which always mark an era of
                        peace. Excitement was necessary to its being. The crusade against slavery
                        gave to it its strength, and it imagined that Americans had become so
                            enamored of the negro, that they would be unwilling
                        to rest until the ignorant African was accorded all the rights of
                        citizenship. Hence they deemed it necessary to blockade the way of return of
                        the Southern States to the Union until the desires of their hearts could be
                        gratified. This has been the fruitful  of all our woes. Instead of
                        harmony and unity they have given us discord and disunion. They have not
                        hesitated to commit the most flagrant outrages in order to accomplish their
                        purpose. They have deliberately shut their eyes to the fact of a rapidly
                        increasing debt. They have witnessed the paralysis of trade in its every
                        department and have heard the mutterings of discontented, suffering
                        workingmen who have felt the blight that has fallen upon our industrial
                        interests. They have made no effort to find a remedy for all this. It
                        mattered not to them that business was stagnant so long as State Governments
                        were being ground to powder, and loyal negroes were shaping affairs in the
                        South so as to prolong the rule of the Radical party at Washington.</p>
                    <p>But the people are getting ready to hold a grand indignation meeting at the
                        polls in November. They have grown weary of uttering feeble protests and
                        seeing them totally disregarded. They have framed an indictment against the
                        Radical Congress, charging it with having committed the most atrocious
                        crimes, and they mean to press it and obtain a verdict of guilty. And after
                        the verdict will come the judgment.</p>
                    <p>Courage, Democrats. The skies are bright. Radicalism is waning. Sensible men
                        are disgusted with its extreme dogmas. White men feel the pride of their own
                        race aroused within their breasts. The negro exhibits no capacity to rule.
                        In the South, his elevation to office has encouraged him to commit the most
                        frightful excesses. We must meet the question fairly and squarely. White men must rule America.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The war damage claims assessors met at both Greencastle and Chambersburg in
                    the past week. They plan to return and also visit the other towns in Franklin
                    County. They were forced to adjourn in part because of fraud surrounding the
                    process. Swindlers from other counties claiming to be working with the
                    commissioners sold Franklin residents fake damage claim forms. The real
