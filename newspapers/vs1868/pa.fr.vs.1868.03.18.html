<b>The Panorama</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Review of a painting done by a man named Hershberger on the burning of
                    Chambersburg. Critic compares it with other paintings, noting the dearth of
                    people and soldiers visible in Hershberger's work.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Agreeable to notice Hershberger's "Panorama of the Invasion of Pennsylvania
                        and Burning of Chambersburg" was exhibited in the German Reformed church in
                        this place, on Saturday evening last, to a large and appreciative audience.
                        Without intending to draw invidious comparisons between Major Hershberger's
                        paintings and those of other artists whose productions have become
                        historical, we will endeavor to particularize:</p>
                    <p>"Gen. Stewart crossing the Potomac," is grand beyond description. True, it
                        represents only twelve or fifteen cavalrymen; but then the "trimmings" make
                        up for the woeful deficiency of sabres, horseflesh, et.
                            cetera. Considering that the crossing took place in the early
                        part of October, the representation of the trees, other than pine, along the
                        river bank, in bright green foliage, is true to nature--on the supposition
                        that Nature accommodated herself to the occasion.</p>
                    <p>The "Burning of Chambersburg" is represented in four different views, giving
                        the principal streets on fire. The scenes represent the conflagration after
                        it had fairly got under headway, but before the heat had driven the people
                        out of the streets; yet all is as quiet as a well-ordered Presbyterian
                        village on a sabbath afternoon. Not more than a half dozen Rebels and a
                        score of citizens are visible in a population of probably 3,000 excited and
                        almost frantic people. We are willing to concede to the people of
                        Chambersburg a full share of composure and self-possession, on all
                        occasions, but seriously doubt whether the gentleman represented standing
                        with his hands in his breeches pockets on the pavement in front of the Bank
                        building was the disinterested spectator he appears to be. As a picture of
                        Goldsmith's "Deserted village" on fire, the views would, probably, be
                        correct--as the "Burning of Chambersburg," we think a regiment or two of
                        terribly excited men in the foreground, would give it more of the real. But
                        we weren't at the fire; we merely guess.</p>
                    <p>But the grandeur of all the other scenes pales before that of "The Harvest of
                        Death." This exquisite poetical conception allegorically blended with the
                        sad realities of the great battle field of the war, is produced upon canvass
                        so truthfully that the audience at once realize, with painful intensity, all
                        the horrors and carnage incident to a mighty conflict of arms.</p>
                    <p>The scene chosen by the artist for realization of the full fruition of his
                        poetical and historical conceptions is a level plain near the National
                        cemetery, whereon during the second day's fight, the hosts of Gen.
                        Longstreet were so sorely repulsed by the Union army. That truly was a
                        "harvest of death;" and the wheatfields over which the contending armies
                        swayed that sultry July afternoon, that evening gave sepulchre to thousands
                        of dead. All this is represented by a field, upon which are visible nine
                        dead soldiers and a broken caisson.</p>
