<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A Convention of colored delegates from different counties of this State met
                        on Friday morning last, in the Wesleyan Union Church, on South Street in the
                        City of Harrisburg. The number of delegates was about one hundred. The
                        object of the Convention was to select delegates to a National Convention of
                        Colored Men to be held in Washington D. C. on the second Wednesday of
                        January 1869. In the call for this State Convention, it is alleged, that
                        though the colored men "had held aloft the flag of patriotism and loyalty
                        during our country's severest trials and shed their blood in preservation of
                        the Union, they are still in many States deprived, either partially or
                        totally, of the franchise and the right of trial by jury." The delegates to
                        the National Convention are to deliberate upon the best method of securing
                        the true interests and welfare of the colored masses. Mr. John Chambers,
                        col'd., of Snyder county, was elected temporary Chairman and Mr. O.L.C.
                        Hughes, col'd., of Harrisburg, permanent President.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Perry Stanton, col'd., of Shippensburg, was chosen one of the Vice
                        Presidents.</p>
                    <p>The delegates from this County were Messrs. Peter Plowden, Waiter at the
                        National Hotel (Trostle's) and Mr. Thomas L. White, Waiter in the restaurant
                        under Repository Hall. Mr. Plowden figured on the Finance Committee, whilst
                        Mr. White bore off the honor of delegate to the National Convention.</p>
                    <p>A committee of seven was appointed to nominate these delegates to the
                        National Convention. The Committee selected five of
                            their own number as delegates thereby exhibiting the rapidity
                        with which they learn the lessons taught them by their white brethren.</p>
                    <p>Resolutions strongly advocating the right of the colored race to perfect
                        equality with the whites were adopted. A committee was appointed to wait
                        upon the Governor, the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth,
                        and invite them to address the convention.</p>
                    <p>Our worthy Governor who fought so bravely for the rights of the colored
                        people during the war, and who unloosed his eloquent tongue at the
                        invitation of Judge Carson and spoke two hours in order to swell the Radical
                        majority in Montgomery and Peters townships, replied that he "sympathized
                        with the colored people and should like to be present this evening, but that he feared his engagements would not
                        permit." If he would have told the truth he would have said,
                        "Gentlemen, I am a candidate for renomination as Governor next year. If I am
                        caught in a negro convention, the conservative Republicans, who loathe the
                        idea of negro suffrage, will 'go back' on me. I must keep in the
                        back-ground." The Deputy Secretary of the Commonwealth rushed to the fore
                        front, however, and sent in the following letter:</p>
                    <p>STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.<br> OFFICE OF SEC'Y OF COMMONWEALTH<br> HARRISBURG,
                        PA., Nov. 13, 1868.</p>
                    <p>
                        To Merryman Cupit and others, Committee.
                    </p>
                    <p>GENTLEMEN: Accept my thanks for your kind invitation to visit the Convention
                        of Colored men now in session in the Wesleyan Church of Harrisburg. ALthough
                        I cannot be personally present, yet I shall be with you
                            in spirit, heartily sympathizing as I do, in your struggles for full
                            recognition as citizens of this State in common with your brethren of
                            other races. Trusting that the day is not far distant when the ballot
                            will be put into the hands of every colored man in Pennsylvania.</p>
                    <p>I am, yours, very respectfully. Issac R. Gara.</p>
                    <p>This is a sample of the kind of cattle that Geary keeps around him.</p>
                    <p>Hon. Murrow B. Lowry, (white) Radical Senator from Erie, then addressed the
                        Convention, paying his respects to the timid and weak-kneed in the Radical
                        ranks. He said,</p>
                    <p>The white race had given them (the negroes) nothing but chains and stripes,
                        and they never intended to give them anything else. They never would have
                        given them the musket had they not been compelled by dire necessity to do
                        so. It was not the Democracy alone that opposed the negro--even his
                        Republican friends had persecuted him. [Hear, hear, hear.] You must take
                        care of yourselves! [Applause.] God could have no affinity with a piety that
                        preached one doctrine and practiced another. Why was it that church
                        ministers and the people could sit still and see a colored woman brutally
                        kicked out of a street car? You have got to cut your own way through by
                        firm, good behavior. There were all over the land weak-kneed, disgraceful
                        Republicans, who aided the enemies of the negro and applauded the wrong done
                        the black race for the last two hundred years. Thank God, they still had
                        many good Republicans, the Quakers and God on their side! [Tremendous
                        cheers.]</p>
                    <p>The audience then rose to their feet and gave Mr. Lowry three times three
                        cheers followed by the choir with--<br> "John Brown's body lies mouldering
                        in the grave,<br> His soul is marching on."</p>
                    <p>Immediately before adjournment it was resolved that the celebration of the
                        anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation on the 22d of next September be
                        held in Chambersburg.</p>
                    <p>How do you relish these proceedings, weak-kneed Republicans of Franklin
                        county? You that have reiterated the statement over and over again and sworn
                        to it, that you would never vote for negro suffrage, how does it "go down"
                        now? The loyal press is clamoring for it. The Radical leaders are about to
                        agitate it in Congress? What do you say on this question in Franklin county?
                        When you voted for Grant, you opened the gate through which negro suffrage
                        will flow in upon you. You closed your eyes and gulped it down; now stop
                        making wry faces at the dose.</p>

                        To the Republican Voters of the 16th Congressional
                            District, and the Public Generally.
                    </p>
                    <p> MT. ALTO, FRANKLIN COL., PA.,<br> 2d Nov. 1868.</p>
                    <p>"As a dog returneth to his vomit," so the Franklin
                            Repository "returneth to its folly," the assumed organ of the
                        Republican party casting its slime at the reputation of Republicans, who
                        decline being led or driven into prostituting personal manhood and
                        integrity, principles and party, to the aggrandizement of a few, the
                        self-constituted directory of the Republicans of Franklin county. Such
                        slanderous assaults seldom produce the intended effect.</p>
                    <p>Before this reaches my fellow citizens, the political campaign of 1868 will
                        have closed, with a result that is not doubtful, viz, the success of the
                        Republican ticket; and I feel that no apology is necessary for now intruding
                        upon you this card; as a decent respect for the opinion of my fellow men
                        demands that I should make known the motives which prompted my course during
                        this campaign. Arrogating to myself no great familiarity with the
                        generalities and abstractions of politics, but relying only upon the
                        experience of the past and the vindication which truth always realizes, I
                        can only present these facts, without malice, in a plain, practical light,
                        and ask my readers to draw their own conclusions.</p>
                    <p>Over a year ago I was solicited by Republicans in this county to become a
                        candidate for nomination for Congress, and for several months I was
                        importuned to this end, not by a few from one locality, but by gentlemen
                        residing in different townships in this county, and to each and all, on
                        every occasion, I declared my unwillingness.</p>
                    <p>In March last, I noticed an article in the Repository, recommending me as a suitable person for such
                        nomination, written without my knowledge and by whom, I knew not--and I
                        reiterated to all inquiring friends again, that I was not a candidate, and
                        had no intention to become such.</p>
                    <p>Soon after this, certain gentlemen besought me with all apparent kindness, to
                        become a candidate for the State Senate; to all of whom I gave an emphatic
                        denial, stating that I was not an aspirant for any political honors.</p>
                    <p>In the issue of the Repository dated 1st July, an
                        article, written, I believe by Captain Geo. Eyster, and signed "Franklin,"
                        appeared in the interest of Mr. Cessna, bringing into invidious comparison
                        the names of Gen. Koontz and myself. As to myself, it stated, flatteringly,
                        that I had "qualifications for the place"--charitably, that I "was a gallant
                        soldier in the war for the Union"--truthfully, that I was "a consistent
                        Republican"--kindly, that I was "a good worker in the cause"--deprecatingly,
                        that I was "a comparative stranger in the County and District," too much so
                        to merit the barren compliment; and finally that he did not know I or other
                        "worthy military gentlemen named" were solicitous of the compliment.</p>
                    <p>On the 3d of July, arriving in Chambersburg, on my way home from
                        Philadelphia, I was met at the cars by the Junior Editor of the Repository, Mr. Hays, who, assuring me of his
                        undying friendship, referred to the above mentioned article, and stated that
                        he did not think it would harm me--that he was satisfied I would not object
                        to it when I read it carefully. He told me, that a few young men in town,
                        (Mr. Cook, Capt. Eyster and others.) who with himself were my personal and
                        political friends, and who desired my nomination and election to Congress,
                        were apprehensive that I had placed myself in bad hands--that my nomination
                        was a foregone conclusion, and they were solicitous lest I should attribute
                        the success solely to these "bad hands," and give to them the distribution of public patronage in this county,
                        while these "few young men who always went together" thought they could do
                        more to further my success; that hence I should place myself in their hands
                        and ignore those who had written in my favor, and all would go well. I
                        replied to him; that I was not aware that I was in the hands of any person
                        or persons, and respectfully declined placing myself in such position; that
                        the articles had been written without my knowledge or consent--that I
                        appreciated the expressions of good will and friendship, but that my friends
                        would best manifest their kindness to me by dropping the use of my name
                        altogether, as I had no desire to become a candidate--that if ever I became
                        an office holder, it would be in the interest of my whole constituency, and
                        I could never so far forget myself as to sell myself or my party to any
                        clique or ring. He replied, "Yes, but you cannot help being a candidate, and
                        we will work and secure you election;" and then he politely invited me to
                        meet a few mutual friends at his office after supper, to tell them also that
                        I had not placed myself in the hands of the Gehrs &amp; Stumbaugh. I
                        consented to meet these friends and advise them of my whole position in this
                        matter.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after supper, I was waited upon at the Hotel by Mr. Hays, and was
                        accompanied by him and Col. Theo. McGowan, (who manifested decided
                        unwillingness to go,) to the office of Cook &amp; Hays. We found there
                        Jere. Cook and John Stewart, Esq's, and Capt. George Eyster and subsequently
                        were joined by Dr. Samuel G. Lane. I was handed a copy of the Repository containing "Franklin's" article, and
                        after reading it carefully, that personally I had no objection to it; that I
                        could not endorse the arguments used, as I regarded them specious and weak,
                        in that, the only objection to me was the "short time I had been in the
                        district;" for however true that was, it was notorious that my "emigration"
                        hither, ante-dated Mr. Cessna's indentification with the
                        Republican party; yet I would feel gratified if the article would effect the
                        dropping of my name in connection with the candidacy, as I had no political
                        aspirations.</p>
                    <p>I do not propose to consume time by giving in detail all that occurred at
                        this later-view; which has been very appropriately styled by one present as
                        a "pitfall," but merely to give the substance of what seemed pertinent. The
                        gentleman all avowed their personal and political friendship for me, and
                        assured me of it particularly in connection with the question before them,
                        and said I would certainly get the Franklin county nomination. They
                        intimated or charged that those who had been using my name were not acting
                        in good faith toward me, but were merely using me in the interest of Gen.
                        Koontz. I was subjected to a general catechisation as to this:--was asked
                        where I would throw my influence in case my failure in the District
                        conference became apparent; to accept the nomination for State Senator; as
                        to the distribution of the patronage in case of an election? &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>The "few young gentlemen who always went together," had no particular
                        spokesman to represent them, but each one present spoke for himself, and the
                        conversation was quite desultory. And it would probably be unfair to hold
                        all responsible for the views of each one.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Samuel G. Lane not only expressed his disapproval of the questions asked
                        me, and of the whole tenor of the interview, but protested against my
                        replying, and stated that he was invited to be present as a friend of mine,
                        and not for the purpose of insulting me or conniving against me. Col.
                        McGowan stated that he had not been aware that the object of the meeting was
                        as it had developed itself, or he would not have been present, and Mr.
                        Stewart, I think, said he had not understood the object of the interview.
                        However, I preferred replying to the interrogatories, notwithstanding the
                        protest of my friend, Dr. Lane, and did so in effect thus:--</p>
                    <p>I was not aware that Messrs. Gehrs and Stumbaugh had any preference for Gen.
                        Koontz over Mr. Cessna; that I did not believe they were actuated by any
                        motives but those of friendship for me, and interest in what they believed
                        to be the welfare of our county and party; that I declined being made a
                        catspaw of, to pull either Mr. Cessna's or Gen. Koontz's chestnuts out of
                        the fire, and hence would not pledge my influence to either, in the event
                        suggested, which event could not occur, as I would not be a candidate; that
                        I would not accept the candidacy for State Senate or any other office; that
                        if I ever became a candidate it would not be of a fragment of the party, but
                        of the whole party: that if I ever became an officeholder, it would be in
                        the interest of my whole constituency to whom I would be individually
                        responsible, and hence would not pledge or promise any patronage to a few.</p>
                    <p>Whether these replies suited the "few young gentlemen who always,"
                        &amp;c., or not, or whether they imagined they could "do better" with some other candidate, can be
                        inferred from the sequel.</p>
                    <p>All reiterated their protestations of friendship for me; assured me that I
                        would have to take the County nomination; only Capt. Eyster kindly
                        admonished me, that whatever was done against me, was not on my own
                        account--was not for any lack of affection for me, but was intended to be
                        against Stumbaugh and Gehrs.</p>
                    <p>Who would not exclaim: "Heaven, save me from my friends!"</p>
                    <p>It was suggested to me that it would be better not to repeat what had
                        occurred at this "pitfall," and I assented, but have concluded since, that
                        'tis better to have it known; and that I have given the substance of what
                        there occurred, truthfully, Dr. Lane, Col. McGowan and John Stewart, Esq.,
                        could not but hear testimony.</p>
                    <p>The Repository, in its issue of 15th July, gave
                        notice that articles on the Congressional question were crowded out for want
                        of space, but would appear in the next issue.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, on the evening of 18th July, John Cessna was at the National Hotel
                        in Chambersburg, where, I have been informed, he met some of his friends,
                        and among others in his interest, some of the gentlemen hereinbefore named.
                        I am informed further, that after denouncing Col. Stumbaugh, the following
                        arrangements were consummated. Some man was to go to Welsh Run and
                        Southampton Township, and one or more were to go to the Northern part of the
                        County, in order to have the Delegates to the Convention instructed in favor
                        of Mr. Cessna--Mr. Cessna saying, "I must carry Franklin
                            County at all hazards, and will pay all it costs," or words to
                        this effect. I believe Capt. Eyster did go to Welsh Run and Mt. Rock
                        Districts; other persons went to the Valley and other parts of the County,
                        and the Delegates were generally instructed for Mr. Cessna; whether by
                        reason and in pursuance of the arrangements made at the National Hotel on
                        the evening of the 18th, I leave the public to judge.</p>
                    <p>The crowded out articles on the Congressional question, did appear in the
                        "next issue" of the Repository, viz: the 22d July
                        last, just four days subsequent to the Cessna Meeting at
                            the National Hotel.</p>
                    <p>They not only preached Mr. Cessna up, to which no one could have objected,
                        but, if memory serves me, preached me down. The same writer, "Franklin," who
                        had so charitably given me credit, as "a gallant soldier in the war for the
                        Union," now asserts what he must have known to be untrue, and attempts to
                        be-little my military services. "Franklin" referring to the organization of
                        drafted men! Ye that were drafted observe! I feel thankful that the drafted
                        men of 1863 are my friends. Can "Franklin" say as much of those of '65?--But
                        my war record needs no vindication or defense at my hands from such as he,
                        and so I leave it. "Franklin" did not confine himself to this, but
                        "annihilated" me entirely; fearing doubtless, that notwithstanding I had
                        advised him that I would not be a candidate, that I might repent and injure
                        his friend's prospects. If this was done only on account of those who had
                        the temerity to avow themselves my friends, and done with kindly feelings
                        toward me, I wonder whose sins "Franklin" was visiting on Gen. Koontz's head
                        in the same chaste article. From this time forward, the Editors of the Repository, Messrs. Cook &amp; Hays, closed their columns against all articles on the
                            Congressional questions not favorable to Mr. Cessna.</p>
                    <p>Friends of mine appeared to increase and I was urged from all quarters, that
                        now in self defense, I must come out as a candidate.</p>
                    <p>But the reasons which had prompted my declination from the first had not
                        modified or changed, and I persisted in my refusal to allow the use of my
                        name. Finally, on the Friday preceding the convention, I concluded that in
                        order to fully develop the machinations of this ring, (of "a few young
                        gentlemen, who always" &amp;c.) I would permit my name to come before
                        the convention, and so advised, by mail, at that late date, a few friends in
                        five districts. From these, where not previously instructed came the 24
                        votes for me.</p>
                    <p>The proceedings of the convention are too fully known, to require any account
                        from me; all who were there, know that the report in the Repository was neither correct or full. The resolution, so
                        fulsome of my praise, only betrayed the imbecility of my friends of the
                        "ring," and forced me to speak in self defense. And the same voices who
                        treacherously lauded me through that resolution; after the October election,
                        were ready with "slay him." The report which the Repository gives in its issue of 21st of October of my speech
                        before the convention is unqualifiedly false in every particular, as all who
                        were present know, and as the editors themselves know. I asked the
                        convention to establish the distinction which existed between Republicans
                        and especially a Republican organ attacking Republican candidates for
                        nomination, and Republicans attacking their own candidates for election; and
                        warned them that in countenancing the action of the Repository in endorsing factional spirit, a precedent would be
                        established that would militate against our candidates at the polls. I
                        endorsed as the sentiment of the Republican party, the words of Gen. Grant:
                        "Let us have peace," but I disavowed all peace which had to be purchased by
                        a servile cringing to the presumption of arrogant demagogues. In my speeches
                        during the campaign, I urged my hearers to support the ticket, for the same
                        reasons which caused me to refrain from exposing to the convention, the
                        honorable (?) workings of the "few young gentlemen, who always," &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>I strove to avoid all things, that would at all jeopardize the success of
                        Republican principles; for as I have stated publicly heretofore, I do not
                        hold to the faith because it is called Republican, but I have been and still
                        am a Republican solely on account of the principles; and when if ever the
                        Republican party drifts from what I believe to be the channels of truth and
                        rectitude; proves false to human rights and progress, and ignores what my
                        conscience approves; then it drifts from and ignores me.</p>
                    <p>It is not my purpose in this card to convey the idea that Mr. Cessna was
                        aware of or approved the erratic course of "The few young gentlemen," etc;
                        neither that he made any bargain with them, in pursuance of which they
                        adopted their Anti-Republican programme. I only present facts as they were
                        present with me, and each one can draw his own inference, the correctness of
                        which the developments of time may demonstrate. Neither do I realize any
                        propriety in referring to the past political record of Mr. Cessna, or to the
                        previous omissions and commissions of the "few young gentlemen,"
                        &amp;c., but feeling the great importance to the people, that the
                        control of the Republican party should not pass into the hands of
                        politicians; that they should not permit men whose main business is office
                        seeking, "to eject delegates from conventions and select candidates," I
                        could not indorse, from any considerations of personal interest, or mistaken
                        political expediency, measures, the legitimate fruit of which was the
                        substitution of "apathy and disgust for earnestness and enthusiasm in our
                        party." And while I bow to the expressed will of the majority in conventions
                        or at the polls, yet I respectfully urge my humble protest, notwithstanding
                        my "lack of common honesty and common sense," in the judgement of these
                        paragons of purity, faithfulness, wisdom and integrity, who have assailed
                        me, against any result so questionably obtained. Hence in the township in
                        which I live, at Quincy Polls, I paid my respects, openly, fairly, and, I
                        thought, modestly, to the representatives of the "few young gentlemen who
                        always went together." This was done without any consultation with any
                        person or persons, and without any positive knowledge, that the "few young
                        gentlemen" would receive any attention elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Immediately after the October election, in order, as it were, to verify the
                        11th verse of the 26th chapter Proverbs, the Repository again "annihilates" me, and alas! some of my friends.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the editorials in their issues of 21st and 28th October, I
                        declare the statement, charges, insinuation, or whatever term they may apply
                        to it so far as they relate to me, to be totally false in every particular,
                        and that they knew it to be untrue and had no adequate ground for believing
                        it to be otherwise. And thus I stigmatize all the reports of like tenor;
                        that I was a renegade Democrat; that I had sold out to the Democracy or had
                        combined with them that I had been instrumental in defeating our candidate
                        for State Senator; that my course had injured the whole ticket; as untrue
                        and worthy only of emanating from the same impure source.</p>
                    <p>To those of my friends who regretted my course, fearing that it would effect
                        my popularity, I can only quote the sentiment of another: "I would rather be
                        right than popular." For whatever may be the views of others, I shall still
                        remain of the opinion, "that honesty in politics, as in business and the
                        private affairs of life, is the best policy," and that the present Editors
                        of the Repository, aye, all of the "few young men
                        who always," etc., are constitutionally, totally incompetent to be the
                        "representatives of the deep conviction and the high moral honor which
                        constitute the strength of the Republican party."</p>
                    <p>Already have prominent Democrats recognized the Repository under its present management, as a "powerful machine
                        to build up their party and break down Republican interests," and thus that
                        paper has, whether from ignorance or evil intent it matters not, placed
                        itself in the van, as the champion of "selfish organization," from the
                        thraldom of which our party must be redeemed by "such reforms as shall
                        popularize the system of party organization, by making the voice of the
                        people directly felt in the decisions of all questions of party discipline.</p>
                    <p>This model newspaper which seems to be edited with the sole purpose of
                        furthering the interests and feathering the "nests" of "those few young
                        gentlemen who always go together," which advocates by its course,
                            partizanship and factional spirit in its worst form, under
                        the cloak of being the organ of great Republican principles which it is too
                        selfishly obtuse to comprehend, refused its columns before this campaign, to
                        articles which suited not their ends, and hence, fellow citizens, I would be
                        false to my own convictions of right, to consign this card to such hands,
                        and therefore present it to you in this shape. All the statements of facts
                        herein made I can sustain with incontrovertible evidence.</p>
                    <p>My action was not prompted by disappointed political ambition, for I had none
                        to gratify; it was not intended to be, nor can I see that it was, a
                        forsaking of my Republican friends, or an abandonment of my cherished
                        political faith; but it was the result of a firm conviction of duty, that
                        supercilious demagogueism should be rebuked; and in an humble but not less
                        positive way, I confirmed the consistency of my conclusions with my actions.
                        And whatever may be the opinions of those who may read this card, my motives
                        were none the less pure, and the award of my conscience satisfactory. GEO.
                        B. WEISTLING.</p>
