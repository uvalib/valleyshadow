                    <p>The debate in the House of Representatives, at Washington, on the 17th ult.,
                        which we publish on our first page, discloses the purpose of the Radical
                        leaders to force negro suffrage, sooner or later, upon every State in the
                        Union. It will be remembered with what indignation, the Republican of two
                        years ago was accustomed to meet the charge made by the Democrats, that the
                        Republican party was gravitating towards this doctrine. How earnestly he
                        protested against the accusation, and how eagerly he announced his intention
                        to abandon his party, whenever it would declare itself in favor of impartial
                        suffrage. The idea of the negro voting was exceedingly repugnant to his
                        judgement, and he indulged in oft-repeated threats as to what he would do,
                        whenever this should be made one of the fundamental tenets of his party
                        creed. Democrats can "spot" persons of this class in every election
                        District. When their remarks upon this subject are brought to their
                        recollection, how they twist, and wriggle, in order to escape from the
                        awkward dilemma in which they find themselves! They protested so loudly and
                        so strongly against the odious doctrine, when they were of the opinion that
                        they would never be called upon to swallow it, that now, when it has become
                        a leading measure of the party, they are forced to make very wry faces as
                        the order comes to them to gulp it down.</p>
                    <p>Men of honor, who pledged themselves to abandon the party whenever it would
                        reach this point, will cut loose from it and throw their influence against
                        it. But those who have no fixed principles of their own, and who make it a
                        rule to vote, as Stevens, Sumner, and their Radical party leaders direct,
                        will run counter to their former declarations, and vote to bring themselves
                        down to the level of the negro.</p>
                    <p>Let white men ponder upon the proposition which drew forth this debate to
                        which we have referred. It is not to allow negroes the rights to vote in the
                        South. That, Congress has done already. They lashed the Radical party into
                        the support of that measure, upon the plea that it was a necessity in order
                        to keep the State governments of the South out of the hands of the Rebels.
                        The consequence is, that negroes not only vote there, but they exercise a
                        controlling influence. They act as jurors. They sit in the conventions to
                        frame State constitutions and are, virtually, the masters of the white
                        people. In fact, the whites have very few rights which the negroes feel
                        bound to respect. But the scheme of the Radicals does not stop here. Negro
                        suffrage and negro supremacy in the South are not sufficient. The negro must exercise the right of suffrage in every
                            State of the Union. State constitutions must be amended in order
                        to conform to this doctrine. Pennsylvania must strike
                            the word "white" from her Constitution. Unless she does so, she
                        is to be held not to have a republican form of government. State rights are
                        no longer recognized. There is no such thing, any more, as a State right.
                        Congress is the government, supreme over all, with full power to fashion
                        State Constitutions as it pleases. The people of the State are to have no
                        opportunity to express their preferences on the subject. Universal and
                        impartial suffrage is to be forced upon the States. Thaddeus Stevens wills
                        it. All the Radical leaders favor it. The Constitution of the United States
                        must give way. These patriots are acting "outside the Constitution." The
                        negro is their God, and they are not satisfied with worshipping him
                        themselves. They have determined that everybody else must worship him
                        likewise.</p>
                    <p>Here is the amendment, offered by Thaddeus Stevens, to a bill now pending in
                        the House, by which, when it has been "snaked" through Congress, it is
                        expected to establish negro suffrage in all the States;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, offered an amendment providing that the right
                        of suffrage shall not be denied or abridged in any
                        State, except for treason, felony, or other crime infamous at common
                        law, but that suffrage shall forever be universal and impartial, and that
                        Congress shall have power to annul any act of Alabama in violation or
                        derogation of the acts with regard to suffrage, and that in case of the
                        Legislature reducing suffrage below the universal right, all legislation
                        admitting it into the Union shall be null and void.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>When Lee and Johnston surrendered their respective armies, the anxiety of the
                        intensely loyal people was exceedingly great as to the probability of the
                        escape of the arch-rebel Davis. It was feared that he would succeed in
                        disembarking from our country and reaching a foreign shore. A reward of a
                        hundred thousand dollars was offered for his capture, by the Government,
                        which has since been paid. Bands of military men scoured the whole South so
                        as to guard against the possibility of his getting off. Never were men more
                        vigilant, and their vigilance was crowned with success. Davis was
                        captured--captured in the Spring of Eighteen Hundred and Sixty-five. The
                        millions of the North shouted for joy. The cry went forth through all the
                        land that now the honor of the government must be vindicated by the speedy
                        conviction of the leader of the rebellion. The interests of the republic
                        demanded a judicial decision that secession is treason, and justice insisted
                        that "treason must be made odious."--Every one, therefore, anticipated an
                        early trial. A military commission was even talked of as a sure and swift
                        means of bringing the offender to punishment.</p>
                    <p>Time passed slowly. The illustrious prisoner, guarded and manacled, was
                        confined within the walls of a fortress, and complaining bitterly of the
                        hopeless imprisonment to which he seemed to be consigned. The Chief Justice could not find time to try his
                        case. Never within the memory of man has such a case been tried as
                        that would have been. But its magnitude and importance could not gain any
                        advancement for it. Two years elapsed. At last, the prisoner was removed to
                        Richmond--but not for trial. He was released on bail, two eminent Radicals
                        becoming his bondsmen. And now, there is a settled conviction in the public
                        mind that there is no intention whatever to try him at
                            all. He travels wheresoever he pleases, and it would be a
                        wonderful relief to Mr. Chase and the whole Radical party, if he would die,
                        or flee the country.</p>
                    <p>Jefferson Davis was the representative man of the rebellion. He was the head
                        and front of the conspiracy to overthrow the government. His was the treason
                        which sent hundreds and thousands of our bravest and best to untimely
                        graves. And yet, there is no trial for him. Radicalism is afraid of the
                        questions involved in his trial. It has dodged them for nearly three years.</p>
                    <p>But look at another picture. While Jeff Davis and the other Southern Senators
                        were delivering their speeches in the Senate Chamber, announcing their
                        intention to withdraw from the Union and set up for themselves; while, day
                        after day, treasonable language was spoken and treasonable acts were being
                        performed, there was one Southern Senator--and only one--who refused to
                        follow the lead of Davis, Yancey and Toombs. One who thundered his
                        denunciations of the secession project. One who uttered bolder words than
                        any which fell from the lips of Northern men, in opposition to the attempt
                        to dissever the Union. Who was he? Andrew
                        Johnson. And when the war broke out, and his own State of Tennessee
                        threw in her fortunes with the Southern Confederacy, he remained firm as a
                        rock, breasting and rolling back the tide of secession. As military
                        Governor, he took charge of that State and ruled it as with a rod of iron.
                        Indeed, nothing but his preeminent loyalty and self-sacrificing devotion to
                        his country, when all others of his southern brethren were faithless,
                        procured for him the nomination of Vice President at Baltimore. He was
                        lauded as the very embodiment of all that was noble, brave and patriotic.
                        Radicals shouted themselves hoarse at the mere mention of his name. It was
                        no common tribute of admiration that was paid to him, and it was no common
                        degree of worthiness that exacted the tribute. The people felt grateful to
                        him and did not hesitate to express their gratitude.</p>
                    <p>But how are they treating him now? They are hunting him down--they are
                        seeking to condemn him, and remove him from office, upon the flimsiest
                        pretexts ever devised by man, whilst Jeff Davis, instead of hanging "on a
                        sour apple tree," is at perfect liberty to go his own way without
                        molestation from any one. Treason appears to be at a premium in the
                        estimation of the Radical party, whilst the extreme loyalty of the war
                        stripe is at a discount.</p>
                    <p>Will not the people open their eyes to the injustice, if not to the monstrous
                        ridiculousness of the comparative treatment of these two men? Jeff. Davis denounced, hooted at, hissed as a traitor,
                            goes free. Andrew Johnson, flattered, applauded deified as the true type
                            of loyalty, is arraigned before the high Court of Impeachment.--Davis is
                            allowed to go unpunished for violating the Constitution, and attempting
                            to dissolve the Union. Johnson is to be convicted of high crimes and
                            misdemeanors, and removed from the Presidential chair, for defending the
                            Constitution, and insisting that the Union is not, and can not be
                            dissolved. Let the people ponder upon these facts.</p>

                    <p>The young men who are now attempting to form a Young Mens Christian
                        Association in our town, contemplate having a library and reading room. If
                        they are successful in their benevolent enterprise of forming the
                        association, and it is thought by some persons, that the library will be a
                        public one.</p>
                    <p>Now there is surely no one who will act in opposition to this movement nor
                        fail to contribute largely to its being successfully "carried out."</p>
                    <p>The advantage of a Public Library is obvious, and it is the duty of every
                        citizen, especially those favored pecuniarily, to heartily co-operate with
                        the excellent gentlemen of the society and assist them to raise money and
                        books, and you who do, will, perhaps, be rewarded by seeing some young
                        friend, who had formerly been in the habit of passing his leisure hours in
                        the billiard saloon, or upon the street corners, in the society of the
                        vulgar and ignorant, spend them afterward in the library--which you helped
                        to construct--with intelligent and religious friends.</p>

                        borrowers, are therefore, ofttimes without literature of any kind.</p>
                    <p>Hence, it becomes every one to lend a helping hand
                        that those who have a desire to cultivate their intellects by a proper
                        course of reading, may do so without paying an extravagant price for books
                        or periodical literature. If some of our wealthy citizens were as generous
                        as the benevolent Mr. Peabody, the Young Mens Christian Association would be
                            presented with a sum sufficient to purchase a
                        library, but as that would be almost miraculous, we presume the young
                        gentlemen of the society will hardly wait in idleness for the advent of so
                        extraordinary an event.</p>
                    <p>We, therefore, again urge all those who are at all interested in the mental
                        and material progress of our people, to also aid the society by donations,
                        whilst they countenance it with words. But should the people donate ever so
                        liberally money alone will not be adequate to sustain or impart vigor to the
                        enterprise. The society wants the learned and brilliant men of our town to
                        come forth from their philosophical retirement, and lend the charm of their
                        presence to the grand and noble project. We are of the opinion that the
                        personal efforts of the brilliant Mr. S---or the profound Dr. K---would be
                        of immense value to the association.</p>
                    <p>This is truly a utilitarian age, but it needs the fostering influence and
                        refining touch of erudition to shape popular thought and to instruct
                        mankind. The apocalyptic vision of the seer of Patmos--they rest not day nor night--should be remembered and cause
                        those who possess talents and accomplishments to work, tho' not for themselves alone, but for Humanity.</p>
                    <p>When Alexander the Great was a boy, he was grieved at his father's success as
                        a warrior and told his play-fellows "my father will leave me nothing to do",
                        but they answered, "he conquers all for thee." "But what good," says
                        Alexander, "will it do me, to possess much and do
                            nothing."</p>
                    <p>A noble ambition is profitable to society; otherwise, the arts would languish
                        and the sciences would be neglected. The desire of immortality and the
                        satisfaction accruing from noble actions, should encourage us more than
                        pecuniary rewards or the attainment of great riches.</p>
                    <p>Alexander gave kingdoms away as fast as he conquered them, and reserved for
                        himself no reward for his labor but the victory of having surmounted them.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, to the young gentlemen of the society, we would say, do not be
                        discouraged by adverse fortune. "The mills of the Gods grind slowly." It may
                        be sometime before your society becomes a thing of greatness, but if you are
                        valiant workers you will doubtlessly, eventually be victorious, and
                        afterward be rewarded by Him who is Sovereign of the Universe.</p>
