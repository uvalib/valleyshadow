                    <p>Next Saturday, as will be seen by the notice in another column, it is
                        proposed to strew the graves of our dead soldiers with flowers. We are glad
                        that this is to be done. It will be an appropriate tribute to the memory of
                        our citizens who fell upon the field of battle, or who died of disease in
                        the camp.</p>
                    <p>This custom was inaugurated in this country by the Rebels, who each year
                        decorate their cemeteries and the resting-places of their dead with
                        evergreens and flowers.--They thus strive to keep alive the recollections of
                        their former comrades and friends. And if they are to be admired for thus
                        casting their offerings of affection upon the graves of those who fell in
                        rebellion against the National Government, how much more ought we to emulate
                        each other in doing honor to those who sacrificed their lives in defence of
                        the Constitution and the Union!</p>
