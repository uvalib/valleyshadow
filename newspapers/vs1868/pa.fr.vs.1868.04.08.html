<b>Impeachment</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Again denounces the impeachment of Johnson. Says the charges are absurd and
                    vouches for Johnson's character while singling out a few Radicals for
                    condemnation. The paper is very pessimistic about the outcome because the editor
                    believes the lure of political reward will outweigh justice in the minds of
                    Republican senators.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The legitimate and necessary business of Congress is entirely suspended,
                        while the "high Old Court" is engaged in the trial of the President.
                        Business interests are suffering all over the country. Uneasiness is felt in
                        every department of trade. Goods are plenty and buyers are scarce. Employers
                        sit within their counting rooms, and clerks lounge on the counters. They
                        have nothing to do. Nobody knows what is coming next. There is no security
                        for the future. Men are afraid to buy. Such utter and complete stagnation
                        has rarely been witnessed before.</p>
                    <p>And yet Congress does nothing to relieve the country. They seem to close
                        their eyes to this terrible condition of affairs, and to be bent on nothing
                        but plotting to retain their hold on power.</p>
                    <p>They fancy that they will start upon a new lease of infinite duration, if
                        they can but oust Andrew Johnson from the Presidential Chair. Hence, all
                        their time and attention are given to this necessary work. It matters not to
                        them how the President is deposed. They care not whether the evidence
                        justifies his conviction or not. If necessary, they would willingly
                        manufacture the requisite testimony. Utterly unscrupulous, having no moral
                        ideas to govern their action, they have determined to revolutionize this
                        government entirely, rather than surrender their official positions for a
                        moment. It is not enough that States must be kept out of the Union, after
                        spending millions of money and sacrificing hundreds of thousands of lives to
                        keep them in the Union. It is not enough that all
                        republican governments must be wiped out within their limits, and unfettered
                        and irresponsible military despotisms be established in their stead: it is
                        not enough that the ignorant, imbrated negro must exercise the right of
                        suffrage, and lord it over his former masters; it is not enough that the
                        whites are disfranchised, save such as will acknowledge themselves inferior
                        to the negro.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding all this, the Radicals still tremble, lest they be beaten.
                        Consequently, they have laid their hands upon the Executive branch of the
                        Government. The President must be removed. And for no other reason than that
                        he is an obstacle in the way of the Radical party. The removal of Stanton is
                        simply a pretext. Behind this charge, laid in the articles of impeachment,
                        lie the true reasons for the Radical clamor for impeachment. The President's
                        open opposition to the Radical reconstruction policy; his known hostility to
                        negro suffrage; his perfect abhorrence of anything that savors of military
                        despotism; his repeated vetoes of unconstitutional bills; his sharp, spicy,
                        public denunciations of Radical men and measures, and his avowed devotion to
                        the old constitution of the United States--these constitute the real ground
                        for Radical action in the matter of impeachment.</p>
                    <p>The managers on the part of the House, manifest the most deadly personal
                        hostility to the President. It would be impossible to extract from the same
                        number of the most poisonous serpents, the quantity of venom that
                        Butler(whom Bingham publicly called a thief) alone spits out in the course
                        of a single day's proceedings. Not only does he desire the proceedings to be
                        hurried along at "railroad speed," but he seems to have lost all regard (if
                        he ever had any) for all the forms of law, and all the proprieties of a
                        Court. He entertains no respect for the rulings of the Chief Justice. Indeed
                        he does not even address him as such. He keeps no more account of him than
                        if he were merely the President of a country debating society. He
                        continually styles him "Mr. President." Of the same spirit are his brother
                        managers. Stevens dozes and nods in his chair, ambitious to figure in
                        history as lending his influence to the success of this nefarious plot, even
                        when he feels Death's clutches at his throat. As he does not believe in a
                        God, or a Heaven, or a Hell, and has surrendered himself wholly to the
                        worship of his ebony idol, it does not make much difference to him in what
                        infernal proceeding he is engaged when his last hour comes.</p>
                    <p>Bingham (whom Butler publicly calls a murderer) chimes in with the voice of
                        the man whom he has thus openly branded, and the two are "as thick as
                        pickpockets" in furthering this scheme for the removal of the President, who
                        entertains the most profound contempt for both.</p>
                    <p>But affairs do not glide along as smoothly as the Radical managers desired.
                        Mr. Chase, as we anticipated in our article of last week, assumed the right
                        to decide upon the admissibility of evidence without first consulting the
                        House Managers. A terrible hubbub was thus created. Drake, of Missouri, ran
                        wild. Sumner tore his hair in a perfect frenzy. An appeal was taken from the
                        decision of the Chief Justice. Pending this, a motion was made to retire for
                        consultation. The vote was a tie. The Chief Justice cut the knot by voting
                        affirmatively. Here was another bomb shell thrown into the Radical camp. Mr.
                        Chase not only claimed the right to decide upon the admissibility of
                        evidence, but he exercised the right to vote. After a long consultation, the
                        Senate sustained the Chief Justice, all the extreme Radicals opposing it.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding this vote, however, we do not hesitate to express the opinion
                        that the majority of the Senate will vote for the conviction of the
                        President, no matter how strong the defence may be. This was clearly
                        demonstrated by the vote, at a later stage of the proceedings, on the
                        admission of the whole of the Grant-Johnson correspondence. The Senate
                        admitted all of it that in any way bore against the President, but refused
                        to admit the balance, although in one of the papers submitted by the
                        Managers, the whole correspondence was distinctly referred to.</p>
                    <p>But a majority is not sufficient to convict. Two-thirds are required for this
                        purpose. Whether or not there are eight Radicals in the Senate possessed of
                        sufficient independence of character to carry out their convictions in the
                        matter, by voting to acquit, remains to be seen. We have no doubt that there
                        are more than eight who see the injustice and utter groundlessness of the
                        impeachment, but a refusal to vote for the President's conviction will be
                        regarded as "going back on" the party, and this may require more nerve than
                        they possess. It is hard for men to shake off party trammels, especially
                        when they are looking forward to political preferment. Hence, we still
                        incline to the opinion that Andrew Johnson has nothing favorable to hope for
                        from the Senate. We fear that "the thing has been set up."</p>

<b>A Breathing Spell</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper reports that the House impeachment managers closed their case
                    against Johnson. The editors assert that nothing has been proven against the
                    president except that he removed Stanton, and denounce the Radicals for
                    attaching importance to Grant's opinions on the case.<br>

<b>The Registry Law</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper asserts that the voter registration law passed by the state
                    legislature is nothing more than a Republican attempt to cheat their way to
                    electoral victory. The editors urge Democrats to study the law so they will know
                    what they must do to register, and call on them to vote heavily in the coming

                    victories in the future.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Repository says the Spring elections in
                        Franklin County were "indifferently attended," simply because it has no
                        other way to account for the extraordinary defeat which the Radicals
                        suffered at the polls. The fact of the Democrats electing the Judge in
                        Mercersburg, and the Radicals electing the Judge in Quincy, is no evidence
                        in itself of indifference. The Radical majority in the Mercersburg district
                        has been diminishing of late years wonderfully. In the Spring of 1866, the
                        Democrats elected the judge. The Democracy will carry that old Radical
                        stronghold one of these days.</p>
                    <p>As to Quincy, the Repository knows that the
                        election of the Radical Judge is owing to everything
                            else but indifference. All the other officers elected in that
                        township are Democrats, chosen by majorities ranging from forty to one
                        hundred. A special effort was made, in a special
                        manner, to elect the Radical Judge, and it succeeded. If there was
                        any "indifference," it was certainly on the Democratic side.</p>
                    <p>That way of accounting for defeats will not answer. General apathy is "played
                        out," and "indifferent attendance" has succeeded.</p>

                    <p>John Hickman, some time ago a member of Congress, now a member of the House
                        of Representatives at Harrisburg, from Chester county, recently used the
                        following language in the course of his speech in favor of striking the word
                        "white" from our State Constitution:</p>
                    <p>"I may possibly see the day that I may walk side by side with a colored
                        woman. I have seen a great many colored women that I would rather walk with
                        than a great many white men. I know a great many negroes who I think are
                        better entitled to vote this moment than a great many white men who do vote,
                        and have long exercised the franchise."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hickman is unquestionably the ablest Radical member of the House. He is
                        regarded as extremely Radical now, but in the words just quoted, he has
                        simply uttered the key note of the Radical party. Ere long, the leaders will
                        all openly take his position, and seek to "educate" the masses into the
                        support of the same doctrine. Let white men open their eyes to the fact that
                        negro suffrage and negro equality are live issues in the great contest
                        between the two parties of the country.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Sunday last, early in the morning, a colored man named Cornelius Vinster,
                        went to the residence of Mr. Benjamin Chambers on Front street and inquired
                        for him. The colored man who lives with Mr. Chambers, informed him that Mr.
                        C., was still in bed. Vinster said that there was terrible fighting going on
                        up street, and that they were killing the black folks. He wanted Mr.
                        Chambers' horse in order to make his escape. The other refused, when Vinster
                        "went for" him, and a struggle ensued. No serious damage was done to either.
                        After they separated, Vinster pretended to leave, but afterwards slipped
                        down to the stable, put a bridle on the horse, took him out and rode off at
                        a very rapid rate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Geo. Chambers, hearing some difficulty below, got up hurriedly, ran down
                        to the stable, got another horse and galloped in pursuit. When he got near
                        the toll-gate on the Shippensburg turnpike, he met Vinster returning, who
                        asked him whether the fighting was all over. Mr. Chambers took the horse
                        under his care, and Vinster was afterwards lodged in jail. His mind seems to
                        be unhinged, and he was evidently laboring under the idea that swift
                        destruction was coming upon the negro population.</p>
