<b>Increase of the President's Salary</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper comes out against the proposed measure to increase the
                    president's salary to $100,000 a year. The paper supports raising the
                    president's salary and believes presidents should make enough to retire on, but
                    is against the timing of the move. They believe it is a Radical offer to Grant
                    that would not have been proposed had Seymour been elected.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Why Does Grant Keep Quiet?</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Comments on the lack of political talk lately and attributes it to Grant's
                    total silence. Describes several incidents where Grant does not speak at the
                    public occasions he attends. Explains the reason for this is that Grant has no
                    policy and so cannot say anything to an anxious nation.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>There is a lull in politics. Men have ceased to discuss on the street-corners
                        and in places of business, the questions involved in the late contest. Why?
                        Radicals will say because the triumph of the Radical party settled these
                        questions. But this is not so. There never was a time when a stronger
                        feeling of unrest and disquiet existed among the people than that which now
                        exists. Men who voted the Radical ticket are not fully satisfied. There is a
                        vague apprehension of danger ahead. They do not know, and are afraid to
                        predict, what is to come next. They do not feel any certainty within their
                        breasts that the election of Grant is a guarantee of peace and prosperity
                        during the next four years. It is this very feeling of uncertainty as to the
                        future--this knowledge of the fact that nothing of the future policy of the
                        government has been settled definitely by Grant's election--that has caused,
                        and now continues, this lull in politics.</p>
                    <p>The Radical press insists that the election of Grant was an endorsement of
                        the Congressional Reconstruction policy. Grant smokes his cigar
                        complacently, and refuses to say anything.</p>
                    <p>Wendell Philips and John W. Forney clamor for negro suffrage. Grant smokes
                        his cigar, and says nothing.</p>
                    <p>Anna Dickinson writes a book in which she shows the blessings of
                        miscegenation and the intermarriage of blacks and whites. Grants smokes his
                        cigar, smiles and keeps silent.</p>
                    <p>At Harrisburg, Bergner and his crew get up a demonstration to do honor to the
                        Chief. Grant gets up from the dinner table, lights his cigar, advances to
                        the balcony of the Lochiel bows his acknowledgments, and "opens not his
                        mouth."</p>
                    <p>The Radical Mayor and black citizens of Washington call upon him and tender
                        him a grand reception. Grant puffs away at his cigar and declines the
                        proffered honor.</p>
                    <p>He goes to New York and the Union League prays the privilege of throwing open
                        its doors to do him reverence. Grant calls for a fresh cigar, and says he
                        would rather not.</p>
                    <p>Bonner drives Pocahontas around, and again Dexter, takes the silent man into
                        his machine, whirls him around the Central Park and back again to the
                        Metropolitan. Grant, all the while, smokes his cigar, admires "the points"
                        of the magnificent horses, enjoys himself hugely, but says nothing.</p>
                    <p>Edwards Pierrepont, who gave his check for $20,000 to aid in Grant's
                        election, invites him to tea, exhibits all his silver plate, talks glibly on
                        matters of state, but Grant puffs away at Pierrepont's cigars, and "talks
                        horses."</p>
                    <p>A splendid dinner is given in Attorney General Evarts while the President
                        elect is in New York. Charles O'Connor Esq presides and Grant and Evarts sit
                        upon his right and left hand. All the members of the New York Bar are in
                        attendance. A toast is drunk to the President-elect. He rises to his feet,
                        cigar in hand, says that there is no other community he would rather receive
                        praises from than the New York people, resumes his seat and the
                            weed, and on matters of state utters not a word.</p>
                    <p>Is it any wonder that there is a lull? When the people of the whole Union are
                        waiting anxiously to hear something as to the policy of the next
                        administration, is it any wonder that they are keeping quiet so that they
                        may hear? Is it not rather more strange that, having such a quiet,
                        attentive, anxious and immense audience, Grant refuses to speak a word for
                        the encouragement and hope of the country? The secret of his reticence is to
                        be found in the fact announced by himself, that he has
                            no policy. And this is the secret of the quiet disquiet of the American people.</p>

<b>Naturalization and Voting</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article points out that naturalization and voting rights are not
                    linked, as many believe. Naturalization is regulated by the Federal Government,
                    suffrage by the states, so it is possible to be naturalized but disfranchised,
                    or have voting rights and not be a naturalized citizen. The paper is in favor of
                    immediate naturalization for all white immigrants, and attacks the 5-year
                    waiting periods now in effect.<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper prints a rumor that some Radical Republicans in the electoral
                    college, worried about Grant's political views, intend to cast votes for

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A commentary from an anonymous worker calling for more pro-labor measures.

                    laws. Accuses both parties of only striving to win office rather than help their
                    constituents. Even says a monarch would be less of a burden on the country than
                    a President in some cases.<br>

                    <p>CHAMBERSBURG, Nov. 23, 1868.</p>
                    <p>Messrs Editors:--Now that the din and excitement
                        of the Campaign are over, the workingmen of Chambersburg and indeed of the
                        whole Country, ought to turn their attention to more important matters than
                        that of President making. It is all well enough so far as it goes, to have a
                        suitable man at the head of a great nation, but it is of far more
                        consequence to us as a people that we commence building our social and
                        political structure, from the bottom, and not from the top. We cannot
                        improve our social condition much by the election of either Seymour or
                        Grant; but by the adoption of Co-operative Stores, Workshops, and Factories,
                        we can. Society needs remodeling. Instead of taking such an apparent
                        interest in our respective candidates for the Presidency, we ought to take a
                        far deeper interest in our own well being. We foolishly think that our
                        social and moral status depends more upon who is President, than upon our
                        own united and individual efforts to raise ourselves in the social scale. If
                        we ever mean to be anything but "hewers of wood, and drawers of water" we
                        shall find it necessary to unite our little savings and be our own
                        employers.</p>
                    <p>Co-operation has been tried on a grand scale in England, and has proved a
                        grand success. Co-operative Workshops, Co-operative Stores, and Co-operative
                        Factories dot the whole Island. Were it not for this unity among the lower
                        classes, the "upper ten" would grind them to dust. Poverty then is, and has
                        been, a public educator. The laboring portion of the American people are
                        about taking lessons from the same cruel master. We have always as a people,
                        been killed with vanity and self conceit, but we have nothing to show for it
                        but long hours of labor and a cringing subserviency to employers that has
                        never been surpassed in any country, be it
                        republican or monarchical. It is time then that we stop boasting. Until we
                        have regulated the hours of labor in accordance with the laws of human
                        nature--until we have secured freedom of speech, and of the press--until we
                        cease to carry deadly weapons concealed about our persons with a view to
                        silence argument and discussion--until we get the full benefits of our labor
                        by being our own employers--until we have sufficient self-respect to abandon
                        the filthy use of tobacco, and above all, until we have carried out the
                        Jeffersonian idea of the "greatest possible good to the greatest number," we
                        shall have no reason to boast of the "greatness of our country"--meaning
                        thereby, the social, moral, and intellectual superiority of the American
                        people.</p>
                    <p>Some of us have seen nations where greater inequality existed as regards
                        riches, but we have never seen a people that submitted so tamely to an
                        employer's dicta, as the "Native born American." Our Legislatures may pass
                        eight or ten hour laws for the workingman's benefit, but they seldom or ever
                        get enforced; and the people look quietly on as though they had no interest
                        in the matter. A law is no law at all if it be not enforced. The law and its
                        enforcement are one. We should not call a human head without body a man;
                        neither should we call a human body without head a man; but when both are
                        united in natural order we then say, he is a complete man. And so it is with
                        a statute law. It does not follow that because our law makers expend much of
                        their time in devising plans and enacting laws for systematizing the hours
                        of labor in Factories and workshops that they have really accomplished any
                        good until they put their laws in force. We have laws for the collection of
                        taxes, but such laws generally get enforced. Our lawmakers know full well
                        that if the tax laws were not carried out they could not pay themselves, and
                        that would never do. They care nothing about Factory operative being injured
                        both in mind and body by the long hour system so general throughout this
                        country. Although a uniform Ten Hour law if rigidly enforced would benefit
                        society more than any law that has ever been devised, yet its importance
                        seems to be unappreciated by the great bulk of the American people. They
                        take more delight in chewing tobacco, talking light headed nonsense, and
                        following their party leaders through thick and thin, than they did in
                        improving their minds, and elevating their social and moral condition.</p>
                    <p>It is not the President of the United States, be he a Washington, a Lincoln,
                        a Grant, or a Seymour, that will confer these blessings upon us. It will
                        have to be done, if done at all, by our own efforts. We are too apt to
                        attach too much importance to the Presidential Office. Each party labors in
                        behalf of its own chosen candidate as though the weal or woe of the nation
                        were wrought up in him. No wonder that we have so many aspirants to the high
                        office--no wonder that our Presidents sometimes suppose themselves the
                        nation. I am sometimes tempted to think against my mind, that a King, or a
                        Queen, or an Emperor, would be a relief. The British Queen with her 385,000
                        pounds a year, is not near so costly to Britain, all things considered, as
                        the American President with his petty income of $25,000 is to the United
                        States. The Queen sits upon her throne a lifetime undisturbed by contending
                        factions. She has no fears of being elbowed out of place and power until
                        death puts an end to her existence. This is not the case with an American
                        President. Scarcely has he got over the first two years of his
                        apprenticeship ere the fife and drum commence to announce the "coming man."</p>
                    <p>Another man has been named by King Horace; but he slightly hints that it is
                        rather too soon yet to commence the campaign. However, his worshipers cannot
                        be appeased. They consider two years out of the four, little enough to make
                        a President of the United States. King Horace's satellites think the same;
                        and thus the two years hubbub has fairly commenced. The whiskey men have
                        heard the news and they drink his health, if he happens to be of their kith
                        and kin. Powder and ball are called into requisition to vindicate their
                        cause. Each party marshals its forces for the fierce contest and the fight
                        begins. Many words of fierce denunciation are uttered by both parties in
                        utter disregard of the truth.--Many blows are struck, and much blood is
                        shed, and some are silenced forever.--Meanwhile the aspirant to the high
                        office either takes a trip to Europe, or crosses the Rocky Mountains in
                        search of fame. He travels in kingly style, although he professes to be a
                        great hater of that class of beings. He makes a little speech at every
                        stopping place, and his attendants make a note of it, correcting slight
                        mistakes. It is then sent home for publication, as though he had said
                        something that had never been said or thought of before. It is in this way
                        that our Presidents and Vice Presidents, with a good deal of help from their
                        particular friends who have an eye upon the crumbs that usually fall from
                        the Presidential table, force themselves into public notice and gain the
                        cravings of a lifetime--the White House.<br> WORKINGMAN.</p>
