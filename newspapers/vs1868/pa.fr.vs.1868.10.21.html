<b>Our Defeat and Our Duty</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Admits defeat in the recent state elections. Charges that Republicans
                    instituted vote fraud and bribery on a grand scale. Assures Democrats they still
                    have a chance in November and not to lose heart.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radicals have carried Pennsylvania. The largest vote ever cast, has been
                        polled, and the result is a majority of less then ten thousand for the
                        Radical candidates. It would be easy for us to show that the Democratic
                        party is gaining ground in this State and that it is in better condition as
                        to numbers and discipline than it has been since the beginning of the war.
                        We might eulogize its invincible courage and unflagging energy and show that
                        this defeat is not such a terrible shower after all.</p>
                    <p>But all this would be to no purpose now. The fact is undeniable and keeps
                        staring us in the face, that the Radicals have won a victory, and that,
                        unless we rise quickly from our defeat, repair our broken columns and make a
                        grand, united effort, they will win another in November.</p>
                    <p>It is possible for the Democracy to carry Pennsylvania in November. For
                        President, all the States hold the election on the same day. There will be
                        no chance to repeat the importation and colonization of voters practiced on
                        such a huge scale at the late elections. Ohio will need all her Radical
                        voters. New York will need hers. The vote cast next month will be only that
                        of the resident population of the State.</p>
                    <p>Besides, we suspect that money will not be as plenty. The Radicals will rely
                        upon the moral effect of the October victory. There are no local candidates
                        who will be willing to "bleed" largely simply for the sake of "saving the
                        country." It will be difficult for them to raise money in such large sums as
                        to justify them in paying ten, fifteen, twenty and twenty-five dollars per
                        head for voters. And these men who were bought at the late election will
                        demand pay again as the consideration of their votes for Grant. If they do
                        not get it, they will vote the Democratic ticket through spite. There is no
                        disguising the fact that the election last week was carried by the corrupt
                        use of money. The week prior to the election, the Democratic leaders in
                        every County of the State found that money was being freely used to buy
                        votes. A systematic plan was adopted by which a certain number of votes was
                        purchased for a certain amount of money. In each election district, a few
                        bar-room politicians were employed to canvass the district, find out the
                        needy and tempt them to sell their votes. If they were willing to barter
                        their votes, the "greenbacks" were paid down immediately, and the bargain
                        closed, except when the parties were of such a character that they could not
                        be trusted to perform their part of the agreement. In such cases the money
                        was withheld until the ballot was deposited in the box.</p>
                    <p>Again, a great many fraudulent votes were cast. The National Convention of
                        the "Boys in Blue" held in Philadelphia a short time before the election,
                        left a large number of carpet-baggers in the city who were fraudulently
                        assessed and permitted to vote. These men were from States in which no
                        elections were held and from which, they could, of course, be conveniently
                        spared.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the full strength of the Democratic party was not
                        developed. Our forces were not as thoroughly organized as the Radical
                        forces. Many of our men did not go to the polls who were entitled to vote,
                        and many went and were not prepared to vote on account of neglect in
                        relation to the assessment.</p>
                    <p>Democrats, get ready for the contest again. Do not be discouraged.</p>
                    <p>There are no local candidates in the field who will furnish the Radical
                        leaders with piles of money with which to corrupt electors.</p>
                    <p>The Radicals will rely to a great extent upon the effect of their late
                        victory and trust to it to win the next.</p>
                    <p>The men who were imported into the State will be needed at home. All the
                        foreign carpet-baggers left the State the morning after the election,
                        leaving their board bills to be paid by the Radical State Central Committee.
                        This illegal vote will be lopped off.</p>
                    <p>Democrats, you have made a grand reconnaissance in force. You have not only
                        ascertained the strong points of the enemy but you have also discovered your
                        own weak points.</p>
                    <p>There are men who are not assessed. Have them
                        assessed.</p>
                    <p>There are men who were not at the polls. Bring them to
                            the polls.</p>
                    <p>There are able men who are wanting in zeal. Stimulate them to action. Let the
                        Democracy labor to poll a larger vote in November than they did in October.
                        Let no Democrat who voted on the 13th instant, fail to vote on the 3d day of
                        next month. Let there be a movement along the whole line. Let "the voice of
                        an invincible courage" go up from solid Democratic ranks. Let us present an
                        unbroken front to the foe and labor from the rising to the setting of the
                        sun, and victory will yet be ours.</p>

<b>John Cessna</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Continues its earlier attacks against Republican Congressional nominee
                    Cessna. Declares the paper is not afraid of him and will continue to criticize
                    him. Disgusted that he was elected when four of the five counties of the
                    district voted against him.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Elated by the success of his unscrupulous efforts to crowd out the gentlemen
                        who had the boldness to enter into a contest with him for the Radical
                        nomination for Congress, John Cessna opened the campaign by a speech in the
                        Court House at this place which was designed to "cow down" some of his
                        political opponents, and especially the editors of the Valley Spirit. Accustomed to confuse and alarm timid witnesses
                        in court by his unearthly screaming, he imagined he could drive us from our
                        guns by a furious assault at the opening of the contest. He had beaten Col.
                        Weistling by the strategy he knows so well how to practice, and he would
                        silence our battery by a sudden and terrific charge. He had carried the
                        county over a political friend, and he would wrest it by main force from his
                        political opponents. He blackguarded us to an extent which he supposed would
                        be sufficient to deter us from opposing him very vigorously; but to make
                        assurance doubly sure, he gave public notice in his speech that if we did
                        not "let up" on him he would come back in a few weeks and make our last end
                        worse than our first. Those who heard him supposed that he had exhausted his
                        vocabulary of billingsgate, but he gave them to understand that his
                        resources were inexhaustible, and that he could and would surpass anything
                        they had heard even from him.</p>
                    <p>There were not a few among his hearers who thought he was barking up the
                        wrong tree when he attempted to frighten the Valley
                            Spirit. Little John himself probably came to the same frame of
                        mind soon afterward. The next issue of the paper must have convinced him
                        that we were not badly frightened, and he must have come to the conclusion
                        that it would not pay to abuse us further, for he
                        did not venture upon a second assault upon us. Dropping his abuse of us he
                        took to bragging about himself. When in this county he bragged that he would
                        gain largely in Bedford and when in Bedford he bragged that he would carry
                        Franklin. He declared that he would not take his seat in Congress if he did
                        not come within one hundred of carrying Bedford county, even though elected
                        by the District, and the lowest majority he would agree to for himself in
                        Franklin was 250. Meantime the Valley Spirit kept
                        pegging away at him, and exposing the arts by which he had attempted to
                        obtain Democratic nominations, and the shameless devices by which he had
                        succeeded in obtaining Republican nominations over the head of men better
                        entitled to them than himself.</p>
                    <p>We have good reason to be satisfied with the result of the fight Mr. Cessna
                        forced upon us. Instead of a majority of 250 for
                        him, as he claimed, we have given 211 against
                        him. No other man of the whole thirteen on his ticket succeeded in running
                        as low as he did. A race-horse running so far
                        behind the whole field would be declared distanced and be ruled out as unworthy to run another heat. A
                        candidate for the highest office on the ticket, and having consequently all
                        the force of party influence in his favor, he is beaten 211, whilst the
                        candidate for the lowest and least important office on the ticket with him
                        is elected by 49. How much do the Radicals of this county think they gained by running the renegade Cessna instead of
                        the consistent Republican Col. Weistling?</p>
                    <p>Four of the five counties composing this Congressional District have declared
                        by decided majorities that they do not want John Cessna to represent them.
                        The fifth has declared in his favor by a majority exceeding the total
                        majority given against him in the others, thus electing him. The counties
                        voting against him had a population of 95,999 by the census of 1860. The one
                        voting for him had 26,778. He will represent, therefore, a little over one-fifth of the whole population of the District.
                        This will entitle him to the distinction of being the Rump Member of the
                        Rump Congress--the Tail End of the Tail End of Radical Creation.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The majority for the Radical State ticket in this County is forty-three. The
                        Radical candidates for Sheriff, Commissioner, Surveyor and Auditor are
                        elected by majorities ranging from forty-nine to one hundred and nineteen.
                        W.S. Stenger, Esq., Democratic candidate for District Attorney is elected by
                        a majority of one hundred and ninety, and Jacob R. Smith, Democratic
                        candidate for Director of the Poor, is elected by a majority of thirty-nine.
                        In our Legislative District, composed of Franklin and Perry, Captain John H.
                        Walker, Radical, of Franklin, and Mr. John Shively, Democrat, of Perry, are
                        elected.</p>
                    <p>Adams and Franklin together have sent Calvin M. Duncan, Esq., to the State
                        Senate by a majority of two hundred and
                        fifty-nine, to occupy the seat from which he was fraudulently ejected
                        three years ago to give place to McConaughy.</p>
                    <p>The result in Franklin County ought to be very encouraging to the Democrats.
                        The Radicals have always claimed that on a full vote, this County belongs to
                        them by from three to four hundred majority. Two years ago upon an aggregate
                        vote of 8405 the majority for Geary was 193.</p>
                    <p>This year, upon an aggregate vote of 8614, the largest ever cast, the
                        majority for Hartranft is only 43. This vote establishes the fact beyond
                        doubt that in all ordinary elections, Franklin County will give a Democratic
                        majority. At the late election local causes operated to bring out a class of
                        voters who will not go to the polls next month. Opposition to the Road Law
                        brought out men who would not have come out at all if that question had not
                        been before the people. Once at the polls, they were persuaded to vote the
                        Radical ticket.</p>
                    <p>We have no hesitation in expressing our opinion that at least one hundred men
                        were bought in this County to vote the Radical ticket. Some were paid five,
                        some ten, some fifteen, some twenty and a few twenty-five dollars apiece. In
                        this Borough we know the names of men who have hitherto acted with the
                        Democrats, who voted the Radical ticket at the late election, and as a
                        consideration therefor, received ten, fifteen and twenty dollars
                        from certain gentlemen whom we could also name. We gave place last week to a
                        letter from Col. McClure in relation to the reception and disbursement of
                        money for election purposes. We do not dispute the statements in his letter,
                        but we know that soon after his arrival here, money became a great deal
                        plentier in the hands of our Radical friends than it was before.</p>
                    <p>And yet, notwithstanding this lavish use of money by the Radicals here, they
                        have only succeeded in carrying the County on the fullest vote ever polled,
                        by a majority of forty-three. Democrats, gird on your armor. Let us carry
                        Franklin County for Seymour and Blair in November.</p>

                    <p>BASTROP,<br> MOREHOUSE PARISH, LA.<br> September 29th, 1868</p>
                    <p>Editors of Valley Spirit: In my last letter I
                        addressed my friends and acquaintances in Path Valley, Amberson's Valley,
                        and about Bossart's mill, and endeavored to show that the South need no
                        reconstruction laws. I now propose to show how those laws work. In the first
                        place three-fourths of the white men are excluded from the polls and from
                        the right to hold any office. Under the operation of these laws, a few white
                        men in the South, (one in a hundred of the resident population being those
                        who were opposed to secession, and commonly called union men,) aided by a
                        board of registration and by bureau officials, acting under the prestige of
                        drum, fife and bayonets, registered the negroes as voters, using their
                        influence with the negroes to prejudice them against the whites in the South
                        and in favor of "Massa Lincum," intending through
                        these negroes to put and keep themselves in power and office and have a fine
                        time of it generally. Accordingly they elected a large majority of Radicals
                        to a convention to form a State Constitution; that is, one man in a hundred
                        (and some of them non resident adventurers) elected the said members of the
                        State Convention; because negroes voted whatever ticket was given them by
                        those who had thus practised on their credulity and gained their
                        confidence. The negroes had no understanding whatever of what they were
                        doing. They did not know what a constitution meant any more than dumb
                        animals. Perhaps one in a thousand, having more intelligence than the mass,
                        had a vague idea of it, but the whole operation was a farce, and the members
                        elected did not represent one in a hundred of the people. This convention
                        was composed of some dozen or more of unprincipled white men and a few
                        conservative white men, and the balance were negroes, who had been
                        plantation slaves, who could not read, nor understand anything of what the
                        provisions of a State constitution mean, being mostly as stolid and stupid
                        as mere animals. Now it is evident from these facts that the present radical
                        constitution of Louisiana was not adopted by a hundredth part of the white
                        citizens of the State, nor was it adopted by one in a thousand of the
                        negroes, because they literally did not know what they were doing.</p>
                    <p>The constitution thus adopted by said bogus convention provided, in
                        substance, that all citizens of this State in the late "so-called"
                        rebellion, shall be prohibited from voting or holding office, unless they
                        acknowledge that the late rebellion was morally and politically wrong; and
                        that they regret any aid and comfort they may have given it, and sign a
                        certificate stating these facts and have the same recorded in the archives
                        of the State and published in the State paper.</p>
                    <p>The operation, therefore, of the reconstruction laws, is to take the control
                        of the State government out of the hands of the intelligent, influential
                        white people, and [line cut off] unprincipled white men and non residents,
                        who came here to appropriate the offices of the government, and plunder the
                        people, and who have no real interest in the government and welfare of the
                        State. These reconstruction laws have imposed on us a constitution which
                        compels nearly all the white men of intelligence and influence to be
                        disfranchised and excluded from office or degrade themselves by signing and
                        publishing a certificate which would prove themselves to have been criminals
                        or fools. By the same constitution white men are taxed to support the
                        education of negro children and are forced to have their own children attend
                        the public schools with the negroes or support private schools at their own
                        additional expense which is unjust and unequal "taxation without
                        representation!"</p>
                    <p>Therefore the Constitution and Laws of Louisiana are not made by the people
                        of Louisiana, but have been dictated by people of other States--by Sumner,
                        Stevens, Phillips and others--not in a spirit of liberty and enlightened
                        Statesmanship, but in a spirit of oppression and revenge, with the view of
                        keeping a party in power; a party that pretends to act in an enlightened,
                        christian spirit, yet this same party takes from the white man the right of
                        franchise and gives it to the negro; a party that appoints a Bureau to take
                        care of the negro's affairs, yet by enfranchising him they deem him fit to
                        make a constitution and laws, for brave, enlightened white men! But white
                        men who dared complain of this outrage upon the rights of those who were
                        once free men, are at once denounced as disloyal men. Loyal and disloyal!
                        How stupidly these words are uttered and how little understood. to be loyal
                        in a political sense is to be attached to the principles of the government.
                        And who are more attached to the principles of the government than the
                        Southern people? Who have ever been taught more impressively the value of
                        the principles of American liberty? Who ought to appreciate liberty higher
                        than those who, having once enjoyed it, are afterwards deprived of it. And
                        who are more disloyal than the men who violated the principle of the right
                        of suffrage; who embody ex post facto penalties and disabilities in
                        constitutions, who impose taxation without representation? Who are more
                        disloyal than the men who do these things in order to secure political
                        power, and by caressing the negro for his vote and by disabling the white
                        man from voting, show their motives to be corrupt and tyrannical?</p>
                    <p>"Well, but then Rebels deserve to be deprived of the right of suffrage as a
                        punishment for their rebellion," some have said. This is the dictate of
                        revenge. Because, either the Southern men committed treason or they did not.
                        If they did, the laws of the United States prescribe a very different
                        punishment, and there is no authority for inflicting any other. If they did
                        not commit treason, as Thad. Stevens has admitted they did not, no crime or
                        offence has been committed and no punishment is due; therefore, whether we
                        committed treason or not, we ought not to be punished by being
                        disfranchised.</p>
                    <p>As I have shown in my former letter, there is no excuse for depriving the
                        white men of the South of their rights, as there is no probability of any
                        other attempt at Secession, and as the Southern white people have more
                        interest in government and more capacity to attend to the affairs of
                        government than the negro, they feel keenly this outrage on them; and these
                        disabilities imposed on them are as broad and palpable a violation of the
                        declaration of independence as ever negro slavery was, about which those
                        same radicals were so long and so much exercised. J.B. MATTHEWS.</p>

                        the votes of thousands who were legally made citizens in the Court of Nisi
                        Prius; by violating and trampling upon the seal of that Court--a recognized
                        symbol of the law; by deterring legal voters from approaching the polls
                        through threatening penalties for imaginary offences; and by despotic and
                        unscrupulous use of power by election offices in Radical Districts.</p>
                    <p>Under the specious charge of fraud upon your part, Radicalism has perpetrated
                        the vilest frauds. Thousands of voters have been colonized, paupers assessed
                        and voted, repeaters hired and voted five times in Radical precincts,
                        returns of election altered and manipulated to suit their own purposes, and
                        fraudulent naturalization papers issued by the ream.</p>
                    <p>In the contest just closed you have learned their capacity for violence and
                        wrong, you have tested the strength of their organization and discovered the
                        weak points in your own.</p>
                    <p>With the experience thus gained in the school of adversity, we will go
                        forward to victory.</p>
                    <p>The enemy are yet to be taught that outrage and fraud, violence and wrong
                        cannot be perpetrated with impunity; they have yet to learn that you are
                        neither dismayed nor demoralized, and that in pursuit of the right you know
                        no such word as fail.</p>
                    <p>Arouse the people once more for the conflict. Bring to the polls every
                        Democratic vote. For right and justice give back right and justice. For
                        outrage and wrong return the full measure of swift retribution.</p>
                    <p>The work to be done is no holiday sport. It is the last battle for the
                        salvation of the Republic, the preservation of the Constitution and the
                        supremacy of your race.</p>
                    <p>Work and fight as men engaged in such a cause should work and fight.</p>
                    <p>By order of the Democratic State Committee.</p>
                    <p> WILLIAM A. WALLACE,<br> Chairman.</p>

<b>Disgraceful Proceedings</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the Radical meeting in Funkstown, there was a torch light procession. They
                        carried torches and stones and when they came to the house of Mr. Jacob
                        Bricker, they threw stones and struck Mrs. Bricker and her child. As they
                        came down street they met Mehlfelt in front of Crome's Hotel. One ran his
                        light right under Mehlfelt's nose and also into Crome's face. Mehlfelt and
                        Crome picked up stones to defend themselves and then the excitement began.
                        Some yelled that the house should be burned. The wildest confusion and
                        greatest alarm prevailed. The excitement was only quelled by the
                        interference of Mr. A.S. Monn who, although a Radical himself, was
                        determined not to allow the peace and order of the town to be disturbed. The
                        whole proceeding was most disgraceful to the Radical party.</p>

<b>Female College</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The trustees of the proposed Female College met at Greencastle and
                    adjourned again without deciding upon a location for the institution. At this
                    point, Greencastle has offered $20,000 to have it built there, and Chambersburg
                    $19,000 to have it located in the city. The paper believes that a pledge of
                    $23,000 will secure the school for Chambersburg, and urges the citizens to raise
                    the last $4,000. The editors argue that the 300-500 students would bring in
                    $75,000 to $100,000 annually and stimulate business, raise property values, and
                    make Chambersburg "one of the most conspicuous inland points in the Union."<br>
