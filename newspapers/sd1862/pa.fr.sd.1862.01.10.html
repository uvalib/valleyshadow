<b>A Deserved Retribution</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that South Carolinians deserve the "state of fearful suspense" that
                    the approach of the federal army from the coast has created. Also chronicles
                    other aspects of the situation in South Carolina that must be distressing to its
                    people.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The most important recent event has been the advance made by a portion of
                        Gen. Sherman's division, under command of Brigadier General Stevens, and
                        several Union gunboats, against a rebel battery, on New-Year's Day. The
                        expedition was fully successful. This triumph is an indication that the
                        rebels are about to suffer new and still more serious injuries from our
                        South Carolina expedition. Charleston and Savannah are now constantly
                        menaced, and the distance between the former city and our out posts is being
                        rapidly diminished. The fond hope of the Secessionists of the Palmetto
                        State, that they could remain safely at home during the progress of the
                        rebellion, watching at a prudent distance the conflict in the Border States,
                        with their own shores uninvaded, has proved utterly fallacious. Their best
                        harbor and the favorite resort of their proudest aristocrats has fallen into
                        our hands. Their railroad communications have been cut off.--Their
                        industrial system has been demoralized, and, in some districts, utterly
                        destroyed. Thousands of their contrabands have abandoned them forever. In
                        insane fury they have demolished millions of dollars worth of their
                        property, and the hand of incendiarism, prompted by motives different from
                        their own, has desolated some of their most important thoroughfares.</p>
                    <p>The harbor of Charleston has been hermitically [sic] sealed, and her citizens
                        are kept in a state of fearful suspense, hourly fearing that a vigilant
                        army, near at hand, or secret foes in their very midst, may overwhelm them
                        in irretrievable ruin. South Carolina is reaping the fruits of her folly and
                        wickedness in fomenting the rebellion almost as rapidly as her most
                        inveterate enemies could desire; and, much as she suffers, each new day,
                        instead of bringing her relief, only adds to her miseries, perplexities and
                        dangers.</p>

<b>A Peep at the Rebel Army</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints part of an article from the Richmond Examiner indicating that
                    Southerners conscripted into the army are paying as much as fifteen hundred
                    dollars to hire a substitute and that men are looking for any sort of way out of
                    their service in the army. The Dispatch points out that an army of men who have
                    been forced to fight cannot possibly defeat an army of volunteers such as the
                    North has.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Richmond Examiner, of the 2d inst., gives an
                        extraordinary picture of the condition of the Rebel army. After remarking
                        that most of the officers are habitually drunk--that dirt, carelessness, bad
                        food, and want of proper medical treatment have produced an immense amount
                        of sickness, the Examiner proceeds:--</p>
                    <p>"We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the army is becoming a name of
                        terror and dread to the minds of our citizens. The newspapers are still
                        filled with advertisements of bonuses for 'substitutes,' although the War
                        Department has adopted a rule restricting the number of substitutes to one
                        in each company. The rates paid for substitutes are enormous. We are
                        informed that they average from two hundred to two hundred and fifty
                        dollars; and we have been told of a recent instance where fifteen hundred
                        dollars were paid for the prompt procurement of a substitute to take the
                        place of a private suddenly constrained to leave the army. Richmond is
                        filled with soldiers who have come out of the hospitals, or who have got
                        here on some pretence or other, applying for discharges, and striving and
                        wriggling in all sorts of ways to get out of the army. It was but a few days
                        ago that a soldier, discharged from one of the hospitals here, committed
                        suicide rather than be constrained to return to the army."</p>
                    <p>Even supposing, says the Philadelphia Bulletin,
                        that the editor, for the sake of making a sensation, has been guilty of
                        exaggeration, still, after making allowance for this, the statements he
                        makes are most significant.</p>
                    <p>After hearing so much of the fine spirits of the chivalric Southerners, and
                        of their eagerness to enlist; after hearing, too, so many denials of the
                        reports that men wee pressed into the service, and that substitutes were
                        often purchased, this statement from a leading journal in the rebel capital,
                        given so circumstantially, is deserving of more than the usual amount of
                        consideratian. [sic] It confirms the view that we have often taken, that the
                        unfavorable delay in getting our main army into proper fighting condition,
                        has had a most terrible effect on the rebel army. When men pay from two
                        hundred to fifteen hundred dollars to get out of the service, the horrors of
                        it must be quite as great as those described by the Richmond editor.</p>
                    <p>When patriotism is put in the market, and sold to the highest bidder, as it
                        appears to be in Virginia, one can form some idea of the spirit of the
                        troops. It is evident that when this army of the South, degraded and
                        demoralized as it is described, is brought into the field against the
                        well-organized army of the Union, every man of whom has volunteered
                        cheerfully, the victory will be on our side. Our Generals have been
                        providing for just such a victory, by the very delay that has been much so
                        censured by unmilitary men. The time of action and advance has now arrived;
                        Burnside and Buell are both on the point of striking at the enemy, and their
                        movements will, we venture to predict, be the signals for a general advance,
                        which will carry consternation and defeat into the demoralized rebel
                    army.</p>

<b>Why the Delay?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses confidence in General McClellan, but argues that the people and
                    soldiers at the North are anxious for a "forward movement of the army."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A pretty general desire, on the part of the people and the press, is
                        manifesting itself, for a forward movement of the army. Gen. McClellan,
                        doubtless, knows what he is about, but if our army is not now ready to
                        strike the enemy, when will it be? It has been undergoing organization and
                        discipline for the last six months, and nothing has been withheld, in the
                        shape of munitions and equipments, to render it invincible, that an
                        extravagant expenditure of money could procure. The men are enthusiastic for
                        a forward movement, and were as ready two months ago as now. The country,
                        however, has confidence in Gen. McClellan, which will not be shaken until
                        they have the most indubitable evidence of his unfitness for the responsible
                        position he occupies, and this evidence has not yet been adduced. He may not
                        yet have seen the favorable time to strike, but when he does, we believe the
                        result will be a triumph. That day and triumph the country is anxiously
                        awaiting.</p>
