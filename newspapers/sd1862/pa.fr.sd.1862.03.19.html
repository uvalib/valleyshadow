<b>The Tonnage Tax Bill</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Editors discuss the Legislature's recent approval of the bill entitled
                    "An act to repeal an act, approved the 7th of March, 1861, entitled 'An act for
                    the commutation of the tonnage duties." The editors argue that the original bill
                    of 1861--that ended that tonnage tax--was a contract made with the Penn. Rail
                    Road Company, and therefore the Legislature does not have the right to nullify
                    such a bill as long as the contracted party (the Penn. R. R.) fulfills the terms
                    of the contract.<br>

                    system perfect, all citizens should pay their taxes without
