                <summary>Reports that the Constitution of the proposed new state of West Virginia
                    includes a clause that prohibits the bringing of slaves into the state or the
                    entrance of "free persons of color" into the state. The Dispatch comments that
                    this clause should ensure that the Constitution is approved by the people of the
                    proposed state.</summary>
