                <summary>Condemns the Valley Spirit for "turning up his beautiful, aristocratic
                    proboscis" at what the Spirit refers to as "small politicians." The Dispatch
                    expresses the opinion that the Spirit is referring to workingmen rather than
                    professional men and compares the Spirit's attitude to that of aristocratic
                    Southerners who refer to workingmen as "greasy mechanics" and "mudsills."</summary>

                    negroes, it is very certain that any assistance they could have rendered would
                    have been received by the country; and the facts that no advantage was taken of
                    the opportunity exhibits an apathy, and a strange aversion to freedom, on the
                    part of the negroe race."</excerpt>

                <summary>Endorses the President's plan for voluntary emancipation in each state that
                    so desires it. Points out that in the war, the slaves at the South have received
                    an opportunity to achieve their freedom but declined to take advantage of that
                    opportunity. Thus, they proved wrong the Northerners who have advocated an end
                    to slavery in order to quell the rebellion.</summary>
