                    nations who argue that the Civil War in the United States is evidence of the

                    mobilization of troops and supplies on a large scale in the U.S. actually proves
                    the effective operation of republican government in this country.<br>

                    <p>The first snow storm has at last come. Saturday I gathered tea roses and
                        other flowers blooming in the open air at Hampton, but to-day the storm king
                        has come in all his fury, and adieu to lingering summer and her sweet
                        flowers. It is the North visiting Virginia with fearful vengeance. Well he
                        comes to cover her stains and nakedness and shame with a pure white robe.
                        May this North king, triumphing today so sternly but so beneficently, be but
                        an omen and pressage of a triumph till all Southland shall be covered with a
                        robe of righteousness and purity, and her present shame and nakedness no

<b>What Is an Abolitionist?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Protests the Valley Spirit's characterization of abolitionists as "fiends."
                    The editor of the Dispatch argues that the paper is not abolitionist in
                    sentiment, but asserts that any person who upholds the institution of slavery to
                    the detriment of the Union, as the Spirit seems to do, is at best misguided.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>What is there so hideous, so odious or so terrible in the term Abolitionist, when applied to an individual or a
                        party, to distinguish it from another party, that induces the new editor of
                        the Spirit to howl so terribly about it? He
                        cackles more over it than would a pullet over her first egg. There must be
                        something terrible in it--perhaps it does mean more than we have any idea
                        of. An Abolitionist, judging from the manner in
                        which the fears of the Spirit are wrought upon,
                        cannot be anything less than a monstrous, hideous hobgoblin, the sight of
                        which would not only frighten children into spasms, but would make ignorant
                        men--such as the Spirit only can
                        influence--tremble with mortal fear.</p>
                    <p>Every body pretends to know what a man means when he says he is a Whig, a Democrat, or an
                            American; that is, every body knows how to
                        classify a man who claims to be designated by one or other of these
                        destinctive [sic] appellations--but to the term Abolitionist, our neighbor wishes to attach a more than ordinary
                        degree of political sin and deformity, and whose policy, if adopted by the
                        Government, would be the greatest monstrosity ever imposed upon any people.
                        So delighted does that pitiable journal seem to be with the frightfulness of
                        the term, that it has altogether dropped its former favorite epithet of
                            Federalist, with which it used to designate
                        all opponents, and now rolls Abolitionist, "like
                        a sweet morsel under its tongue." It has given the term Federalist the go-by, probably, out of consideration for the
                        feelings of the "favorite son of Pennsylvania," who, in his retirement, is
                        now contemplating the exquisite horrors that he was mainly instrumental in
                        permitting to obtain headway in our country, and who was such a terrible
                        Federalist that it is said he boasted of not having even a drop of
                        Democratic blood in his veins. We say, it may be out of respect for the
                        feelings of James Buchanan, that prince of the Federalists, that it has
                        dropped the one and adopted the other.</p>
                    <p>But what is an Abolitionist? According to the Spirit, an Abolitionist is a fiend! and a
                        fiend, Webster says, is "an infernal being"--"the devil." Well, we will
                        again refer to Webster to see what his definition of the word Abolitionist
                        is one who favors "the immediate emancipation of slaves." A person, then,
                        who favors the emancipation of slaves, or who wishes to carry out God's
                        command to "let the oppressed go free," is a fiend! To comply, therefore, with God's direct command, the Spirit argues, is to become a fiend! We cannot
                        refrain from saying, just here, that such fiends have multiplied enormously,
                        fearfully, since the bombardment of Fort Sumpter, and among them may be
                        enumerated such sterling Democrats as Gen. Bulter, Gen. Dickinson, Hon. John
                        Cochran, M. C., of New York, and a host of others we might name, if it were
                        necessary.</p>
                    <p>As a general thing, ninety-nine out of every hundred men, who profess to be
                        Abolitionists, are the most upright, moral, pious men of the community in
                        which they dwell, and they have naturally become Abolitionists in their
                        endeavors to carry out Christ's injunction: "Whatsoever ye would that men
                        should do to you, do ye even so to them,"--but to follow this rule, the
                            Spirit argues, makes man a fiend, and instead of advancing his spiritual life,
                        it tends to death!</p>
                    <p>We are not now, nor were we ever an Abolitionist; not because we believe
                        there is anything intrinsically wrong in the doctrine, but from prudential
                        motives. The time has passed when odium can be attached to a man for being
                        an Abolitionist. We are for the preservation of our Constitution and Union,
                        at all hazards, and if Slavery stands in the way of their preservation, then
                        we are for striking down Slavery--or, in other words, we then become an
                        Abolitionist. If it is the Jonah, to save the ship let it be thrown
                        overboard. But it is that very thing which gives our neighbor so much grief
                        and trouble. He does not want Jonah thrown into the sea of oblivion--and to
                        save Jonah, he is willing to run the risk of losing the ship and cargo.</p>
                    <p>If all right-thinking men in the North are not Abolitionists, they are at
                        least antislavery in sentiment, and it is no credit to a Free State man'
                        head or heart to say that he is not anti-slavery in his views.</p>
                    <p>Or as John Randolph, of Va., said, in reply to a Northern dough-face who
                        attempted to justify Slavery in a speech in Congress, "I envy neither the
                        head or the heart of the Northern man who can stand up here and attempt to
                        justify Slavery on principle."</p>
