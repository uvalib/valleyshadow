                    <p>AIR--<emph rend="italic">Wait for the Wagon.</emph></p>
                    <p>Secession is the wagon, 'tis painted nice and new; <lb/>The horses they are
                        fractious, and draw a factious crew; <lb/>But then the whip's a good one,
                        the lines are safely tied, <lb/>So jump into the wagon and we'll give you
                        all a ride. <lb/>CHORUS--Then, drive along the wagon-- <lb/>The Secession
                        wagon-- <lb/>We'll put them in their wagon, <lb/>And give them all a ride.</p>
                    <p>Come all ye Northern freemen and fall into the ranks, <lb/>The "Secesh" need
                        a lesson, and we will stop their pranks; <lb/>We'll bring them to
                        subjection--we'll subjugate their pride, <lb/>We'll put them in their wagon
                        and give them all a ride. <lb/>CHORUS--So, drive along the wagon,
                        &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>The wagon it was stolen, and so the horses too. <lb/>And all their spending
                        money was taken right from you; <lb/>But Floyd's the man to do it, tho'
                        others long had tried, <lb/>So we'll put them in the wagon and give them all
                        a ride. <lb/>CHORUS--So, drive along the wagon, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Jeff. Davis we will catch, and Stephens we will bag, <lb/>And all the
                        Southern leaders, who of their bravery brag; <lb/>We'll box 'em up so
                        neatly, and from all care exempt, <lb/>They never shall have troubles, for
                        they shall be well hemped. <lb/>CHORUS--So, drive along the wagon,
                        &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>Claib. Jackson is included, and Price we'll kindly treat; <lb/>For we know he
                        always travels with the <emph rend="italic">loosest</emph> kind of seat;
                        <lb/>And the poor deluded rebels, whose trusts have been belied, <lb/>We'll
                        show them every kindness on their Secession ride. <lb/>CHORUS--So, drive
                        along the wagon, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>The niggers we don't want them--for them we do not fight-- <lb/>For tho' we
                        make them freemen, we cannot make them white; <lb/>We'll only take their
                        masters who do not with us side, <lb/>And put them in the wagon to take a
                        Secesh ride. <lb/>CHORUS--So, drive along the wagon, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>M'Clellan is our driver, Abe Lincoln holds the reins, <lb/>And he will drive
                        the wagon with the greatest care and pains; <lb/>His hold it is a good one,
                        and it will never slip. <lb/>So, jump into the wagon, he'll take you through
                        the trip. <lb/>CHORUS--So, jump into the wagon, &amp;c. </p>

                    <p>A bill is to be introduced into the Legislature of Delaware to abolish
                        slavery in that State. By this bill it is provided that all slaves over 35
                        years of age shall be freed within 90 days after it becomes law; all under
                        35 shall become free on reaching that age; all males born after the bill
                        becomes law are to be slaves till they turn 21, and females till they are
                        18, all slavery is to cease after January 1st 1872. These provisions are
                        made conditional upon this, that "Congress will, at its present session,
                        engage to pay to the State of Delaware, in bonds of the United States,
                        bearing interest at the rate of six per centum per annum, the sum of
                        $900,000 in ten annual instalments [sic], ninety thousand dollars to be
                        payable on some day before the first day of September 1862, to establish a
                        fund for securing full and fair compensation to the owners of slaves who
                        shall have been divested of their property by force of the act in question."</p>
                    <p>Delaware has, according to the census of 1860, 1805 slaves, and the sum asked
                        of Congress for their gradual emancipation amounts to $500 a head, which is
                        a fair price. The Wilmington <emph rend="italic">Republican</emph> says that
                        many of the slaveholders would gladly exchange their slaves for money, which
                        they could use in payment for their lands and contemplated improvements."</p>
                    <p>If this measure comes up before Congress for its response, we hope that body
                        will make it a condition to the national assistance that the State of
                        Delaware shall engage itself to provide by sufficient laws for the rights of
                        the freedmen, and also for their education.--<emph rend="italic">Ex.
