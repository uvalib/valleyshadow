                    <p>Official Report.</p>
                    <p>Head-Quarters Fifth Brigade, <br>Battle-field near Pittsburg Landing, Tenn.
                        <br>April 12th, 1862.</p>
                    <p>Honored Sir:--I embrace the first moment of time allotted me since the
                        terrific battle of the 6th and 7th inst., to inform you that the old
                        Keystone was represented in the battle of the 7th inst., by the 77th
                        regiment.</p>
                    <p>We were 28 or 30 miles from the scene of action from the scene of action on
                        Sabbath morning the 6th inst., when we distinctly heard the cannonading,
                        and, of course, made all possible haste to reach the battle field. Leaving
                        our transportation we marched forward 22 or 23 miles, over roads almost
                        impassable, to Savannah on the Tennessee river, where we arrived at 7
                        o'clock P.M., and after standing in the street under a most drenching rain
                        for eight hours, we embarked on board a boat at 3 o'clock A. M., on the
                        morning of the 7th, and landed at Pittsburg Landing at 6 o'clock the same
                        day, when, after a hasty cup of coffee and a cracker had been disposed of,
                        we were ordered forward into battle. The 77th was held in reserve for the
                        5th Brigade from 6 o'clock to 11 o'clock A. M., under a galling fire,
                        without being allowed to fire a gun, when we were ordered to support the 4th
                        Brigade, commanded by Gen. Rosseau, which they did till about 12 o'clock,
                        when the Regiment was detached by order of Gen. M'Cook, for the purpose of
                        flanking three regiments of the enemy, which the 77th nobly did, and also in
                        the meantime fired upon and silenced one of the enemy's batteries by killing
                        all their horses and many of their men. Just here a considerable body of
                        rebel cavalry charged down upon us, but were repulsed with severe loss.
                        Again they came and again the 77th repulsed them, when they retreated in
                        confusion. Our Regiment took many prisoners that day, among whom was Colonel
                        Battles, of the 2d Tennessee infantry.</p>
                    <p>Suffice it to say that all the officers and men of the 77th fought cooly and
                        bravely that entire day. I am especially indebted to Lieut. Col. Housum and
                        Maj. Bradford for distinguished services during the battle.</p>
                    <p>Our loss is quite meagre--only two or three mortally wounded, and some five
                        or six seriously and slightly. This, I apprehend, is on account of our
                        loading and firing lying on the ground.</p>
                    <p>The loss on the Federal side is very heavy, but nothing to compare with the
                        loss of the Rebels.</p>
                    <p>The ranking officers of our brigade all being wounded, I find myself in
                        command of the Brigade, and I may add it was the
                        Brigade on Monday.</p>
                    <p>Trusting that you will pardon this incomplete and badly written epistle,
                        written on a drum head,</p>
                    <p>I am, dear sir, <br>Your obedient servant, <br>F. S. Stumbaugh.</p>

<b>The Rebel Outrages at Manassas</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>

                    Conduct of the War that give examples of the "rebel outrages" that were

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Washington, April 30.--The committee on the conduct of the war, made a report
                        today, on the subject of the barbarities committed by the rebels at
                        Manassas, on the bodies of the federal soldiers, who fell at that battle.</p>
                    <p>The committee give ample evidence to sustain all the previous allegations.
                        The report shows that the most inhuman acts were perpetrated by the rebels.
                        The committee say:</p>
                    <p>"The outrages on the bodies of our dead will revive recollections of the
                        cruelties to which savages subject their prisoners. Our soldiers were buried
                        in many cases naked, face downwards."</p>
                    <p>In other cases, the testimony shows that the bodies were left to decay in the
                        open air. Their bones were dug up and carried off as trophies. Drinking cups
                        were made of their skulls, &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>The testimony of Governor Sprague is extremely interesting.</p>
                    <p>One of our men, who was taken prisoner, testifies that five of his comrades
                        were shot by sentinels. The murders were prompted by other rebels.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Honiston, Surgeon of the New York Fourteenth regiment, testifies that the
                        rebels brutally refused him permission to aid the wounded who were under his
                        charge on the field. He avers that he saw rebel Surgeons unnecessarily and
                        inhumanly operate on our soldiers. Some of our wounded were left lying on
                        the field at Bull Run, through one rainy and one sultry day, and when they
                        were at last brought in, their wounds were completely alive with larvae
                        deposited by flies.</p>
                    <p>Gen. Richetts testifies that the rebels threatened to knock his brains out as
                        he lay on the ground, wounded: that they stripped his first lieutenant and
                        left him naked on the field. Also, that our soldiers who died at Richmond
                        were buried naked along with negro corpses.</p>
