                    Gen. McClellan will extemporize them into a brigade, and authorize them to make
                    a special advance towards Richmond, if it is only to give them an opportunity to

                    <p>Slavery is now costing this country from one to two millions of dollars per
                        day. Slavery means rebellion. Wherever slavery is strong, there is treason;
                        where there is no slavery and no sympathy with it, there every man is loyal
                        to his government.</p>
