<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Albany Statesman</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Albany Statesman, publishes a letter from
                        Hooker's Division on the Potomac, stating that Samuel Cox, of Port Tobacco,
                        Md., a returned rebel, whipped a negro to death for informing the Federal
                        commander that he (Cox.) had arms for rebel use secreted in his house. The
                        slave had escaped, but was delivered up to Cox. The correspondent says:</p>
                    <p>"Cox tied the man to his horse and rode at a rapid rate, the poor slave
                        running to keep up behind him. When he left the regiment, he had on a pair
                        of good shoes, but when he reached his master's house his shoes were gone,
                        and his bleeding feet were found to be bursting open from coming in contact
                        with pebbles and stone. He had been dragged eleven miles behind his master's
                        horse! They arrived home at 11 o'clock on Friday. He tied him to a tree and
                        called his overseer, Franklin Roby, and a man by the name of John Robinson.
                        They commenced whipping him about twelve o'clock and whipped him until three
                        o'clock, three hours, taking turns with the whip; when one was tired and
                        breathless another would apply the lash.</p>
                    <p>"The only words he uttered up to 2 o'clock were, "I shall not live after
                        this." "Oh, no, you rascal, I intend to kill you!" said Cox. "Mr. Cox," said
                        Robinson, "he is dying." "No he is not. He is stout-hearted and able-bodied.
                        He can stand as much more. However, give me the whip, let his blood rest
                        upon my head," replied Cox. The lash was then applied until about two hours
                        before day.--About 3 o'clock he was cut down and sank to the earth
                        insensible. He had on a new cotton shirt when they began to whip him, and
                        when they were done there was nothing left of it but the collar-band and
                        wristbands. Then commenced the rubbing down to bring back sensibility, but
                        all of no avail. Their unfortunate victim breathed his last before sundown
                        on Saturday evening. Thus perished a loyal negro at the hands of a traitor."</p>
                    <p>That a person (even if he is black) who brings valuable information to our
                        forces should be given up to a rebel to be whipped to death, does not speak
                        well for the good sense or justice of the officer who is responsible for
                    it.</p>
