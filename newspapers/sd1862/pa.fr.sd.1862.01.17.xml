                    <p>We regret that we cannot, on account of a press of news, give a more extended
                        notice to an editorial of enormous length in the last <emph rend="italic"
                            >Spirit</emph>. If the editorial in question be considered a fair sample
                        of what the readers of the said interesting hebdomadal may expect in future,
                        we congratulate them on the <emph rend="italic">quantity</emph> of such
                        delectable effusions in prospect, without saying one word, at the start, in
                        praise of the <emph rend="italic">qualitiy</emph> of number one! Vapid and
                        prolix twaddle, when uttered by a musical voice, is sometimes agreeable
                        enough, but when reduced to plain prose, and put in types, to the
                        intelligent reader it tries the temper more than the repeated duns of an
                        importunate creditor. It is indeed a dun upon the patience of a man, for he
                        would just as soon read any thing else as the vapory, senseless gibberish of
                        nearly three columns in the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>, under the
                        caption of "The Abolitionists at Work." It tries his patience, as a matter
                        of course, because its spirit is precisely that of the Richmond <emph
                            rend="italic">Dispatch</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Examiner</emph>.
                        What are all loyal men in the North but anti-slavery men, honestly and
                        avowedly, or, as the said rebel newspapers distinguish us, "Yankee
                        Abolitionists"? Who has not read the precious morceaus from the Richmond
                        papers denouncing <emph rend="italic">all</emph> Northern men for their
                        Abolitionism? Actuated by a spirit which no loyal man would hesitate to
                        denounce, the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> takes up the burden of the
                        Southern hue and cry, proclaiming the party in power the Abolitionists who
                        originated the war, and propounds the following question:</p>
                    <p>"Is it to be wondered at that the Southern people felt alarmed at their
                        position in the Union, with four hundred millions of property in slaves
                        endangered by <emph rend="italic">the advent of such a fiendish party to
                            power?"</emph></p>
                    <p>Who are fiendish? The people, both Republicans and "deluded Democrats," who
                        patriotically sustain the Government? Or is it those Southern incarnate
                        fiends who really originated all our trouble, and are now warring against
                        the Government of the country? We endeavor to be courteous to all men, but
                        we can have no patience with the man who will publicly assert that any class
                        of politicians in the North--even should they be Abolitionists--originated
                        the war! It is false, and the history of the past year will prove it so. Who
                        took up arms against the Government but Southern traitors? Who took up arms
                        in defence of this Government but Northern men, consisting of Republicans,
                        Democrats, as well as Abolitionists? An infatuation certainly possesses the
                        man who will make the declaration that any class of Northerners originated
                        the war, or an inexcusable ignorance renders him capable of uttering what
                        all sensible readers cannot help but contemn [sic] and ridicule. The <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit</emph> has also made the discovery that, among the
                        loyal supporters of the Government, in Franklin county, there are
                        Abolitionists, as well as "Democrats who have been deluded by the arch
                        machinations of the destroyers of our country"!! Read what it says in
                        reference to these zealous supporters of the Union in our own county:</p>
                    <p>"These are the men of the same stamp of the New England Puritans, who killed
                        the Indians, hung the Quakers, drove out the Baptists, drowned women for
                        witches, and all in the name of Religion."</p>
                    <p>Could any thing be more appropriate for an Eastern Virginia paper than the
                        character the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> gives of Franklin county
                        anti-slavery men? We leave our readers to make any additional comments we
                        have not the space for, and we will promise further notice of any more of
                        our contemporary's editorials on his and the Richmond papers' favorite theme
                        of Abolitionists and Abolitionism! </p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>By the last issue of the <emph rend="italic">Valley Spirit</emph>, it appears
                        that that establishment has passed from the hands of the late publisher, Mr.
                        G. H. Mengel, to those of Messrs. P. S. Dechert and B. T. Hamsher.</p>
                    <p>Judging from the first issue of the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> under
                        the new proprietorship, the tone of that journal will not be much improved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lincoln was elected President of the Republic by the people, and in the
                        manner prescribed by the Constitution. According to these new lights, it was
                        the carrying out of this <emph rend="italic">Democratic</emph> feature of
                        our Government that brought about the present rebellion! Shades of
                        Jefferson, save us from the teachings of such Democrats! The new editors
                        have the effrontery to denounce the party that elected Mr. Lincoln as "a
                        fiendish party," and say, "we have men--ah, Christian men--in our own county
                        who are as rabid Abolitionists at heart as Lloyd, Garrison or Wendell
                        Philips. Some of them even pretend to be followers of the "meek and lowly
                        Jesus," &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>If they are "Christian men," as they first state, we presume it will not be
                        doubted that they follow the precepts of the "meek and lowly Jesus," quite
                        as closely as the new editors of the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>
                        profess to do, both being acceptable members of a very prominent church. But
                        is it not an insult for such followers of the "meek and lowly Jesus," in the
                        very first breath of their editorial career, to denounce many men of their
                        own communion, as well as others, quite as good, of other communions, as
                        "fiendish," because they saw proper to vote for Mr. Lincoln?</p>
                    <p>Thousands of Democrats as well as Republicans voted for and now sustain the
                        present Administration. In the deliberate language of the pious editors of
                        the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>, they are, therefore "fiendish." Now,
                        what was there in the policy enunciated by the party that placed Mr. Lincoln
                        in nomination, that differs so widely from the teachings of the early
                        fathers of the Union, or what is there in the policy of his administration
                        of the Government since his election, in view of the present causeless and
                        wicked rebellion, that could justify any moral and responsible person to
                        characterize those who elected him, as "a fiendish party"? Could a more
                        false, slanderous and base epithet have been chosen from the whole calender
                        [sic] of billingsgate, to throw into the face of so large a portion of their
                        fellow-citizens? A "fiendish party" indeed! Who are fiends? Why, according
                        to the new editors of the <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph>, all who
                        supported Mr. Lincoln for President!</p>
                    <p>We trust, for the sake of truth, that the new proprietors will not pursue
                        further the reprehensible course on which they have started out.</p>
