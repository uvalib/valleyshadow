                    <p>Stores and Teachers for the Contrabands.</p>
                    <p>The steamer Atlantic sailed from New York, a day or two ago, for Port Royal,
                        with a large cargo of army stores for our troops, and about sixty persons
                        who accompany Mr. Edward L. Pierce, the Government agent in charge of the
                        plantations and contrabands at Port Royal. These persons were all
                        recommended by the National Freedman's Relief Association, and its
                        auxiliary, the Educational Commission, at Boston. Three-fourths of the whole
                        number are men who are to be the superintendents of the abandoned estates,
                        and will direct the labors of the negroes, who are to be employed in such
                        agricultural pursuits as cotton-culture and raising vegetables for their own
                        support and for the use of the army at that point.</p>
                    <p>Twelve or fifteen of the passengers are ladies, who will become teachers of
                        an industrial school, which will be at once established at Port Royal, under
                        the superintendence of Rev. M. French, of New York. Mrs. Senator Harlan, of
                        Iowa, is among the ladies, and will assist in some department of the work.
                        Rev. Dr. Floy, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, of New York, is a
                        passenger by the Atlantic. He goes to Port Royal for the purpose of
                        preparing for missionary efforts among his negroes.</p>
                    <p>A portion of the superintendents and teachers receive compensation from the
                        associations in New York and Boston; but some are volunteers. Among the
                        number are men of almost all trades, and some professions. There are several
                        physicians and one or two clergymen.</p>
                    <p>About three thousand dollars' worth of agricultural implements, including
                        plows, hoes, and others in most common use have been purchased by Mr.
                        Pierce, and will be taken to Port Royal in the Atlantic. He takes also a
                        quantity of seeds, including one barrel contributed from the Patent Office
                        at Washington; as well as some medicines, and other necessary articles.</p>
                    <p>From New York forty barrels and boxes of clothing, seven or eight boxes of
                        shoes and two sewing machines are sent for the use of the negroes, from the
                        Association in that city. Besides these, a large number of boxes and
                        packages of all sorts were put on board the Atlantic. From Boston, about
                        twenty-five boxes of clothing, with many barrels of goods and "notions,"
                        have been forwarded.</p>
                    <p>All the superintendents and teachers were requested to take the oath of
                        allegiance to the United States, previous to going on board the steamer.
                        Twenty seven gentlemen and four ladies from Boston; twenty-one gentlemen and
                        seven ladies from New York, and Miss Susan Walker, Mrs. Walter R. Johnson
                        and Miss Mary Donalson, from Washington and Philadelphia, subscribed to the
                        oath. No man who would not, in case of necessity, fight for his country, was
                        permitted to go to Port Royal to assist in the management of the
                            contrabands.--N. Y. Eve. Post.</p>

<b>A Richmond Editor's Ravings about "The Yankee"</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints a portion of an article published in the Richmond Whig the
                    previous summer that characterizes the North as the rightful slave of the South.
                    The Dispatch points out the dignity of free labor and denounces what it
                    perceives as the misdirected belief of "Southern aristocratic lords" that all
                    who work are slaves.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The following editorial appeared in the Richmond Whig last summer. A correspondent desires its publication at this
                        time to how rebel sympathizers how impotent have been the threats of their
                        traitor friends:--</p>
                    <p>"To be conquered in open and manly fight by a nation of gentlemen, and
                        subjected to their sway, might not drive us raving distracted with rage and
                        shame: but for Yankees--the most contemptible and detestable of God's
                        creation--the vile wretches, whose daily sustenance consists in the refuse
                        of all other people--for they eat nothing that anybody else will buy--for
                        them to lord over us--the English language must be enlarged, new words must
                        be invented, to express the extent and depth of our feelings of
                        mortification and shame. No, it is not possible that we can be reduced to a
                        state which there is no words to describe. Instead of this, we must bring
                        these enfranchised slaves back to their true condition. They have long, very
                        properly, looked upon themselves as our social inferiors--as our
                        serfs--their mean, niggardly lives--their low, vulgar and sordid occupations
                        have ground this conviction into them. But of a sudden, they have come to
                        imagine that their numerical strength gives them power--and they have burst
                        the bonds of servitude, and are running riot with more than brutal passions
                        of a liberated wild beast. Their uprising has all the characteristics of a
                        ferocious, servile insurrection. Their first aim is demolition--the
                        destruction of everything, which has the appearance of superior virtue,
                        which excites their envy and hate, and which, by contrast, exposes the
                        shameful deformity of their own lives.</p>
                    <p>They have suggested to us the invasion of their territory, and the robbery of
                        their banks and jewelry stores. We may profit by the suggestion, so far as
                        the invasion goes--for that will enable us to
                        restore them to their normal condition of vassalage, and teach them that cap
                        in hand is the proper attitude of the servant before his master. A cock for
                        a sailor, a goose for a soldier--a Yankee for a gentleman--images
                        incongruous and unnatural!"</p>
                    <p>Such are the sentiments entertained by the Southern aristocratic lords of the
                        last of the people of the North, because they prefer to do their own work,
                        and will not worship their barbarous institution of Slavery. On perusing the
                        above ravings of the Richmond Whig, we could not
                        help smiling, and indulging a feeling more of pity than anger. Capital is
                        the product of Labor--Labor, intelligent, free and compensated, has made the
                        Free States what they are in power, wealth, and greatness. In the North,
                        labor is honorable; in the South, it is degrading for a white man to work,
                        especially if he works from necessity to support himself or family. The
                        lordlings of the South have always maintained, that the "normal condition"
                        of all who work for a living, whether white or black, is slavery; and with
                        "cap in hand" should stand before their masters.</p>
                    <p>When we see men who earn their bread by their daily toil, supporting the
                        Breckinridge wing of the Democratic party, thus aiding to elevate men who
                        believe they should be reduced to slavery just because they are poor and are
                        compelled to work for a living, and that, instead of standing erect in all
                        the dignity of their manhood, the peer of the wealthiest in the land, he
                        should be bowed, with "cap in hand" before his employer or his owner--we
                        repeat, when we see working men supporting a party which is led by men
                        believing and enforcing such ideas, our heart sickens at the sight. But so
                        it is.</p>
                    <p>These principles of the Southern chivalry are not uttered now simply because
                        they are at war with the North, but they were indulged, uttered and enforced
                        long before the Rebellion was seriously meditated. If any people should
                        oppose Slavery, and seek its utter and entire destruction and extirpation
                        from the land, by every means which they may possess, it is the working men
                        of the Free States.--It is they who are immediately affected by the
                        degrading system, and that any one of them should seek to uphold the
                        "institution," is not only marvellous [sic], but shows a want of
                        intelligence and self-respect that is truly humiliating.</p>

                    <p>Resolved, That the United States ought to
                        co-operate with any State which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery,
                        giving to such State pecuniary aid to be used by such State in its
                        discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences, public and private,
                        produced by such change of system."</p>
                    <p>If the proposition contained in the resolution does not meet the approval of
                        Congress and the country, there is the end; but if it does command such
                        approval, I deem it of importance that the States and people immediately
                        interested should be at once distinctly notified of the fact, so that they
                        may begin to consider whether to accept or reject it. The Federal Government
                        would find its highest interest in such a measure, as one of the most
                        efficient means of self-preservation. The leaders of the existing
                        inserrection [sic] entertain the hope that this Government will be forced to
                        acknowledge the independence of some part of the disaffected region, and
                        that all the Slaves States north of such parts will then say--The Union for
                        which we have struggled being already gone, we now choose to go with the
                        Southern section.</p>
                    <p>To deprive them of this hope substantially ends the rebellion, and the
                        initiation of emancipation completely deprives them of it as to all the
                        States imitating it. The point is not that all the States tolerating slavery
                        would very soon, if at all, initiate emancipation; but that while the offer
                        is equally made to all, the more Northern shall, by such initiation, make it
                        certain to the more Southern that, in no event, will the former ever join
                        the latter in their proposed confederacy. I say initiation, because, in my
                        judgment, gradual and not sudden emancipation is better for all. In the mere
                        financial or pecuniary view, any member of Congress, with the census tables
                        and treasury reports before him, can readily see for himself how very soon
                        the current expenditures of the war would purchase, at fair valuation, all
                        the slaves in any named State.</p>
                    <p>Such a proposition on the part of the general Government sets up no claim of
                        a right, by Federal authority, to interfere with slavery within the State
                        limits, referring, as it does, the absolute control of the subject in each
                        case to the State and to its people immediately interested. It is proposed
                        as a matter of perfectly free choice with them. In the annual Message, last
                        December, I thought fit to say:--the Union must be preserved, and hence all
                        indispensable means must be employed. I said this not hastily, but
                        deliberately. War has been made, and continues to be an indispensable means
                        to this end. A practical re-acknowledgment of the national authority would
                        render the war unnecessary, and it would at once cease.</p>
                    <p>If, however, resistance continues, the war must also continue, and it is
                        impossible to foresee all the incidents which may attend, and all the ruin
                        which may follow it. Such as may seem indispensable, or may obviously
                        promise great efficiency towards ending the struggle, must and will come.
                        The proposition now made is an offer only. I hope it may be esteemed no
                        offence to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered would not be of
                        more value to the States and private persons concerned, than are the
                        institution and property in it, in the present aspect of affairs. While it
                        is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be merely
                        initiatory, and within itself a practical measure, it is recommended, in the
                        hope that it would soon lead to important practical results. In full view of
                        my great responsibility to my God and to my country, I earnestly beg the
                        attention of Congress and the people to the subject.</p>
                    <p>(Signed) <br>ABRAHAM LINCOLN. </p>
