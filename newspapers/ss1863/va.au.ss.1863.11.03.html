                    attorney's pay. The Senate discussed a proposal to re-organize the state forces.
                    A number of measures to regulate aspects of the economy were raised without
                    resolution. Also a communication from Governor Letcher announcing the death of

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>During an unreserved conversation between Gen. Scott and a Washington
                    official, General Scott passed judgement on a number of military officers
                    involved in the present conflict. He judged Gen. Lee "the greatest general of
                    the war," admitted to being sorely disappointed in General McClellan, and,
                    having served with Grant in Mexico, he declared that Grant displayed "more
                    military skill than any other General had exhibited on our side." Scott also
                    added that Grant's performance in Mexico indicated a "young lieutenant of
                    undoubted courage but giving no promise whatever of anything beyond ordinary

<b>Lincoln's Call For Troops</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses Lincoln's new system to raise 300,000 men by providing a
                    combination of conscription and cash bonuses. The author sees this tactic as
                    further proof of the failure of the North to subjugate the South. The writer
                    believes that the requested number of enlistees will prove inadequate to carry
                    out the North's war plans and "the whole world will understand that his attempt
                    at subjugation is a hopeless abortion."<br>

<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Richmond Whig</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Lincoln has issued a proclamation, calling upon the States to furnish 300,000
                        troops. If that number do not volunteer under the persuasive influence of
                        "advance pay, premiums and bounties" by the 5th day of January, they will be
                        drafted--the draft to commence on that day.</p>
                    <p>The return to the volunteer plan, says the Richmond Whig, is a confession
                        that conscription had failed, just as the resort to conscription was a
                        confession that volunteering could no longer be relied on. The plan now is
                        to unite the two exploded and impotent systems--men are invited to
                        volunteer, and are warned, if they do not, that they will be drafted. But
                        the draft has lost its terrors, and cannot therefore be used to frighten
                        into volunteering. The promise of large bounties will have more effect, and
                        bring into Lincoln's net a worthless few, who will engage to do anything for
                        money, but who will be far more anxious to avoid fighting and get out of the
                        army than they were eager to accept the blood-money that drew them into it.
                        Such men will never stand before troops who fight from principle, and for
                        everything most cherished.--Lincoln's new call is a confession to the world
                        that the "rebellion" is too strong for him, by at least three hundred
                        thousand men; and as his other estimates in this way have shown how far he
                        has underrated the strength he had to overcome, it will naturally be
                        suspected that, even should he succeed in raising this number, the result
                        will show that he has again miscalculated. But when, as we feel assured will
                        be the case, it is soon that he comes far short of obtaining the number that
                        he confesses are needed, the whole world will understand that his attempt at
                        subjugation is a hopeless abortion.</p>

                        of the Va. Hotel, which resulted in Chambers shooting Sutton in the thigh.
                        Sutton drew his pistol to shoot Chambers, who averred that he was not
                        armed--then Sutton gave up his pistol to Col. Anderson, whereupon Chambers
                        drew a pistol and shot Sutton. The same parties met the same night at the

                        capture of that city. In Tennessee, Bragg has driven Rosencrans to the
                        defensive, and after one roar from his lair, the beast has been turned upon
                        by his own companions, and deposed from his command. In Trans-Mississippi,
                        Kirby Smith, Dick Taylor, Price and Magruder, have made a run upon Banks,
                        and the latter seems to have suspended. In East Tennessee movements seem to
                        be in progress that will eventually yield fruits of success. Take it all

                    <p>Economy in the use of all the necessaries of life is now absolutely necessary
                        and our people should begin to practice it at once. The soldiers in the army
                        must have meats to feed on, or they cannot fight, and in order to ensure
                        them a supply, those out of the army must do with very little, if any. In
                        Virginia, where a large army is to be fed, and where a large portion of the
                        grazing and stock-raising territory is in the hands of the abolitionists,
                        the stock of beef, hogs and sheep, is being rapidly used up, and will soon
                        be exhausted. Further South the supply is much larger, but the difficulty of
                        bringing it here is so great that we need expect none save for army
                        purposes. The people, therefore, had as well make up their minds to use but
                        little meat, and the sooner they do so the better for our cause.</p>

                    <p>In impressing beef and hogs for the army, an eye should be had to the
                        importance of preserving a sufficiency of stock for breeding purposes. In
                        some sections of the country nearly all the milch [sic] cows have been taken
                        for beef cattle, and in others scarcely a hog is to be found. If the war
                        continues two or three years longer--as it probably will--the great mass of
                        the people will be compelled to live on little or no meats; and in order to
                        do this they ought to plant out orchards and vineyards, cultivate the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Editor:--I have seen, through the columns of your paper, and been
                        convinced by conversation that I have heard every day, that the people are
                        laboring under a very great mistake in regard to the capture made at
                        Charlestown. They seem to think that the commands of Major Gilmor and
                        Captain McNeil, were the only ones engaged in the fight. It is true, they
                        both bore a conspicuous part, but none more so than McClanahan's Battery and
                        the 62nd Va. Infantry, commanded by the brave and chivalrous officer, Col.
                        Smith. The whole affair as I am capable of judging is as follows: We left
                        Berryville, at 3 o'clock, Sunday morning, the 25th inst, and arrived at
                        Charlestown at sun rise. We found about 400 Yankees, who, at our approach,
                        had taken refuge in the Court House. Our General demanded a surrender. They
                        wished an hour's time in which [they said] to remove the women and children.
                        The General knowing that reinforcements would arrive in that time, refused
                        them 15 minutes. They replied "take us if you can." Our guns were ordered
                        into position, and fired at the buildings when they commenced retreating and
                        were captured by our cavalry. So you see, the truth is, that this Battery
                        shelled them out of their retreat, and the 18th Va. Cavalry, commanded by
                        Col. Geo. Imboden, together with Major Gilmore and Capt. McNeil's commands,
                        captured them. And on our retreat, being pursued by a greatly superior force
                        we escaped admirably, for which much praise is due our beloved General and
                        his brave little band of followers.</p>
