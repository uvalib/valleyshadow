                    <p>"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall
                        reap you carnal things?" I Corinthians, ix, xi,</p>
                    <p>MR. SPECTATOR: With your permission I would read a homily to my
                        fellow-citizens upon the present times, and call their attention to the
                        beautiful philosophy embodied in the words of Holy Writ just quoted.</p>
                    <p>It may not be amiss to say that I have been a deeply interested observer of
                        passing events, with reference to their influence in developing the
                        character of those who constitute our society, in order to ascertain, if
                        possible, the designs and ends to be wrought out, positively and
                        permissively, by the All-Wise Disposer of events.</p>
                    <p>Now, so far as my observation goes, one of the most singular phenomena, so
                        far developed, exhibits itself in the feverish excitement, and vagueness of
                        thought and feeling, that prevail with reference to extortion and
                        speculation which have been practiced to such an extent that the strong arm
                        of military power is outstretched to prevent the army from starving and to
                        save the country from ruin. Few subjects are more prominent before the
                        public mind than these--speculation and extortion--and divines and
                        legislators have reasoned, spoken and written until they are as familiar as
                        household words. The reading public have perused, with some care, sermons,
                        essays and speeches, yet the more discerning of the signs of the times arise
                        from their perusal with the intuitive conviction that if the principles
                        advocated be carried out, dealers in articles of prime necessity may have
                        free course, and ruin the country at their leisure. For example, reference
                        may be made to the theory and principles so ably elucidated by "W.H.R." in
                        recent numbers of the "Central Presbyterian," and by "Alamby," with less
                        research, but more to the point and with more unction of spirit. Moreover
                        there are those who are fully persuaded that the suggestions gravely made in
                        some sermons, and in many parliamentary speeches to correct these evils and
                        even some of the measures resorted to by government agents, contain the
                        germs of an oppression as vile and unreasonable as that we are endeavoring
                        to flee from, through a Red sea of blood and tears. This melancholy failure
                        of gifted writers and even of Legislators, to point out and provide a remedy
                        for the evils complained of consistent with reason, personal liberty and the
                        emergencies of the country, I am satisfied arises from a misapprehension of
                        the fact that we are living in a time of war which imperils everything worth
                        living for in this world. They have enjoyed the blessings of a profound
                        peace so long that their feelings and modes of thought and expression in
                        writing and speaking of the laws of trade are biassed more or less. With the
                        lips they assume that war exists, yet with the heart they reason and
                        legislate as if there was no war, and thus vainly adopt principles of a
                        state of peace, to the emergencies of a fearful and unprecedented war. Could
                        our writers, Legislators, preachers and persons out of the army generally,
                        be aroused in heart and soul to realize, as many of the Ladies in this
                        Confederacy, clad in mourning do, that we are in a state of war, the
                        philosophy of my text, would put into operation a system of dealing in
                        articles of prime necessity, that would go very far towards meeting the
                        evils and emergencies of the times. It would teach our countrymen to reason
                        thus, "This is a time of war, all that is worth living for, or possessing is
                        now involved in fearful risk. Our sons, brothers and neighbors have devoted
                        their health, their blood, and even life itself, to the noble duty of
                        securing us life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, when they make such
                        sacrifices, and we enjoy the benefits, they have secured to us by loss of
                        life, health or limb, is it a great thing that we should incur the loss of a
                        little flour, beef or bacon for the time being? Would IT BE A GREAT THING
                        for us to raise everything we possibly can for a few years on our farms,
                        with the expectation of GETTING NOTHING for our labor but liberty,
                        independence, and LEAVE to keep our land when the war is over? Were our
                        people imbued with the spirit of this philosophy of the New Testament, no
                        further clue would be needed to lead us out of our difficulties. Then let
                        all who love their country employ example, tongue, pen, and pencil to
                        diffuse its spirit and its touchings, and all will yet be well.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>We are pleased to see that the <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph> has
                        materially modified its tone, and to a considerable degree, its position, in
                        regard to pacific manifestation in the North West, and the policy of
                        employing diplomatic and moral means, to further the development of that
                        spirit, and to detach that section from the Yankee States, proper. It admits
                        that the material interests of the North West will sooner or later control
                        the conduct and decide the attitude of that people--that their interests are
                        in conflict with those of the North East and incline them to an alliance
                        with the Confederate States. Such an alliance of the proper time, and of a
                        proper character, the <emph rend="italic">Enquirer</emph> will be ready to
                        approve, &amp;c., &amp;c. All this is very different from, and much
                        better than, the fierce and scornful language heretofore held by the <emph
                            rend="italic">Enquirer</emph> towards the people of the North West. </p>
                    <p>It is urged by a portion of the Southern press, that it is folly for the
                        North West to talk of a reconstruction of the Union, and because they do
                        desire such a step, we should denounce their efforts for peace. How absurd!
                        How can any settlement of existing difficulties be effected until
                        hostilities cease? If, then, they can cause them to cease, have they not
                        taken the first step towards ending the quarrel which has desolated so many
                        happy homes, and converted so many smiling fields into grave yards?
                        Reconstruction of the Old Union, of course, is impossible. They do us no
                        harm in advocating it, and we should leave them to use their own means to
                        end the war. If they select the sword and bayonet as the only means, we will
                        meet them as we have met them. If they select a truce and negotiation, we
                        accept the proposition; and the argument they may use to obtain the truce is
                        clearly a matter of little consequence to us. Indeed, we regard the talk of
                        reconstruction as a mere "side issue," known by its advocates to be an
                        impossibility. But a reunion of the North West and the Southern States is a
                        question on which we will have some day to pass, for infallibly they will
                        soon or late solicit such an association. There is no need now to discuss
                        the question. We will only say that we do not advocate this change--do not
                        regard it a "consummation devoutly to be wished." Too great an expansion of
                        territory is the bane of Republics. A diversity of interests arises and
                        difficulties in legislation ensue, producing a train of trickery and
                        corruption too plainly exhibited in the downfall of the United States.</p>
                    <p>The extreme desire on the part of the Yankees to be united with the South
                        speaks plainly their appreciation of the latter, and her importance in
                        increasing their wealth, respectability and happiness. Who believes that the
                        Yankee nation would be expending its money so freely, and pouring out its
                        blood so profusely, if only a principle were the stake? If they cannot whip
                        us into their Government, they will beg to be admitted into ours. They are
                        now trying the first means of reconstruction, war--let us not interfere with
                        those who are preparing the war for the second--peace. When re-union is
                        asked, then we may express our views of its advantages or disadvantages, and
                        our views for or against it; but, until then, let us trust to the God of
                        Battles, who has crowned our cause with so many brilliant victories, and
                        leave the little leaven put into the mass by Mr. Vallandingham and others,
                        to produce its own effects, augmented by every influence we can bring to
                            bear.--<emph rend="italic">Rich. Whig</emph>. </p>

                    everything they could lay their hands upon...A handful of prostitutes,
                    professional thieves, Irish and Yankee hags, gallows birds from all lands but
                    our own, congregated in Richmond with a woman huckster at their head."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>On Thursday last, the city of Richmond was excited by strange and outrageous
                        proceedings which occurred in the streets of that city. A band of robbers,
                        composed of both sexes, supposed to number 100 or 150, attempted, in broad
                        day-light, to rob the stores of that city. This proceeding was so strange
                        and so unexpected that the citizens seem, for some time, to have been
                        paralyzed, and whilst they were looking on in bewildered wonder and
                        astonishment, these robbers were breaking open the stores and robbing them
                        of their contents. We have been informed by gentlemen who were present,
                        that, before the civil or military authorities had gotten ready to do
                        anything, Hon. John B. Baldwin, of this place, backed by a number of
                        gentlemen who promised to support him, went into the midst of them and had a
                        number of the leaders arrested. This was on Main Street. He afterwards found
                        a large crowd of the same class proceeding in the same way on Franklin
                        Street. With equal promptness and boldness he went into their midst whilst
                        they were threatening and endeavoring to strike him down. Here, he was
                        called upon by the citizens to address the rioters, which he did with such a
                        happy blending of firmness with moral suasion, that they became quiet and
                        were persuaded that they had better disperse and retire to their homes.
                        After the sea of tumult had been calmed, and when "Scarcely a breath
                        disturbed the sleeping billow," the military and civil authorities appeared,
                        and, in a tone of command, cried: "Peace, be still." After this, vast
                        crowds, composed chiefly or orderly citizens, were addressed by Col.
                        Munford, Mayor Mayo, Gov. Letcher, and President Davis. These robbers were
                        not in need of food, as they pretended, for they stole everything the could
                        lay their hands upon. And the investigations in the police court established
                        the fact that some of them possessed considerable property--the husband of
                        one woman, owing <emph rend="italic">seven thousand</emph> dollars worth of

                        "bread riot"--it did not proceed from want, but crime. The charitable
                        institutions in that city have money in hand which has never been called for
                        by the needy, for whom it is designed. It is quite probable that it was
                        instigated by the enemies of the South, with the view of encouraging the
                        North to prosecute the war by making the impression that the South is
                        approaching a starving condition. This seems the more probable from the fact
                        that similar proceedings have recently taken place in Atlanta, Ga., Mobile,
                        Ala., Saulsbury, N.C., and Petersburg, Va., in neither of which places is
                        there any suffering for the want of food. The fact that the scarcity of food
                        is made the <emph rend="italic">pretext</emph> for adopting proceedings
                        which are calculated to encourage the enemy, should induce every farmer to
                        raise as much as possible; for every grain of corn planted is a nail driven
                        into the coffin of the enemy's hopes. </p>

                        gallows-birds from all lands but our own, congregated in Richmond, with a
                        woman huckster at their head, who buys veal at the toll gate for a hundred
                        and sells the same for two hundred and fifty in the morning market,
                        undertook the other day to put into private practice the principles of the
                        Commissary Department. Swearing that they would have goods "at government
                        prices" they broke open half a dozen shoe stores, hat stores, and tobacco
                        houses, and robbed them of everything but bread, which was just the thing
                        they wanted least."</p>
                    <p>A charitable institution, under the delusion that they wanted something to
                        eat, made a distribution of rice and flour to all who would ask it,
                        whereupon, the Examiner says, miscreants were seen to dash the rice and
                        flour into the muddy streets, where the traces still remain, with the remark
                        that "if <emph rend="italic">that</emph> was what they were going to give
                        they might go to h--l." </p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>Whilst as a nation, struggling heroically and successfully against one of the
                        most powerful and malicious nations on the earth, we are exciting the
                        admiration of foreign nations, many of our people, and, we fear, a majority,
                        present a spectacle as disgraceful as it is remarkable. We had supposed, at
                        the beginning of this gigantic struggle for freedom and independence, that
                        all would feel like a band of brothers--that the whole people constituted
                        but one family--that as all were equally interested in the success of the
                        struggle, so all would be equally willing to perform their share of
                        patriotic duty--either to aid in driving the ruthless invaders from our
                        soil, or do all that was within their power to relieve the necessities, or
                        palliate the sufferings of those at home.</p>
                    <p>We still think that this was the general, if not universal feeling at the
                        beginning of the war; but alas! it is too evident that such is not the case
                        now. Our people seem to have forgotten Liberty--to have ignored Humanity--to
                        have discarded Charity, ay, to have wandered from the sacred altar of
                        Christianity to offer their oblations upon the polluted altar of Mammon.
                        Instead of doing all they can to assist each other, and all they can to
                        repel the invaders of our soil, they are preying upon each other like the
                        fishes of the sea--they have become cannibals, and prey upon their own
                        kindred and friends. They seem to have become as deaf as adders to the voice
                        of distress--they heed not the wail of the widow, nor the cries of the
                        orphan. Their ears seem to be stuffed with shinplasters and their hearts
                        turned to stone. They forget patriotism, and, instead of supporting, engage
                        in discrediting the currency of the country, and then imperil their souls in
                        their efforts to clutch a handful of the very money which they have
                        depreciated. The aphorism that "one half of the world does not know how the
                        other half lives," was never more forcibly illustrated than at the present
                        time. Those who live by sales, either of produce or merchandize, do not know
                        the trials, at the present time, of those who have everything to buy. Those
                        who sell can accommodate themselves to the changed circumstances. They can
                        increase the price of what they have to sell, but those who have nothing to
                        sell cannot do so, and every increase of price serves the more to oppress
                        them. The farmer who has his produce to sell, can increase his prices <emph
                            rend="italic">pari passu</emph> with [t]he merchant who sells to him,
                        and <emph rend="italic">vice versa</emph>. But whilst the farmer is
                        increasing his prices to become even with the merchant, and the merchant
                        increasing his to keep a little ahead of the farmer, those who have nothing
                        to sell become oppressed with this system of piling "Pelion upon Ossa." The
                        farmer and merchant may become wealthy; but it will be at the expense of
                        that unfortunate class who have everything to buy and nothing to sell. They
                        are between the upper and nether millstones, and many become ground to
                        poverty, and some even to destitution. Those who are making money and
                        amassing fortunes should remember this class. It too frequently happens that
                        the more rapidly people make money, the less disposed they become to
                        consider the condition, and to relieve the wants of those who do not make
                        it. They fix their intent gaze upon the "filthy lucre, devises plans to
                        obtain it, and lose sight of those who need the necessaries of life." We
                        should remind them that "<emph rend="italic">he that giveth to the poor,
                            lendeth to the Lord</emph>," and, with Dean Swift, would ask "if they
                        desire <emph rend="italic">better</emph> security." </p>

                    <p>Lincoln must certainly understand and appreciate by this time the issue which
                        he has succeeded in making with and among his own people. His wonderful and
                        sagacious organ, the <emph rend="italic">Herald</emph>, evidently sees it,
                        and perhaps understands it in all its dread bearings. It would seem to be
                        plain to the commonest understanding. It is reduced simply to this--Success
                        or Revolution. The Federal Government has gone so far that it MUST succeed
                        in conquering the South, or must abide the dread alternative of armed revolt
                        at home. Hence its tremendous efforts at preparation for attack on us, and
                        its scarcely less concealed exertions to repress, check and overawe the
                        element of opposition in its own midst. </p>
                    <p>Success, and that speedily, is the agonizing cry of all
                        Abolitiondom--success, or else conscription fails--success, or the financial
                        bubble bursts--success, or the three hundred thousand go home in
                        May--success, or the demoralized ranks will grow skeletons by disease and
                        desertion--success, or no new armies can be levied--success, or the
                        copperheads will strike--success, or the usurper comes to the bar of
                        infuriated public opinion, perchance to the block--success against the
                        unoffending, brave, free Confederates, or else anarchy, revolution,
                        bloodshed--a reign of terror in the North.</p>
                    <p>It is plain enough that these people have the strongest motives for desiring
                        success, the fiercest promptings to achieve it. But we have still stronger
                        incentives to urge us to prevent their success. Everything we have and are
                        and expect to be is at stake. National independence, personal liberty,
                        property, honor, fame, home, wives, children--all depend on the hazard of
                        this fearful struggle. Let these thoughts inspire every Southern soldier to
                        deeds of greater daring than he has yet essayed--let each swear by his own
                        soul that he will never yield to such fate as the Yankees promise. And let
                        all the people with unfaltering confidence support and stand by the Army and
                        the Government. A very few weeks MAY suffice to change the whole aspect of
                        affairs. At the worst, the war can but be prolonged; but if, by the exercise
                        of all our powers, we can prevent abolition success, or, still better,
                        soundly beat them, and take the offensive in Virginia and Tennessee, then
                        the peace party in the North will grow to be a giant, fearful to Lincoln and
                        his minions.--<emph rend="italic">Augusta (Ga.) Constitutionalist</emph>.
