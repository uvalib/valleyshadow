<b>To The Soldiers Of The Confederate States</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprints an appeal from Jefferson Davis for the populace to redouble their
                    efforts in fighting the war. This appeal describes the dire consequences of
                    failing in the war, and at the same time claims that victory is still
                    attainable. President Davis also calls on the women of the Confederacy to use
                    their considerable influence to see that all men return to their duty.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>After more than two years of warfare scarcely equalled to the number,
                        magnitude and fearful carnage of its battles--a warfare in which your
                        courage and fortitude have illustrated your country and attracted not only
                        gratitude at home, but admiration abroad--your enemies continue a struggle
                        in which our final triumph must be inevitable. Unduly elated with their
                        recent successes, they imagine that temporary reverses can quell your spirit
                        or shake your determination, and they are now gathering heavy masses for a
                        general invasion in the vain hope that by a despearte [sic] effort success
                        may at length be reached.</p>
                    <p>You know too well, my countrymen, what they mean by success. Their malignant
                        rage aims at nothing less than the extermination of yourselves, your wives
                        and children. They seek to destroy what they cannot plunder. They propose as
                        the spoils of victory that your homes shall be partitioned among the
                        wretches whose atrocious cruelties have stamped infamy on their Government.
                        They design to incite servile insurrection and light the fires of
                        incendiarism whenever they can reach your homes, and they debauch the
                        interior race, hitherto docile and contented, by promising indulgence of the
                        vilest passions as the price of treachery. Conscious of their inability to
                        prevail by legitimate warfare, not daring to make peace lest they should be
                        hurled from their seats of power, the men who now rule in Washington refuse
                        even to confer on the subject of putting an end to outrages which disgrace
                        our age, or to listen to a suggestion for conducting the war according to
                        the usages of civilization.</p>
                    <p>Fellow citizens, no alternative is left you but victory, or subjugation,
                        slavery, and the utter ruin of yourselves, your families, and your country.
                        The victory is within your reach.--You need but stretch forth your hands to
                        grasp it. For this and all that is necessary is that those who are called to
                        the field by every motive that can move the human heart, should promptly
                        repair to the post of duty, should stand by their comrades now in front of
                        the foe, and thus so strengthen the armies of the Confederacy as to ensure
                        success. The men now absent from their posts would, if present in the field,
                        suffice to create numerical equality between our force and that of the
                        invaders--and when with any approach to such equality have we failed to be
                        victorious? I believe that but few of those absent are actuated by
                        unwillingness to serve their country; but that many have found it difficult
                        to resist the temptation of a visit to their homes and the loved ones from
                        whom they have been so long separated; that others have left for temporary
                        attention to their affairs with the intention of returning, and then have
                        shrunk from the consequences of their violation of duty; that others again
                        have left their posts from mere restlessness and desire of change, each
                        quieting the upbraidings of his conscience, by persuading himself that his
                        individual services could have no influence on the general result. These and
                        other causes (although far less disgraceful than the desire to avoid danger,
                        or to escape from the sacrifices required by patriotism,) are, nevertheless,
                        grievous faults, and place the cause of our beloved country, and of
                        everything we hold dear, in imminent peril. I repeat, that the men who now
                        owe duty to their country, who have been called out and who have not yet
                        reported for duty, or who have absented themselves from their posts, are
                        sufficient in number to secure us victory in the struggle now impending.</p>
                    <p>I call on you, then, my countrymen, to hasten to your camps, in obedience to
                        the dictates of honor and of duty, and summon those who have absented
                        themselves without leave, or who have remained absent beyond the period
                        allowed by their furloughs, to repair, without delay, to their respective
                        commands; and I do hereby declare that I grant a general pardon and amnesty
                        to all officers and men within the Confederacy, now absent without leave or
                        desertion, excepting only those who have been twice convicted of desertion.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I conjure my countrywomen--the wives, mothers, sisters and
                        daughters--of the Confederacy, to use their all-powerful influence in aid of
                        this call, to add one crowning sacrifice to those which their patriotism has
                        so freely and constantly offered on their country's altar, and to take care
                        that none who owe service in the field shall be sheltered at home, from the
                        disgrace of having deserted their duty to their families, to their country,
                        and to their God.</p>
                    <p>Given under my hand, and the seal of the Confederate States, at Richmond,
                        this 1st day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred
                        and sixty-three.</p>

<b>Endurance</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have the authority of our officials for saying that, at the present time,
                        our force would be numerically the equal of that of the enemy, if our
                        soldiers were all afield. Besides this, the President has called for all the
                        men between forty and forty-five to join our army. The number of these in
                        the country is about 168,500.--Deducting a forth for exempts, and we have
                        more than 126,000, as an addition to a force that is now ale to confront the
                        foe. We have an enlisted force now ample to meet our enemies, and we are
                        calling our reserves more effectually than they. We have a population that
                            will maintain an army much larger than we
                        have yet brought into the field. </p>
                    <p>There is no occasion, therefore, for the fear that our supply of men will be
                        exhausted, or become insufficient. All that is necessary is for us to do our
                        duty. Let us keep down the exemption list. Let soldiers resolve to stand by
                        their colors, faithfully. Let citizens unite to urge them to their duty, and
                        especially let the ladies exert their irresistible influence in this behalf.
                        If we lost our liberties it will not be because God has withheld from us the
                        means and the strength to defend them; but because we will have thrown them
                        away through cowardice or meanness of soul.</p>
                    <p>The above exhibit is very far from completing the statement of our capacity
                        for self-defence.--The army of seven hundred thousand men, which we are able
                        to maintain indefinitely, is composed only of the physically vigorous; such
                        as are able either to fight around Richmond, or to pursue the battle to
                        Gettysburg. But let us, if necessity require, make this a war entirely of
                        self-defence; and what a vast force we could add to our strength of men
                        unable to stand the march. None would rush more swiftly and gladly, and none
                        would fight braver than the youths between sixteen and eighteen; and of
                        these we have, according to Mr. De Bow, nearly 180,000. Of the men from
                        forty-five to sixty, the very great majority would have the vigor and the
                        will to fight for their country; and men of that age could not afford to
                        disgrace themselves by a want of gallantry. Of these we have probably
                        250,000.--Thus we can meet our enemies with more than a
                            million of men under arms, and of as brave a race as ever faced a
                        foe. The invaders could not equal this number, if Lincoln were to do his
                        utmost. Besides, if we stood on the defensive, we should have the choice of
                        ground for fighting. </p>
                    <p>In view of all these facts, we would ask the most despondent man in the land,
                        if his despondency is not a disgrace to him? We would ask the veriest craven
                        in our midst, how it is possible that we should
                        be conquered? Let us forever banish from our minds the faintest thought of a
                        calamitous result to our noble struggle. It is a shame, so much as to give
                        it a moment's audience. God has put the strength in our right arms wherewith
                        to win our safety. He has signally manifested His favor on various
                        occasions. He is sending distraction among our enemies.--In His own good
                        time He will raise us friends, if we need them. Why, then, should any
                        tremble, even if his soul were like the aspen? [Sentinel. </p>

                        are more men in arms in the trans-Mississippi section now than there has
                        been at any time within a year past, and these increased levies are under
                        men in whom they have the fullest confidence, such as Kirby Smith, Dick
                        Taylor and J. B. Magruder. The people in West and Middle Tennessee, and
                        Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana, where the Yankees have penetrated, have
                        found out to their cost that the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel, and
                        they will soon swell the ranks of Johnston and Bragg.</p>

                    <p>In order to allow as many of our brave soldiers to visit their families and

                        hereby instituted in this army.</p>
                    <p>These furloughs will be granted, in the first instance, at the rate of two
                        for every one hundred men present for duty; subsequently, at the rate of one

                    <p>This system will be continued as long as the exigencies of the service will
                        permit. Should the effect not be found prejudicial, commanders of regiments
                        and battalions will forward on each occasion, the most urgent and
                        meritorious cases from those recommended by the company officers for the

                        30 days.</p>
                    <p>Furloughs will be granted equally to soldiers from States and districts with
                        which communication is cut off, but in no case will these furloughs carry
                        permission to go within the enemy's lines or pass through them. The time for
                        such cases will be regulated by the number of days allowed for the State in
                        the above list which they intend to visit.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Editor.--I am rejoiced that our patriotic Governor has called the
                        Legislature to convene on the 7th of next month. If ever there was a time in
                        our history that demanded the energies of our men of talents, and brave
                        hearts, that will rescue our country from the hands of a besotted tyrant,
                        now is the time for them to show their hands. I have been astonished that
                        our most prominent men, who ought to be the first to sound the alarm through
                        the medium of the public press, are at the present moment as quiet as a
                        mouse, engaged in adding dollar to dollar, when the country that gave them
                        birth is bleeding at every pore. I hope, when the Legislature meets, prompt
                        and decisive steps will be taken, to put the whole State in a proper state
                        of defence to repel the infernal foe who seeks our ruin.</p>

                    Ridge at Rockfish Gap."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Friday last, there was some excitement here consequent upon a despatch
                        [sic] sent by Colonel Jackson to the Commandment of the Post of this place
                        that there was considerable force of the enemy in Highland county, and that
                        it was impossible for him to get his forces between the enemy and this
                        place. Couriers were sent immediately to Gen. Imboden, apprising him of the
                        intelligence, and he very promptly moved his command from Linsville creek,
                        in Rockingham county, to the neighborhood of this place. By the middle of
                        the afternoon of Saturday his troops were within three miles of Staunton. It
                        seems from later intelligence that the enemy, 2,500 cavalry, appeared, quite
                        unexpectedly to the citizens, at Monterey, the county seat of Highland, on
                        Thursday last, and, the Court being in session, captured the Court and all
                        who were attending, and about 100 horses. We understand that all were
                        afterwards released except Mr. D. M. Auvil, a lawyer, who was, at the
                        beginning of the war, Commonwealth's Attorney for Harbour county, Captain
                        Wm. Myers, and several others. Mr. Auvil had been once before captured by
                        the enemy, and imprisoned for a long time at Camp Chase. From Monterey, it
                        seems, the enemy, instead of coming in this direction, went to Huntersville,
                        the county seat of Pocahontas, where the forces of Colonel Jackson were
                        stationed. We understand that there had been some skirmishing between the
                        forces of Colonel Jackson and the enemy, and that the former fell back in
                        the direction of the Warm Springs, the county seat of Bath.</p>
                    <p>P. S. Since the above was written, the excitement here was greatly increased
                        and intensified on yesterday morning by the report of some of our scouts
                        that the enemy were crossing the mountain at Buffalo Gap, about ten miles
                        West of this place. As soon as this report was received prompt and active
                        preparations were made to "welcome them with bloody hands to hospitable
                        graves." The forces of General Imboden, and the convalescent soldiers in the
                        hospitals here, were soon in readiness for the march to meet them. The
                        members of the company which was organized on Saturday last, were soon in
                        their saddles with guns slung to their sides. The hands in the work shops
                        and other citizens responded with alacrity and promptitude to drive back the
                        invaders. In a marvellously short time there was a large force in readiness
                        to meet the foe, if he should dare to come to this place. This active
                        preparatoin [sic] continued till the authorities became satisfied that it
                        was a false alarm.</p>
                    <p>Such a scene has not been exhibited here since the brave ancestors of this
                        people rallied from hill and dale and mountain glen to meet the enemy in the
                        First Revolution, when it was thought that Tarleton was marching to cross
                        the Blue Ridge at Rockfish Gap. The sons of Augusta of the present day are
                        worthy of their brave and patriotic ancestors--they are chips of the old
                        blocks, and will do their duty when the emergency shall demand it. Though
                        the "wolf" did not come this time, it should have the effect of inducing our
                        people to get the "dogs of war" ready, that [illegible] may tous him when he shall come. </p>

                        honestly unless aided by the contributions of those who are more fortunate.
                        Those who have the means, and particularly those who have made money since

                        to be willing to take the lead in meeting the

                        the poor man as to the wealthy, and is as highly prized by him; but as the
                        enemy are also making war against property as well as liberty, the
                        property-holder is more interested in the result

                        object the protection of our liberties and
                        property.--There are some property-holders so intent upon greater
                        accumulations that they cease to have a single patriotic sentiment, and
                        there are some poor men who have suffered their prejudices against such
                        characters to blind them to their duties as patriots, and have resolved not
                        to strike a blow till they see such Shylocks in the army. Both have duties

                    <p>Suppose, says the Lynchburg Republican, that the
                        army now in Virginia numbers two hundred thousand men, it will require four
                        hundred and fifty thousand barrels of flour to feed them in one year,
                        issuing one pound and a quarter as rations per day to each man. </p>
                    <p>The census of 1850 put the total white and colored population of the State
                        down as 1,421,661. From this number it is fair to take the inhabitants of
                        that portion of the territory which does not enter into our calculations
                        about the product of wheat, those in the army, and the negro population lost
                        to us: one-third would not be a large estimate. This will leave o be fed a
                        population of 947,773 persons, for which it will take in round numbers, two
                        millions barrels flour. The sum may be stated thus: <br>

                    <p>It will be seen that we have left out of account the large product of corn,
                        peas, beans, sweet and Irish potatoes, from which is derived one-third of
                        the food used by the people.</p>

                        an increase in price will be disappointed. An abundant crop of wheat has
                        been harvested in every State to supply the wants of its population. By what
                        reasons is it urged, then, that the price must advance, except it be through
                        the withholding of supplies by the farmers? This should not be done. It is
                        unpatriotic; it is unwise.</p>

                    <p>The Atlanta Confederacy says that the most reasonable class of our enemies do
                        not look for subjugation, but submission. Their anticipations are of an
                        humbled people--worn down by the cares and anxieties attendant on war--the
                        loss of property, of children--deportation from their homes, and the
                        dislocation of family ties. The character of our people forbids this
                        conclusion, but if there were any one circumstance stronger than another, to
                        put to flight this expectation, it is the deep and growing and incurable
                        hatred of our people to the dominion of the Yankees. History cannot furnish
                        a parallel to it. It exceeds that of the Moors towards the Spaniards when
                        Grenada was despoiled--of the Netherlands towards the same people, when
                        William the Silent was assassinated, and the Duke of Alva brought to the
                        block some of the most illustrious citizens of Holland. When the torch of
                        the incendiary and the sword of the military assassin, when the spoiler and
                        cut-throat shall be esteemed among the instruments of conciliation--then
                        will our people listen to submission--not before.</p>

                    <p>The Tax in Kind.--It is well known to all that our Congress, at its last
                        session, levied a tax in kind on the products of the earth. It is the duty
                        of our planters to pay this tithe, upon such crops as has been gathered in,
                        at the very earliest opportunity. Our armies are now needing the provisions
                        which these tithes will furnish, and ought not to be deprived of them a
                        moment longer than is sufficient to get them to some depot where they can be
                        shipped to the order of the Government. Besides, a prompt compliance with
                        the provisions of the law will save the Government much expense and trouble.
                        We say to all who have a "tax in kind" to pay, do your duty
                        patriotically--at once, with the least possible delay. Do not wait to be
                        called upon and forced to do it.</p>
