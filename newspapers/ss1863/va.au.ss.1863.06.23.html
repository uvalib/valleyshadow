<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>According to some theological writers, who have undertaken to unravel the
                        mysteries of prophecy, the combined hosts of Gog and Magog are to meet in
                        the Great Valley of the Mississippi some time between the years 1861 and
                        1878, when the great battle of Armageddon shall be fought. At this battle,
                        the blood is to flow until it reaches the bridle bit of the horsemen, and a
                        "stink" is to arise from the carcasses of the slain that will scatter
                        pestilence and mourning through the whole land. It is to be the greatest and
                        last battle on earth--the final contest between liberty and despotism; it is
                        to decide not only the fate, and shape the future political character of the
                        Western Continent, but is likewise to produce a revolution in all the great
                        monarchies of Europe. The cause of liberty is to make its final triumphs;
                        the ancient monarchies of the Old World are to give in before the conquering
                        hosts; Israel is to be restored, a democratic theocracy is to become the
                        recognized Government not only in North America, but throughout all Europe;
                        Poland is to be restored to her ancient liberties, demagogism is to have its
                        funeral obsequies, the Millennial Reign of a Thousand Year is to set in and
                        (it is hoped) the Puritan Round Heads and Yankee politicians are, like their
                        great Chief in the lower world, to be put into close custody where they may
                        no longer disturb the public peace by a system of intermeddling with affairs
                        that do not concern them.</p>
                    <p>The sanguinary conflict which has been progressing at Vicksburg during the
                        past ten days--the disposition of the Yankee Government to hazard everything
                        in the contest--the continued flow of reinforcements to both armies for
                        several weeks past--the dreadful carnage of the Yankee troops and offensive
                        stench arising from their rotting carcasses--the locality of the hostile
                        armies, their great and increasing numbers, and the period of time in which
                        these events are transpiring, serve to remind us of Dr. Baldwin's "United
                        States in Prophecy," and his theories of the great Armageddon. It cannot be
                        claimed as a verification of his "Prophecies," however, since the character
                        and material of both armies lack many of the essentials specified in his
                        prophecy.--Columbus Sun.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>An anonymous writer, to whom we have never referred in the remotest manner,
                        in the last "Vindicator" offers an insult to every soldier in our heroic
                        armies by adopting the honored title "A Soldier," as the signature to an
                        article which contains charges against us so evenly compounded of malice and
                        absurdity that it is difficult to tell whether they excite more indignation
                        than ridicule. The palpable absurdity contained in those charges shows that
                        the ignorance of the author is only equaled by the malice which prompted
                        them. The man who can assert that another, who was within the lines of the
                        enemy, where all know the conscription act is of non effect, was "forced back by the conscription act" into the
                        Confederate lines, where alone that act could operate or affect him in the
                        slightest degree, exhibits a degree of stolid ignorance which is truly
                        astounding. </p>
                    <p>The absurdity of this charge is equaled only by that of another of the same
                        author, which no other but himself could be guilty of perpetrating. He
                        maintains that it is inconsistent for an individual to desire the
                        establishment of organized companies to repel raids and plundering parties
                        of the enemy, who did not go solitary and alone
                        (for at that time there was no organization and no other citizen thought of
                        going) to meet and drive back the whole army of the "enemy marching
                        triumphantly up the Valley, driving the small band of veterans under
                        Stonewall Jackson before them, who on account of the paucity of his numbers
                        was compelled to leave the main road, retreating to Port Republic, thus
                        leaving, as it was thought, the town of Staunton at the mercy of the
                        invaders." </p>
                    <p>As "Stonewall Jackson and his veterans," deeming "discretion the better part
                        of valor," had gotten out of the way and left an
                        opportunity for a fair fight between the "enemy marching triumphantly up the
                        Valley" and ourself, "A Soldier" thinks that we
                        were very remiss because we did not "pitch in" and drive the whole army of
                        the enemy defeated, discomfited and totally routed, confused, confounded and
                        disgraced to their own homes beyond the flowing waters of the lovely
                        Potomac. We are much obliged to him for the compliment, but it is so much
                        above our deserts that we blush in the apprehension that it may verge upon
                        flattery, which is always offensive. He seems to think that we possess in
                        our single person the military prowess of Achilles multiplied ten thousand
                        fold. We have a more modest opinion of ourself, and think that such an
                        adventure "upon our own hook" would have excelled in madness anything every
                        undertaken by the chivalrac knight De La Mancha. We never conceived that the
                        madness of Don Quixote would ever be excelled till we witnessed the folly,
                        madness and absurdity exhibited by this anonymous writer who pays us such
                            undeserved compliments. </p>
                    <p>This writer may consider it compatible with the character of "A Soldier" to
                        take advantage of the concealment furnished by a fictitious signature to
                        calumniate the character of one who has never given him the slightest cause
                        of provocation, but we suppose that there is not a
                            soldier in our army who concurs with him in that view. When he
                        shall have the manliness to announce his name, company and regiment in the
                        "Vindicator," we will give to him and his false charges such further notice
                        as we may deem them worthy of receiving. </p>
                    <p>We are at a loss to know what can be the character of the ideas respecting
                        editorial courtesy entertained by an editor who allows his paper to be made
                        the medium for anonymous writers to calumniate the character of another
                        editor. We do not mention this in the way of complaint, for we know that
                            we cannot be injured by it, but we mention it
                        as showing a remarkably nice sense of propriety and an unusual degree of
                        good taste. We acknowledge the right of any editor to conduct his paper
                        according to his own taste. "De gustibus non est
                            disputandum." "Every one should consult his own taste," as the
                        fellow said who nursed the skunk. </p>
                    <p>An editor who declines to correct a false charge which he, himself, has made
                        against another, and that, too, when his special attention has been called
                        to it, and when not only his sense of simple justice, but his "magnanimity"
                        has been appealed to, may very readily consider it consistent with his ideas of editorial propriety to allow the use
                        of his columns to anonymous calumniators of another editor. </p>
                    <p>Whilst it is our disposition to be upon terms of amity with all men,
                        particularly members of the editorial fraternity, yet we wish it distinctly
                        understood that we "know our rights, and dare maintain them."</p>
                    <p>As to those who are now vainly endeavoring to injure us by calumny, or
                        influence our conduct as an editor by threats or personal violence, we defy
                        the whole pack, including every</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article sees in Vallandigham's nomination for Governor of Ohio signs
                    of increasing war weariness amongst Northerners.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The unanimous nomination of Vallandigham by the Democracy of Ohio, for the
                        highest office in the gift of the people of that State, indicates, says the
                        Lynchburg Virginian, the progress of discontent
                        towards the Lincoln Government, which is steadily increasing in the North.
                        It will embolden the opposition everywhere; and one may expect to see still
                        more out-spoken utterances respecting the despotism enthroned at Washington.
                        The people of Ohio have dared to question, and to denounce the validity of
                        that act by which one of their most prominent citizens was driven into
                        exile. What will Lincoln do? Can he accomplish what Edmund Burke, quite as
                        good a statesman as himself, could not? Can he "frame an indictment against
                        a whole people?" Burke knew not how to do it. Lincoln may. Yet, we believe
                        Vallandigham, who stated it as his conviction that no more prominent men
                        would be exiled. Meanwhile, the opposition will strengthen by the aliment it
                        feeds upon. It will increase, but Lincoln must decrease. Already we see the
                        beginning of the end. The progress of discontent at the North, and the
                        growing clamors for peace, will, after a while, paralyze the energies of the
                        Administration.--Whilst our armies are energetically engaged in conquering a
                        peace, we shall find co-workers in the Northern men, who, convinced that war
                        will never restore the Union, are determined to inaugurate peace. They will
                        have peace, and that secured, if natural affinities and of the Union, as
                        they wish, they will never consent to try again the arbitrament of arms.
                        This we understand to be the position of Vallandigham; now the most
                        prominent, the most popular, and the ablest statesman of the North. </p>
                    <p>We cannot, therefore, divest ourselves of a certain degree of interest in
                        what is now transpiring in Ohio and other Northern States. The agitations
                        that are seen there promise the speediest solution of our national troubles,
                        and are the only signs that foreshadow the end of the war. Heaven speed
                        them!</p>

                    <p>The revival of the barbarous practice of Raids renders necessary the revival
                        of the system adopted to counteract it. Yankee raids will have two objects:
                        1. To cut our lines of communication; 2. To carry off or destroy our
                        property. As it is impossible to foresee where a raid may come in, it will
                        be impossible to provide a drilled force to resist it at every point. Our
                        object must be two fold. 1. To guard bridges and public stores; 2. To remove
                        from the line of a raid families, slaves, stock and provisions, or other
                        property liable to destruction. For this object, the following plea is
                        proposed.</p>
                    <p>SIGNALS.</p>
                    <p>1. The county courts of the border counties subject to predatory invasion
                        should appoint an officer or committee, whose duty it should be to examine
                        the quarter liable to raids, and adopt a system of plain signals, adapted to
                        the character of the country, preferring "beacon fires" or smokes, where the
                        points of view are sufficiently conspicuous, and providing adequate notice
                        to "Raise the Country" upon the earliest information of a raid.</p>
                    <p>RAID GUARDS.</p>
                    <p>2. The courts should appoint a commander with a company of 80 men, in each
                        magisterial district, whose duty it should be first to examine the roads and
                        points capable of easy obstruction, and secondly, upon notice of a raid to
                        block and obstruct the roads in every manner possible.</p>
                    <p>3. Upon notice of a raid, thus spread throughout the country, the citizens
                        should first remove their families, horses, cattle and provisions from the
                        line of the raid. The force intended for the protection of public buildings,
                        stores, bridges, &amp;c., should at once repair to their posts of
                        defence.</p>
                    <p>4. The roads throughout the whole country having been thus obstructed, the
                        citizens should turn out to embarrass the enemy, and increase the chances of
                        capture upon their retreat.</p>
                    <p>This plan is recommended as easy of execution--taking the people but little
                        from their crops--enabling every one to do something, and, in the end,
                        tending to defeat and capture or destroy the enemy. To rely alone on the
                        organization of Home Guards for resistance, must expose us to much danger.
                        Mounted men can easily avoid small companies of infantry, if the roads are
                        open, but if the roads are obstructed, the delay occasioned will be of great
                        use, and the Home Guards can then inflict more damage than in other way. Let
                        the two systems be combined.--Whig.</p>
