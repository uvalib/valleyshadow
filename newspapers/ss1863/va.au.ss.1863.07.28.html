<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>General Pickett receives the order to charge those batteries at the opportune
                        moment. The cannonade still goes on with intense fury; our batteries are
                        handled with great skill. This battery and that limbers up, advance to the
                        front, wheel into action, and again the roar of cannon becomes deafening.
                        Our shells seem robust with terrible accuracy; now a caisson of the enemy's
                        is blown up--quickly another follows; their fire slackens; the order comes
                        in advance. That flag which waved amid the wild temptest [sic] of battle at
                        Gaine's Mill, at Frazer's Farm, and at Manassas, never rose more proudly.
                        Kemper, with as gallant men as ever trod beneath that flag, leads the right;
                        Garnett, with his heroes, brings up the left; and the veteran Armistead,
                        with his brave troops, moves forward in support. The distance is more than
                        half a mile. As they advance the enemy fire with great rapidity--shell and
                        solid shot give place to grape and cannister--the very earth quivers beneath
                        the heavy roar--wide gaps are made in this regiment, and that brigade; yet
                        they quickly close up and steadily move onward--that flag goes down; but see
                        how quickly it again mounts upward! borne by some gallant man, who feels
                        keenly the honor of his old commonwealth, in this hour which is to test her
                        manhood. The line moves onward--straight onward; cannons roaring, grape and
                        canister plunging and ploughing through the ranks; bullets whizzing as thick
                        as ballstones in winter, and men falling as leaves fail when shaken by the
                        blasts of autumn. In a double-quick, and with a shout which rises above the
                        roar of battle, they charge--now they pour in volleys of musketry--they
                        reach the works--the contest rages with intense fury--men fight almost hand
                        to hand--the red cross and gridiron wave defiantly in close proximity--the
                        enemy are slowly yielding--a Federal officer dashing forward in front of his
                        shrinking columns, and with flashing sword, urges them to stand. Gen.
                        Pickett, seeing the splendid, valor of his troops, moves among them as if
                        courting death by his own daring intrepidity. The noble Garnett is dead,
                        Armistead wounded--and the brave Kemper, with hat in hand, still cheering on
                        his men, falls from his horse into the ranks of the enemy--his men rush
                        forward, rescue their General, and he is borne mortally wounded from the
                        field. Where is the gallant Williams? The First is there, but his clear
                        voice is no longer heard--he has fallen lifeless, and there goes his horse,
                        now riderless. There stand the decimated ranks of the Third; and Mayo,
                        though struck stands firm with his faithful men, animating them to yet more
                        daring deeds; but Calcott, the Christian soldier, who stood unmoved amid
                        this carnival of death, has fought his last battle; no sound shall awake him
                        to glory again, till the summons of the Great Judge, announcing to him the
                        reward of the faithful soldier, who has fought the good fight. Patton, Otey,
                        and Tery, who but a moment since, stood at the head of their respective
                        regiments, are wounded. The brave Hunton here of Leesburg, most worthy
                        successor of the noble Garnett, Stewart, and Galt, lies wounded. Carrington,
                        his gallant regiment shattered, stands firmly, flaunting defiantly his
                        colors in the very face of the enemy. Allen and Ellis killed. Hodges, too,
                        has fallen; and the modest, chivalrous Edmunds lies numbered with with [sic]
                        the noble dead; Aylett wounded, and Magruder has gone down in the shock of
                        battle.--The fight goes on--but few are left, and the shrinking columns of
                        the enemy gain confidence from the heavy reinforcements advanced to their
                        support. They, too, are moving in large force on the right flank. This
                        division, small at first, with ranks now torn and shattered, most of its
                        officers killed or wounded, no valor able to rescue victory from such a
                        grasp, annihilation or capture inevitable, slowly, reluctantly fell back. It
                        was not given to these few remaining brave men to accomplish human
                        impossibilities. The enemy dared not follow them beyond their works.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>It is due to General Pickett and his division that the country should know
                        and properly appreciate the service rendered by them in the terrible action
                        of the 3d of July.</p>
                    <p>The day preceding, the division had made a long and toilsome march. At 8
                        o'clock of the 3d, they moved forward to the field of battle, and were in
                        position very early on the morning of that event... day. During a
                        considerable portion of the forenoon, the division were exposed to the
                        burning rays of a July sun and the terrible shelling from the enemy's
                        batteries. They very much exhausted by the intense heat, and seriously
                        crippled by the enemy's fire; about 8 o'clock they were ordered to charge
                        the heights. An eye witness testifies that they formed into line of battle
                        as coolly and deliberately as if forming for dress parade. Headed by their
                        gallant officers, the column being led by General Pickett himself, they
                        moved forward to the carnage across a plain, some 500 yards in width,
                        subjected to the action of guns smoking like a hurricane of death all over
                        the field.</p>
                    <p>The noble and gallant Pickett, commanding then pressed up to the ugly
                        ramparts of the enemy. It is believed that a more gallant and heroic charge
                        was never made on this continent.--Pickett's division has been in the
                        hardest fighting of this bloody war. The division have borne themselves well
                        and nobly, always and everywhere. But the crowning glory of those patriot
                        heroes was achieved in the assault upon the ironclad crest of Gettysburg.
                        The list of casualties tells, in terms of truer eloquence, the bravery and
                        patriotism of that blood-stained and self-honored division, than can any
                        figures of rhetoric or poetry. Every Brigadier fell, and a long catalogue of
                        Colonels and other officers. The division went in from five to six thousand
                        strong. Three days after the battle but fifteen hundred reported for duty.
                        Well done, noble heroes, officers and men; your country will cherish the
                        memory of your deeds and sufferings with a gratitude and affection which
                        time can never obliterate. Major General Pickett has well earned, and will
                        no doubt receive the meed [sic] of his country's praise. Without meaning to
                        disparage any other officer or division, it is, indeed, a high honor to have
                        belonged to Pickett's division and to have fought under that gallant
                        commander.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The fierce spirit of the rioters of New York has been lulled to sleep by the
                        appropriation of $2,500,000 to purchase the exemptions of those drafted, and
                        the treacherous promise of the authorities that the draft would be suspended
                        in the city. This fierce spirit of resistance to the draft is not dead, but
                        only sleepeth, and will, we opine, in a short time, manifest itself in a
                        more furious and terrible manner. They may be willing to see the
                        administration practicing treachery towards us, but we suppose that they
                        will not submit to have the same dishonorable game practiced upon
                        themselves. Col. Nugent, Acting Assistant Provost Marshal General, announced
                        that the draft was suspended in the cities of New York and Brooklyn. After
                        which Governor Seymour pledged his word that the draft should be suspended.
                        After the rioters became convinced of their triumph in defeating the
                        execution of the draft, they dispersed, became quiet and returned to their
                        homes and avocations. As soon as the rioters had been thus lulled into false
                        repose, the following order was issued from Washington:</p>
                    <p>WAR DEPARTMENT, <br>Provost Marshal General's Office, <br>Washington, July
                        17, 1863 </p>
                    <p>The operations of the draft lately ordered in the New England and Middle
                        States, though in most instances completed, or now in progress without
                        opposition, have in one or two cites been temporarily interrupted.</p>
                    <p>The Provost Marshals are informed that no orders have been issued
                        countermanding the draft.</p>
                    <p>Adequate force has been ordered by the Government to the points where the
                        proceedings have been interrupted.</p>
                    <p>Provost Marshals will be sustained by the military forces of the country in
                        enforcing the draft, in accordance with the laws of the United States, and
                        will proceed to execute the laws heretofore given for the draft as rapidly
                        as shall be practicable, by aid of the military force ordered to cooperate
                        with and protect them.</p>
                    <p>JAS. B. FRY, <br>Provost Marshal General. </p>
                    <p>The surprise and indignation which would be naturally excited in the bosoms
                        of the rioters by this order can be readily imagined. Governor Seymour
                        promised that the Constitutionality of the draft should be tested in the
                        civil courts of the State. If the draft shall be executed in spite of these
                        fair promises on the part of Seymour, and in violation of the announcement
                        made by Colonel Nugent, these people will arise with redoubled fury in
                        opposition to its execution, and their example will be followed in various
                        parts of the North. The draft will be of no benefit to Lincoln, but may be
                        of immense value to us.</p>
                    <p>Before the riot was over the New York Herald reported the casualties as
