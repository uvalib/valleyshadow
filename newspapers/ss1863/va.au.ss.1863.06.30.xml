                    significant testimony against their own themes and pretensions, and in favor of
                    the South. The following account of the horrible condition of the slaves in
                    Nashville is from the charge of the Grand Jury by Judge Brien on the act for the
                    punishment of slaves:"</commentary>
                <excerpt>"They are too lazy to work; too ignorant to distinguish between liberty and
                    license; too shameless to respect common decency, and too degraded to respect
                    the ordinary rules of morality. The men are thieves and burglars, the women

                    <p>We of the city of Nashville are absolutely cursed with the presence of a
                        negro population which we find it impossible to control. Nashville is made
                        the general rendezvous for all the runaway negroes in this and some of the
                        adjoining States. They thrust themselves into the houses of our citizens and
                        defy the owners to oust them. They pilfer, they steal, they scruple at
                        nothing; they respect nobody; they regard no law, human or divine. Some of
                        them are engaged in hospitals, but they are so numerous that this is perhaps
                        only a fractional part. They promenade our streets; they crowd our
                        sidewalks; tread our alleys; they fill our houses, cellars, garrets. They
                        are too lazy to work; too ignorant to distinguish between liberty and
                        license; too shameless to respect common decency, and too degraded to
                        observe the ordinary rules of morality. The men are thieves and burglars,
                        the women prostitutes and vagrants. There is scarcely a stable, a hog pen or
                        a hen roost that does not bear the impress of a long heel and hollowless
                        instep. These negroes are a curse to the army, a cancer to society, a blight
                        upon honesty, morality and decency, and a leech upon the Government.</p>

                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Among the registered enemies of the United States government who have been
                        recently sent across the lines, from New Orleans, there is now in this city
                        a lady whose adventures place her in the ranks of the Molly Pitchers of the
                        present revolution.</p>
                    <p>At the breaking out of the war, Mrs. Laura J. Williams, (the lady to whom we
                        allude,) was a resident of Arkansas. Like most of the women of the South,
                        her whole soul was enlisted in the struggle for independence. Her husband
                        was a Northern man by birth and education, and a strong Union man. After
                        Arkansas seceded from the Union, he went to Connecticut, he said, to see his
                        relations and settle upon some business. Mrs. Williams suspected his
                        purpose, and finally she received information that he had joined the Yankee
                        army. Possessing little of the characteristic weakness of her sex, either in
                        body or mind, Mrs. W. vowed to offer her life upon the altar of her country.
                        Disguising herself in a Confederate uniform, and adopting the name of "Henry
                        Benford," she proceeded to Texas where she raised and equiped [sic] an
                        independent company, and went to Virginia with it as 1st Lieutenant. She was
                        in the battle of Leesburg and several skirmishes; but, finally, her sex
                        having been discovered by the surgeon of the regiment--the 5th Texas
                        Volunteers, to which the company had been attached--she returned to her home
                        in Arkansas. After remaining their [sic] a short time, she proceeded to
                        Corinth, and was in the battle of Shiloh, where she displayed great coolness
                        and courage. She saw her father on the field, but, of course, he did not
                        recognize her, and she did not make herself known to him. In the second
                        days' fighting she was wounded in the head, and was ordered to the rear. She
                        wrote to her father, and then came on down to Grenada, where she waited for
                        some time, but never saw or heard from him.</p>
                    <p>She then visited New Orleans, was taken sick, and while sick the city was
                        captured. On recovery, she retired to coast, where she employed herself in
                        carrying communications, assisting parties to run the blockade with drugs
                        and cloths for uniforms. She was informed on by a negro and arrested and
                        brought before General Butler. She made her appearance before Gen. Butler in
                        a Southern homespun dress. She refused to take the oath, told him she
                        gloried in being a rebel--had fought side by side with Southern men for
                        Southern rights, and if she ever lived to see "Dixie" she would no [sic] it
                        again. Butler denounced her as the most incorrigible she rebel he had ever
                        met with. By order of the Beast she was placed in confinement, where she
                        remained three months. Some time after her release, she was arrested again
                        for carrying on "contraband correspondence," and kept in a dungeon fourteen
                        days on bread and water at the expiration of which time she was placed in
                        the State prison as a dangerous enemy. Her husband, it so happened, was a
                        lieutenant in the 18th Connecticut regiment, and on duty as Provost Guard in
                        the city. He accidently found her out and asked if she wanted to see him.
                        She sent him word she never wanted to see him as long as he wore the Yankee
                        uniform. But he forced himself upon her, tried to persuade her to take the
                        oath, get a release, when he said he would resign to take her to his
                        relations in Connecticut. She indignantly spurned his proposition, and he
                        left her to her fate. When Gen. Banks assumed command he released a great
                        many prisoners, but kept her in confinement until the 17th of May last, when
                        she was sent across the lines to Meadesville with the registered enemies.</p>
                    <p>An article was recently published in the New York "World" in relation to the
                        part Mrs. Williams has played in this war, but the above is, we are assured,
                        a true account of her remarkable career. We understand she has attached
                        herself to the medical staff of a brigade now in this city, and will render
                        all assistance in her power to our wounded in the approaching struggle for
                        possession of the great Valley of the Mississippi.</p>

                    <p>In the last "Spectator" I noticed an editorial article, entitled "The Good
                        Old Way," which occasioned me much surprise. When the enemy were marching
                        triumphantly up the Valley, driving the small band of veterans under
                        Stonewall Jackson before them, who, on account of the paucity of his
                        numbers, was compelled (?) to leave the main road, retreating to Port
                        Republic, thus leaving, as it was thought, the town of Staunton at the mercy
                        of the invaders, the writer of that article did not show, at that most
                        opportune moment, even a desire to <emph rend="italic">defend</emph> his
                        home. When we were standing firmly and defending <emph rend="italic">his
                            property</emph> and <emph rend="italic">home</emph> at the expense of
                        some of the best blood in our army, where was he? Leaving his printing
                        office and property he fled at the first approach of danger to Lewisburg,
                        (not from fear of the enemy, but simply of fighting in defence of his home,
                        as the enemy occupied the section to which he fled,) where he remained until
                        forced back by the conscription act and a fear of the confiscation of his
                        property as an alien enemy. </p>
                    <p>It is said that doctors rarely practice what they preach, and in this
                        instance, judging by his <emph rend="italic">acts</emph>, "the good old way"
                        when Tarleton threatened, which he preaches, would not be <emph
                            rend="italic">his "good old way."</emph></p>
                    <p>This much I have thought proper to say in reference to the editor of the
                        Spectator who so unjustly assails officers who did their duty, and who stood
                        at their post, when he so shamefully fled to escape fighting for <emph
                            rend="italic">his own</emph> and his <emph rend="italic">neighbor'
                        homes</emph> [sic]. It may be proper to add that the writer, although from
                        another State, assisted in the defense of this same editor's home in that
                        remarkable Valley campaign, and is still </p>
                    <p>June 19--1t.</p>
                    <p>A SOLDIER.</p>
                    <p>The above is the anonymous communication, signed "A Soldier," the absurd
                        charges of which we noticed last week, and promised to notice them further,
                        as well as the <emph rend="italic">author</emph> of them, if he would have
                        the "manliness to announce his name." This he has <emph rend="italic"
                        >not</emph> done, and has, therefore, relieved us of any obligation to
                        notice them again; but, as the editor of the "Vindicator" has given them a
                            <emph rend="italic">quasi</emph> endorsement, and has given his pledge
                        to send the "refutation of them to the identical set of readers the charges
                        have gone to," we have concluded to notice them more in detail, and with as
                        much seriousness as the ridiculous and absurd characters of the charges will
                        admit. We publish the whole communication, that our readers may see that we
                        meet every proposition it contains fairly, squarely and fully. </p>
                    <p>We will present in the order in which they occur every proposition contained
                        in the communication, and will notice them in the same order.</p>
                    <p>1. It is inconsistent in us to recommend organization for Home Defence,
                        because we did not go to meet the enemy when they were driving Stonewall
                        Jackson and his veterans up the Valley.</p>
                    <p>2. That "the enemy occupied the section to which we fled."</p>
                    <p>3. That we were "forced back by the Conscription act."</p>
                    <p>4. That we feared the "confiscation of our property as an alien enemy."</p>
                    <p>5. That he makes these charges against us because we "unjustly assailed
                        officers who did their duty."</p>
                    <p>6. That he, a soldier from another State, assisted in the defence of our
                        home.</p>
                    <p>In reply to the foregoing charges, we say--</p>
                    <p>1. At the time to which he refers, when the "enemy were marching triumphantly
                        up the Valley" driving Jackson and his army before them, there was no
                        organization here, and, as a consequence, no citizen thought of going to
                        meet the enemy. Gen. Jackson and his army left the Valley road at
                        Harrisonburg and marched to Swift Run Gap--a gap in the Blue Ridge
                        mountains. It was tho't here at the time that Jackson was on his way to
                        Gordonsville. The enemy were in full force near Harrisonburg, and there was
                        not a soldier between this place and that to offer any resistance to their
                        march to this place. Because we did not go <emph rend="italic">solitary and
                            alone to drive back the whole Yankee army, or else surround them and
                            take them all prisoners</emph>, he thinks it extremely and strangely
                        inconsistent in us now to recommend organization for the purpose of meeting
                        plundering parties of the enemy if they should make their appearance in this
                        section of the State. As we said last week, he seems to think that we
                        possess in our single person the military prowess of Achilles multiplied ten
                        thousand fold, which is <emph rend="italic">rather</emph> more than we
                        really possess. If he had been half as good a soldier as he gives us credit
                        for, the "enemy would never have marched triumphantly up the Valley, driving
                        Stonewall Jackson and his veterans before them." Upon his principle, it
                        would be impossible to establish any organization for Home defence in this
                        county, as none could join consistently save those who marched to meet the
                        enemy at the time to which he refers, and as <emph rend="italic">none</emph>
                        did so, <emph rend="italic">none</emph> could join such an organization. </p>
                    <p>2. The enemy did <emph rend="italic">not</emph> occupy Lewisburg when <emph
                            rend="italic">we went there</emph>, on the contrary it was held by a
                        considerable Confederate force under the command of Brig. Gen. Harry Heth,
                        and the enemy were not in any force, nearer than the Kanawha Valley. </p>
                    <p>3. We noticed last week the absurdity of the charge that a man who was within
                        the lines of the enemy where the conscript act is of <emph rend="italic"
                        >non</emph> effect could be "forced back by the conscription act" into the
                        Confederate lines where alone that act could effect him in the slightest
                        degree. The man who leaves the lines of the enemy to enter the Confederate
                        lines, shows, by that act, that the "conscription act" has no terrors for
                        him. </p>
                    <p>4. The fear of the "confiscation of our property as an <emph rend="italic"
                            >alien enemy</emph>" never entered into our head, and we suppose such an
                        idea never entered the head of any other <emph rend="italic">rational</emph>
                        man. How the wildest imagination could make an <emph rend="italic"
                        >alien</emph> of a man who is a "native and to the manor born," and who has
                        lived all his life within the State of his birth, and has never been off the
                        soil of his native State longer than three weeks, (and that was years before
                        the war) we are at a loss to conceive. We have never <emph rend="italic"
                            >gone</emph> into the lines of the enemy, though we were for some time
                        within them. The lines of the enemy were thrown around us by the retreat of
                        our forces and the advance of the enemy. The position of "A Soldier" would
                        make alien enemies of every one embraced within the lines of the enemy.
                        Every soldier captured would be an alien enemy. Of the manner in which we
                        confronted the enemy in the midst of trial when the <emph rend="italic"
                            >patriotism and moral courage</emph> of every citizen were put to the
                        test, it is not for us to speak--we leave that for those who were witnesses
                        of it. We will only say that there is no part of our life upon which we
                        reflect with more pleasure and pride.--We had deliberately resolved to
                        sacrifice, not only property, but life itself, rather than take the oath of
                        allegiance to the U.S. Government, and daily urged upon others the propriety
                        of making the same resolve. And yet "A Soldier" whose <emph rend="italic"
                            >moral courage</emph> has not been tested, and whose patriotism has not
                        been put into the crucible of trial, talks about us as an <emph
                            rend="italic">alien enemy</emph>. Fudge! </p>
                    <p>5. We would be obliged to him if he would mention the names of any officers,
                        or even the name of a <emph rend="italic">single</emph> officer, whom we
                        have "unjustly assailed."--We have <emph rend="italic">never unjustly</emph>
                        assailed any officer. This remark of "A Soldier" betrays a great deal more
                        than he designed, for it furnishes the key not only to the motives which
                        prompted his unprovoked charges against us, but also to the authorship. When
                        we called upon the author to announce his name, it was not because we felt
                        at any loss to know it, but because we desired to have the privilege of
                        exposing him <emph rend="italic">publicly by name</emph>. His name obtained
                        in any other way, we would not feel authorized to use in that manner. </p>
                    <p>The remarks we made about the "Officer" to whom he refers, were based upon
                        the statement of the "Vindicator," edited by his friend and relative. The
                        conduct of which we expressed our disapprobation, that "officer" has not
                        even <emph rend="italic">attempted to justify</emph>. If his super
                        serviceable friends and relatives desire to "keep before the people" his
                        conduct in that matter, we are too accommodating to decline to gratify them. </p>
                    <p>6. It will be observed that he boasts his citizenship of <emph rend="italic"
                            >another</emph> State, and claims great credit for defending <emph
                            rend="italic">our</emph> home. The spirit of his communication would
                        indicate that it would afford him more pleasure to <emph rend="italic"
                            >destroy</emph> anything we have, even our character, more precious to
                        us than anything else, than to defend it. He, a Virginian by birth, now
                        boasts his citizenship of <emph rend="italic">another</emph> State, and,
                        yet, has the effrontery to speak of such as have clung to the State of their
                        nativity as alien enemies. We do not doubt his <emph rend="italic"
                        >patriotic</emph> motives in leaving the country of his birth, for we think
                        he "left his country for his <emph rend="italic">country's good</emph>." </p>
                    <p>We have thus noticed as briefly as we well could all the propositions
                        contained in the communication of our anonymous assailant, and it is for the
                        public to decide whether or not we have answered fairly, candidly and
                        satisfactorily. We abide with confidence the decision of a fair, impartial
                        and unprejudiced public.</p>
                    <p>The only truthful statement which our assailant makes concerning us is, that
                        we did not leave "from fear of the enemy"; for, notwithstanding that most
                        our friends, though they intended themselves to remain, advised us to leave,
                        as we would be sure to be taken prisoner, because we were an editor who had
                        been making war upon the enemy ever since Lincoln had issued his
                        proclamation, and that any copy of our paper would furnish conclusive
                        evidence of our hostility to the United States Government, yet we had
                        determined to remain and run all the risks of capture. What determined us
                        finally to leave was the fact that the proprietors and boarders of the hotel
                        in which we were boarding stampeded and left our wife the only female
                        occupant of the hotel. No one would expect us to leave her there under such
                        circumstances. We resolved to take her to her father's home--the proper
                        place under such circumstances--and to return ourself in a short time to
                        Staunton. We had made our preparations to return, when the withdrawal of our
                        forces, leaving every family liable to be visited by plundering parties of
                        the enemy, made it our <emph rend="italic">duty</emph>, as we conceived, to
                        remain, at all hazards of capture or worse treatment, to protect, as far as
                        we could, the family of females who had no other male protector than
                        ourself. In this connection we publish an extract from an editorial article
                        which appeared in the "Spectator" on the 23rd of September, 1862--the first
                        issue published after our return. That extract is as follows: </p>
                    <p>"After an unavoidable suspension of 5 months we have the pleasure of resuming
                        the publication of the "Spectator." When its publication was suspended, in
                        April last, we expected to resume it in a short time, but were prevented by
                        the fact that our presence was needed to protect a defenceless family of
                        females, within the lines and in the presence of the enemy, against any
                        obtrusion, violence, or insult which the debased soldiery of the enemy might
                        attempt to perpetrate. The official duties in the Confederate service of
                        every male member of the family rendering it impossible for them to be at
                        home, the family would have been without a male protector if we had not
                        remained with them. For the space of three consecutive months they were so
                        situated as to be the victims of alarm almost every day and night. During
                        that time, two fights occurred in the town [Lewisburg] in which they
                        lived--one on the 12th, and the other on the 23rd of May last. The former
                        being when the enemy, by vastly superior numbers, drove off the gallant
                        Greenbrier cavalry company, under the command of Captain B. F. Eakle, which
                        had been left there to protect that place against marauding parties of the
                        enemy, when our forces, under Brigadier General Heth, withdrew from that
                        place to Dublin Depot, to protect the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, and
                        the latter, the battle between the forces of Brig. Gen. Heth, and those of
                        the enemy, under the command of Brig. Gen. Crook, in which the enemy was
                        successful, and consequently retained military possession of the town. After
                        the battle, the enemy were infuriated to such a degree that they acted more
                        like demons than men--they threatened to lay the town in ashes, and it was
                        thought that they would do so."</p>
                    <p>We know not how others would have acted under similar circumstances, but we
                        know that the motives which influenced us to go to Lewisburg, and the
                        motives which influenced us to stay there as long as we did, at the
                        sacrifice of our business and pecuniary interests, meet the approbation of
                        our own conscience. We knew that in staying we ran great risks, as the
                        probabilities were that we would be taken prisoner, but believing it to be
                        our <emph rend="italic">duty</emph> to stay, we were ready to hazard all
                        dangers.--Whilst we believe we are in the line of <emph rend="italic"
                        >duty</emph>, we never shrink from any danger however great. We regret the
                        necessity of occupying so much of our space with personal matters which
                        should be devoted to a better purpose, but hope our readers will pardon us
                        this time. </p>

                <summary>A long and detailed rebuttal to the charges leveled by A Soldier in an
                    earlier letter. The gist of A Soldier's complaint seems to be that the editor of
                    the Spectator fled his responsibilities in the face of the approaching enemy.
                    This the editor fiercely denies in a long and often ad hominem attack on his
