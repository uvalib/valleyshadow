                    <p>Whereas, in and by the Constitution of the United States, it is provided that
                        the President shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences
                        against the United States, except in cases of impeachment and whereas, a
                        rebellion now exists whereby the loyal State government of several States
                        have, for a long time, been subverted, and many persons have committed, and
                        are guilty of treason against the United States; and whereas, with reference
                        to said rebellion and treason, laws have been enacted by Congress declaring
                        forfeitures and confiscation of property and liberation of slaves, all upon
                        terms and conditions therein stated, and also declaring that the President
                        was thereby authorized at any time thereafter, by proclamation to extend to
                        persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion in any State or
                        part thereof, pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions, and at such times,
                        and on such conditions, as he may deem expedient for the public wellfare
                        [sic]; and whereas, the Congressional declaration for limited and
                        conditional pardon accords with the well established judicial exposition of
                        the pardoning power; and whereas, with reference to the said rebellion the
                        President of the United States has issued several proclamations with
                        provisions in regard to the liberation of slaves; and whereas, it is now
                        desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said rebellion to resume their
                        allegiance to the United States, and to re-inaugurate loyal State
                        governments within and for their respective States, therefore, I, ABRAHAM
                        LINCOLN, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare and make known
                        to all persons who have directly, or by implication, participated in the
                        existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is
                        hereby granted to them and each of them, with restoration of all rights of
                        property except as to slaves, and in property except as hereinafter
                        excepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them,
                        with restoration of all rights of property except as to slaves, and in

                        upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath,
                        and thenceforward, keep and maintain said oath inviolate, and which oath
                        shall be registered for permanent preservation, and shall be of the tenor
                        and effect following, to wit:</p>
                    <p>I do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty God, that I will henceforth
                        faithfully support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United
                        States, and the Union of the States thereunder; and that I will in like
                        manner abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed during
                        the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far as not
                        repeated, modified or held void by Congress or by the decision of the
                        Supreme Court, and that I will in like manner abide by and faithfully
                        support all proclamations of the President, made during the existing
                        rebellion, having rference [sic] to slaves, so far as not modified or
                        declared void by decision of the Supreme Court. So help me God.</p>
                    <p>The persons except from the benefits from the benefits of the foregoing
                        provisions are all who are or shall have been civil or diplomatic officers
                        or agents of the socalled [sic] Confederate Government, all who have left

                        navy; all who have left seats in the United States Congress to aid the

                        States and afterwards aided the rebellion, and all who have engaged in any

                        otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons may have been

                        capacity. And I do further proclaim, declare and make known that whenever,
                        in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee,
                        Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina, a number of
                        persons not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such States
                        at the Presidential election of the year of our Lord 1863--each having taken
                        the oath aforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a qualified
                        voter by the election law of the States existing immediately before the so
                        called act of secession, and excluding all others--shall re-establish a
                        State government, which shall be republican, and in nowise contraving said
                        oath, such shall be recognized as the true government of the State, and the
                        State shall receive there under the benefit of the constitutional provision
                        which declares that "the United States shall guarantee to every State in
                        this Union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them
                        against invasion, on application of the Legislature, or of the Executive
                        when the Legislature cannot be convened, and against domestic violence."</p>
                    <p>And I no further proclaim, declare and make known that any provision which
                        may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed people of
                        such State, which shall recognize and declared their permanent freedom,
                        provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent as a temporary
                        arrangement with their present condition as a laboring, landless and
                        houseless class, will not be objected to by the national Executive. And it
                        is engaged as not improper that, in constructing a loyal State, government
                        in any State, the name of the State, the boundary, the sub divisions, the
                        Constitution and the general code of laws, as before the rebellion, be
                        maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary by the
                        conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if any, not contravening
                        said conditions, and which may be deemed expedient by those framing the new
                        State government.</p>
                    <p>To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation, so
                        far as it relates to State governments, has no reference to State
                        governments, has no reference to States wherein loyal State governments have
                        all the while been maintained. And for the same reason it may be proper to
                        further say that whether members sent to Congress from any State shall be
                        admitted to seat constitutionally, rests exclusively with the respective
                        house, and not to any extent with the Executive; and, still further, that
                        this proclamation is intended to present to the people of the States wherein
                        the national authority has been suspended, and loyal Sate [sic] governments
                        have been subverted, a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal
                        State governments may be re-establish within said States or in any of them;
                        and, while the mode presented is the best the Excutive [sic] can suggest
                        with his present impressions, it must not be understood that no other
                        possible mode would be acceptable.</p>
                    <p>Given under my hand, at the city of Washington, the eighth day of December,
                        A. D. one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the independence of
                        the United States of America the eighty-eighth.</p>

                    <p>We think it would be well if the citizens of Staunton would make some
                        arrangement to have a series of Lectures delivered in this place, the
                        proceeds to be appropriated for the benefit of the families of poor
                        soldiers. We have no doubt that the services of able and eloquent Lecturers
                        could be obtained, that the attendance would be good, and that the proceeds
                        would amount during the Winter, to a very considerable sum, which, properly
                        dispensed, would afford great relief to many deserving families. They might
                        get Dr. Hoge to deliver the Lectures in this place which he is now
                        delivering to crowded houses in Richmond for a similar object. The service
                        of other Lecturers could be obtained, so that one or more lectures might be
                        delivered each week during the Winter Season. Such lectures would afford
                        innocent and instructive entertainment and would be well attended. Will not
                        such an arrangement be made?</p>

                    <p>There is little doubt that the Congress will very soon pass a law
                        conscripting all foreigners in the Confederacy. This ought to have been done
                        long ago. It is a shame that these men should be permitted to enjoy all the
                        privileges of the country, without bearing its full burdens. They have made
                        fortunes out of the war, while the natives have fought the battles. This is
                        manifestly wrong. Every one of this class should be made to select between
                        leaving the country, or going into the army. The most of them will, of
                        course, adopt the former alternative and leave us, but we cannot say that we
                        either expect or desire them to do otherwise. They who are not willing to
                        share with us the fortunes of the Confederacy should abandon the
