                    <p>The first conflict of arms in this destructive war in which blood was spilt
                        occurred at Phillippa, in Barbour county, on Monday morning, the 3rd day of
                        June, 1861. It will be remembered that two of our gallant soldiers, Leroy P.
                        Dangerfield, jr., of Bath county, and Jas. Hanger, of this county, each lost
                        a leg in that unfortunate surprise and defeat. Mr. Hanger, being possessed
                        of good mechanical ingenuity, and too patriotic to be dependent upon the
                        Yankees for an artificial leg, invented by his own genius, and manufactured
                        by his own skill, an artificial leg, by which he is enabled to walk with
                        ease. Though this feat of skill reflects great credit upon the inventor and
                        manufacturer, yet we cannot indulge in the extravagant praise of the Editor
                        of the <emph rend="italic">Vindicator</emph>, who, in his last issue, said,
                            "<emph rend="italic">It is one of the most complete legs we have ever
                            seen.</emph>" We infer from this, that his extreme modesty has confined
                        his observation to his own "drum sticks," for it seems that, </p>

                <origin/>
                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Lincoln's Conscript Bill was amended in the House, and sent back to the
                        Senate, where the House amendment was concurred in, and the bill passed with
                        only six votes against it. Of the two Senators from the bogus State of
                        Western Virginia, Wiley voted for and Carlisle against it.</p>
                    <p>That the skies are now dark there can be no denying. We should prepare to
                        meet the crisis with courage and fortitude. The Richmond <emph rend="italic"
                            >Examiner</emph> says that "the inauguration of an absolute sovereign
                        over the Northern States of the late Union, has a signification of vital
                        importance to every man and woman in this country. The official publication
                        of the fact makes plain, to the humblest understanding, the nature and
                        duration of the war. Scraps of Northern Newspapers, the declamations of
                        individuals in the North, and our own universal and sincere desire for
                        peace, lose the power of delusion in the presence of this solid reality.
                        While it was possible to regard the Union as a republic, governed by the
                        representatives of the people, it was also possible to believe that the
                        evils of war would create a party among the people, that would force the
                        Government to terminate the struggle on reasonable terms and within a
                        limited time. But now that the Government has rendered itself entirely
                        independent of the people and its representatives--now that the last relic
                        of the Republican Constitution has been abolished, and absolute power
                        declared by Congress and proclaimed by the press to have been openly
                        substituted, it is beyond question that the duration of the war depends on
                        the will of Lincoln and his councillors. None need be told that these men
                        will not consent to any terms of peace. Setting aside considerations of
                        passion, it is enough to know that Lincoln has been invested with a
                        sovereign power over one of the greatest countries of the world, on the
                        expressed ground that he will destroy the Southern people, and take their
                        property for distribution among his followers. The moment he departs from
                        this purpose, the sword and purse drop from his hands, and he will be torn
                        to pieces by his own dogs. Therefore, while he stands on the bad eminence
                        where he is now placed, he will fight us with an inveterate determination
                        and with unchangeable cruelty. While Lincoln is President-dictator, and the
                        North contains a man or a dollar, they will be used to carry on the war."

                    <p>The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Examiner</emph> truly says that "this war
                        has thoroughly tested the true manhood of our people. When our country was
                        blessed with peace and plenty, there was a class of chivalrous knights of
                        the Don Quixote school, who despised the usual routine of business, and
                        desired, above all things, that an opportunity might be granted them to
                        display their fighting qualities. They were very blood-thirsty at the
                        beginning of the war, and expressed the strongest desire to literally eat up
                        ten times their number of live Yankees. But now, that the time has arrived
                        when every man can serve his country, and the chance of promotion is free to
                        all who distinguish themselves, these mighty men of Mars, these warriors

                <transcript>
                    <p>Early in the month of April, it may be expected that the great campaigns of
                        the East and West will re-open with unexampled activity. Certainly it has
                        not been from want of the means, or motives, or strength to fight, that the
                        powerful armies of Lee and Hooker, of Bragg and Rosencrans, have camped for
                        months in close proximity without a cannonade and almost without a skirmish.
                        Now that the condition of the ground permits the passage of cannon and the
                        march of columns, what both parties regards as the trial scene of the war,
                        will be speedily witnessed. The next two months will be signalized by the
                        most terrible battles of modern times.</p>
                    <p>We have no fear for the general result of the approaching campaign. The
                        Confederate armies have never been equal to what they now are. The preludes
                        of the coming collision which have already been witnessed are most
                        encouraging. Wherever they have touched, the Southern troops have made their
                        mark. Every affair indicates the high spirit which animates the Confederate
                        army; and the weakness or demoralized condition of the enemy is equally
                        evident.</p>
                    <p>In truth the field of the military affairs in all quarters is bright with
                        hope. Yet it cannot be denied that the sentiment of the country at this
                        moment, though not despondent, is serious and even sombre. It is affected by
                        the political complexion of the Northern States. The revolution in the
                        Constitution of their Government, consummated by the passage of the military
                        and financial bills through Congress, has destroyed the expectation of a
                        termination of the war for years to come, and renders any other conclusion
                        than that of our own destruction, or exhaustion and anarchy in the North,
                        less than probable. We have a long and gloomy perspective of danger and
                        desolation before us. This prospect does not inspire gayety of heart, and
                        the ideas it suggests are illustrated in the prodigious rise in gold.
