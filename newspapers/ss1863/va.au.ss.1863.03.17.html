<b>Correspondance of the Spectator</b><br> (Column 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Letter condemns Confederate violations of personal liberty with regard to
                    property, including the anti-distillation bill and the proposed Tobacco Bill.<br>(Names in announcement:   Walker,   Fulton, Dr. J. E. Lockbridge)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Editor. The papers, I doubt not, have kept you and your readers posted as
                        far as we are upon the important and current news of the day.</p>
                    <p>The House today repealed the law authorizing the distillation of grain into
                        Whiskey for Medical and Hospital purposes, which the Senate has yet to act
                        on. What will be its fate in that body we can't opine. The law has been
                        awfully abused, I learn by parties who embraced its provisions, hence the
                        plea for its repeal. In one county in Eastern Virginia, an Agent, under the
                        authority of the Act, gives out from ten to a dozen contracts to Sub-agents,
                        and you can at once see, whilst they distil one gallon for the Government at
                        $3, government price, they will distil, say from 3 to 5 gallons excess, for
                        which they can get 2 to $30 per gallon, therefore, they can afford to give
                        the Government its quota, and thus make $25 per gallon for their pockets.</p>
                    <p>Two of your delegates, I learn, voted for the repeal of the law. Messrs.
                        Walker and Fulton, upon the grounds that it has been abused, and they are
                        anxious that we should husband all our food for the army, and for the poor
                        families of soldiers in the field.</p>
                    <p>The Tobacco bill, which is to be suppress entirely [sic] (save for family
                        consumption), the growth of the weed, or at least to limit so many plants to
                        the hand, is before the Legislature, and will pass in some form. This is a
                        sad commentary upon the patriotism of our people, who declare they are
                        forced to this course, by Government agents who press their Corn far below
                        the market price; arguing that they will not press Tobacco, as it is not
                        needed for man or beast.</p>
                    <p>It is certainly a great infraction of personal and private rights, to say by
                        law what this or that man shall produce. The people are the best judges if
                        they are let alone, and know more about such matters than the Legislature of
                        Virginia. But the case is one sui generis. Our
                        Army must have bread. But let the axe be laid at the root of the evil. Make
                        these Government agents act within the limits of the law, give the farmer
                        the market value for his products, and we will guaranty our people will do
                        right. They are honest, patriotic, and know their own business better than
                        these Government agents, or their representatives. </p>
                    <p>The unprecedented advance of gold here, it is said, is caused by the exodus
                        of the Israelites, North, together with Judge Meredith's decision, but one
                        of the causes for the depreciation in Confederate notes, and rise in gold,
                        is the course pursued by the blockade runners, who are offering 45 to 50 per
                        cent, in Confederate for Virginia money. This at once strikes a blow at the
                        value of our currency here, and up pops gold. Congress says they have no
                        power to make Confederate money a legal tender, yet Government violates all
                        common law, all statute law, and all natural law, in suffering their agents
                        to impress property without a just equivalent. Last Spring they took from
                        the people Corn at 80 cents, Bacon at 20 cents, and Cattle at 7 cents, which
                        would now command twenty times that amount. And, these sacrifices were borne
                        too by many of us, who by a necessary net of the Government were left in the
                        Yankee lines, many of whom fled, however, from their homes because they
                        could not live under a Yankee invasion, and who are now compelled to pay
                        these awful prices or starve. All this growing out of the fact that Congress
                        will do nothing to make the currency they issue a legal tender, or give it
                        stability in some way, or by preventing the Yankees, directly through the
                        blockade runners to Baltimore and Philadelphia, from depreciating
                        Confederate notes, which they wont take, for their goods, but who are under
                        the rule of Old Abe allowed to take Virginia money. Thus we go. Our people
                        are yet hopeful and bouyant [sic], and I believe in the ultimate achievement
                        of our Independence. The prospects for peace, however, are gloomy. We have
                        never had any hopes of peace under the reign of King Abraham. His Abolition
                        Congress, before its close, gave him plenary powers, and declare him
                        Dictator as much so as the Czar of Russia. We will have to fight it out. May
                        our rulers have wisdom, virtue, capacity and honesty to direct the Ship of
                        State amid the breakers that surround us. The mania for the "Root of all
                        Evil," is as rife here as elsewhere. Rancid butter, blue poor tough beef,
                        and a weak infusion of dirty rye has caused board to rise at all the hotels.
                        The rise in board being a signal for a diminution in the fare, both in
                        quantity and quality, though the prices are from 6 to $8 per day. The hotel
                        keepers, as an excuse for their exorbitant prices, will tell you that
                        butter, beef, and all kinds of vegetables have greatly advanced, and many
                        other articles which they never bring to their tables, but yet they make you
                        pay for them. Would you call this extortion? I have no name for it. It is
                        some consolation, however, to see as you pass along plenty of everything
                        fat, nice and fine in all the eating houses or restaurants.</p>
                    <p>The Medical College terminated its course last week, and Virginia may well be
                        proud of the Virginia Medical College, and its able corps of lecturers, to
                        whom I listened with great interest for some weeks. Old Augusta, as usual,
                        may boast of the honor conferred upon one of her sons, Dr. J. E. Lockridge,
                        of Mt. Solon, who received, as he justly merited, the award of $50 for the
                        prize essay on Medicine-Subject, Dyptheria, that
                        scourge of the human race. Pardon me for trespassing. Adieu. </p>

<b>A Suggestion to our Farmers</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Item encourages farmers to invest in Confederate 8 percent bonds as a hedge
                    against future falling crop prices.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is manifest that there must soon be a great increase of taxation--both
                        State and Confederate. The probability is, that the aggregate will be about
                        two per centum on the value of every man's
                        estate--real and personal. A farmer, therefore, who has land, slaves and
                        other personal property worth $20,000, will have to pay $400 in taxes. This
                        he can do without much inconvenience while wheat, corn and rye are worth $4
                        per bushel, and other things of his farm in proportion. Every one now has
                        more money than he knows what to do with; but when prices fall to their
                        natural and regular rates, the burthen will be heavy--nay, almost ruinous. </p>
                    <p>Now is the time for every prudent man to make provision against the evil day.
                        Let every farmer, instead of wasting his money in buying things not
                        indispensable, invest it in Confederate 8 per cent bonds to an amount which
                        will yield an interest equal to his taxes. By doing so, and holding the
                        bonds to let the interest meet his taxes, he will obtain an exemption from
                        taxation on the residue of his property. It will be easy for a farmer with
                        property worth $20,000 to buy $5,000 of Confederate bonds, and the interest
                        on this, which is $400, will, year by year, discharge his taxes. The taxes
                        will be a lien on every man's land in the future; and now is the time, when
                        money is cheap, in effect to discharge this lien by buying an equivalent in
                        8 per cent bonds. Let the bonds be worth what they may in the market, the
                        interest will always be an offset against taxes, and thus the holder will
                        always be secure of getting paid in the form of a discharge from his taxes.</p>
                    <p>If our farmers will pursue this course, they will render the public a great
                        service, by relieving the Government of a part of the redundant currency;
                        and they will save themselves from most oppressive burthens in the future.</p>
                    <p>Let, then, the man worth $20,000 buy $5,000 worth of Confederate bonds; the
                        man worth $40,000 buy $10,000 worth; and the man worth $60,000 buy $15,000,
                        and so on in proportion. Those who pursue this course will, hereafter, thank
                        us for our suggestion.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In these times, when that desolating moral simoom, a spirit of exhorbitant
                        speculation, has converted society into a vast Sahara, by withering the
                        flowers of benevolence and drying up the fountains of charity, it affords us
                        much pleasure to be enabled to state that there are yet remaining a few
                        oases to redeem the scene from total desolation, and to inspire the hope
                        that there are yet enough good men living to save our country from the fate
                        of Sodom and Gomorrah. We have the pleasure to announce that there is at
                        least one man in this county, and we hope there are many more, who furnishes
                        supplies to the families of the soldiers at the following rates:</p>
                    <p>Bacon at 12 1-2 cents per lb; butter at 25 cents per lb; corn at 75 cents per
                        bushel, and other things, upon the same principle, and in similar
                        proportions. The market price in his neighborhood for these articles is as
                        follows; Bacon, $1.00 per lb.; butter, $1.00 per lb, and corn, $3.00 per
                        bushel. This citizen will be surprised and possibly shocked by seeing his
                        name in this connection given to the public, but as we give it that others
                        may be induced, by his example, to "go and do likewise," we hope he will
                        pardon us for giving publicity to his name. We allude to Mr. Solomon Miller,
                        who resides near Hermitage in this county. He belongs to the army of "Home
                        soldiers," and, both as a patriot and christian, is "fighting the good
                        fight," and will reap the patriot's and christian's reward. Let others
                        follow this noble example, whilst speculators and extortioners, if they have
                        any sensibility, will, with crimson blushes, hang their heads in shame. They
                        should remember that their ill-gotten gains will never profit them nor their
                        children. We commend to the consideration of this despicable class the 11th
                        verse of the 17th chapter of the prophet Jeremiah, which reads as follows:</p>
                    <p>"As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not, so he that getteth
                        riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the
                        midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool." </p>
