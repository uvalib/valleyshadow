<b>A Plan Of Financial Relief-Letter From A. H. H. Stuart</b><br> (Column 5, 6, 7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Alexander Stuart reflects on the problems of the Confederate economy, in
                    particular the devaluation of the currency and the inflation of prices. He sees
                    the primary obstacle in dealing with the economic crisis being the inability to
                    coordinate the policies of all the states of the Confederacy. In order to aid
                    the economy, Stuart advocates a national program that will include the following
                    steps: 1. stop issuing new treasury notes; 2. retire one-half to two-thirds of
                    the present issue; 3. enact a specific export duty on all the productions of
                    field and forest to pay the interest and principal of the debt; 4. obtain funds
                    through the sale of bonds, not by the issue of treasury notes.<br>

<b>War News</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses the state of various theaters of conflict. In Tennessee, it
                    appears the Union forces are on the move, and a large battle is expected in
                    Lookout Valley. In Virginia, a number of smaller engagements have taken place

<b>Grain Distilled</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Clarifying an earlier editorial, the Spectator reports that a local
                    distillery is actually consuming thirty bushels of grain a day, rather than the
                    one hundred bushels reported.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>The Legislature--Good Bills</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>While an earlier article argued that the previous legislative session
                    hadn't passed any bills of importance, this article asserts that in fact three
                    worthwhile bills were passed. These include measures to provide for the support
                    of the indigent families of servicemen; the outlawing of gambling; and a measure
                    to prohibit the production of spirituous and malt liquors. The bulk of the
                    article is a defense of the last measure against charges that it represents an
                    unconstitutional measure violating the prohibition against any law "impairing
                    the obligation of contracts."<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The statement we made last week that the Legislature had not passed any bill
                        of general importance save the repeal of a law of the previous session in
                        reference to the currency, did not do full justice to that body of Solons,
                        for they did pass three very good bills besides the one to which reference
                        was made, to wit: The bill against gambling; the bill for the support of the
                        indigent families of those in the military and naval service, and the bill
                        prohibiting the consumption of grain by distillers and other manufacturers
                        of spirituous and malt liquors. The following is an extract from the last
                        bill mentioned:</p>
                    <p>"It shall not be lawful for any person hereafter to make, or cause to be
                        made, any Whiskey, or other Spirituous or Malt Liquors, out of any Corn,
                        Wheat, Rye, or other grain, or out of dried Fruit, Potatoes, Sugar, Cane,
                        Molasses Cane, or Sorghum; and any person so offending shall be deemed
                        guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined for
                        every offence not less than one hundred dollars, nor more than five thousand
                        dollars, and be subject to imprisonment in the county jail, not exceeding
                        twelve months at the discretion of the court.</p>
                    <p>No person, firm or company shall execute, in whole or in part, any contract
                        heretofore or hereafter made with the Confederate Government, or with any
                        agent of said Government, for making, or causing to be made, any Whiskey or
                        ardent spirits within this State; and all such contractors who shall violate
                        this section shall be deemed subject to all the penalties imposed by this
                        and other acts against unlawful distillation."</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that persons are not only prohibited hereafter to make, or cause to be made, any whiskey, or other
                        spirituous and malt liquors, out of any corn, wheat, rye or other grain, or
                        out of dried fruit, potatoes, sugar, molasses, sugar cane, molasses cane or
                        sorghum, but that they are prohibited to execute,
                        in whole or in part, any contract heretofore, or
                        hereafter, made with the Confederate Government, or with any agent of said
                        Government, for making, or causing to be made, any whiskey or other ardent
                        spirits within this State; and any person so offending shall be fined, for
                        every offence, not less than $100, nor more than $5000, and be subject to
                        imprisonment in the county jail, not exceeding twelve months, at the
                        discretion of the court. </p>
                    <p>Some persons erroneously suppose that this law violates that provision of the
                        constitution which prohibits the enactment of any law "impairing the
                        obligation of contracts." This law does not impair the "obligation of
                        contracts," but merely prohibits the execution of
                        certain contracts within this State. The validity of the contracts is not
                        destroyed, but the execution of them, in this State, is prohibited. The
                        contractors may execute them in another State.--This law does not relieve
                        either of the contracting parties from any obligations imposed by their
                        contracts. The Legislature is competent to pass such a law, or else this
                        State has no power to protect itself. The Confederate Government might else
                        have all the grain of the State distilled into whiskey, and the citizens of
                        the State be left to starve. </p>

                    <p>For the past three days the Confederate States District Court, Judge
                        Halyburton presiding, has been engaged in the examination of ten men, from
                        Rockingham county, charged with aiding and abetting and piloting deserters
                        from the Confederate army to the Yankee lines.--These men, known
                        respectively as Geo. Yates, Samuel Wheelbarger, George Cooper, David Cooper,
                        (father and son) George W. Ramsey, George Hume, Samuel Boman, William
                        Coffman, John D. Keiser and Rev. Wm. Dunlap, have long been suspected, but
                        have hitherto managed to elude the vigilance of the authorities.</p>
                    <p>At the commencement of the investigation a message was received from the
                        Secretary of War, stating that the parties were subject and ought to be
                        tried by military authority.</p>
                    <p>To this the counsel for the prisoners objected, alleging that they were
                        citizens, and were, therefore, subject to only jury trial.</p>
                    <p>The evidence elicited, showed that the prisoners had been guilty of harboring
                        Confederate deserters, and that they had used language that showed their
                        antagonism to the Southern Confederacy and in favor of the Yankee
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The Judge, yesterday, after hearing the evidence in the case, decided that
                        the offence was not committed within his district, and consequently
                        discharged the prisoners.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner Watson then had them arrested, and they will be sent to Staunton
                        for trial. <br>--Enquirer</p>
