                    rise and eventually bring about Lincoln's downfall.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For the first time since the signal of war was given by the booming of cannon
                        at Fort Sumter, we discern some gleams of hope that there is a prospect for
                        a termination of hostilities. Though Lincoln's army is greater now than at
                        any former time, yet there are signs which indicate very plainly that his
                        prospects for conquering the South were never so gloomy as at present. In
                        various parts of the North, palpable signs of a coming storm, which will
                        soon beat in all its fury upon the Lincoln Administration, have recently
                        manifested themselves. The "pitiless storm" which beat upon the devoted head
                        of King Lear was as a balmy and gentle zephyr from spice Islands, compared
                        with that resistless storm of popular wrath which will soon beat with fury
                        upon the head of the fiendish madman who is recklessly running the "machine"
                        of the United States Government, and crushing beneath its wheels the
                        liberties of his own people. Though he has an army of one million of men,
                        yet he is quaking with fear and his knees are knocking together, like
                        Belshazzar's at the feast, and for a similar reason, for he sees the
                        handwriting upon the wall which denotes that he has been weighed in the
                        balances and found wanting. He needs no Daniel to interpret--the characters
                        are legible, and he becomes the interpreter of his own doom. He feels that
                        he wields a barren sceptre; that his efforts have been vain; that he is
                        disgraced in the eyes of the whole world; that he has gained nothing save an
                        immortality of infamy; that he has destroyed the temple of Liberty, and
                        acquired a more infamous fame than Erostratus for the destruction of the
                        temple of Diana of the Ephesians; he feels that he cannot "escape history"
                        which will present him in his true character as a monstrum horrendum, the slayer of Liberty, and enemy of the
                        human race. Those whose mouths he would muzzle, if he were not afraid of
                        arousing the sleeping wrath of his own people, are now speaking out in bold
                        terms their condemnation of his policy. They are now holding him up to the
                        derision and indignation of the people. They have placed him on the pillory
                        of public scorn, where he remains the object of jeers and taunts--he is
                        wounded to the quick, but dare not raise his hand to stay the scorpion lash
                        of his pitiless criticisers. </p>
                    <p>In New Jersey, in New York, in Illinois, in Indiana, and even in Ohio, the
                        people are beginning to speak as freemen in condemnation of the wickedness
                        and crime of the war which the Lincoln Administration is waging upon the
                        South. They are beginning to appreciate the fact that the South cannot be
                        conquered, and that the continuance of the war will only have the effect of
                        destroying all hope of liberty at the North. They now see that, whilst
                        Lincoln is professing to emancipate the slaves of the South, he is making
                        slaves of the freemen of the North. He cannot raise another army, and his
                        present one cannot effect the purpose for which he summoned it to the field.
                        Volunteering in the North is now dead, and the Western States will not
                        submit to another draft. By next June, fifty regiments of the two years'
                        volunteers, his best soldiers, will march back home, as their term will
                        expire at that time. The Western States now see that it has been converted,
                        on the part of the Administration, into a war for abolition, and not for the
                        preservation of the Union as it was, and as they desire it to remain.
                        Lincoln has built his house upon the sand, and the and the [sic] storm now
                        rising will soon sweep it away, and the rainbow of peace will braid the brow
                        of the storm cloud.</p>

                    <p>The passage in the President's Message in which it is stated that Yankee
                            officers hereafter captured will be turned
                        over to the Executives of the different States to be dealt with according to
                        the laws thereof, is not the least important in that document. It will
                        create a lively sensation in the Yankee army. According to the laws of every
                        Southern State, the penalty for inciting insurrection is death by hanging; and there is no law on the Statute book which
                        will be more promptly and diligently executed. Governors and people will all
                        concur and co-operate in this. The Yankees, therefore, have fair notice of
                        the fate that awaits them. If they come upon our soil and are taken, the
                            officers know their doom. They will be
                        certainly hanged. </p>

<b>Lincoln and Milroy</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Gov. Letcher's response to the proclamations of Lincoln and Milroy
                    denouncing emancipation.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Monday last, Governor Letcher sent a communication to the General Assembly
                        relative to the Emancipation Proclamation of Abraham Lincoln, and the more
                        recent Proclamation of R.H. Milroy, Brigadier General commanding at
                        Winchester, dated 5th instant. The Governor, after stating that he had
                        transmitted a copy of the latter to the two Houses "for such action as may
                        be deemed appropriate," proceed as follows:</p>
                    <p>Abraham Lincoln, in violation of all the principles of humanity and of the
                        nobler and more generous impulses of our nature, in disregard of all social,
                        moral and political obligations which should influence a just and wise
                        ruler, and in utter destitution of all those virtues which should adorn a
                        husband, a father and a citizen, and in wanton heedlessness of the peace,
                        the happiness, and even the lives of thousands of innocent and unoffending
                        women and children, has issued a proclamation bearing the date January 1st,
                        instant, from which I take this paragraph:</p>
                    <p>[The paragraph quoted is that declaring the negroes free and ordaining that
                        the military and naval authorities shall maintain them in any effort they
                        may make for their active freedom.]</p>
                    <p>No public man in our country has exhibited such depravity; no statesman has
                        shown such an abandonment of moral principle; no American citizen, save John
                        Brown, has displayed so atrocious a spirit as is manifested in this
                        proposition. This unscrupulous man, feeling that he cannot cope with the
                        Southern Army in fair battle, aided with all the advantages that he has
                        possessed in numbers, in improved arms, in supplies and munitions of war of
                        all kinds, smarting under the munitions of war of all kinds, smarting under
                        the numerous reverses and defeats that his army has suffered in a moment of
                        desperation, seeks to excite servile insurrection and deluge Southern soil
                        in blood.</p>
                    <p>The Governor comments further upon the atrocious proclamation, exposing the
                        hypocrisy and malignity of its promulgator.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the proclamation of Milroy, the Governor says:</p>
                    <p>The proclamation of Milroy is a natural sequel to the proclamation of
                        Lincoln, and is characterised by the same ferocious and malignant spirit. He
                        is, in all respects, a suitable tool for the execution of so execrable a
                        work. He follows the lead of his master, and therefore promises to maintain
                        the freedom of the slave--urges a ready compliance with the proclamation of
                        Lincoln, and admonishes our people that in case they manifest a disposition
                        to resist its enforcement, "they will be regarded as rebels, in arms against
                        the lawful authority of the Federal Government, and dealt with accordingly."
                        The officers are ordered to act in accordance with said proclamation, and
                        "to yield their ready co-operation in its enforcement."</p>
                    <p>This action on the part of Milroy violates, in the most positive manner, the
                        provisions of our Act of Assembly which declares, "if a free person advise
                        or conspire with a slave to rebel or make insurrection, or with any person,
                        to induce slaves to rebel or raise insurrection, he shall be punished with
                        death, whether such insurrection or rebellion be made or not."</p>
                    <p>The Governor next refers to the execution of John Brown and his guilty
                        associates for the violation of this act of the General Assembly, and says
                        that "the only difference between Brown and Lincoln consists in this: the
                        former had a corporal's guard of followers to aid him; the latter comes
                        backed with his thousands of hirelings. Their objects are the same and both
                        are alike guilty of attempting to excite a servile insurrection, etc." The
                        Governor quotes the statute prescribing the penalty for stealing and
                        carrying away slaves.</p>
                    <p>The Governor quotes from the recent "able and excellent message" of the
                        President his allusions to Lincoln's proclamation, and the announcement of
                        his purpose "to deliver to the several State authorities all commissioned
                        officers of the United States that may be hereafter captured," &amp;c.
                        The Governor closes as follows:</p>
                    <p>If these prisoners are turned over to the State for trial, as the President
                        suggests, it will be necessary to amend our laws in regard to trials, so
                        that any Circuit Court in the Commonwealth shall be invested with power to
                        hear and determine all cases that may be brought before it--This suggestion
                        of the President accords with my own views, and believing it to be right, I
                        appeal to you to adopt such legislation as will ensure a fair and speedy
                        trial.</p>
                    <p>I trust the General Assembly will, at an early day, give expression to their
                        views on the subject I have presented for their consideration in this
                        communication.</p>
