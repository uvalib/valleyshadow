<b>From Gen. Lee's Army</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Continuing account of the battle of Gettysburg.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The despatches which have been sent from Martinsburg in reference to military
                        operations in Pennsylvania have been so very contradictory and unreliable
                        that it has been impossible to form any satisfactory idea of what has really
                        been done. We had intended to publish them, but found them so unreliable,
                        and some of them so palpably false--reporting battles when none were
                        fought--that we determined not to occupy space with them. The Richmond
                        Dispatch learns from an officer of Wright's brigade, who left Gettysburg on
                        Saturday, the 4th, that in the fight of Wednesday and Thursday we whipped
                        the enemy badly. On Friday the fight again commenced, being chiefly done by
                        our centre, which was composed of Longstreet's corps and two divisions of A.
                        P. Hill's corps. Neither the right nor left wing was seriously engaged. We
                        drove the enemy back five miles to the heights, which he had fortified. In
                        driving them this five miles we broke through two of their lines of battle
                        formed to receive the onset of our troops, and finally charged them to the
                        heights. Here our men were ordered to charge the heights, and the order
                        being executed, resulted in our repulse.</p>
                    <p>On Friday night our wagon trains were ordered to fall back, and commenced
                        going to the rear. It is supposed that our army fell back from want of
                        provisions. There was no scarcity of ammunition, for there were many trains
                        or ordnance out of which not a single cartridge or shell had been taken.
                        Some of them were attacked by the enemy, but Imboden's cavalry successfully
                        drove them off. Those of our men who were slightly wounded and could walk
                        were sent off Saturday about noon. Those who were severely wounded were left
                        in the hospitals near the battle field. In the fights of Wednesday,
                        Thursday, and Friday, General Lee took about 10,000 prisoners, who were
                        promptly sent to the rear. During the same time we lost about 4,000
                        prisoners and about 11,000 killed and wounded--making our loss 15,000 in
                        all. The battle was the most furious that has taken place in this country,
                        and the losses of the enemy in killed and wounded must exceed ours. In the
                        charge in which we drove the enemy five miles, their loss, while flying
                        before our troops, was enormous. Wright's brigade suffered severely. One of
                        the regiments which went into action with a Colonel, Lieut. Colonel, and
                        five or six Captains, came out in charge of a Second Lieutenant, the ranking
                        officers having been either killed or wounded.</p>
                    <p>After the battle of Friday, Gen. Lee withdrew his army to Hagerstown, Md.,
                        about thirty miles Southwest of Gettysburg, where the battles were
                        fought.--A telegram to the Richmond Enquirer of Friday last states that
                        there had been a severe fight at Boonsboro, Md., on Wednesday, the 8th, in
                        which we had repulsed the enemy after a fight of three hours. Boonsboro is
                        situated about 15 miles, a little East of South, from Hagerstown. From what
                        we have been enabled to learn--and that is precious little--we suppose that
                        General Lee's army has taken a position not far from Hagerstown, and is
                        there awaiting the approach of the enemy, in anticipation of another
                        terrible struggle.</p>

<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"We publish in this issue the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry in the
                    case of Col. A. W. Harman. From these proceedings it will be seen that the
                    silver ware therein spoken of was captured by J. C. Hogan, who took it to Col.
                    Harman and told him he designed it as a present for Mrs. Harman, and that Col.
                    Harman had it sent to his home. When it arrived at his home, it was shown by his
                    wife to Mr. W. H. Lynn, a relative of the family, and Editor of the "Vindicator." In the next issue of his paper, he made
                    the following statement concerning it:"<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"We saw a beautiful silver set which was captured and
                            sent as a present to Mrs. Col. A. W. Harman." </p>
                    <p>Being surprised at the announcement, in the next issue of the "Spectator," we quoted the statement of the "Vindicator" and noticed it in the following
                        language: </p>
                    <p>"We acknowledge that the above announcement contained in
                            the Vindicator of last week surprised us. We had supposed that
                            everything captured by soldiers in the Confederate service became the
                            property of the Confederate States. Have we been mistaken in this
                            supposition?" </p>
                    <p>And by way of illustrating his purpose to do so in a forcible and striking manner, he assaulted us on the 21st of May
                        for the offence of suggesting that that was the proper
                            course to pursue.--At that time he did not deny the truth of the
                        statement of the Vindicator, but denominated it a "youthful indiscretion."
                        His feelings of friendship for his relative may have induced him to withhold
                        the denial, and rather suffer himself the reproach of appropriating public
                        property to private use, than to place the stigma of falsehood upon the
                        character of his relative; for it follows necessarily that, if the statement of the Vindicator were true, Col.
                        Harman was guilty of sending, as a present to his wife, property which
                        belonged to the Confederate States. </p>
                    <p>Before the Court of Inquiry, however, he was not so regardful of the
                        reputation of his friend, the Editor of the Vindicator has perpetrated a most outrageous slander against his
                        friend and relative. He falls, too, under the denunciation of the Court of
                        Inquiry, which declares "that the imputations cast upon Col. Harman's
                        character as a gentleman and a soldier are without
                            foundation." It is for the Editor of the Vindicator to show how he was justified in making the statement
                        he did. </p>
                    <p>If the finding of the Court be correct, then the
                        Editor of the Vindicatorstands guilty of making a
                        false and slanderous statement. </p>
                    <p>In reference to another statement of the Editor of the Vindicator, Col.
                        Harman, before the Court of Inquiry, was equally unmindful of the reputation
                        of his relative. In an attempted defense of the conduct of Col. Harman, the
                        Editor of the Vindicator, in his issue of May 29th, denied that Col. Harman had sent the
                        silver ware to his home. In that paper he said: </p>
                    <p>"We did not say that Col. H. captured or sent it,
                            both of which would have been untrue." </p>
                    <p>Col. Harman, before the Court, said:</p>
                    <p>"I told my servant to take it to my house." </p>
                    <p>For the honor of the Confederacy we would like to see Col. Harman exculpated
                        from the charge contained in the statement of the Vindicator, for we would
                        not like to have any Confederate officer guilty of an offence which would be
                        a reproach to our Confederate soldiery; and, on the other hand, we would
                        like, for the honor of the Editorial fraternity, the Editor of the
                        Vindicator to be able to exculpate himself from the charge of having uttered
                        a slanderous falsehood against an officer of the Confederate service. The
                        Court of Inquiry has endeavored to protect the honor of the Confederacy, it
                        remains to be seen whether the Editor of the Vindicator will exhibit equal
                        concern for the honor of the Editorial fraternity.</p>
                    <p>Will he, either as a man or editor, rest contented under the brand of
                        falsehood which Col. Harman has placed upon him? Nous
                            verrons.</p>
