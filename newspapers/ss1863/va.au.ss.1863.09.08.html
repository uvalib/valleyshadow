<b>Letter From Mr. Rives</b><br> (Column 5-7)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Provides an encouraging appraisal of the state of the war and draws on
                    historical precedent to forecast a successful conclusion of the current
                    hostilities. Especially interesting is the summary of the various advantages
                    possessed by the Northern forces at the outset of the war.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"We are permitted to make public the following letter from Mr. Rives to
                    a well known gentleman of Lynchburg. It is as encouraging in its opinions and
                    its historical citations, as it is elegant in style and noble and patriotic in
                    sentiment. Its appearance, too, is fortunately timed, and it cannot be without
                    the happiest effect on the public mind. It would be well if a copy of it should
                    fall under the eye of every citizen of the Confederate States, and we are sure
                    that our contemporaries of the Press will gladly aid in giving it the widest
                    circulation:"<br>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Continuing the themes raised in Mr. Rives's letter, this article focuses on

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on the dismal state of African-Americans behind the Union lines in
                    the western theatre of the war. The article seeks to document a lack of concern

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>I regret to hear from trustworthy sources, that the contrabands in the
                        Western part of the State within our lines, and especially those further
                        down on the Mississippi, are suffering much from want of proper food,
                        medicine and sanitary arrangements. The enlisted negroes are doing very
                        well, but the negro camps of refugees--women, old men and children--are in a
                        sad condition; disease and disorder prevailing, and the poor creatures dying
                        by the hundreds. No one seems to have any supervision over or concern for
                        them.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Describes a series of military encounters that took place in Pendleton,
                    Highland and Pocahontas counties in West Virginia. The article details the
                    extraordinary efforts of the Confederate forces under the command of Col. Patton
                    against a numerically superior force under the command of Gen. Averill. It also

                    attempts to recapture the boats led to a spirited exchange of artillery, but the
                    efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.<br>

                    the faces of the poor" in pursuit of profits. The article recommends the
                    enactment of a tax on the wealthy that will provide for the maintenance of the
                    poor in their midst. There is an additional post script that announces that the

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In these times of high prices, speculation and extortion, the condition of
                        the poor is pitiable in the extreme. We have unfortunately in our midst, as
                        in all other communities, those heartless wretches who, to make money in
                        haste, hesitate not to "grind the faces of the poor." Those who have nothing
                        to sell and everything to buy are at the mercy of those who have the
                        articles they need, whether they be provisions for clothing or fuel. The
                        merchants and farmers can retaliate upon each other, but those who have
                        nothing to sell are between the upper an nether millstone. Something should
                        be done for the relief of this unfortunate class. There are many in it who,
                        this winter, will be unable to supply themselves with the necessaries of
                        life. We should not rely upon voluntary contributions, because they impose
                        all the burden upon the kind and generous, whilst the close-fisted, though
                        they may be much more able to give, do nothing for the relief of the
                        poor.--The best way to equalize the burden is to impose a tax for the
                        special purpose of relieving the wants of the needy, and to tax each in
                        proportion to his means.</p>
                    <p>P. S.--Since the above was written, the Town Council, we are pleased to see,
                        has taken such action as is recommended in the above. See ordinance
                        published in our advertising columns.</p>

<b>Lincoln</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discusses a letter written by Abraham Lincoln that asserts that there are
                    only three ways to secure peace: by force of arms; by giving up the union; and
                    by compromise. The letter goes on to rule out the latter means, since "no
                    propositions of compromise have been made by the Confederate authorities."<br>

<b>Home Defense</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Announces the organization of companies for home defense at Fisherville,

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Complains of poor service at Post Offices and attributes the problem to
                    "too many keepers to be well kept." This bloated workforce not only reduces the
                    number of men available for military service, but also increases the possibility
                    of mismanagement.<br>
