<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The cruelty, faithlessness and mendacity of the Abolition armies ravaging our
                        country have been so conspicuous that it is but natural that an intense
                        spirit of resentment should have seized upon our people. Hence we find many
                        who are eager to raise the black flag, and show no quarter to the vandals
                        who are spreading desolation and woe wherever they penetrate our borders.
                        That they deserve such a doom, in the eye of
                        heaven and of enlightened civilization, there is no question; but there are
                        considerations of policy which should be taken into account, and which
                        should oftimes [sic] control our actions against the dictates of passion or
                        even of abstract principles of justice. The black flag is the insignia of a
                        desperate thirst for revenge which we have every reason to feel, but whose
                        vindication is a divine prerogative. "Vengeance is mine--I will repay, saith
                        the Lord." </p>
                    <p>But aside from these high moral considerations there is abundant argument
                        against raising the black flag, to be found in mere considerations of
                        policy.</p>
                    <p>The enemy occupies our soil. He has driven from their homes thousands of our
                        people, whose household altars he now desecrates, and thousands more within
                        his lines are subject to the exercise of his powers of control. If we raise
                        the black flag we know enough of the perfidy of the enemy to be assured that
                        the innocent will alone for the revenge we wreak upon the guilty heads of
                        the invader. Innocence and virtue--so lightly regarded now, and so insecure
                        within the reach of the tainted breath of the lustful and malignant
                        foe--would then be their readiest objects of revenge, and to the cry of
                        desolation which now goes up from our blackened plains will be added the
                        shrieks of outraged virtue, and the wild wall of the helpless and broken
                        hearted.</p>
                    <p>If we raise the black flag, we can only wreak the vengeance, of which it is
                        the symbol, upon such of the desperate and heartless arms bearing aggressors
                        as may fall into our power through the prowess of our arms, while the enemy
                        may exercise it upon the whole population of the districts which he
                        occupies. Decrepit age, female purity, and helpless infancy--would all be
                        subject to his unbridled powers of outrage and torture. Therefore in raising
                        the black flag, we not only expose ourselves to the exercise of the same
                        desperate and unchristian retaliation, but we subject to its untold horrors
                        thousands of non-combatants, who, infamously as they are wronged, are
                        comparatively secure against the unbridled lust and rapacity of an avowed
                        war of extermination.</p>
                    <p>Let us temper our thirst for vengeance with discretion, which is the better
                        part of diplomacy as well as valor; and if we fail to secure the practical
                        recognition of a system of civilized warfare, we may maintain for our
                        struggling nation a character for manliness and forbearance which will shine
                        in the records of chivalry, and be an enduring source of pride and honor to
                        our children.</p>

<b>Home Defense</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Calls for the mobilization of a home defense.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The conviction seems to be universal that our people must adopt without delay
                        some practical organization for Home Defence [sic]. The Yankees have adopted
                        as a part of their settled policy a system of cavalry raids for the mere
                        purpose of plunder and devastation.--They hope in this way to further their
                        benevolent purpose of starving us into submission, and they may therefore be
                        expected to make these inroads into the principal agricultural districts.</p>
                    <p>The President has urged upon the States and the people the importance of an
                        organized Home Guard. The Governor is calling out the militia, and the
                        various counties are adopting plans of voluntary association--all having the
                        same object in view.</p>
                    <p>We are glad to see this general movement in progress, and we hope that out of
                        it all will grow some well digested plan by which our people can be enabled
                        to present an organized opposition to these predatory bands who threaten so
                        much mischief.</p>
                    <p>For our defence against invasion by large armies we must of course depend
                        upon our great Captain--but against these wandering, plundering, murdering
                        bands of scoundrels we must prepare to defend ourselves.</p>
                    <p>We hope our magistrates and our people will not fail to attend the meeting at
                        the June court on Monday next.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As we have previously mentioned on several occasions during the last three or
                        four months the subscription list of the Spectator continues to increase, and recently the rate of increase has greatly augmented. Though we make
                        but little, if anything, on the subscriptions, owing to the greatly
                        increased cost of publication, yet, it [illegible] gratifying to us is the
                        fact that a large proportion of those who have recently subscribed formerly
                        belonged to what has been called the Democratic party. This is gratifying
                        because it shows that we are right in the position we maintain that the
                        great mass of that party are freemen, who are willing to sacrifice party
                        spirit [illegible] the altar of patriotism; and because it shows,
                        furthermore, that we have not been altogether unsuccessful in our purpose to
                        conduct the Spectator in a spirit high above mere
                        party considerations. Since the tocsin of war was sounded, we have known but
                        two parties, the friend and enemies of the South--we have not recognized the
                        old party distinctions of Whig and Democrat. </p>
                    <p>The following is an extract from a letter under date of June the 10th, sent
                        from the adjoining county of Rockbridge.</p>
                    <p>"We do not how to express our appreciation of your late course as a public
                        journalist better than by sending you a batch of Democratic subscribers to
                        the Spectator. Enclosed find $24.-- Send the
                        Spectator to the following persons for one year." Then follow the names. We
                        do not often speak of new subscribers, though there is scarcely a day but
                        some are added to the list, but we thought our readers would pardon us for
                        noticing the reception of eight Democratic
                        subscribers in one letter. </p>
                    <p>As these are Rockbridge Democrats, fellow-countymen of Gov. Letcher, we think
                        it probable that they have adopted this mode of manifesting their heartfelt
                        gratitude to us for securing to Gov. Letcher the 162 votes which he received
                        in this county. Whether it was for the service we rendered his Excellency,
                        or for the service we have rendered any other Democratic office-holder,
                        military or civil, in our "late course as a
                        public journalist," we fully reciprocate their kindness, and approve their 'late course' as heartily as they do ours,
                        and would, most respectfully commend their good example to others. These
                        eight Democrats have "acted their part well," and we would enjoin others to
                        "go and do likewise." </p>

                    <p>As a refugee I desire to acknowledge the kindness and liberality manifested
                        by your citizens generally, and the proprietors of the Virginia Hotel
                        particularly towards these whom the sad referees of war have thrown upon
                        their hospitality. To those who have recently left homes of plenty, the
                        Hotel rates must appear extravagant, but a short tour through the South will
                        satisfy all that the rates of the Virginia Hotel are no higher than those of
                        other hotels. In every case, the Messrs. Peytons have deducted largely from
                        the regular charges. In one instance, as much as one-half the usual fare was
                        contributed to the relief of a refugee. They have certainly given not less
                        than eight hundred or a thousand dollars to refugees and poor soldiers,
                        since my arrival in Augusta county. There are other ministering spirits,
                        whom delicacy forbid to mention, whose smiles and words and deeds of charity
                        have embalmed their memories imperishable in the hearts of many a weary
                        wanderer from home. I say this much in gratitude to those whose magnanimity
                        would disdain the offer of any public tribute to their generosity.</p>
                    <p>A REFUGEE.</p>
