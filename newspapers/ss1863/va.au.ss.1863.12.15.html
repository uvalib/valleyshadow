<b>For the Spectator</b><br> (Column 6)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Remarking on a recent lecture by Dr. O. R. Harris at Churchville, "An Old
                    Man Of the Neighborhood" commended the Doctor for his keen understanding of the
                    issues facing the nation. After reminding the congregation of the parallels
                    between the current situation and that facing our colonial forbearers, the
                    Doctor urged the public to remain of good cheer. He also discussed the current
                    financial problems and the current policy of the government on substitutes.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Fromt he rumors of the last few days, it would seem that the enemy are making
                        a simultaneous movement in all parts of Western Virginia. They came from
                        Kanawha, and on Saturday last had a fight with Gen. Echols' command, it is
                        reported, at Greenbrier Bridge, three miles East of Lewisburg. Gen. Echols
                        retreated into Monroe County. At the same time a force was threatening Col.
                        Jackson's command in Pocahontas.--He has fallen back, it is reported--to
                        what point we do not know. The enemy also appeared in strong force in the
                        lower part of the Valley. They, we understand, have gone back. At the same
                        time a force under the command of Gen. Averill moved up the South Branch
                        Valley from Hardy County. Supposing it was his object to reach this place
                        Gen. Imboden moved his force from Rockingham County to the Shenandoah
                        Mountain West of this place. As soon as he apprised the authorities here of
                        the movement of the enemy, the regiment of "Augusta Raid Guards" were
                        summoned, [in the absence of Col. Baldwin,] by Lieut. Col. Harper
                        commanding.--They responded very promptly notwithstanding the inclemency of
                        the weather and marched to the expected scene of conflict.</p>
                    <p>We think it probable that this movement of the enemy in Western Virginia and
                        in the lower part of the Valley is designed to conceal the transfer of
                        troops from the army of Grant to that of Meade.</p>
                    <p>They desire to keep our troops so far away from the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
                        Road as to make it impossible for them to do any damage to that road, and
                        also to prevent them from knowing, if possible, that troops are passing over
                        that route from Grant to Meade. Another object may be to concentrate the
                        forces of Western Virginia, that they may push on to the Virginia and
                        Tennessee Rail Road with the view of cutting off communications with
                        Longstreet and throwing a column in his rear. If either or both of these
                        objects be contemplated by the enemy, the probability is that they will not
                        desire or attempt to get to this place.</p>
                    <p>If assured that the enemy were trying to reach this place, we would desire to
                        have the gallant and noble soldiers of the Stonewall Brigade within call,
                        for we know that they would take delight in driving the invading foe from
                        the soil of Augusta. How the hearts of our people would leap with joy, if
                        they could greet the arrival of this famous brigade! That Brigade,
                        individually as well as collectively, is dear to the hearts of our people.
                        If the enemy should come, may the Stonewall Brigade be here to see. This is
                        the aspiration of the hearts of all our people.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"The report of the Secretary of War is too long for us to publish it in
                    full. We give a synopsis of his recommendations:"<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Secretary refers to the operations of the army in its several
                        departments, and says that the campaign in Mississippi was certainly
                        disastrous. It is difficult to resist the impression that its disasters were
                        not inevitable. That a Court of Enquiry, to investigate the whole campaign,
                        met in Atlanta in September, but in consequence of the vicinity of the enemy
                        requiring the presence of witnesses and judges at other points, it has been
                        temporarily suspended. It is expected soon to reassemble. A deficiency of
                        resources in men and provisions, rather than reverses in battle, caused the
                        withdrawal of the army to Middle Tennessee. He alludes to desertion,
                        straggling &amp; [illegible] is but little over half or two-thirds of
                        the men whose names are on the muster rolls. He recommends the repeal of the
                        substitute and exemption provisions, and that the privileges which Congress
                        granted to put in substitutes can be regularly and constitutionally
                        abrogated by the same power. He says that no compact was entered into
                        between the Government and the person furnishing a substitute, as has been
                        alleged, but only a privelege [sic] which Government accorded. Instead of
                        complaining of such abrogation, the person ought to feel gratified at what
                        has heretofore been allowed him. He recommends an abridgment of exemptions
                        and the conscription of them all, making details according to the wants of
                        society, at home.--He says that the three years' men, when their terms
                        expire, cannot be finally discharged, and should be retained, allowing them
                        to choose the existing company under its present organization, in the same
                        arm of the service. He recommends the consolidation of such companies and
                        regiments as are reduced below a certain complement. He pays a glowing
                        tribute to the heroism, endurance and unfaltering devotion of the soldiers,
                        and of the lamented dead who yielded their lives as sacrifices upon the
                        altar of Liberty, and closes by saying that our very reverses, showing a
                        united and determined endurance of everything for independence, must
                        convince the enemy of the futility of his efforts to subdue us.</p>

                    <p>The President rapidly reviews the events of the past year, remarking that

                        checked the enemy everywhere in his advance. Our relations with foreign
                        nations are discussed at considerable length. The President regrets that
                        there has been no improvement since the message of January last, and that
                        the conduct of the European nations is less impartial and in some cases has
                        assumed a character positively unfriendly to the commissioners which were
                        sent abroad for the purpose of entering into negotiations proper to fix the
                        relative rights and obligations of the Confederate and United States under
                        treaties entered into with foreign nations prior to the separation which has
                        taken place; but this tender on our part was declined--hence, as we have
                        been refused the benefit of these treaties, they certainly have ceased to be
                        binding and in the opinion of the President our relations with European
                        nations are now controlled exclusively by the general rules of the law of

                        the President contends that whilst the provisions of the permanent
                        constitution in reference to direct taxation can not be carried into effect
                        in the mode pointed out, it is plain that it is the duty of congress to
                        execute the general intent of the Constitution by making taxes uniform
                        throughout the Confederate States. These considerations are greatly enforced
                        by the reflection that an attempt to apportion taxes amongst the States,
                        some of which are wholly or partially in the occupation of hostile forces,
                        would subvert the whole intention of the framers of the Constitution, and he
                        productive of the most revolting injustice instead of that just co-relation
                        between taxation and representation which their purpose secured. With large
                        portions of some of the States ocupied [sic] by the enemy, what justice
                        would there be in imposing on the remainder the whole amount of taxation of
                        the entire State in proportion to is representation?</p>
                    <p>What else would this be in effect than to increase the burthen [sic] of these
                        who are the heaviest sufferers by the war, and make our own inability to
                        protect them from invasion, as we are required to do by the Constitution,
                        ground for adding to their losses by an attempted adherance[sic] to the
                        letter in violation of the spirit of that instrument. No such purpose could
                        have been entertained and no such result contemplated by the framers of the
                        Constitution. It may add to the of weight these considerations if we reflect
                        that although the Constitution provides that it should go into operation
                        with a representation temporarily distributed among the States, if expressly
                        ordains that after providing for a census within three years this temporary
                        distribution of representative power is to endure until such enumeration
                        shall be made. Would any one argue that because the census cannot be made
                        within the fixed period the Government must at the expiration of that period
                        perish for want of a representative body? In any aspect in which the subject
                        can be viewed I am led to the conclusion already announced, and which is
                        understood to be in accordance with a vote taken in one or both houses at
                        last session. I shall therefore until we are able to pursue the precise mode
                        required by the Constitutional deem it my duty to approve any law levying
                        taxation which you are bound to impose for the defence of the country, in
                        any other practicable mode which shall distribute the burthen uniformly and
                        impartially on the whole property of the people.</p>
                    <p>In your former legislations you have sought to avoid an increase of the
                        volume of notes in circulation by offering inducements for voluntarily
                        funding. Measures adopted for that purpose were not partially successful,
                        the amount [illegible] no other remedy than compulsory reduction of currency
                        to the amount required by the business of the country.</p>
                    <p>This reduction should be accompanied by a pledge that under no stress of
                        circumstances will that amount be exceeded. No possible mode of using the
                        credit of the government can be so disastrous [sic] as on which disturbs the
                        basis of exchange, renders impossible all calculations of the future values,
                        augments in constantly increasing proportions the price of all commodities,
                        and so depreciates all fixed wages, salaries and incomes as to render them
                        inadequate to bare subsistence. If to this be added the still more fatal
                        influence on the morals and character of the people, to which I have already
                        adverted, I am persuaded, you will concur in the conclusion that an
                        inflexible adherence to a limitation of the currency at a fixed sum is an
                        indispensable element of any system of finance now to be adopted. Holders of
                        currency now outstanding can only be protected in the recovery of their just
                        claims by substituting for notes some other security.</p>
                    <p>If the currency is not greatly and promptly reduced the present scale of
                        inflated prices will not only continue to exist, but by the very fact of
                        large amounts thus made requisite in the conduct of the war, those prices
                        will reach rates still more extravagant and the whole system will fall under
                        its own weight, rendering the redemption of debts impossible and destroying
                        its whole value in the hands of the holder. If, on the contrary, a founded
                        debt, with interest secured by adequate taxation, is substituted for the
                        out-standing currency, its entire amount will be available to the holder and
                        Government will be in a condition enabling it beyond the reach of any
                        probable contingency to prosecute the war to a successful issue.</p>
                    <p>It is, therefore, demanded as well by the interest of the creditor as of the
                        country at large that the evidences of public debt now out-standing in the
                        shape of treasury notes be converted into bonds bearing adequate interest
                        with provision for taxation sufficient to insure the punctual payment and
                        final redemption of the whole debt.</p>
                    <p>The President recommends to the consideration of Congress the report of the
                        Secretary of the Treasury; and hopes it will engross the consideration of
                        that body until disposed of in the manner best adapted to attain the
                        important results which the country anticipates from its action.</p>
                    <p>The President believes the army to be, in al respects, in better condition
                        than at any previous period of the war. He recommends the restoration to the
                        army of all who are improperly absent, putting an end to substitution,
                        modifying the exemption law, restricting details and placing in the ranks
                        able-bodied men now employed as wagoners, nurses, cooks and employees doing
                        service for which negroes may be found competent.</p>
                    <p>He concurs in the opinion expressed by the Secretary of war that there is no
                        ground for the objection that a new provision to include those who furnish
                        substitutes under the former call would be a breach of contract. The action
                        of the several executive departments is reviewed and the gratifying
                        announcement made that the receipts of the past office department are six
                        hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars in excess of the expenditures.
                        Communication with Trans-Mississippi is so obstructed as to render difficult
                        compliance with the executive needs. Legislation is required providing for
                        the exercise of temporary authority, especially in the Postal Department and
                        Treasury, for which the subsecretaries are recommended, while for military
                        affairs it would seem to be sufficient to authorize the President and
                        Secretary of war to delegate to the commanding Gen'l so much of the
                        discretionary powers vested in them by law as exigencies of the service
                        shall require. In conclusion the President adverts to the savage ferocity of
                        the enemy in conducting the war, and holds up to public execration the
                        refusal of the Lincoln Government to execute the cartel for the exchange of
                        prisoners. But the patriotism of the people had proven equal to every
                        sacrifice demanded by their country's need, and God had blessed us with
                        success disproportionate to our means and under his divine favor our labors
                        must at last be crowned with success.</p>

<b>Gov. Letcher's Message</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The governor addresses a number of issues in his latest address. These
                    include his concerns about extortioners; lukewarm support for ending the policy
                    of substitution; increased emphasis on the development of Home Guard units; a

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The message of Governor Letcher is very long, filling nine and a half columns
                        of the Richmond "Enquirer." It quotes the remarks of Samuel Adams of
                        Massachusetts delivered in 1776 to show that our present struggle for
                        independence is justified as was that of our fathers in the first
                        revolution. Honor, justice, propriety--every consideration that should
                        influence good and patriotic men--show the necessity of our eternal
                        separation. Men who preach peace under present circumstances are false to us
                        and the Confederacy. It is time enough to speak of an honorable peace when
                        Lincoln shall have withdrawn his armies from our soil.</p>
                    <p>All classes, rich and poor, are equally interested in this struggle. Those
                        who maintain the contrary are enemies to our cause and success. In the main,
                        they are men who were active in bringing about the present war, but who have
                        taken peculiar pains to keep out of the fight. I happen to know of a number
                        of such in our own State, who have domiclied [sic] themselves and families
                        in soft places, and have thus escaped the dangers of the field. They were
                        for commotion and agitation, not for a fight and take their chances for
                        martyrdom in a glorious cause.</p>
                    <p>Legislation is required for the protection of our people against the
                        impositions practiced by impressment officers and persons claiming to be
                        such, and I trust it will be had at this session. Impressment should be
                        apportioned according to the quantities on hand in each neighborhood,
                        leaving a portion to each farmer, to be disposed of for the inhabitants of
                        the cities and the poor of the country. If any other system be adopted
                        distress, dissatisfaction and starvation will be inevitable.</p>
                    <p>The harboring of deserters, and the aid extended to them in facilitating
                        their passage from point to point on their way home, is a mot serious evil,
                        and legislation is imperatively demanded for its correction.</p>
                    <p>He recommends an increase of the pay of soldiers.</p>
                    <p>The gains of extortioners since the war should be ascertained, from which a
                        land should be created for the relief of the families of our gallant
                        soldiers.</p>
                    <p>He renews his recommendation of the last session for an organization of all
                        able-bodied persons in our State, for the purpose of home defence, and to
                        aid, if necessary, in the execution of the laws.</p>
                    <p>He was opposed to the policy of substitution, but as it was adopted, he is
                        opposed to violating such contracts as have been made by requiring the
                        principle to go into the service. Contracts between governments and
                        individuals should at all times be held sacred and inviolable. No Government
                        which violates them can long maintain its character for honor or integrity.
                        When these are forfeited by a government, the public confidence in it is at
                        an end.</p>
                    <p>He recommends the use of free negro labor exclusively in the repair of our
                        railroads.</p>
                    <p>Of the currency, he says that excessive issues have caused distrust with the
                        people as to their ultimate redemption, and hence the great depreciation and
                        the enormous prices now demanded for articles of prime necessity. Confidence
                        must be restored if a moderate degree of wisdom and good sense shall control
                        the action of Congress at the present session.</p>
                    <p>On the 26th day of last month another call for five thousand more slaves was
                        addressed to me by the President. This call and the papers accompanying it
                        are submitted for your examination.</p>
                    <p>The people generally complain that the provision of the law, which requires
                        the Confederate Government to pay the value of such slaves as may die, or be
                        not returned to their owners, has not been complied with, and they have no
                        guarantee that slaves now sent, if lost, will be paid for. The reason
                        assigned to me for nonpayment has been that Congress had made no
                        appropriation for this object, and that payment could not be made until a
                        bill appropriating the amount necessary had become a law. Within the last
                        few days I have been informed that it is the opinion of the War Department
                        that all such claims, when that court shall be organized; and that no
                        payments can be made without a favorable judgment be pronounced by such
                        tribunal. Such a construction seems to me to be at war not only with the
                        spirit but also the letter of the law requiring the Executive to comply with
                        the President's requisition.</p>
                    <p>In this be the construction which is to be placed on this law, it is not
                        wonderful that dissatisfaction and indisposition to comply with the
                        requisitions should be the consequence. A slave lost in this service a year
                        ago could not now be replaced at less than double the value fixed at that
                        day; and if the demand of his owner is postponed, until a Court of Claims
                        shall be organized, it is equivalent to nearly a total loss.--It is in my
                        judgment the duty of our Senators and Representatives in Congress to see
                        that an appropriation for this purpose is made without delay. The people
                        expect it, and their reasonable expectation should not be disappointed in
                        this respect.</p>
                    <p>The entire funded debt of the State on the 1st of October, 1868, was
                        $85,145,798.35. For the payment of the interest and the final redemption of
                        the principal of this debt, the Constitution of the State has provided a
                        sinking fund, which must extinguish the whole in thirty-four years from its
                        creation; and this fund has been realizing the anticipations of its
                        founders, and will accomplish the end in less time. The temporary debt
                        created for the purposes of the war, and for which treasury notes have been
                        issued, amounts to the sum of $4,938,112. For the payment of this amount
                        ample provision has been made, so that whenever the notes shall be called in
                        they will be promptly redeemed.</p>
                    <p>The amount received into the treasury from all sources <br>during the fiscal
                        year has been $16,874,995.51 Which, with the sum on hand at the end of the
                        previous fiscal year 484,778.96 Makes 16,809,774.47 And the expenditures for
                        the same period have been 15,484,770.25 Leaving a balance in the treasury on
                        the 1st of October, 1868, of $1,375,004.22 Which with a few warrants issued
                        in the year and not collected, as is explained in the Auditor's report, will
                        make the actual balance $1,877,868.95 </p>
                    <p>The auditor's estimate of the probable receipts into the Treasury for the
                        fiscal year ending 30th September, 1864, with the balance on hand at the
                        commencement of the year, is $10,666,532.67; and his estimates for the
                        probable charges upon the treasury for the same year is $12,910,783.79;
                        which for the present fiscal year will have a balance against the treasury
                        of $2,244,251.12.</p>
                    <p>Than Virginia no State has been more loyal, more faithful, more devoted. None
                        has contributed more liberally in means and men--none has bared her breast
                        more boldly or defiantly to the storm--and none has sent her "reapers to the
                        harvest of death" with more self sacrificing devotion than the Commonwealth
                        of Virginia.--She enlisted for the war after full consideration, and with a
                        just appreciation of all the consequences that were to follow the
                        separation, and she will be true to the end. She will never sue for peace,
                        because she did not bring on this war. She will never propose compromise,
                        because she struggles only for her rights, her liberty and her independence.
                        She will, as becomes the mother of States, stand up boldly, and hurl scorn
                        and defiance in the face of her foes until they come to her terms. She will
                        never consent to a treaty of peace which dismembers her own territory, nor
                        will she consent to a treaty which does not recognize fully the Confederacy.
                        She knows what is due to her own dignity and character, and she knows what
                        is due to the Confederacy and her duty will be performed with scrupulous
                        fidelity. Kneeling around the altar of the country, her sons will swear
                        allegiance to her, and fidelity to the Confederate Government, and their
                        prayers will ascend to heaven for blessings on Virginia and the Southern
                        Confederacy.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the Ruler of the Universe for His blessings conferred upon us with
                        such liberality--for the successes which have attended our arms--for the
                        unity and harmony of our people--and for the spirit and courage with which
                        He has nerved them for this contest.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully, <br>John Letcher. </p>
                <br>
