                    <p>We understand that Gen. Milroy has only 4,000 men at Winchester and 7 pieces
                        of artillery, whereas we have in the Valley [illegible],000 men and 11
                        pieces of artillery, yet the enemy are allowed to remain unmolested, whilst
                        they are practising the worst possible barbarities upon the people and
                        destroying their property at their fiendish pleasure. Gen. Jones is no doubt
                        a gentleman and a brave man, yet he does not effect much in the way of
                        protecting the people of the Valley against the depredations of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Having no personal acquaintance with him, and judging only from his conduct
                        as Commanding officer we infer that he is a modest man, diffident of his
                        capacity to devise and execute successful campaigns. What we need in the
                        Valley is an able, active and brave commanding officer, who combines the
                        capacity to plan with the energy to execute.</p>
                    <p>We learn that the enemy in Winchester are tearing down all the untenanted
                        houses to make fuel of them, and by way of illustrating their professions of
                        kindness to the colored people, <emph rend="italic">destroyed their
                        church</emph>. The Southern people <emph rend="italic">build</emph> churches
                        for the colored population, and the Yankees <emph rend="italic"
                        >destory</emph> them. The Yankees pretend to be their friends, whilst they
                        are really the only enemies they have. They are now trying to persuade the
                        slaves to take up arms, when they <emph rend="italic">know</emph> that every
                        one, caught with arms in his hands, will certainly be hanged. They have no
                        more love for the slave than the monkey had for the cat whose paw he used to
                        scrape the roasted chestnuts from the hot embers. </p>

                    <p>"Coming events cast their shadows before," and the people of the North are
                        beginning to realize the dread fact that they are resting under the penumbra
                        of swift "coming events," which portend the failure of all their dire
                        purposes against the South. They begin to see the sure evidences of a civil
                        war in their own midst, if they persist in waging their diabolical warfare
                        upon the South. They hear in the West the first mutterings of a storm, which
                        will sweep the war party from power, or drown it in the blood shed in
                        fratricidal strife. If Lincoln be wise, he will haul in his sails; if
                        doomed, as we believe he is, to destruction, he will bid defiance to the
                        coming storm, and will be ignominiously buried beneath the surges of popular
                        wrath. Horace Greely, the white-coated philosopher of the New York<emph
                            rend="italic"> Tribune</emph>, though blinded by abolitionism, is yet
                        able to see that there is a terrible storm approaching. </p>
                    <p>In a speech recently delivered at the Cooper Institute, New York, he said:</p>
                    <p>"I think we have more danger to-day from conspiracies against the Union in
                        the Free States than in the Slave; I think the danger is greater from these
                        than from those."</p>
                    <p>In a recent issue of his paper, the "New York Tribune," Greely says:</p>
                    <p>"From the West we hear of schemes designed by the desperate and
                        disaffected--conspiracies tending to fresh ruptures and the final overthrow
                        of the Republic. Wicked men, even at the North are beginning openly and
                        shamelessly to dally with disunion, and propose, since dislocation has come
                        into fashion, to multiply the fragments of our institutions. All this is
                        terrible. We can better afford to lose fifty fights than thus to weaken the
                        morality of our cause. We can better afford to submit to invasion than thus
                        to make disintegration familiar to our constituencies. We can better afford
                        to let the slaveholding soldier bivouac in the Capitol than to be betrayed
                        into negotiations which are full of danger, or to dally with compromises
                        which, with their adoption, must precipitate us into unmitigated anarchy.
                        Already we begin to hear of Western Confederacies. Already we have hints of
                        new and tempting combinations, aiming at safe and convenient boundaries and
                        the monopoly of internal navigation."</p>
                    <p>These fears of our enemies are not groundless, and we have reason to augur
                        much good from them. A little more patience, and some more heroic fighting,
                        and our independence will be accomplished.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>[From the <emph rend="italic">Richmond Whig</emph>] </p>
                    <p>We published an advertisement, and, we believe, all the papers in the State
                        were requested to copy an article purporting to be from the Rockingham <emph
                            rend="italic">Register</emph>, covering the proceedings of a Court of
                        Inquiry. The effect of that publication was to exhibit Mr. Stuart as a
                        secret, anonymous and false accuser of an honest public functionary. The
                        following letter from Colonel Baldwin gives the facts of the case, and
                        presents Mr. Stuart in a light in which no gentleman and patriot need be
                        ashamed to appear. We know nothing of Colonel Harman's official conduct, and
                        the Court of Inquiry testifies with fullness and swift-footedness to his
                        perfect integrity--and its judgment we have no disposition to call in
                        question. But when public officers on limited salaries, in very short
                        periods, amass unlimited fortunes--the fact will excite surprise and
                        comment. Everything may be right--boundless wealth may be the legitimate
                        reward of Quartermasters and Commissaries of an impoverished Government. We
                        know nothing to the contrary. </p>
                    <p>The very unusual notoriety sought to be given to this publication, by its
                        insertion in every paper in the State, would seem to mean something that
                        does not meet the eye, but what it is we don't know. <lb/></p>
                    <p>CORRESPONDENCE</p>
                    <p>Staunton, January 2d, 1863.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Col. Jno. b. Baldwin</emph>--Dear Sir:-- <lb/>I observed
                        in the <emph rend="italic">Examiner</emph> of yesterday, among the
                        advertisements, an unfounded and ill-natured assault on me, purporting to be
                        taken from an editorial of the Rockingham <emph rend="italic"
                        >Register</emph>. </p>
                    <p>As you are personally cognizant of all the circumstances having any relation
                        to my connection with the imputation upon Col. M. G. Harman, I will be
                        obliged if you will give a brief statement of them for publication in the
                            <emph rend="italic">Examiner</emph>. </p>
                    <p>Very respectfully, yours, <lb/>ALEX. H. H. STUART.</p>
                    <p>House of Representatives, <lb/>January 24, 1863.</p>
                    <p><lb/><emph rend="italic">Hon. Alex. H. H. Stuart</emph>--Dear Sir: </p>
                    <p>I have received yours of the 22d instant, and have also seen the publication
                        to which you refer.</p>
                    <p>The idea that you made an anonymous attack upon Col. M. G. Harman is simply
                        absurd, or that you assailed him at all.</p>
                    <p>At the last session of Congress you sent me a private letter, in which you
                        suggested the appointment of a Congressional committee to overhaul the
                        Quartermaster and Commissary Departments of the army. In support of your
                        suggestion you refer to a number of rumors affecting the administration of
                        those departments in our community, and express the opinion that an
                        investigation ought to be had, and the parties implicated either acquited or
                        punished. You did not mention the name of any officer in connection with the
                        rumors referred to, and you expressly stated that you had no personal
                        knowledge of the truth of any of the charges.</p>
                    <p>In a conversation with the Quartermaster General on the subject, I mentioned
                        your views to him, and showed him your letter. He asked me to leave the
                        letter with him. I told him I had no authority to make any such use of it,
                        as you had no personal knowledge of the matters mentioned by you, it would
                        not be proper to use your name in connection with them. Colonel Myers then
                        asked me to give him an extract containing a statement of the kind of rumors
                        prevailing in our community and stated that he wished to use it in a way
                        which would make it unnecessary to use your name.</p>
                    <p>With that understanding, I addressed him a note containing the extract
                        desired. I was greatly surprised, after returning to Staunton, to find that
                        Col. Myers had felt himself at liberty to send a copy of my note to each one
                        of the numerous Quartermasters in our community.</p>
                    <p>I was at once called upon for the name of my correspondent, and by your
                        direction I referred them to you. A correspondence between you and Col. M.
                        G. Harman disclosed the fact that although you had not named him in your
                        letter, he was, by rumor, implicated in some of the transactions referred to
                        by you, and the consequence was that a Court of Inquiry was convened to
                        investigate his transactions. I happened to know that when called upon to
                        appear before the Court of Inquiry, you referred them to the correspondence
                        to show them you had from the beginning disclaimed any personal knowledge on
                        the subject, and you were now examined as a witness.</p>
                    <p>This was, so far as I know, your whole connection with the matter.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully, <lb/>Your obedient servant. <lb/>John B. Baldwin</p>
