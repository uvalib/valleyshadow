<b>Hopelessness of the North in this War.</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The North is growing hopeless in this war--everyday shows it. The recent
                        debates in Congress, and the discussion of the more influential of the
                        radical press, show on the part of the North this lack of confidence in its
                        ultimate success. The Chicago "Times," a strong conservative paper, taking
                        this view, says:</p>
                    <p>The administration have no hope of conquering a peace. A part of the Cabinet
                        never supposed the emancipation proclamation would have any other effect
                        than to bring disaster and defeat. If any part of the Cabinet ever believed
                        it would prove of any practical benefit in the war, they are now undeceived.
                        They now know the utter hopelessness of the war under the proclamation.</p>
                    <p>Shall Union-loving men be required to give their treasure and blood in a
                        crusade that is not only hopeless, but if the restoration of the Government
                        be its object, is destructive of that object. When this administration
                        acknowledge their defeat, when the abolition leaders in Congress confess
                        that the nation is bankrupt, and success impossible, when the chosen
                        newspaper organ of the party asks in despair for but ninety days more of
                        trial, when the abolition pulpit announces that our destiny is not in our
                        own hands, but in those of "God and the negro," shall we still pile the debt
                        at the rate of $4,500,000 a day, and still send armies to new fields of
                        slaughter.</p>
                    <p>Every life sacrificed in such a war is a murder by those who carry it on.
                        Under no circumstances can any people be required to give life and treasure
                        in support of a hopeless contest. We have sacrificed enough of blood--we
                        have brought upon ourselves enough of desolation--there are enough of homes
                        where light has gone forever--and our efforts should now be directed where
                        they may reach the purpose for which the war was begun.</p>
                    <p>We must enforce the will of the people--the obedience due to the
                        constitution--the demand for peace.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On the 10th inst., in the House of Representatives of the Confederate
                        Congress, Mr. Hodge, of Kentucky, obtained leave to introduce the following
                        preamble and resolution:</p>
                    <p>Whereas, Information has reached this Congress of the passage by the Congress
                        at Washington, D.C., of a bill for the enlistment of negroes, as soldiers,
                        in the armies of the United States, which armies are to be engaged in the
                        further invasion of the Confederate States of America; and, whereas, the
                        Constitution both of the Confederate States and the United States recognize
                        Africans and their descendants as property; and, whereas, we cannot consent
                        to any change in their political status and condition: Therefore,</p>
                    <p>Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary be instruced [sic] to inquire
                        into the expediency of bringing in a bill providing the proper forms for the
                        disposition of all negroes or mulattoes who may be captured from the enemy,
                        in such manner that those of them who are fugitives from their masters may
                        be returned to their rightful owners, and those for whom no master can be
                        found shall be sold into perpetual bondage, for the purpose of raising a
                        fund to reimburse citizens of this confederacy who have lost their slave
                        property by reason of the interference therewith of the enemy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hodge addressed the House in favor of his proposition, afterwhich it was
                        agreed to.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We understand that the military officers have been impressing the grain,
                        meat, &amp; c. of the farmers of this county, and have been allowing
                        them prices greatly below the market value. We do not know that there is any
                        legal authority for such impressments at all, as we know of no provision
                        having been made by Congress for such impressments. We do not believe that
                        persons should be allowed to hoard a surplus of
                        supplies when they are needed for the subsistence of our army, nor do we
                        believe that they should be taken from the owner without allowing him the
                        local market value of them. Any man who has more than is needed for his own
                        family, and who refuses to sell to the Government for the market value in
                        his locality, should have his surplus supplies impressed, and the Government
                        should allow him full and fair compensation. If the Government would do
                        this, there would be no objection to impressments properly made by the
                        proper authorities, and it would be seldom necessary to resort to
                        impressment, for the great majority of farmers would rather sell their
                        supplies to the Government than to private individuals. Let the Government
                        adopt this policy, and there would be no necessity to resort to impressment,
                        except in reference to those who hoarded their products with the view of
                        obtaining a higher price at a future day, and for such there would be no
                        sympathy, and no dissatisfaction with the Government officials created in
                        the community. If the farmers shall have a guarantee that the fruits of
                        their hard labor will not be taken from them at less than a fair
                        compensation they will cultivate as much land as possible, but if they are
                        to be subject to impressments which will not allow them half price for their
                        products, they will not cultivate more land than is necessary to supply
                        their own families. We hope that Congress will pass an impressment bill
                        which will guarantee to the farmers their rights, and we hope, as we believe
                        they will, that the farmers will use extraordinary efforts to raise an
                        increased quantity of all the supplies necessary for the subsistence of our
                        gallant army. The farmers have a great and patriotic duty to perform as well
                        as the soldiers. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It will be seen by the communication published below that there are at least
                        two of Gen. Jackson's "tried soldiers" who seem to be anxious to entwine the
                        myrtle with the laurel which decorates their brows. They represent
                        themselves as "good looking, intelligent, refined and tried soldiers," and
                        "expect" their fair correspondents to "possess similar qualifications." This
                        county contains a great many fair and lovely ladies who possess the first
                        three qualities mentioned, but we do not know that it contains any who are
                        "tried soldiers." But these young candidates for matrimony need not be
                        discouraged, for whilst the ladies are not "tried soldiers" they may be
                        willing to try soldiers, for a very general impression prevails that ladies
                        have no power to resist the fascination of military buttons. These "tried
                        soldiers" should remember that, in matrimony, the ladies are never volunteers, but always require to be enlisted and pressed
                        into service. Though they never volunteer, they
                        make the most faithful soldiers, for they never desert. </p>

                    <p>MATRIMONY. Two young gentlemen, who are both good-looking, intelligent,
                        refined and tried soldiers of Jackson's army, are desirous of commencing a
                        correspondence with any young ladies who may have a view to matrimony after
                        the adjustment of existing difficulties. Of course the lady is expected to
                        possess similar qualifications.</p>

<b>The Exemption Bill</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article outlines the provisions of the new exemption bill.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Exemption Bill was passed by the Senate, on Wednesday last. As it is
                        quite lengthy, and has to undergo the revision of the House of
                        Representatives, we deem it unnecessary to occupy space by publishing it in
                        full. Its provisions differ from those of the act of last session in
                        sev-particulars [sic]. The clause relative to the exemption of those unfit
                        for service in the field provides that their bodily incapacity shall be
                        "ascertained by a surgeon of the army who is not a resident of the part of
                        the country from which those he is called upon to examine may have come." It
                        also provides that persons so examined and declared unfit for duty "shall
                        not be afterwards subject to be again examined and enrolled." How many times
                        have they been examined already?</p>
                    <p>The clause exempting the judicial and executive officers of the State
                        Governments specifically exempts the Judge of the Supreme, District,
                        Superior, Circuit and Probate Courts, the Chancellors of State Courts, and
                        Sheriffs, and excludes Justices of the Peace.</p>
                    <p>Persons appointed by the officers of the Executive Departments, since the
                        16th April, 1862, and who were liable to military service when appointed,
                        are excluded from exemption.</p>
                    <p>Presidents or conductors of any railroad company, or train, who fail,
                        neglect, or refuse to furnish seats or drinking water to sick and wounded
                        soldiers, not to be exempted.</p>
                    <p>"One editor of each newspaper now being published, and such journeymen,
                        printers, engineers, pressmen, stenographic reporters and mailing clerks as
                        the editor or proprietor thereof may certify upon oath to be indispensable
                        for conducting the publication," are to be exempted.</p>
                    <p>Manufacturers of various classes specified, are exempted on condition that
                        the Manufactured articles shall not be sold at a net profit not exceeding
                            thirty per cent. per annum on the net capital
                        invested. </p>
                    <p>Two new clauses relative to the police of slaves, and to the protection of
                        families not less than ten in number on any farm, are embraced in the bill.</p>
                    <p>These are the principal changes made in the Exemption Act passed in the last
                        session.</p>
