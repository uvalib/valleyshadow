<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The battle between the armies of Gen. Lee and Gen. Hooker, which extended in
                        space from West of Chancellorsville, 12 miles from Fredericksburg, to East
                        of that "old burg," and in time from Friday evening, the 1st, to Monday
                        evening, the 4th, was one of the bloodiest and most hotly contested of the
                        war, and resulted in one of the most glorious and decisive victories of our
                        gallant army. The enemy had 158,000 men, whilst Gen. Lee had, we suppose,
                        less than half that number. The enemy were confident of victory, and
                        expected to defeat and capture the army of Gen. Lee. They have been beaten
                        and driven back across the Rappahannock, and Lincoln has called for 500,000
                        more men. This fact will stand as a refutation of the strongest lying they
                        can possibly perpetrate in reference to this battle. We give as connected an
                        account as we have been enabled to get from the papers of the battle or
                        series of battles.</p>
                    <p>On Thursday, Hooker's right wing had reached a point near Spotsylvania Court
                        House, his left resting on the Rapidan at Ely's Ford, and his centre on
                        Chancellorsville, ten miles Southwest of Fredericksburg. The hostile lines
                        were at this time in close proximity and skirmishes were frequent. On Friday
                        evening, about six o'clock, General Jackson attacked the enemy's right
                        flank, and the first general battle ensued. General Rhodes, commanding D.H.
                        Hill's old division, being on our extreme left, began the fight. The enemy
                        had, during Thursday night, thrown up formidable breast works to resist an
                        attack from the direction of Fredericksburg, but our forces advancing from a
                        nearly opposite direction, they were, of course, worthless. The enemy
                        finding himself outflanked deserted his works without resistance and fled
                        towards Chancellorsville. Night coming on the pursuit was discontinued.
                        During Saturday Jackson continued to press the enemy's right, whilst General
                        Lee assailed him in front. On Sunday morning, shortly after midnight, the
                        hostile armies occupying lines parallel with the plank road leading from
                        Fredericksburg to Orange Court House, the enemy advanced and delivered
                        battle. At this critical juncture General Jackson received his wounds under
                        the following unfortunate circumstances.</p>
                    <p>At midnight, on Saturday night, his men being drawn up in line of battle, a
                        body of troops was seen a short distance in advance of our line. It being
                        doubtful whether they were friends or enemies, General Jackson and staff
                        rode forward to ascertain. Whilst he was engaged in reconnoitering, his men,
                        being unaware of his movement, mistook himself and staff for enemies and
                        fired a volley into them, instantly killing one of his staff and severely
                        wounding Gen. Jackson and Major Crutchfield. One bullet passed through the
                        General's right hand, whilst another struck his left arm below the elbow,
                        and, ranging upward, shattered the bone near the shoulder. He instantly fell
                        to the ground. His brother-in-law, who was with him, laid down beside him to
                        ascertain the character of his wounds. In a moment the unknown troops in
                        front, who proved to be the enemy, advanced and captured two other staff
                        officers who were standing over the General without noticing him. Soon
                        after, four of our men placed him on a stretcher, and were bearing him to
                        the rear, when they were all shot down. The injury to his right hand is
                        severe, one of the bones having been shot away, but it is believed he will
                        ultimately recover its use. His left arm was amputated near the shoulder by
                        Dr. Maguire, of Winchester, and he is said to be doing as well as could be
                        expected.</p>
                    <p>[Since the above was in type we have learned, by telegraph, the sad
                        intelligence that Lieut. Gen. Thos. J. Jackson, the hero, patriot and
                        christian is no more. He died of pneumonia at Guinea Station at a quarter
                        after 3 o'clock on Sunday evening last.</p>
                    <p>This intelligence will cast a pall of gloom over the whole Confederacy. "The
                        Lord give, and the Lord hath taken away." His is one of the "few immortal
                        names that were not born to die."]</p>
                    <p>After one of the most desperate and bloody battles of the war, which lasted
                        until ten o'clock on Sunday morning, Hooker was beaten at all points, and
                        fell back towards the Rapidan at its confluence with the Rappahannock, some
                        sixteen miles above Fredericksburg. This was the battle of Chancellorsville.
                        Whilst it was raging, Sedgwick, with an overwhelming force, advanced from
                        the Rappahannock below Fredericksburg, upon General Early, who, with one
                        division held the heights of Fredericksburg. After a short but desperate
                        resistance, Early was compelled to retire towards Chancellorsville, and
                        Sedgwick took possession of the long coveted heights. In this fight the
                        enemy captured a number of prisoners and five guns of the Washington
                        Artillery battalion.</p>
                    <p>The enemy's triumph was destined to be shortlived. General McLaws being sent
                        to General Early's assistance, in less than two hours dislodged Sedgwick and
                        drove him into the valley of the Rappahannock. General Lee, having punished
                        Hooker sufficiently to keep him quiet for the balance of the day, turned his
                        troops towards Fredericksburg, determined to drive Sedgwick beyond the river
                        and get rid of him. This he did, but as we learn, after the dearest bought
                        victory of the day.</p>
                    <p>After Sunday there was no fighting of consequence on the upper line. On
                        Monday and Tuesday the stillness was occasionally broken by the reports of
                        heavy ordinance, but no engagement occurred, and on Wednesday night the
                        enemy, taking advantage of the storm, recrossed his shattered and
                        discomfitted columns to the North bank of the Rappahannock.</p>
                    <p>Hooker owes the safety of the remainder of his defeated army to the storm
                        which prevented Gen. Lee from falling upon him again.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen by the following General order of Gen. Hooker, issued just
                        before the battle, that he thought "certain destruction" awaited the army of
                        Gen. Lee, if it did not "ingloriously fly."</p>
                    <p>HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, <br>Camp near Falmouth, April 30.
                        <br>General Orders No. 47.</p>
                    <p>It is with heartfelt satisfaction that the Commanding General announces to
                        the army that the operations of the last three days have determined that our
                        enemy must either ingloriously fly or come out from behind his defences and
                        give us battle on our own grounds, where certain destruction awaits him. The
                        operations of the 15th, 11th and 12th corps have been a succession of
                        splendid achievements.</p>
                    <p>By command of Maj. Gen. Hooker, <br>S. WILLIAMS, Ass't Adj't Gen'l.</p>
                    <p>We have not been able to learn the casualties in the regiments from this
                        county. We understand that, in the 52d regiment there were only three
                        slightly wounded. In the 5th regiment, we have been informed, that there
                        were nine killed and one hundred and eleven wounded. Of these we have been

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Staunton, May 8th, 1863</p>
                    <p>"A VOTER," in the Vindicator of today, asks me a
                        number of questions, to which I reply as follows: </p>
                    <p>
                        First. Did you vote for the Ordinance of Secession as a
                            member of the Convention?
                    </p>
                    <p>Answer. I did not.</p>
                    <p>
                        Second. Did you vote for the Ordinance of Secession at
                            the polls?
                    </p>
                    <p>Answer. I did, at Richmond, in presence of the Governor and Council, and I,
                        also, signed the Ordinance in token of my willingness to follow the fortunes
                        of Virginia wherever they might lead.</p>
                    <p>
                        Third. In voting against the expulsion of the traitor
                            Carlyle, singly, and alone, did you doubt his loyalty? Or was your vote
                            based upon other grounds? This objection to you is alleged to have a
                            peculiar significance from the fact that you and Carlyle were made the
                            special objects of public honors by the disloyal of Richmond.
                    </p>
                    <p>Answer. I did vote singly and alone against the expulsion of Carlyle from the
                        Convention. From my knowledge of the man, and from the rumors which
                        prevailed, I believed him to be disloyal, but I was called upon as a sworn
                        judge to condemn an absent man without giving him notice of the trial, or
                        any opportunity to make defence; and I was asked to do this without any
                        testimony of record to which I could appeal in justification of my action.
                        This, I refused to do, because I regarded such a proceeding as not merely
                        affecting Carlyle, but as involving the rights of the people he represented,
                        and as tending to establish, in the midst of all the wild excitement of a
                        revolution, a precedent dangerous to individual right and to representative
                        liberty. Carlyle was already a fugitive in disguise, and it would have been
                        easy to give him a kick as he went down hill. Many a rogue has passed for an
                        honest man by merely crying, "stop thief."</p>
                    <p>The statement that I was "made the special object of public honors by the
                        disloyal of Richmond," is untrue. Some Union ladies of Virginia presented me
                        with a wreath of flowers at Richmond, and the Union ladies at Staunton sent
                        me a silver goblet. Who questions the loyalty of these ladies?</p>
                    <p>
                        Fourth. Do you now, or have you at any time since your
                            election to Congress, looked to, or spoken of, compromise or
                            reconstruction as the finality of our struggle against the iniquitous
                            assumptions of our enemies?
                    </p>
                    <p>Answer. I do not, and have not. I was among the last to give up the old
                        Union; but when I did so, I gave it up forever. </p>
                    <p>
                        Fifth. Did you, about the time of taking command of the
                            Fifty-second Regiment--eight companies of which are from the County of
                            Augusta, in a public speech at the Court House express your solemn sense
                            of the responsibility of your position, as the guardian of the welfare
                            and lives of the sons and relatives of your friends and neighbors, and
                            did you abandon that Regiment after a few brief months in the field?
                            This is feelingly spoken of against you, by parents and friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>Answer. I did make such a speech. The Fifty-second Regiment was enlisted for
                        one year, and when the command was offered to me, I gave up a position in
                        Richmond of higher rank, greater comfort, and better pay, to accept it. When
                        I became a candidate for Congress, I stated that it was my purpose to serve
                        with my Regiment to the end of the year. When Congress met, the House of
                        Representatives decided that the two positions were incompatible; but, at my
                        earnest solicitation, they gave me leave of absence to be with my Regiment
                        to the end of the year, and I returned to it for that purpose. After my
                        return to the Regiment, the Conscript law was passed which vacated my
                        commission, and an order was made for the entire re-organization of the
                        Regiment. The army had just fallen back from Shenandoah mountain under
                        orders from General Jackson, and finding that the law allowed a postponement
                        of the elections in the Regiment for about a month longer, I made an earnest
                        effort to obtain such a postponement upon the express ground that the
                        officers then in commission desired to take part in the approaching campaign
                        in the Valley. Failing in this, I was compelled to leave the service. I was
                        elected to Congress in November, but continued in command of my Regiment
                        until the May following. My only furlough was spent in the publice [sic]
                        service in Congress, and my only other absence was when sent home ill with
                        camp fever.</p>
                    <p>
                        Sixth. Did you, since your election to Congress, declare
                            positively in the town of Staunton, in the hearing of soldiers and
                            others, after the disasters at Roanoke and Donelson, that it was useless
                            to disguise the fact that we were whipped--that we were a conquered
                            people?
                    </p>
                    <p>Answer. I never thought so, or said so, in Staunton or elsewhere, in public
                        or private, to soldier or citizen. On the contrary, I have always thought,
                        and still think, that the success of our cause is as certain as anything in
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>
                        And Seventh. As the result of this belief, did you, by
                            deed, divest yourself of your property for the benefit of female
                            relatives?
                    </p>
                    <p>Answer. I did not. I had agreed to sell my house and furniture to some orphan
                        girls, members of my family, as a means of securing to them a home when
                        deprived of my protection. The property was valued by George M. Cochran, Wm.
                        W. Donaghe and Benjamin Crawford, and the papers were all prepared, but the
                        arrangement was never consummated, and I am still the owner of the property
                        I had at the beginning of the war, but of nothing
                        more. </p>
                    <p>I have thus answered all the questions put by "A Voter," and it cannot but
                        have struck all who have read the questions and answers that not one of them
                        has any relation to my public conduct as the Representative from this
                        district. The attempt to associate me with Carlyle in the public estimation
                        approaches the sublime of impudence. I have not been ignorant of the fact
                        that here, in the community where I was born, and where I have spent my
                        whole life, there has been for some time past a systematic effort to deprive
                        me of the public confidence, and that, for this purpose, slander has been
                        organized, and my whole conduct, public and private, has been subjected to
                        malignant criticism and misrepresentation. I am a patient man and slow to
                        seek controversy with any one; but assailed as I am by a gang of scoundrels,
                        I feel that it is time to let it be known that I am prepared to meet them
                        with utter defiance.</p>
                    <p>If "A Voter" belongs to the gang he will understand me, if he is only one of
                        their tools, I feel for him mere contempt and pity.</p>
                    <p>JOHN B. BALDWIN. <br>District papers copy one time.</p>
