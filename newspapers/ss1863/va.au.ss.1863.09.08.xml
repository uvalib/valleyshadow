                <commentary>"We are permitted to make public the following letter from Mr. Rives to
                    a well known gentleman of Lynchburg. It is as encouraging in its opinions and
                    its historical citations, as it is elegant in style and noble and patriotic in
                    sentiment. Its appearance, too, is fortunately timed, and it cannot be without
                    the happiest effect on the public mind. It would be well if a copy of it should
                    fall under the eye of every citizen of the Confederate States, and we are sure
                    that our contemporaries of the Press will gladly aid in giving it the widest
                    circulation:"</commentary>

                    hearts with unceasing vigilance and unfaltering faith."</excerpt>

                    <p>In these times of high prices, speculation and extortion, the condition of
                        the poor is pitiable in the extreme. We have unfortunately in our midst, as
                        in all other communities, those heartless wretches who, to make money in
                        haste, hesitate not to "grind the faces of the poor." Those who have nothing
                        to sell and everything to buy are at the mercy of those who have the
                        articles they need, whether they be provisions for clothing or fuel. The
                        merchants and farmers can retaliate upon each other, but those who have
                        nothing to sell are between the upper an nether millstone. Something should
                        be done for the relief of this unfortunate class. There are many in it who,
                        this winter, will be unable to supply themselves with the necessaries of
                        life. We should not rely upon voluntary contributions, because they impose
                        all the burden upon the kind and generous, whilst the close-fisted, though
                        they may be much more able to give, do nothing for the relief of the
                        poor.--The best way to equalize the burden is to impose a tax for the
                        special purpose of relieving the wants of the needy, and to tax each in
                        proportion to his means.</p>
                    <p>P. S.--Since the above was written, the Town Council, we are pleased to see,
                        has taken such action as is recommended in the above. See ordinance
                        published in our advertising columns.</p>
