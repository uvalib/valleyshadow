                <excerpt>"It may be said that the bible is not intended to teach Political Economy,
                    and therefore, any attempt to draw from this source the truths of Political
                    Economy is improper and will end in failure. It is admitted. But the truth of
                    science, and the truth of the Bible must be consonant. They are a part of the
                    harmonious whole. There [can] be no discord. If the inferences of Political
                    Science, and the truths of the Bible disagree, if they jar and clash, then may
                    we not rest assured that our inferences are untrue?"</excerpt>

                <summary>A correspondent, W., takes issue with a statement in the Oct. 27th issue of
                    the Spectator that the Malthusian doctrine is true. He argues for the primacy of
                    the Bible as a source of truth, and focuses on the passage "Be fruitful and
                    multiply" as a mandate that can inflict pain on mankind.</summary>

                <commentary/>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>We have sometimes wondered whether the extortioner ever prayed. We should
                        like to hear his prayer, or rather to read the secrets of his heart, while
                        ostensibly engaged in the holy exercise. His words, interpretated [sic] with
                        his thoughts would be something like what follows:</p>
                    <p>Our Father who art in heaven--I wonder what will be the price of wheat this
                        season. My crop is fine, very fine. I think that I might get at least four
                        dollars for it. I should like to get ten--Hallowed by thy name--If the
                        season continues I shall make a tremendous crop of corn, and as my crops are
                        sufficient to last me two years, it will be a clear profit--Thy kingdom
                        come--Chickens are a great institution. Before the war I used to sell them
                        for ten cents, now I get two dollars. I can scarcely find it in my heart to
                        pray for peace--Thy will be done on earth--I believe I will sell my corn to
                        the soldiers' relief society. They dont [sic] give enough--as it is done in
                        heaven. That old steer brought me two hundred dollars. Give us this day our
                        daily bread--my poor neighbor who has a poor husband in the army, and six
                        little children at home, must find it hard to get along.--The Lord bless her
                        and hers. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass
                        against us--my old friend Smith was rather hard on me when he said I gouged
                        the poor, but I forgive him--and lead us not into temptation--I am afraid
                        our pastor's prosperity will prove a snare to him. Why brother Jones sent
                        him a cow and calf--but deliver us from evil. I wish our pastor would quit
                        preaching on extortion. If he don't I will stop subscription, sure. He is
                        really an evil. He won't let a body be at peace--for thine is the kingdom,
                        the power and the glory for ever. I believe I will send some milk cows to
                        Atlanta. I hear they are bringing tremendous prices. The merchants there do
                        charge awfully for their goods. Lord have mercy on us, and save us from such
                        extortioners.--Amen!</p>

                <origin>The Central Presbyterian</origin>
                <commentary>"The Central Presbyterian publishes a sketch of the remarks made by Rev.
                    Mr. Lacy, from which the following is an extract:"</commentary>
                <excerpt/>
                <transcript>
                    <p>After returning from our Chaplain's meetings, General Jackson would send for
                        me, and in his manner would say, "Come in, Mr. Lacy, and make your report."
                        In response to interesting statements he would say--That's good; we ought to
                        thank God for that." When he saw Gen. Lee and other officers come to attend
                        preaching, it gave him great joy. Among his liberal contributions of money,
                        it may be mentioned that he gave $300 to publish an editon [sic] of the
                        tract, "Our Danger and Our Duty," one of the most powerful productions that
                        ever came from the pen of Dr. Thornwell. General Jackson was deeply
                        impressed by it. After he was wounded in his last battle, his love for the
                        word of Go seemed greater than ever. He (Mr. Lacy) would sometime a read
                        eight or ten chapters to him.</p>
                    <p>Here the Rev. Dr. Hoge being requested to state what was the impression made
                        in England by his death, remarked, in substance, that it was in the highest
                        degree solemn, deep and affecting; that he was not only admired there as a
                        great General, but loved as a good man; and that his death was lamented with
                        a sorrow like that which belongs a personal bereavement. Lord Shaftsbury
                        said he considered Gen. Jackson the greatest man our country had ever
                        produced.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lacy then traced the progress of the revival after the death of this
                        eminent man. About one thousand soldiers made a profession of religion in
                        Gen. Jackson's corps while encamped about Fredericksburg, and before the
                        army went into Pennsylvania. Amid all the hindrance of the campaign, there
                        was still great interest on this subject, and when the army returned to
                        Winchester it increased. More than two thousand have made a profession of
                        religion within about two months.</p>

                <summary>In addition to noting the deeply religious nature of General Jackson, Rev.
                    Lacy goes on to attribute a revival of religion amongst the soldiers of the army
                    to the influence of Jackson.</summary>

                <excerpt>"The enemy now massed his whole force on our left and center, consisting of
                    about Four thousand Cavalry, under Averill, and three thousand Infantry under
                    Kelley. To oppose this force we had seventeen hundred, of which eight hundred
                    were cavalry. For four hours we contended against overwhelming odds."</excerpt>

                    <p>We have been unable to learn the particulars of the fight in Greenbrier on
                        Friday, the 6th instant, in which the forces of Genl. Kohels and Col. Wm. L.
                        Jackson, amounting to only 1,700 men were forced to retire in some disorder
                        before the combined forces of Genl's Kelly and Averill numbering 7,000 men,
                        after a stubborn resistence [sic] of four hours.--Col. Wm. L. Jackson with a
                        small force of cavalry and a section of artillery, was near Mill Point, in
                        Pocahontas county, when the enemy marched upon him.--He despatched the fact,
                        that the enemy in force were marching upon him, to Genl. Echols at
                        Lewisburg, who immediately marched to his relief. Col. Jackson fell back in
                        the direction of Lewisburg to Droop Mountain (28 miles North East of
                        Lewisburg) where the reinforcements of General Echols met him, and where the
                        engagement occurred. A correspondent of the Richmond <emph rend="italic"
                            >Whig</emph> says: </p>
                    <p>"The battle was joined about eleven o'clock by our artillery firing at the
                        enemy's battery as it came into position.--This was soon ended, as he was
                        driven away by our well directed shots. The enemy now massed his whole force
                        on our left and centre, consisting of about <emph rend="italic">Four
                            thousand Cavalry</emph>, under Averill, and <emph rend="italic">three
                            thousand Infantry</emph> under Kelley. To oppose this force we had <emph
                            rend="italic">seventeen hundred</emph>, of which eight hundred were
                        cavalry. For four hours we contended against overwhelming odds.--The enemy,
                        moving his forces beyond our left, wheeled his men, and thus obtained an
                        enfilading fire. </p>
                    <p>Just at this time, our centre, which had been much weakened in reinforce the
                        left, was attacked by a largely superior force and pressed back. Gen.
                        Echols, seeing it useless to contend longer, gave orders to retreat; the
                        enemy badly cut up, made only a feeble pursuit.--Our loss was necessarily
                        very heavy, especially in killed and wounded. Maj. R. A. Bailey, of the 22nd
                        Virginia regiment was wounded; [reported mortally] and captured. <emph
                            rend="italic">Of ten officers in </emph> 3 <emph rend="italic">companies
                            of this same regiment that fought on our left, but two escaped
                        unhurt.</emph></p>
                    <p>The 3d batallion [sic] suffered severely, but as reports of casualties have
                        not been handed in, no accurate information can yet be obtained.</p>
                    <p>The retreat had continued but a short time when Gen. Echols received
                        information that the Yankees, several thousand strong, were marching on
                        Lewisburg, by the Kanawha road, to cut him off. It was now all impotant
                        [sic] to get our trains and artillery by Lewisburg and across the Greenbrier
                        river before the new force could come up. This was done, and the enemy
                        baffled <emph rend="italic">with the loss of [illegible] of artillery and
                            one wagon which was abandoned because the carriage broke down.</emph>
                        Gen. Echols crossed the river early in the morning of the 7th instant, and
                        after resting a few hours, continued the march towards Union, Monroe
                        county." </p>
                    <p>After the failure of the enemy to capture the forces of Echols and Jackson at
                        or near Lewisburg as they no doubt expected to do, Gen. Averill, with a
                        cavalry force supposed to number 3,500, marched East in the direction of
                        Staunton as far as Callaghans in Alleghany, 6 miles West of Covington, where
                        he turned off north to Highland county. A foraging party of the enemy went
                        within a few miles of Covington where they were fired upon by a portion of
                        Genl. Imboden's force, when they took the back track at more than a double
                        quick. As the enemy marched North on the North side of the Mountains, Gen.
                        Imboden marched North on the South Side so as to be ready to prevent his
                        coming to the Valley.</p>
                    <p>On Thursday morning a despatch was received here from Gen. Imboden which
                        stated that from the information he had, he was led to believe that Gen.
                        Averill would be reinforced at Monterey by a force of 300 under Col.
                        Mulligan, and that their combined forces would attempt to reach Staunton.
                        Upon this information, Col. Baldwin, as Colonel of the regiment of Home
                        Guards, summoned the different companies of H. Guards in the county to get
                        ready for duty and report as soon as possible at Staunton. On the next day
                        (Friday) the town was thronged with hundreds of Home Guards who were soon
                        armed and ready to march to the mountains to meet the foe. Gen. Averill
                        seemed to know instinctively the kind of reception he would meet with on the
                        part of the Augusta Home Guards, and marched in the <emph rend="italic"
                            >opposite</emph> direction, so that there was no opportunity, for the
                        Home Guards to phlebotomise the Yankees. The Home Guards reported for duty
                        as promptly as regulars could have done, and they presented as fine an
                        appearance as any regiment in the service, and those who knew the good
                        material of which the companies were composed did not doubt for a moment
                        that they would fight gallantly. </p>
                    <p>Though the "wolf" may not come every time the cry of wolf is made, yet it is
                        better to respond promptly every time the alarm may be given, for it would
                        be better to come out ninety-nine times when there is no wolf, than to fail
                        the hundredth time if the wolf should really come. We have no doubt that the
                        Home Guards will always do their duty, and their <emph rend="italic"
                        >first</emph> duty is to respond promptly when called upon by their
                        commanding officer. Should it be their fortune to be led against the
                        invading foe, we cherish the hope that their heroic conduct will cause a
                        halo of glory to </p>
                    <p>"Circle their armies with a charm against death."</p>

                <summary>On October 6th, near Greenbrier, a greatly outnumbered Confederate force
                    under Gen. Echols and Col. Wm. L. Jackson fought heartily, but had to retreat in
                    the face of a determined attack. The enemy troops under the command of General
                    Averill next moved towards Staunton until their forces were blocked by Gen.
                    Imboden near Covington. The presence of a large enemy troop in the area led to
                    the mustering of the Home Guard units at Staunton. While the anticipated arrival
                    of the enemy troops never materialized, it was, according to the author, "better

                    severe losses.</summary>

                <head>Financial Relief--With A Vengeance</head>
                <origin/>
                <commentary>"We were very much surprised to find in the Richmond Whig of 13th inst.,
                    under the heading 'Financial and Commercial', the following article:"</commentary>
                <excerpt>"The proposition is to levy a tax, one-half of which, or some other
                    equitable proportion, shall be paid in SPECIE, or in the coupons of a new issue
                    of six per cent bonds."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>"The plan of financial relief, copied into this paper a short time since from
                        a North Carolina paper, originally appeared, we believe, in the Columbia
                        South Carolinian, to which journal it was communicated by a citizen of South
                        Carolina. The plan is attracting considerable attention from the press, and
                        is generally regarded as the most effective yet suggested for restoring our
                        finances to a healthful condition. The proposition is to levy a tax,
                        one-half of which, or some other equitable proportion, shall be paid in
                        SPECIE, or in the coupons of a new issue of six per cent. bonds. The theory
                        is, that tax payers will invest in these bonds to an amount sufficient to
                        secure the coupons required to pay a moiety [sic] of their taxes, and thus
                        the redundant currency will be reduced, and, thereafter, may be kept within
                        reasonable limits."</p>
                    <p>In our poor judgment this is the most inefficient and mischievous proposition
                        that has yet been suggested. Its adoption would leave the currency for a
                        long time to come, in its present lamentable condition, and bring ruin on
                        the whole people. To talk of collecting one-half the present large amount of
                        taxes in gold and silver, is simply preposterous. Where is the gold and
                        silver to come from? Specie is now worth 12 in notes for one in gold. If
                        this be the case when there is but little demand for it, what would be the
                        premium when a new demand was created for hundreds of millions of it? It
                        would run up to 50 or 100 for one. There is not one-fifth of the required
                        amount of gold in the whole Confederacy. But it may be said that people may
                        relieve themselves by buying bonds of the new issue to such an amount that
                        the coupons would be sufficient to pay the specie half of the tax. This may
                        do for the wealthier classes, but how are men in moderate circumstances to
                        get the money to buy the bonds? A shoemaker or other mechanic, for example,
                        pays a license tax of $50 and commissions on his sales amounting to, say
                        $100 more. One-half of his tax would be $75. Under this notable scheme, he
                        would have to pay $75 in gold, or buy $1250 worth of bonds to get enough
                        coupons! Where is he to get the money? All his stock in trade, including his
                        tools, would not suffice to buy them, and he would be sold out of house and
                        home for taxes. Of course, at the sales, nothing would be received in
                        payment but coupons of those particular bonds or gold and silver! What would
                        property bring sold on these terms?</p>
                    <p>This mild admonition to buy bonds reminds one of the wisdom of the Queen of
                        France, who, when the people were clamoring for bread to feed their starving
                        families, naively exclaimed: "How silly! Why don't they eat cakes?"</p>
                    <p>But suppose the scheme were adopted, and suppose the bonds bought, it would
                        require six and twelve months for the coupons on the bonds to mature? What
                        would become of the country and the currency in the mean time?</p>
                    <p>If Congress wishes to ensure the defeat of our cause, it could devise no more
                        effectual means of accomplishing that end, than to adopt this scheme.
                        National and individual ruin would be its inevitable consequences.</p>
                    <p>We are satisfied the editors of the Whig did not intend to endorse this
                        scheme by giving it a place in its paper. But as it appears from the article
                        that "the plan is attracting considerable attention from the press and is

                        Yankee. Our Revolutionary sires overcame the last two; be ours the task to
