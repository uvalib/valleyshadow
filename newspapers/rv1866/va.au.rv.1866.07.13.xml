                    <p>The people of the United States consume a large quantity of whisky, if we may
                        judge from the report of the Revenue Commission, which estimates the amount
                        annually consumed at a gallon and a half for each man, woman and child in
                        the country. British America is not far behind us, however, for it consumes
                        annually a gallon and a quarter for each of the population. In Great Britain
                        malt liquors prevail, for the people, whilst they consume only seven-eights
                        of a gallon of whiskey for each one, drink an average of nearly a barrel of
                        ale and beer apiece. Russia is the greatest whiskey drinking country, the
                        consumption averaging more than two gallons annually for each of the
                        inhabitants.</p>

                    <p>The new tariff bill, which is intended to foster certain manufacturing
                        interests in certain sections, is meeting with a howl of disapproval from
                        the people of the great grain-growing West. For several years their policy
                        and that of the dominant party in the North has been one. No word of warning
                        would be listened to-no protest against unconsitutional acts was heeded.
                        Recklessly they uphold the hands of the controlling faction, and endorsed
                        their acts until it has led the country into its present pitiable condition.
                        National legislation has been turned into the enactment of laws intended to
                        enrich individuals, or the passage of amendments to the constitution, with
                        the purpose of preserving power, forever, in the hands of a few, to all of
                        which, heretofore, the West and Northwest has uttered no word of protest.
                        Now the leader of this faction, aided by a powerful lobby, has thrust into
                        their teeth a bill, the burdens of which will be borne by the exclusively
                        agricultural sections, while those wholly manufacturing will reap a rich
                        harvest, and those agricultural sections, which possess an ability to
                        manufacture, now being developed, or awaiting development, will be either
                        damaged much nor benefited a great deal. With whip and spur he would goad
                        into line his, heretofore, passive followers, but the West and North-west
                        wince under the spur and the burdens to be borne and are disposed to balk
                        just at the pinch of the hill.</p>
                    <p>The Eastern and Middle States are largely manufacturing and greatly to be
                        benefited, while the Southern have been agricultural, but abound in untold
                        wealth, the development of which will receive somewhat of a stimulus, but
                        the grain-growing West and North-west, being exclusively agricultural must
                        pay the piper. They could look on exultingly while our unfortunate section
                        was being fleeced of its abundant wealth, and see her pillaged and
                        devastated with loud shouts for the destroyers, but not one sigh of sympathy
                        for the oppressed, recking little where their aid and influence was bearing
                        them, but now, when the pennies are to be filched from their own pockets to
                        enrich New England manufacturers, they feel the folly of their course, but
                        utter their protests too late.</p>
                    <p>We pity them in their oppression, and trust their experience will teach them
                        ever hereafter to avoid radicalism as the vilest of pests,-and that passion
                        and prejudice lead on but to destroy, while wisdom's ways are those of
                        prosperity as well as pleasantness and peace.</p>

                    grain-growing West," since the bill will hurt them, as well as the South, while
