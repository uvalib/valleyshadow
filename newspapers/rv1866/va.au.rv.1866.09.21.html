<b>A Returned Confederate</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Tells the tale of a soldier named Simpson, who has been trying to make his
                    way back to his home in Augusta since the end of the war. He was jailed for
                    months in Indiana after shooting a Federal officer with his own gun after being
                    shot three times himself.<br>(Names in announcement:   Simpson)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The latest and perhaps the last to come, returned Confederate was in this
                        city Saturday, direct from the late enemy's prisons.</p>
                    <p>His experiences since the surrender has been both eventful and tragic. Soon
                        after the termination of the war he was, with other prisoners at Johnson's
                        Island, liberated, but not furnished with transportation. Being without
                        money, he was at a loss how to get to his home, which is in Augusta county
                        in this State, nine miles from Staunton. He, however, made his way into
                        Indians afoot, and in passing through a town of that State, went into hotel,
                        thinking he might meet with some one who would him assistance. A number of
                        men were at the bar drinking among them a Federal officer, who was talking
                        about the war, and among other things, said that he had taken an oath to
                        kill every one of Ashby's men he ever men with ... Without stopping to weigh
                        the consequences our returned hero spoke up, on the impulse of the moment,
                        and said he was one of Ashby's men. The officer at once drew a pistol and
                        fired on him three times, each ball taking effect, but not in the vital
                        points. Our Confederate, like a wounded lion, rushed on him, wrenched the
                        weapon from his grasp, and shot the officer dead with a remaining ball. The
                        Confederate was arrested, thrown into prison, where he suffered long months
                        of confinement, and it was only very recently that he was brought on trial,
                        which resulted in his final acquittal. He then started again for home, and
                        reached here Saturday morning by the Tennessee train. He stopped at the
                        Norvell House, where he was recognized by gentlemen who knew him and vouched
                        for his respectability and reliability. He also had with him a copy of the
                        records in the trial, properly authenticated, corroborating his statements.
                        He was furnished with assistance and started for his home Sunday morning.
                        His name is Simpson, and he was a member of Ashby's command, while that
                        knightly chieftain rode his wondrous round, and was the first to reach his
                        noble form when he fell. Thus has perhaps the last "rebel" in gray come back
                        to his home, save the long, long list of those who sleep in the "bivouac of
                        the dead," who will return never again to the homes for which they fought so
                            well.--Lynchburg News.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The New York Times of Wednesday has the following remarks upon the troubles
                        threatening the country., the course the President would likely pursue, and
                        the possibility that General Grant will become supreme ruler:</p>
                    <p>By law, congress consists of 241 members, and by law, also a majority of the
                        whole number, or 121 members constitute a quorum. Suppose that members
                        elected from the Southern States should meet in December, 1867, and be
                        enough, added to Northern members who believe in their right to
                        representation, and who would meet with them to constitute a quorum; and
                        suppose the Northern members who do not believe the South entitled to
                        representation, and who would meet with them, should meet by themselves,
                        constituting less than a quorum of the whole number. The Pittsburg Chronicle
                        begins to see the possibility of such an occurrence; and it also sees that
                        the President will be under the necessity of recognizing one or the other of
                        these bodies as the valid, constitutional House of Representatives. He must
                        send his message to one or the other. He must sign bills passed by the one
                        or the other as a branch of Congress, and the other as having no such
                        authority. And under the circumstances assumed there can be very little
                        doubt in view of his known opinions on the subject, that President Johnson
                        will recognize the numerical quorum -- the body which contains a majority of
                        all the members -- as the only body authorised by the Constitution to make
                        laws for the United States. He will probably send his message to that body;
                        he will sing the bills they pass, if concurred in by the Senate, and he will
                        not recognize the acts of the other as valid in any respect. The Senate, on
                        the contrary, will recognize a majority from all the States, but ten, even
                        if they are a minority of the whole, as the real Congress, and as clothed
                        with all the powers of legislation.</p>
                    <p>Here, certainly, is danger of a collision of authority. We have foreseen it,
                        and have warned the country of it. The Radicals have foreseen it, and have
                        been preparing for it. They have not concealed their purpose, in such an
                        event, to appeal to force and rouse the country to another conflict of arms.</p>
                    <p>General Grant maintained, and still maintains, his personal independence. He
                        is reserved, by those singular and unmatched personal qualities which hold
                        him aloof from all factious and seditious schemes, for the supreme hour of
                        trial which may await our beloved Republic. And stranger things have
                        happened in human history than would be the salvation of the nation from the
                        perils of a new civil war, by a spontaneous committed of its destinies to
                        his control.</p>
