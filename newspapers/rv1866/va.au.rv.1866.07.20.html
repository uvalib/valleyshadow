<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes the people of the Valley for their reticence to subscribe to
					Valley Railroad stock, explaining to readers that "if we want this road built we
					must take an interest in it and put our shoulders to the wheel."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We published some weeks since the call of the President of the Valley
						Railroad to the People of the Valley to increase their subscription to the
						Valley Railroad stock, in order to secure its completion at the earliest
						possible moment. This notice to the people of the Valley is still published
						in our columns, and we invite the particular attention of our readers to it.
						To be sure the large amount of one million dollars is necessary to be
						subscribed, but the terms are such that none can cavil at them. Two  per cent to be paid when called for thirteen  per cent., to be paid in the next three  years and the remainder, eighty-five per cent., in the next ten
						 years. What man in this community could not take one share and pay
						for it on these terms? Not one. </p>
					<p>With the terms made thus easy, this call seems almost to have fallen still
						born on our people. To be sure one or two counties moved in this matter but
						there it seems to have stopped. Do the people of the Valley really want the
						Valley Railroad constructed? Their delay and hesitation in subscribing
						promptly the amount needed would argue that they did not. It surely can not
						be believed that capitalists are bent on building this road and that we can
						lie by mere idle speculators of the construction of a work, the direct
						benefit from which will accrue to ourselves. If this delusion is nurtured
						let it be dissipated now and forever. If we want this road built we must
						take an interest in it and put our shoulders to the wheel. The rich lands of
						our Valley call for, and the interest of production demands its
						construction, and yet we seem to remain immovable in this matter, so
						important to us, and to be trusting simply to luck. If the million dollars
						needed was to be subscribed and paid in at once, we could understand the
						delay and procrastination, but, when only two 
						per cent. will be called for at once, thirteen 
						per cent. in the next three years and the remainder in the next ten years,
						we are at a loss to know why this stock has not been taken ere this. </p>
					<p>The advantages to the valley section are incalculable at present, but we know
						that the increased value of all that we possess in this section will be many
						times more than the amount of stock necessary to be taken, in order to
						construct this road. Think of this farmers and business men of the
						Valley.-One thousand dollars of stock will only require $20 to be paid when
						called for, $130 in the next three years, and $850 in the next ten years.</p>
					<p>The officers of the road say that the "circumstances are more favorable now
						to the construction of this work than ever before, or probably than they
						will be hereafter"-a competent corps of engineers are locating the road
						between Harrisonburg and Salem, and all that remains to be done is for the
						Valley people to come up to this work in earnest, and raise the subscription
						to the amount needed. Will they do it? If they see the matter in the light
						of their own interest we are satisfied they will, and we warn them to think
						of it and not to let this golden opportunity for vastly improving the
						condition of our section pass by without taking advantage of it.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>A meeting of the Breckinridge, and Bell and Everett Executive Committees met
						in Richmond on Monday last to confer as to the advisability of sending
						delegates to the Philadelphia National Convention. There being no organized
						Douglas Committee in Richmond several of the party present were invited to
						participate in the proceedings. There was a diversity of opinion as to the
						course to pursue, but the Philadelphia Convention was approved and it was
						resolved to send delegates to represent Virginia. A committee was appointed
						to prepare business and the meeting adjourned to meet again on Wednesday.</p>
					<p>We are opposed to the sending of delegates by the Southern States to this
						convention, upon the platform of the committee calling the convention, or in
						the light of its construction by prominent men endorsing this convention,
						who either directly or indirectly sanction the present Congressional test
						oath. We can not go into such a convention under the platform proposed,
						without stultifying ourselves and giving our sanction to the legality of the
						unconstitutional test oath, which would debar us from having anything but a
						mock representation in Congress for years to come, and we would be decidedly
						better without any. Assure them in any proper manner that we will aid them
						in what way we can, and on Constitutional principles, to defeat the Radicals
						and restore the country, last let us not sit in any convention which
						acknowledges any difference in loyalty to the Constitution between the
						people of the sections now "unnaturally severed."</p>
					<p>If delegates are to be sent let it be under the express qualification, as
						expressed in the resolution of Mr. Nat. Tyler, on Monday last, that Virginia
						claims her rights under the Constitution, and laws made in pursuance
						thereof, and protests against all proscriptive test oaths."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The President returned the Freedmen's Bureau Bill to the House of
						Representatives, on Monday last, with his objections. His objections are the
						same as those given for his veto of a similar measure in February. He
						opposes it as class legislation, as unwise, as setting up military tribunals
						liable to come in conflict with the civil law, and unnecessary, as the laws
						of each state protect the persons and property of white and black alike. He
						objects to it on the score of economy. He says the act now in force extends
						some months beyond the meeting of the next Congress, which, if additional
						legislation is necessary, can then mature a bill. He further states that the
						Civil Rights bill secures all the legislation contemplated by this bill, the
						provisions of which will be faithfully executed so long as it remains
						unrepealed and may not be declared unconstitutional by courts of competent
						jurisdiction. The provision confirming the sale of certain Sea Island lands
						is considered unwise, partial and unconstitutional. In conclusion he warns
						Congress of the danger of class legislation.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Lynchburg Republican of Saturday in referring
						to the Bell, Breckinridge and Douglas Executive Committees of Virginia to
						appoint Delegates to the Philadelphia Convention, pointedly asks, "by what
						shadow of authority these defunct committees of two defunct parties in
						Virginia, can presume to arrogate to themselves such a task as is thus
						proposed to be assigned them?" The functions of these committees closed with
						the Presidential election of 1860, and the very parties which gave them
						existence have ceased to exist. For two gentlemen in Richmond-Mr. McFarland
						and Colonel Rutherford-to step forward and undertake to do what they have no
						authority, to do, and what the people have not asked them to do, would be an
						act of presumption, an abuse of power and an insult to the people, which we
						are sure such elevated and discreet gentlemen will not commit. If the People
						of Virginia want to send delegates to the Philadelphia Convention, let them
						assemble in primary Conventions and do so. But if they don't want to send
						delegates there, don't insult public intelligence and outrage the principles
						of representation by plaming off delegations through the instrumentality of
						an effete  and unauthorized organization. A
						Jacobin Congress wants to assume all powers at Washington, and two gentlemen
						in Richmond are to assume all political authority in this commonwealth! If
						the people intend to have any more representative government, let them have
						it, but if not, let us give up the shadow and cease to delude ourselves with
						ridiculous ceremonies.</p>

<b>End of a "National Bank"</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports on an institution in South Carolina that called itself the
					"Freedmen's National Bank" where the proprietors gave freedmen worthless notes

<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>"We find this melancholy history in an exchange:"<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Freedmen's National Bank, an institution organized by a Boston firm, at
						Sandy Hill, South Carolina, to receive and take care of the savings of the
						negroes in that region, has closed its doors finally. Its name was a mere
						sham as it had no connection with the Government to authorize the assumption
						of the title 'National Bank.' Its notes were wretched lithographs, much
						resembling blacking box labels, but printed in gaudy colors, which
						captivated the eyes of the poor negroes.-Each freedman who deposited a
						dollar greenback in the ban, received a two-dollar note of this gay
						pictorial issue, and fancied, of course, that he was so much richer.</p>
					<p>There is no telling how much longer the swindle would have lasted, if Captain
						Jewett, late of the army, who had leased a plantation in the neighborhood of
						Sandy Hook Hill, had not discovered some of the fraudulent notes among the
						hands of the place and learned from the simple-minded creatures the nature
						of the financial enterprise in which they had embarked. He immediately wrote
						to Washington upon the subject, but Clarges &amp; Higginson, the
						proprietors of the institution, somehow getting wind of the discovery, stole
						something getting wind of the discovery, stole away in the night, carrying
						with them of course, all the deposits in their "vaults."</p>
					<p>It is supposed that they realized by this transaction between $3,000 and
						$4,000.-They came South as temperance lecturers, and at first eked out their
						substance by selling tracts and bibles. It is said that certain parties from
						the North, who are occupying abandoned plantations near the site of the
						defunct "bank" suggested the enterprise to those two adventurers, induced
						the freedmen in their employ to exchange their wages for the beautiful bills
						of Clarges &amp; Higginson, and divided the profits of the concern with
						those worthies. The freedmen who have been thus shamefully gulled have
						learned a lesson, but a very hard and unpleasant one.</p>
