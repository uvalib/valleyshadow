					<p>Impartial Suffrage" is the only new name which the Negro Kissers have given
						to what plain men, in a plain way, call niggers votin'. "Impartial Suffrage"
						sounds better than nigger suffrage, but it don't change the nature of the
						thing. You may call a sawbuck a horse fiddle, if you please; but it is the
						same double X with a transverse bar, and makes the same discordant noise
						that it did before. Call a nigger wench the "Rose of Allendale," and she is
						no lovelier than when you call her Dinah. Just so it is with Impartial
						Suffrage. It means to let a nigger vote, who don't know his A. B. C.'s; it
						means to give him the same voice in administering the Government that the
						smartest and most learned white man has; and none but a fool or a traitor
						would favor such a scheme as thatn. I ain't much in favor of Impartial
						Suffrage myself. Too many ornry cusses vote now, that don't know what they
						are doin' when they give their vote. If this wasn't so, the people would
						never have put their foot in it so badly as to vote war, conscription, and
						everlastin' taxation, high prices, and poverty on themselves. But there's
						one "Impartial" I go for. I go for Impartial Taxation. I'm tired seein old
						Hunks strutiin' about like a turkey gobbler, with his fifty thousand dollars
						in hand which don't pay any tax, while all the poor men and poor women in
						the country are taxed on all the property they have, and work their very
						lives out to raise money topay these taxes. I'm tired of that. I would
						rather repudiate the whole concern than to put up with this sort of thing
						any longer. The debt ain't honest any how. Three-forths of it was made up of
						stealings that went into the pockets of Yankee manufacturers, and
						contractors. It was paid for condemned guns, and shoddy blankets, and wooden
						soled shoes, and hte rest went into the pockets of thieving quarter-masters
						and defaulting paymasters.--That's what's the matter. But even if the
						principle must be paid, and if the bondholders aintt to be taxed, I've been
						calculatin', and I make out, one way and another, puttin' the whole
						together, these shaves get abot twenty-four per cent. You see it comes in
						this way! A great deal of this debt was made when a gold dollar was worth
						three paper dollars. A fellow had ten thousand dollars in gold. he would buy
						for this $30,000 in Government bonds, on which he gets 6 percent in gold.
						Six per cent in gold is worth to-day eight per cent in paper, eight per cent
						on $30,000 amounts to $2,400. this is the annual interest which the holder
						gets on his original investment of $10,000. In other words, we ar now, as a
						matter of fact, paying twenty-four per cent on a debt which is three-fourths
						a fraud! I don't think we can do a devil of a sight better without Imperial
						Taxation. I may be wrong; but that's the way I look at it; and, since Andy
						Johnson's been President, its pretty generally admitted that every man has a
						right to his own opinion.</p>
					<p>There's a fellow over in England by the name of John Bright--a sort of John
						Bull Josh Giddings,--who wants Impartial Suffrage for the coal-heavers, and
						stevedores, and navies, and sich like, who have no more business with a vote
						than a child has with one of Colt's Revolvers, and all the Black Republicans
						in America are hurrahing for John Bright! This looks "Impartial," too--don't
						it? When these very same fellows who are dyin' to see votes given to men who
						were never entitled to vote and not fit fer it, deny it to the intelligent,
						brave, and noble men of the South, whose votes, and wisdom, and patriotism,
						in conjunction with the same attributes in the North before the days of
						Black Republicanism, made this the most powerful and glorious government on
						earth! I go for Impartiality of old genuine sort; but this Black Republican
						Impartiality is bogus, and I don't want anything whatsoever to do with it.
						That's so. I'm a plain man, and say what I think in a plain way.--<emph
