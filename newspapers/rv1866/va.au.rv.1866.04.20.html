<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Continuing controversy surrounding an incident first described in the April
                    6 issue of the Vindicator in which a teacher at the local Freedmen's School, Mr.
                    Scott, was seen walking down the street with a black woman. Mr. Tukey, the
                    Assistant Superintendent of the Freedmen's Bureau, responds to the editor in

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In our issue of the 5th inst., we took occasion to notice what seemed to us
                        an extraordinary exhibition of gallantry on the part of a teacher in the
                        "Freedmen's School," in escorting a colored woman down one of our principle
                        streets. The teacher, objecting to our article, handed us what he stated to
                        be an explanation, which being of a character to provoke further controversy
                        we declined to publish, but deeming it but right to give him the benefit of
                        explaining the occurrence thro' the same channel in which it had been
                        noticed, and notifying him of our views, he wrote an explanation which we
                        published, giving him the full benefit thereof, without one word of comment
                        on our part. We thought that we had done all that justice and fairness
                        required at our hands, but it seems that the Ass't Sup't of the Freedmen's
                        Bureau does not agree with us, and has handed us another communication on
                        this subject.</p>
                    <p>We do not deem it incumbent on us to publish this communication, but, since
                        Mr. Tukey has shown a disposition to act with fairness to our people and
                        feels called upon to notice this affair, we give it an insertion. But in
                        inserting Mr. Tukey's article we also feel called upon to prevent any
                        erroneous impressions it might make. Our article was not headed
                        "Miscegenation in Staunton." That our article was personal we do not deny,
                        for the occurrence in our view justified it and we intended it so to be. We
                        knew of what we wrote, and the fact of the gallantry exhibited, as we
                        described it, viz. that the teacher came down on one side of the street side
                        by side with the negro woman, pointed the way, when she hesitated, and
                        walked across the street with her, and having reached the other side, in a
                        very gallant manner gave her the inside of the pavement, has not been
                        controverted, nor even sought to be palliated, and surely the want of a hymn
                        book on the part of the woman is no excuse for the scene witnessed by us.
                        Mr. Tukey seems to think that under the circumstances the teacher did
                        nothing improper, and that he would have acted precisely as the teacher did.
                        Of this we need not speak, but we will say, that if the two intelligent and
                        influential citizens, spoken of, had witnessed the specimen of gallantry, as
                        we did, they would be far from saying that they would have acted as did the
                        teacher, and should they  ever act thus we
                        promise them that they shall be handled with gloves off. </p>
                    <p>As to Mr, Tukey's belief of what the Editor would have done, placed in the
                        same circumstances attendant on this case, an entire uprooting of our
                        sentiments and feelings, an utter abnegation of [MISSING LINES] this case,
                        an entire uprooting of our sentiments and feelings, an utter abnegation of
                        self and self-respect, and a total disregard of the sentiments and feelings,
                        an utter abnegation of self and self-respect, and a total disregard of the
                        feelings and sentiments of the communi- at large, ere we could be quite so
                        gallant.</p>
                    <p>Before this occurrence, we had been led to regard the teacher very favorably,
                        from the fact that, in one instance which came to our knowledge, he would
                        not permit his pupils to do an act calculated to wound the feelings of our
                        people, and from his remarks since are charitable enough to give him the
                        benefit of the assertion that he did not think that he was doing any thing
                        wrong, (though at the time, after signs of disapprobation were shown, he
                        acted in a manner which we characterized as with a "brazen effrontery,") yet
                        that he did act in such a manner as to disgust every witness of the affair,
                        and would not be sanctioned as proper by the two intelligent gentlemen, or
                        even Mr. Tukey himself, had he witnessed it, we do not hesitate to assert.
                        With this brief statement, we publish the communication in another column,
                        not that justice requires us to publish it, after giving publicity to Mr.
                        Scott's explanation without comment, but from the fact that Mr. Tukey has
                        been actuated by a spirit of fairness to our people and desires its
                        insertion.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since the passage of the Civil Rights bill over the President's veto, we have
                        expected daily to hear of some more monstrous proposition about to be acted
                        upon. With the spirit and letter of the constitution violated by this bill
                        and the rights of all the States invaded, it seems but natural to expect
                        other violations of that instrument and more rights to be wrested from the
                        States. We are now threatened with two things, the Negro Suffrage bill and
                        the District of Columbia, which if passed is but a stepping stone to the
                        passage of a general negro suffrage bill, equally as constitutional as to
                        declare the negro a citizen, which is done by the Civil Rights bill; and
                        that the Committee of Fifteen have at last agreed upon a plan for the
                        reconstruction of the Southern States, which will be presented to both
                        Houses at an early day and a two-thirds vote is confidently expected. Why is
                        a two-thirds vote desired unless it is different in spirit from President
                        Johnson's policy? He surely would not veto it if it is constitutional, and a
                        majority is all that is necessary to carry it through. From the desire for a
                        two-thirds vote on the plan of the Committee we suspect it is not all it
                        should be, but that it may bear in it more humiliation than of
                        reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>We have been, as we said, threatened  only for the
                        past week. May it end in threats for many weeks to come. Since the
                        banishment of King Alchohol from the walls of the Capitol and the healthy
                        signs given by the Northern Masses in their late municipal elections, the
                        heated, feverish condition of some members has cooled, and we trust, with
                        the abatement of the fever heat, reason will again be allowed to resume her
                        sway, and legislation for the whole country take the place of the partizan
                        measures, which have excited the people and wearied their patience for many
                        months. </p>

                    <p>Editor of the Staunton Vindicator; <br></p>
                    <p>Dear Sir:-Having seen in your issue of 5th inst,
                        an article headed "Miscegenation in Staunton," and thinking that it
                        contained a greater degree of personality and unfairness towards the
                        gentleman spoken of, than was called for by the circumstances, I waited
                        until a second issue to see if upon sober thought justice would not be done;
                        finding it was not done, I have thought it proper to say, on behalf of the
                        family, that while we all expect to hold ourselves subject to the criticisms
                        of the community in which we live and are willing to be governed by the
                        ordinary usages of its society, yet we claim, and not
                            only claim, but think we have a right to demand, when such
                        criticisms are to be made, first, that the party making them shall have full
                        knowledge of the facts as to which he speaks; second, that they shall be
                        stated in a fair and impartial manner and that they be divested of that
                        personality of tone and manner, which, in polite society, is always regarded
                        as inconsistent with the dignity and character of a gentleman. </p>
                    <p>In reference to the particular case under consideration,--that of a teacher
                        of the Freedmens' Schools, I have only to say , that after hearing his
                        explanation of the circumstances, I am of opinion that I should have done
                        precisely as he did;--a sentiment which, I think, would be concurred in by a
                        large number of the intelligent, reflecting portion of the community; in
                        fact, I have been informed by two intelligent and influential citizens, that
                        they had no doubt they would have acted in a similar manner; one of them,
                        who holds a high official position informs me that he has done so, many
                        times during the past six months; indeed, so far from being an event of
                        unusual occurrence, or calling for extraordinary comment by the Editor, I am
                        constrained to the belief that had the Editor 
                        himself been placed in the same circumstances, he would have done precisely
                        as the Teacher  did; that is, allow a colored
                        woman who called on him on business, to walk with him to his office. </p>
                    <p>Preferring to have my conduct speak for itself, rather than to have it a
                        subject for defence in the public press, I am led to these remarks, not from
                        any desire to evoke a controversy, or from a spirit of captious criticism,
                        but simply from that sense of justice and fairness, which I conceive to be
                        essential at this time in promoting sentiments of forbearance and
                        moderation, so desirable to all parties. <br></p>
                    <p>Very Respectfuly, &amp;c.,</p>
                    <p>F. S. TUKEY,</p>
                    <p>Asst. Sup't B. R. F. &amp; A. L.</p>
