<b>A Conversation With President Johnson</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"A gentleman who had a free conversation with President Johnson" outlines
					the President's views on various issues associated with Reconstruction.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Origin of Article: </font>Boston Commercial</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>We find the following in the Boston Commercial. It contains some facts
					for serious consideration among thinking men.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>A gentleman who had a free conversation with President Johnson, a short time
						since, informs us that he found him hopeful, in good spirits and
						unhesitating in the expression of his views. He does not anticipate anything
						like a democratic majority in the next House of Representatives, though the
						number of representatives of that party will doubtless be considerably
						increased. But he does count confidently on the return of a majority of
						moderate men, who will be prepared to deal with the people of the South, as
						all honorable and high minded nations deal with their antagonists after
						having beaten and disarmed them. And in districts and States where the
						republican party fail to nominate such men he things democratic candidates
						will be likely in a majority of cases to be voted over radicals.</p>
					<p>The President is unhesitatingly of the opinion that the only safety of the
						nation lies in a generous and expansive plan of conciliation, and the longer
						this is delayed the more difficult will it be to bring the North and the
						South into harmony. If the suspicious, tyrannical policy is too long
						pursued, the population of the South will become hostile in time to the
						North as the people of Ireland are towards England, adding to this evil of
						hereditary and growing animosity an ability for revenge a hundred fold
						greater than Ireland possesses.</p>
					<p>In regard o the blacks, the President says they will find work enough, and
						for many years to come probably better remuneration than any other class of
						agricultural laborers in the country. The competition of capitalists and
						land owners will insure good treatment and good pay from the planters. That
						there will be much disorder is to be expected; but there will be no more
						than there would be at the North were the number of black laborers
						sufficiently numerous to enter into serious rivalry with the white laborers.</p>
					<p>The President is confident that nothing can be safely and permanently done in
						regard to restoring the currency, diminishing taxation, and establishing the
						prosperity of the country on a sound and enduring basis until
						representatives from all the States are present in Congress. The idea of
						legislating for one third of the population of the county, and passing
						constitutional amendments without allowing them any voice in the matter or
						paying any attention to their wishes, is full of danger to the future peace
						and welfare of the nation. They cannot be treated as a subjugated people or
						as vassal colonies without a germ of hatred being introduced, out a germ of
						hatred being introduced, which will some day or other, though the time may
						be distant, develop mischief of the most serious character.</p>
					<p>With regard to the basis of representation he denounces this as a mere
						bugbear. It cannot and will not be permanently settled until all the States
						are representatives in consequence of the emancipation of the slaves can in
						any event occur until the census of 1870 is taken, until which time of
						course the three-fifths provision is in force under the last census. There
						is, therefore, ample time to settle this matter between now and 1870, and it
						is unwise to agitate it until other matters which cannot be delayed are
						settled.</p>
					<p>The President does not admit that he has been inconsistent. He is as much
						opposed to treason and traitors as ever he was, and for punishing them
						severely. But there is no treason and no traitors now. The enemy has fully
						and fairly surrendered and is powerless, and a foe thus situated should be
						magnanimously treated. A generous and self-reliant warrior always restores
						his disarmed enemy his sword and trusts his parole of honor.</p>
					<p>The idea of muzzling the press and tying the tongues of the people of the
						South, after the manner of the suspicious tyrants and the Holy Inquisition
						of the Old World, he denounces as absurd. A people should be allowed a
						grumble who have suffered so much and they would be unworthy the name of men
						if they did not respect the brave officers who have suffered with them, and
						honor the memory of their gallant dead who sleep on a hundred battle-fields
						around their homes.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses relief that Congress has adjourned and hope that "men who endorse
					the Johnsonian policy" will soon "expose the vile course in Congress."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Congress of the United States, after endeavoring to adjourn, subject to
						calls for re-assembling other than that of the President, did at last
						adjourn sine die, on Saturday 28th ult. We are
						sure that the conservatives of the whole country rejoice that this body of
						men, whose whole course of legislation, from the first Monday in December
						last to July 28th, has had but one single object 
						in view, the retention of power in the hands of the Radical Republicans, has
						adjourned without a day. </p>
					<p>They have sought in every possible way to harass the people of the South with
						a view to political capital, and have opposed, assailed and abused the
						President in his endeavors to restore the country to its former prosperous
						condition, and to preserve the Constitution intact, and all to secure the
						return of a radical majority to Congress. Finding that at every turn, they
						have been met by the President, holding aloft the banner of the Union and
						the Constitution, and rallying around him the patriot masses of the country,
						they have betaken themselves to other fields to speak, write and work for
						radical success. Let loose upon the Northern people, with all their
						retainers, they will introduce into the canvass in their respective States
						an unwonted excitement, and will, by the aid of the distorted and false
						testimony before the "Reconstruction Committee," the lying reports of
						mercenary scribblers throughout the South, and the base co-operation of Jack
						Hamilton, et id omne genus, endeavor to fire the
						already excited Northern mind with a rage and malice, to which their
						exhibition in Congress of the noble attributes has been but feeble child's
						play. </p>
					<p>They will be met, however, by men who endorse the Johnsonian policy, who
						really love their country and revere the Constitution, and who will, with
						unsparing hand, expose their vile course in Congress, and paint in
						unmistakable colors on the retina the Northern eye the grossly
						unconstitutional acts of the last National Legislature. If the Northern
						people can be brought to look without prejudice upon the acts of the now
						dominant faction, their fate is sealed. At any rate we shall hope for the
						success of the men who sympathize with the policy of President Johnson, and
						who would preserve the Constitution and restore the Union, with the equality
						of the States unimpaired.</p>

					<p>The Pennsylvania Democratic campaign was opened with most favorable
						prospects, at Reading, Pennsylvania, on the 18th ult. There were over 30,000
						persons present.-The spectacle of the New York
						Tribune and Times  and the Philadelphia Age assert that it was "one of the
						largest political meetings ever assembled in Pennsylvania," and the World , correspondent expressed surprise to find
						Mr. Clymer, the Democratic candidate for Governor, "extremely popular with
						the Conservative men and personally liked by his opponents, who say that he
						was the very strongest man the Democracy could have chosen." </p>
					<p>One of the prominent features of the occasion was a Soldiers' Clymer Club, a
						local organization, one thousand strong. On their banners were the following
						inscriptions.</p>
					<p>"The boys in blue repudiate the hero of Snickersville."</p>
					<p>"We vote as we fought (Solders' Club,) for the Union and the Constitution."
						"Old Northampton-3,500 majority for Clymer," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
					<p>Although eight stands were erected, they were found insufficient, and
						speeches were made at various other points. Among the chief speakers, were
						Hon. Heister Clymer, Hon. Montgomery Blair and Hon. Geo. H. Pendleton. When
						Mr. Pendleton was introduced he received an ovation and the enthusiasm is
						said to have been so intense that for full ten minutes after cheer after
						cheer greeted the distinguished Ohioan. It was acknowledged by all parties
						to have been a grand affair. May it be but a feeble indication of the
						"ground-swell" which shall hurl the Radicals from power, forever, not only
						in the "Old Keystone State," but in the country.</p>
