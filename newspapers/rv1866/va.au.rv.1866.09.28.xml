                    <p>Brownlow was among the first to raise the cry of another war and, in terms as
                        execrable as ever, emanated from his demoniac brain, to call for the
                        extermination of the Southern people. Forney, the "Dead Duck," takes up the
                        cry, and says that the next army that marches South "will go there to stay,"
                        not only "to revenge but to exterminate." Brownlow and Forney both know that
                        the Southern people are as brave as any people under the sun, and have acted
                        as honorably in defeat as they were daring in the contest; that they have
                        done all that has been asked of them to show that they have accepted the
                        result of the late war and intend to abide by it in good faith. Yet these
                        fiends in human shape, for the purpose of keeping alive a sectional
                        hostility, for a reason which can not be concealed, and to arouse again the
                        passions of the North against the South, speak of the threatened contest as
                        "between the South and North." That man must singular indeed that does not
                        fear a collision, under certain circumstances, but not "between the South
                        and North."--We are but a silent speculators of the passing events in this
                        country, with no voice in its affairs, calmly awaiting the time when reason
                        and justice shall accord us rights and privileges now unjustly denied, with
                        no power to enforce them, much less to wage another war against the
                        undamaged North.--Without the desire even to engage in another struggle we
                        are charged with it and are threatened in consequences with a bloody
                        extermination. The collision, if it comes, must be between the men of the
                        North who are striving to restore the Constitution and the Union in good
                        faith and those fanatics, who, to glut a vengeance still unsatisfied, would
                        override the Constitution, and destroy forever all hopes of a Union by again
                        saturating the land with blood.</p>
                    <p>We have great faith in the men of the North who have, through the trials of
                        the past, continued to cry aloud for the preservation of the Constitution
                        intact and who, together with those men who were carried away by the
                        excitement of war and forgot for a time the existence of that instrument are
                        now banding together with Andrew Johnson to preserve it and the Union, and
                        believe if proper exertions are made by them in the Middle and Western
                        States the fell fiend of war will be turned from our shores. However, if
                        fanaticism receives the sanction of these States in the forthcoming
                        elections the collision is likely, but between Conservatism and Radicalism
                        and not between any two sections of the country. We of the South have no
                        desire even to see a conflict of arms between the Conservatives and the
                        Radicals, and certainly not to bring about one between ourselves and any
                        other section. But silent in our sorrows and unrepresented in our interests
                        we can afford to smile at such malicious efforts as Forney and Brownlow are
                        making to excite Northern passions against us, and need fear but little from
                        such blatant blusterers, knowing well that, if left with them, and those
                        their ilk, they will never attempt to put into execution their extermination
                        programme.</p>
