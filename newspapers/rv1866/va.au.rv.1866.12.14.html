<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>With Congress back in session, several "prominent subjects" will take

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Congress assembled on the 3rd inst., and has mostly been engaged in preparing
						business for the session. The prominent subjects which seem to engross their
						attention at present are, "The resolving the Southern States into a
						territorial condition"--the repeal of the 13th section of the Act of July
						17th 1862, authorizing the President by proclamation, to extend amnesty and
						pardon to persons who had engaged in the rebellion; a general national
						Bankrupt law, and the ratification of the Constitutional Amendment, which is
						to be insisted upon before Congress may take up
						the subject of of amnesty. These are all questions in which we feel an
						interest, but over which those eminently hostile to us have a vast control.
						They are all questions, likewise, which induce an inquiry as to their
						constitutionality. How far the written Constitution of our country may
						restrain the action of Congress would not be difficult to predict, judging
						from the past acts of this body.--But, however it may be ignored to carry
						out the diabolical schemes of an unbridled and dominant radicalism, we can
						at least console ourselves that we had nothing to do with it. While we had a
						voice in the affairs of the nation our boast was our great reverence for the
						Constitution and the Government of our Fathers. When we attempted separation
						we carried our reverence for that instrument with us and reiterated its
						principles in the Constitution which was to be our chart and guide. Let all
						else be said, we can never be accused of a want of reverence for the
						Constitution. And when its principles are effaced, as destiny seems to
						foreshadow, as we boasted of our efforts to preserve it pure and inviolate
						when we had power, and mourn over the disregard of its teachings, so our
						greatest consolation will be that we had hand in its destruction, but,
						powerless, protested against the great wrong to the Republic and its coming
						generations.</p>

<b>Local Items</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Booten vs. Scheffer. This was a Bill in Equity, alleging that the Plt'ff
					was owner of one moiety of the Va. Hotel property, seeking a recovery of rents
					and profits of said property while in possession of the Def't, and for a
					division of the property by sale. The Def't contested the Plt'ff's alleged
					claims, on the grounds that he was the purchaser of the whole property instead
					of one half as asserted by the Plt'ff. A decree was rendered sustaining the
					Defendant as the purchaser and owner of the entire property, and directing an
					account to ascertain the unpaid balance of purchase money thereon. Brown,
					Lanigan &amp; Co. vs. Forrer, Milnes &amp; als. This was suit in
					Chancery, seeking to compel the specific execution of a contract for the sale of
					the "Shenandoah Iron Works," in Page County, Va., at the price of $240,000 by
					the Defendants, the Messrs. Forrer, to the Plaintiffs. The pretensions of the
					Plt'ffs were resisted by the Messrs. Forrer, and by Milnes &amp; Co., who
					had subsequently become purchasers of said Iron Works, on the ground that the
					Plt'ffs had not complied with the contract entered into by them with the Messrs.
					Forrer. The evidence in this case was very voluminous, and the case very ably
					argued, for several days by Messrs. Michie and Stuart for Plt'ffs, and Messrs.
					Baldwin, Echols and Menifer for the Defendants. On Tuesday, a decree was
					rendered in favor of the Defendants, thereby settling the main points in
					controversy and quieting the Messrs. Milnes &amp; Co., the last purchasers,
					in the possession of this very valuable property. Cochran's Adm'r vs. Echard,
					and a number of similar cases. These cases, all, seek a recovery, from the
					several Defendants, of money on obligations given during the war, when
					Confederate States Treasury notes were almost exclusively the circulating medium
					in this county. These various cases were resisted by the Defendants, on the
					ground that such obligations were given with the view of payment in Confederate
					Treasury note. The parties submitted the questions in issue to the Court in
					preference to Juries. The Court gave a very lengthy and able opinion on the
					whole subject, in which so many persons are interested, which we expect to
					publish in a short time. Substantially the holder of the obligation under this
					decision, recovers in amount the value of the Confederate Treasury notes at the
					date of contract, with interest. The Circuit Court adjourned on the 11th inst.,
					having been in session continuously from the 1st day of November last. A special
					term of the Court is appointed for the 9th of January next. Hon. H. W. Sheffey,
					Judge of this Circuit, leaves to day for Abingdon to attend the District Court
					(of Appeals) to commence its sessions at that place on the 15th inst.<br>(Names in announcement:   Booten,   Sheffer,   Brown,   Lanigan,   Forrer,   Milnes,   Michie,   Stuart,   Baldwin,   Echols,   Menifer,   Cochran,   Echard, Justice H. W. Sheffey)</blockquote>
