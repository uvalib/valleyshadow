                <summary>Speculating as to why the number of young men who "turn out badly" seems to
                    be growing, the article attributes the phenomenon to "the spirit of false pride
                    which induces parents to put their boys in stores and offices rather than to
                    apprentice them to good trade."</summary>

                    <p>In these times, when the great safe-guards of the Constitution and Government
                        of our country, intended to protect the small and weaker States from the
                        aggressions of the larger and more powerful are lost sight of in the frenzy
                        of Norhern or Radical supremacy, when the great principle of States rights
                        has been swept aside by the voice of the North to make way for Federal
                        dominance on all questions, not for the sake of perpetuating the principles
                        of Republican Government, but rather to perpetuate the power of a ruling
                        faction, representing far less than one-half of the body-politic of the
                        country, it becomes a question of importance to the Southern people what to
                        do. We can and should expect nothing from this ruling faction. It is
                        therefore a patent fact that the South must reach forth its hands for no
                        extraneous help but must carve out its future for itself. Can she do this?
                        With scarcely no desire to meddle with the present fruitless schemes of
                        politics, which, whatever we do, seem to produce extra burdens for us to
                        carry, the South is in the best possible mood to accomplish her true
                        destiny. Within her broad borders she has a most productive country
                        abounding in inexhaustible mineral resources and supplied with the finest
                        water-power in the world. It now remains for her to take advantage of what
                        nature has placed within her reach.--She must produce to the utmost extent
                        of her capacity. She must delve in the bosom of mother earth for her hidden
                        treasures and, not content with bringing them to the surface she must make
                        use of her vast water-power and construct at home the various mechanical
                        contrivances so needfulin recuperating our devastated and depleted
                        section.--We must lay asided the idea of commencing largely at present with
                        abundant capital, not at our command, but begin in a small way and increase
                        our manufacturing facilities as the demand requires. Thus will we lay the
                        foundation sure of future prosperity, furnishing a large field for skilled
                        labor, an invitation to capital and immigration that can not be withstood, a
                        ready market at home for a vast proportion of our articles of production and
                        the circulation of our means, obtained largely from abroad, within
                        ourselves, without being necessitated to purchase as at present from those
                        who by their words are professed friends, bu tby their acts show themselves
                        to be our malignant and unrelenting enemies. The degrading conditions sought
                        to be imposed by the North on us, and the taxation on some of our staple
                        products, which furnishes a vast stimulus to their production elswhere, may
                        be productive of greater good than we have heretofore anticipated. If it
                        cause us to turn our attention to ourselves and our future, and force us to
                        make use of hte advantage we possess, then what was intended as a curse will
                        be a blessing indeed. No people under the sun were ever urged on to do by
                        such a stimulus as we are.</p>
                    <p>Let us then foster each and every project among us by our influence and our
                        patronage and the depleted South of to-day will ere long not only exhibit an
                        unwanted progress due to an untiring energy which she possesses, though long
                        derided as devoid of, but by the potent influence of prosperity will demand
                        that consideration, which she must otherwise, now and for years to come,
                        seek in vain in the muddy pool of party politics.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>At the commmencement of the late war there was a very large party in the
                        North opposed to the coercion of the sovereign States of the South. The
                        larger party in the North, however, favored coercion, and the party opposed
                        gradually yielded their convictions on the subject until but a small portion
                        of them were left, the larger portion by far joining in the cry for the
                        forcible preservation of the Union as loudly as the most out and out
                        coercionists. The latter gained their point and compelled the South to
                        submit. This being accomplished, the question of the status of the Southern
                        States gave rise to a dvision among the Northern people, the larger portion
                        demanding guarantees from the Southern States unjust and humiliating, while
                        the anti-coercionists, in the main, contended as strongly for the return of
                        those States to the Union with their rights and privileges unimpaired under
                        the Constitution as it was. This question decided by the voice of the North
                        in the late election in favor of additional and unconstitutional guarantees,
                        and by a large majority, has had the effect of again causing some of the
                        most persistent to yield their convictions. They now advise the South to
                        accept the terms held out by the radicals, on the ground that these or more
                        stringent terms will be forced upon us. It were better they say for us to
                        accept voluntarily these conditions than to be forced to do so. We are
                        thankful to the many conservative men of the North for the bold and manly
                        stand they have taken on the side of the contitution and in opposition to
                        unconstitutional guarantees, and humiliating conditions of restoraion, and
                        we are disposed to receive their advice as of well wishing friends. We,
                        however, have seen them yield principle in the first instance and rank
                        themselves with their political opponents in the cry against us, and if they
                        again do so we may not disappointed, but they must excuse us from acting on
                        their advice when they forsake their principles and pursue a course, purely
                        from policy and at which their feelings must revolt.</p>
                    <p>If we are compelled to accept such conditions as the dominant North may
                        dictate we can not help ourselves, but as for placing a brand on our own
                        foreheads, voluntarily with our own hands, we can not think of it for a
                        moment.</p>
                    <p>From those of our Northern friends who remain true to principle we would be
                        glad to receive advice, but for the sake of consistency, if nothing else, we
                        beseech those who have sided with the majority not to tender advice, as
                        friends, to those whom they have deserted in their direct moments. From all
                        such friends we can but exclaim, "Good Lord, deliver us!"</p>

                <summary>In light of the Republicans' overwhelming victory in the late elections,
                    northern conservatives have called on white southerners "to accept the terms
                    held out by the radicals" because, if they do not, they will be forced to accept
                    even more stringent conditions. Though appreciative of the "bold and manly"
                    stand taken by northern conservatives, the editors lament that they cannot

                <summary>The case of John Spitler vs. Jas. E. Carson for assault and battery
                    produced a split decision: Carson was fined $250 and Spitler $80. The judge
                    overruled the judgement against Carson because of a lack of evidence.</summary>
