                    <p>About seventeen years ago, there was a fair girl, so pure, so lovely, so
                        refined, that she rises to my mind, as almost akin to angels. She was wooed
                        and ultimately won by handsome young man of considerable wealth. He sported
                        a fine team, delighted in hunting, and kept a pack of hounds.-He neither
                        played cards, drank wine, nor used tobacco. He had no occupation, no
                        calling, no trade. He lived on his money, the interest of which would have
                        supported a man handsomely. I never saw the fair bride till a few days ago.
                        Seventeen years had passed away, and then her beauty and her youth, her
                        husband's fortune, and his life, during the latter part of which they lived
                        in a log cabin on the banks of the Ohio, near Blennerbassett's Island-a
                        whole family in one single room, subsisting on water, fat bacon and corn
                        bread. The husband had no business capacity. He was a gentleman of
                        education, of refinement, of noble impulse; but when his money was gone he
                        could get no employment, simply because he did not know how to do anything.
                        For awhile he floundered about-first trying one thing, then another; failure
                        was written on them all.</p>
                    <p>He, however, finally obtained a situation; the labor was great, the
                        compensation was small-it was that or starvation. In his heroic efforts to
                        discharge his duties acceptably, he over-worked himself and died, leaving
                        his widow and six little children in utter destitution. In seventeen years,
                        the sweet and joyous and beautiful girl had become a broken-hearted,
                        care-worn, poverty-stricken widow, with a house full of children.</p>
                    <p>Young woman! if a rich young man asks you to marry him, and has no
                        occupation, or trade, or calling by which he can make a living if he were
                        thrown upon his own resources, you may give him your respects, but give him
                        the mitten.-<emph rend="italic">Dr. Hall</emph>. </p>

                    <p>Since our last issue the <emph rend="italic">so-called</emph> Convention of
                        the Union Republican Party of Virginia met in Alexandria and adjourned. It
                        was composed, according to the Washington Chronicle of eighty members,
                        pretending to represent only <emph rend="italic">ten </emph> counties out of
                            <emph rend="italic">one hundred</emph>. Of the number, <emph
                            rend="italic">twenty-six</emph> were from the city of Alexandria and
                            <emph rend="italic">forty-one </emph> from the adjoining county of
                        Fairfax, leaving only thirteen representatives of the remaining eight
                        counties. We have heard of no meetings to select delegates to this so-called
                        Convention and presume that, like Botts and the delegates from Lynchburg and
                        Rockingham, the vast majority of the members were self-constituted delegates
                        and represented no body but themselves. In truth it seems to have been
                        gotten up entirely on the selfish principle, and its resolutions and doings
                        bear the unmistakable mark of self-aggrandizement. For the purpose of
                        getting possession of the State Government and offices, they would
                        enfranchise the negro and disfranchise the whites who disagreed with them
                        during the war. The resolution to this effect is singularly inconsistent
                        with another passed, which declares "that if any considerable portion of the
                        community is denied a vote in elections, that portion of the people will be
                        denied such perfect protection as ought to exist in the rights of person and
                        property." The one would disfranchise a large portion of community while the
                        other sanctions their right to vote. These may have been intended to secure
                        the endorsation of the President and Congress (as set forth in another
                        resolution,) by eliding the radical resolution in one case and the
                        conservative (if w emay so term it) in the other. Without such an
                        arrangement it would be difficult to "ride both sides of the sapling," as
                        the Convention desired, by securing the endorsation of the President and
                        Congress. Viewed in any other light than as a strategic movement against
                        both Congress and the President, these resolutions, as do the others, show a
                        want of brain and purpose not to be equaled by an assemblage of men in any
                        community, "without regard to color,: and exhibit the so-called Convention
                        of the Union Republican Party of Virginia as the greatest farce of the day. </p>
                    <p>This is the last, in all probability, that will ever be heard of the Union
                        Republican Party of Virginia, and we suggest as a suitable epitaph, "Born to
                        satiate an inordinate selfish appetite, it died of Botts."</p>

                    <p>We publish below a few more statements from the signers and pretended signers
                        of the Dews-Todd petition. <lb/></p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Mr. Editor</emph>:--In your last issue I noticed a
                        petition presented to Congress by a number of the citizens of Augusta
                        County, and was surprised to find my name in the list.-That petition I never
                        saw until it appeared in your paper. The facts are these. Sometime in the
                        month of January, Mr. R. T. Whitlock came to my house and made some inquiry
                        respecting the loss I sustained during the war. He said, to receive any
                        thing from the authorities at Washington, it would be necessary for me to
                        enrol myself as a Union man, on a paper to be found in Mr. Dews' office, as
                        none would be paid except such as were found registered there. I replied
                        that I did not know that I would pass muster as a Union man. I thought I
                        would pass a conservative as I had taken no part in any election from the
                        time Virginia seceded to the election in 1865, and had done nothing but
                        detailed service and by substitute, but if putting my name there would get
                        pay for my horses taken by the Yankees I would do it, as I did not consider
                        it any more inconsistent, than to see a Confederate officer and a Yankee
                        riding together, which I had seen in Staunton. He said nothing about a
                        petition asking for armed soldiers to protect horse-thieves and
                        corn-stealers, which class it appears, gives Mr. Dews more trouble than the
                        Superintendent of the Freedmen's Bureau has with all the little negroes. It
                        so happened that I was in Staunton on the first day of the March Court, and
                        went to Mr. Dews' office and asked for the paper containing the names of
                        Conservative or Union men, glanced over it and saw the names of several
                        persons I knew, I put down my name in the presence of no one in particular
                        and went out. It was near the bottom of the list-not at the top as in this
                        petition. Some one has put it there. </p>
                    <p>Why, sir, while I was a faithful supporter of the old Government and hope to
                        be of the new, if the work of re-construction don't end in destruction, yet
                        I would be the last man in the world to pray Congress to send a pack of
                        blue-devils here, if such as I have seen (a few officers excepted) is a
                        sample. They looked as if hell had been raked with a fine toothed comb and
                        their service is as little needed here now as before the war. If I had my
                        way with the Yankees that took my horses during Hunter's raid-June 1864-in
                        place of praying Congress to send them here I would ask Congress to send
                        them to the Infernal Regions and placed under the command of "Old Nick" that
                        they might snuff brimstone through the cracks of the bottomless pits through
                        the endless ages of eternity.</p>

                        day voluntarily appeared before me and made oath that he was solicited to
                        sign a petition setting forth that threats were being made against the lives
                        of loyal men, that neither justice nor protection could be obtained at the
                        hands of the officers of the civil law or through the civil courts and
                        asking the return of troops to this point to obtain the same, and that
                        affiant did this under an entire misapprehension of its meaning, it never
                        having been explained to him, that he has seen an affidavit made by one
                        James Todd, to the effect that affiant singed said petition in his presence.
                        So far from this being the fact, affiant has not seen Mr. Todd to speak to
                        him for the space of four or five years, and has not otherwise had any
                        communication with him upon any subject that affiant now declares that no
                        threats are being made against any person on account of his or their
                        sentiments, or to his knowledge have been made heretofore, that he believes
                        that he believes justice and protection can be obtained through the civil
                        courts and at the hands of the civil officers by all classes of persons in
                        this community without regard to past or present opinions, and that there is
                        no necessity for the return of the troops to this community to furnish
                        protection or afford justice to any class of our people whatever, and that
                        affiant believes one Wm. J. Dews was the solicitor for his name to the paper
                        referred to, and I further certify that this statement under oath, was made
                        before me at the request of affiant and of his own accord, having applied to
                        me for the purpose.</p>

                        signers to a petition which you published week before last. It is due to
                        myself that the matter should be explained. Having had some property pressed
                        and desiring to get pay for the same I was told by Wm. J. Dews that the
                        matter would have to go before a military court and it would be necessary to
                        enrol myself as a Union man. This and this only, I thought I was doing and
                        was surprised to see it attached to a petition with the statements of which,
                        from reading I disagree, in ever particular, and did not believe that I was
                        signing such a paper and never would have signed it had I known its purport. </p>

                        interests of the loyal citizens, "so-called," of this county, I take this
                        method to inform the public that I never signed any such paper, nor did I
                        authorize any one to do so for me, and furthermore that I never was
                        solicited to do so by any one. As Messrs. Tedd and Dews have made affidavit
                        to the statement that all the names to said petition were signed in their
                        presence, I deny that I signed it in their presence, or at all; and I
                        denounce them as perjurors and slanderers, and utterly unworthy the
                        confidence or esteem of any respectable community.</p>
                    <p>WM. ARMSTRONG.</p>

                        the Court is suspended until further orders, and no new cases will be tried

                        concerned, we are pleased to state that they have discharged the duties
