<b>Veto of the Civil Rights Bill</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We publish on our first page to-day, the President's veto of the Civil Rights
                        Bill. Its searching analysis of the bill, showing up its [MISSING LINES], if
                        not destroy the rights of the States will strike almost every one with
                        amazement, that even the reckless Congress with which we are cursed, in the
                        face of the veto if the Freedmen's Bureau bill, could have the hardihood to
                        pass another bill, if anything more unconstitutional, unjust, and calculated
                        to sap the foundation of our Government and destroy the liberties of our
                        people. While the partizans in Congress are thus endeavoring by every means
                        to over-ride the Constitution and subvert the policy of the Government,
                        there is some consolation to the patriotic in the land, that there is at the
                        head of affairs a man, who has the courage to oppose the mad schemes of the
                        dominant party in Congress, who seem determined to "rule or ruin" and
                        perhaps ruin if they continue to rule. The veto of this bill, from what we
                        can learn, does not displease the Conservative Republicans. The New York
                        Times (Republican) whose Editor, Mr. Raymond, is a member of Congress, thus
                        speaks of the veto:</p>
                    <p>"It may be hoped that arguments so cogent as those employment in the message
                        will not be thrown away. It is not every day that members have an
                        opportunity of listening to reason and common sense. They may find this
                        appeal a seasonable and acceptable change. Be that as it may, the
                        President's message will be read and studied outside of Congress and
                        everywhere throughout the civilized world; and wherever it is read and
                        studied, the American name and character will be elevated in so far as
                        Andrew Johnson is held to represent the American people."</p>
                    <p>The Washington correspondent of the same paper, says:</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Bingham, who is probably the ablest lawyer in the House, says that its
                        legal objections to the bill are unanswerable; but he does not attach the
                        same importance to its political positions. It shows the tenacity with which
                        the President adheres to his political convictions, and demonstrates the
                        futility of trying to coerce him into acquiescence with the radical theories
                        concerning the condition and status  of the
                        Southern States." </p>

                    <p>While many in the North seem to have an unconquerable hatred to the people of
                        the South, for their act of secession and attempt to set up for themselves,
                        in which they conscientiously believed they were right, yet we must not

                        humiliated in the extreme. There is still a number there, and not
                        inconsiderable either, who would see us restored to our old position in the
                        Union and contemn the Radicals and their policy as much as we. They are
                        acting in concert and under the same old organization called Democracy. From
                        them we get words of encouragement and cheer. Of this class are a number of
                        our northern exchanges, none of which we read with more pleasure, perhaps

                        citizens, engaged in the peaceful occupations of life, on their farms, in
                        their workshops, &amp;c. What more ought we to ask? What more can we
                        ask? Taking the oath and acting in conformity to the Constitution and laws
                        is the test of allegiance. We require nothing beyond this of Massachusetts?
                        How can we demand more of South Carolina? To do so is unreasonable; is
                        outrageously wrong. The States are all on the same footing. All are equal

                    <p>THE CONFERENCE WITH PRESIDENT LINCOLN. <br></p>
                    <p>Outside of these matters of general inquiry there is one historical episode
                        connected with the secession of Virginia and the outbreak of the rebellion,
                        on which the testimony of three witnesses was taken. This was a conference
                        sought for and held by Mr. Lincoln with a member of the Virginia Secession
                        Convention, delegated by the Union members of that body, Mr. John B.
                        Baldwin, prior to the opening of the Rebel batteries on Fort Sumter. The
                        first statement on the subject came from Mr. John F. Lewis, an
                        uncompromising Union man all through the war, and who had been himself a
                        member of the Virginia Convention. He testified [MISSING LINES] 1861, he
                        visited John Minor Botts in Richmond, and learned from him that Mr. Lincoln
                        had informed him that he had had an interview with John B. Baldwin. <br></p>
                    <p>JUDGE SUMMERS. <br></p>
                    <p>Judge Summers, for whom a special messenger had been sent, not having been
                        able to go to Washington, the Union members having delegated Mr. Baldwin,
                        and had made a proposition that if the Virginia Convention would adjourn
                        sine die [ITAL sine die], without passing an ordinance of secession, he, Mr.
                        Lincoln, would take the responsibility of withdrawing the troops from Fort
                        Sumter. Colonel Baldwin refused to accede to the proposition, and did not
                        communicate it to the Convention. Next morning, after hearing this
                        statement. Mr. Lewis prevailed on Mr. Baldwin, to accompany him to the house
                        of Mr. Botts, who repeated the statement made to him by Mr. Lincoln, and
                        asked him how in the name of God he could take the responsibility of
                        withholding the knowledge of such an interview from the Convention. Mr.
                        Baldwin looked at his watch and replied that it was then near the hour for
                        the meeting of the Convention; that he had to be there, and that he would
                        see him (Botts) again. <br></p>
                    <p>MR. BALDWIN. <br></p>
                    <p>The narrative of the same transaction given by Mr. Baldwin is this:</p>
                    <p>After relating the circumstances of a special messenger being sent to
                        Richmond by Mr. Seward, with a request that Judge Summers or some other
                        leading member should come to Washington to have a conference with Mr.
                        Lincoln; of his (Mr. Baldwin's) being sent and accompanying the member to
                        Washington on the same night; of his being introduced next morning by Mr.
                        Seward to Mr. Lincoln; of Mr. Lincoln's taking him into a private bedroom
                        that they might be the more free from interruption. He gave a narration of
                        the conversation which was opened by Mr. Lincoln's remarking, Mr. Baldwin, I
                        am afraid you have come too late.</p>
                    <p>Too late! For what?</p>
                    <p>I am afraid you have come too late, said he. I wish you could have been her
                        three or four days ago.</p>
                    <p>Why? Replied Mr. Baldwin. Allow me to say, Mr. President, that I do not
                        understand your remarks. You sent a special messenger to Richmond who
                        arrived there yesterday. I returned with him by the shortest and most
                        expeditious mode of travel known.</p>
                    <p>Why do you not adjourn the Virginia Convention?</p>
                    <p>Adjourn it! How? Do you mean sine die [ITAL sine die].</p>
                    <p>Yes, sine die [ITAL sine die]. It is a standing menace to me, which
                        embarrasses me very much.</p>
                    <p>I am very much surprised, said Mr. Baldwin, to hear you express that opinion.
                        The Virginia Convention is in the hands of Union men. We have in it a clear
                        and controlling majority; we are controlling it for conservative results. We
                        can do it with perfect certainty if you will uphold our hands by a
                        conservative policy here. If we were to adjourn sine die [ITAL sine die],
                        leaving these questions unsettled, it would place the Union men in Virginia
                        in the attitude of confessing their inability to meet the occasion. The
                        result would be that another Convention would be called, which would be
                        under the exclusive control of secessionists, and an ordinance of secession
                        would be passed in less than six weeks.-Our true policy is to hold the
                        position that we have, and for you to uphold our hands by a conservative
                        national course. The Union men in Virginia would not be willing to adjourn
                        that Convention until we either effect some settlement of the matter or
                        ascertain that it cannot be done.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin then went on to sketch out a plan of policy which he thought the
                        President should pursue, embracing a conciliatory and issuing a
                        proclamation, calling a great national convention, and the withdrawal of the
                        forces from Forts Sumter and Pickens. This was about the substance of the
                        interview Mr. Lincoln giving to Mr. Baldwin no pledge and no promise, and
                        making no offer of any sort.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Baldwin visited Mr. Seward the same afternoon, and found him extremely
                        earnest in the desire to settle the matter, and apparently, shrinking from
                        the idea of a clash of arms, Mr. Baldwin went on to Richmond and reported to
                        the gentlemen who sent him.</p>
                    <p>Further on in his testimony he added that he understood Mr. Lincoln had given
                        a somewhat different version of the interview, representing that he had
                        offered, if the Convention would adjourn sine die [ITAL sine die], to
                        withdraw the troops from Sumter and Pickens. I am as clear, said Mr.
                        Baldwin, in my recollection as it is possible to be, that he made no such
                        suggestion as I understood it, and said nothing from which I could infer it.
                        <br></p>
                    <p>VERSION OF THE HON. JOHN MINOR BOTTS. <br></p>
                    <p>Mr. John Minor Botts gave his version of the interview, as it was related to
                        him by Mr. Lincoln. He says that on Sunday afternoon, April 7, 1861, being
                        then in Washington, he received a note from Mr. Lincoln, saying that he
                        would be glad to see him during the evening, and that he went the same
                        evening to the White House and remained in consultation with Mr. Lincoln
                        from 7 o'clock until 11 o'clock, during which time Mr. Lincoln related the
                        particulars of the visit of Mr. Baldwin, substantially as follows:</p>
                    <p>"Oh! Mr. Baldwin," said Mr. Lincoln, "why did you not come sooner? I have
                        been waiting and expecting some of you gentlemen of the Convention to come
                        to me for more than a week past. I had a most important proposition to make
                        to you, and I am afraid you have come too late. However, I will make the
                        proposition now. We have in Fort Sumter, with Major Anderson, about eighty
                        men, and I learn from Major Anderson that his provisions are nearly
                        exhausted. I have not only written to Gov. Pickens, but I have sent a
                        special messenger to him to say that if he will allow Major Anderson to
                        obtain his marketing at the Charleston market, or will have it sent to him,
                        I will make no effort to provision the fort, but that if he does not do that
                        I will not permit these people to starve, and shall send a vessel he will
                        fire on an unarmed vessel. But I shall at the same time send a fleet with
                        her with instructions not to enter the harbor of Charleston unless that
                        vessel is fired into; and if she is then the fleet is enter the harbor and
                        protect her. Now, Mr. Baldwin, that fleet is lying in the harbor of New
                        York, and will sail this afternoon at 5 o'clock; and, although I fear it is
                        almost too late, yet I will submit the proposition [CORRECT proposition]
                        which I intended, when I sent for Mr. Summers. Your Convention in Richmond
                        has been sitting nearly two months, and all that they have done has been to
                        shake the rod over my head. You have recently taken a vote in the Virginia
                        Convention on the right of secession, which was rejected by ninety to
                        forty-five-a majority of two-thirds-showing the strength of the Union party
                        in that Convention. If you will go back to Richmond and get that Union
                        majority to adjourn and go home without passing the ordinance of secession,
                        so anxious am I for the preservation of the peace of this country, and to
                        save Virginia, and the other border States from going out, that I will take
                        the responsibility of evacuating Fort Sumter and take the chance of
                        negotiating with the cotton States which have already gone out."</p>
                    <p>"Well, Mr. Lincoln," inquired Mr. Botts "how did Mr. Baldwin receive that
                        proposition?"</p>
                    <p>"Sir,," said Mr. Lincoln, raising up his hands, "he would not listen to it
                        for a moment; he hardly treated me with civility.-He asked me what I meant
                        by an adjournment. Did I mean an adjournment sine die [ITAL sine die]? Why,
                        of course. Mr. Baldwin said, I mean an adjournment sine die [ITAL sine die].
                        I do not mean to assume such a responsibility as that of surrendering that
                        fort to the people of Charleston upon your adjournment, and then for you to
                        return in a week or ten day and pass your ordinance of secession after I
                        have given up the fort."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Botts was very much incensed, as he says, that Mr. Baldwin should have
                        rejected the proposition, and asked Mr. Lincoln to authorize him to make it
                        to the Union men of the Convention, assuring him that they would adopt it
                        willingly and cheerfully. To which Mr. Lincoln replied: "Oh! it is too late;
                        the fleet has sailed and I have no means of communicating with it."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Botts then asked permission to mention the circumstances for Mr.
                        Lincoln's own benefit; but Mr. Lincoln said: "Well, not just now, Botts;
                        after a while you may."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Botts' inference was that Mr. Lincoln was assuming a responsibility which
                        would at that day have been extremely distasteful to those who had elevated
                        him to the Presidency; but he thought it due now to history and to the
                        character of Mr. Lincoln to make it known.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Botts was here asked:</p>
                    <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure, according to your best recollection, that Mr.
                        Lincoln told you that he had made that proposition to Mr. Baldwin to
                        evacuate Fort Sumter? A. I know it as well as I know you are standing before
                        me and that I am answering your question.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Botts relates that some weeks afterward he returned to Richmond and
                        mentioned one evening to Mr. John F. Lewis, a Union member of the
                        Convention, the conversation he had had with Mr. Lincoln, and that next
                        morning Mr. Lewis and Mr. Baldwin drove to his house and had an interview
                        with him, which he narrates as follows:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Botts said: "Mr. Baldwin, is it true that Mr. Lincoln did propose to you,
                        that if the Convention would adjourn and go home without passing the
                        ordinance of secession, he would evacuate Fort Sumter?</p>
                    <p>"Yes," said Mr. Baldwin, "he did."</p>
                    <p>"My God! Mr. Baldwin," said Mr. Botts, "why did you object to such a
                        proposition as that?"</p>
                    <p>The only answer that Mr. Baldwin made was by taking out his watch and saying:
                        "it is only twenty minutes of the hour of meeting the Convention, when a
                        most important vote is to be taken, (meaning the ordinance of secession). I
                        am obliged to be there punctually at the hour, and I have not the time to
                        make the explanation I desire; but I will avail myself of the earliest
                        opportunity to make full explanation of the whole of it."</p>
                    <p>From that day to this Mr. Botts says he never laid his eyes on Mr. Baldwin,
                        nor heard any explanation from him, nor had directly any communition
                        [CORRECT communication] with him; but he had been informed that Mr. Baldwin
                        gets very much excited whenever the subject is mention in his presence.</p>
                    <p>Further on in his testimony Mr. Botts was asked if this whole proposition had
                        been communicated to the Unionists of the Virginia Convention, together with
                        a call for a National Convention, would that have prevented the breaking out
                        of civil war? A. I think that it would, for the reason that although the
                        Democracy, which never meant to be satisfied with anything but war
                        despairing of being able to carry the ordinance would have voted for the
                        adjournment, while the union men, who wanted peace, would also have voted
                        for an adjournment. The testimony in relation to this interesting historical
                        episode is confined to the three witnesses, Messrs. Lewis, Baldwin and
                        Botts. It is quite voluminous, but the foregoing extracts contain the pith
                        and marrow of it.</p>

                    <p>THE Delegates to the Valley Railroad Convention assembled in Staunton on

                    <p>At 5 P. M. a meeting of Stockholders was held, when an election for a

                        selection both as regards the President and Directors.</p>

                        while the negress seemed ashamed of herself, and, at one or two stages of
