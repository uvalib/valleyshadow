<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Among the many thrilling events of the late war (says the St. Louis Republican  of the 7th.) none can exceed the
                        adventures of Mrs. Loretta De Camp, the subject of this sketch. Mrs. DeCamp,
                        whose maiden name was Roach, was born in the West Indies, in 1838, and is
                        now about twenty-eight years of age. At an early period her parents moved to
                        the United States and settled in the parish of St. James, Louisiana. The
                        current of her life ran smoothly on, until the outbreak of the war for
                        Southern independence, when, fired by enthusiasm in, as she thought, the
                        cause of liberty, she donned the male attire, and was among the first to
                        rush to arms. Raising a company of cavalry, and equipping it at her own
                        expense, she proceeded to Virginia, and there served eight months on the
                        peninsula, under the command of the celebrated Colonel Dreux, before her sex
                        was discovered. When this occurred she was at once mustered out and ordered
                        home. In stead of obeying the order, she proceeded to Columbus, Kentucky,
                        and was serving with General Polk at the evacuation of that place. She
                        proceeded to Island No. 10. but not being satisfied with the manner in which
                        affairs were conducted there, she left and went to Fort Pillow, where she
                        was elected First Lieutenant in Captain Phillips' Company of Independent
                        Tennessee Cavalry. With her company she proceeded to Corinth, and reported
                        to General A. S. Johnston. At the battle of Shiloh Captain Philips fell
                        mortally wounded, and the command then devolved on her. While gallantly
                        leading her company in a charge, she was twice wounded and carried from the
                        field. After the retreat from Corinth she was taken to New Orleans for
                        surgical treatment, and when the city fell into the Federal hands she was
                        among those taken prisoner. After a confinement of several months she was
                        paroled, and soon after exchanged. </p>
                    <p>Proceeding at once to Richmond, the disguised female soldier was commissioned
                        1st. Lieutenant in the Adjutant General's department, and ordered to report
                        to General Marcus J. Wright, commanding the district of Atlanta. Upon
                        reporting, she was assigned to duty with the Provost Marshall, as chief of
                        detectives and military conductor. Serving for several months in this
                        capacity, she met Major De Camp, of the 3d Arkansas cavalry, to whom she was
                        engaged to be married previous to the war. The ceremony was then performed
                        at Atlanta, and from the dashing Lieutenant Roach she was transferred to the
                        sober Mrs. Major De Camp.-From this time her services ceased as an officer
                        in the field, and she was engaged in secret service-sometimes in the
                        Confederacy, again in England, and then in Canada. In 1864 she spent several
                        months traveling in the United States, and even went as far as Sioux county
                        Minnesota. Her husband, who was taken prisoner in the fall of 1863, while
                        serving with his regiment in Georgia, was carried to New York. After a long
                        and arduous siege she at length succeeded in getting him paroled in January,
                        1865, but he lived only eight days after his release from prison. Subsequent
                        to the death of her husband (in January, 1865,) she proceeded to Columbus,
                        Ohio, to watch over the interests of the Confederate prisoners confined at
                        Camp Chase.</p>
                    <p>After the final collapse of the Confederacy, Mrs. De Camp remained in the
                        North until January, when she returned to her home in Louisiana; but
                        remaining there only a few days, she proceeded to Memphis and purchased a
                        stock of goods, which were shipped on the ill-fated steamer Miami, which was
                        blown up on the Arkansas in February.-She was one of the two ladies who were
                        saved, but with the sacrifice of all her baggage and goods. By an
                        unfortunate oversight on the part of her merchants her goods were not
                        insured, and, consequently, she lost her all.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. De Camp is now in this city, and sojourning at the Southern Hotel. Many
                        who served in the Confederate army will remember the dashing Lieut. Roach,
                        of whom so much was said in Mobile and Selma in 1863. Our space will not
                        permit a full recital of her adventures.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Discourages the formation of a new political party system in the South
                    since "there is no division of sentiment in the South, the universal desire
                    being to bring the country back to a strict adherence to the Constitution."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>While some seem to think that new party organizations are necessary in these
                        times, would it not be well for us to consider this matter thoroughly before
                        we make the attempt. There is no division of sentiment in the South, the
                        universal desire being to bring the country back to a strict adherence to
                        the Constitution, under which the Union was an object of our veneration.
                        Believing Andrew Johnson to be animated by the same desire, we have, by
                        public convenings and otherwise, unanimously accorded his course and policy
                        a cordial endorsation. It would, therefore, be an easy matter to rally the
                        united South under the banner of one party, whose principles embraced our
                        views and call it by any name we might prefer, and as far as the name is
                        concerned would make but little difference to us, but this would avail but
                        little. We of the South are powerless, did we even have a perfect
                        organization under a new name. We must rely upon a co-operating organization
                        in the North under the same name and with the same principles. But we find
                        there, different from what is here, party lines distinctly drawn and parties
                        organized and contending. One, the Democratic party, fighting for the
                        maintenance of the Constitution and the restoration of the Union with the
                        rights of all States unimpaired, and the earnest in its support of President
                        Johnson, the other, the Republican party, insisting on a perversion of the
                        Constitution, opposing the restoration of a number of States to the Union on
                        equal terms, and active in its opposition to the policy of the President.
                        Many who formerly acted with the Democratic and Whig parties and joined the
                        Republican party on the question of slavery, or some war issue, who cannot
                        coincide with the ultra views of the radicals, are daily swelling the ranks
                        of the Democratic party, in support of its principles, which are ours. Can
                        we then expect that the organization of the Democratic party in the North
                        will be destroyed and a new party built upon its ruins, with the aid of the
                        Conservative Republicans, which will more nearly carry out our principles
                        than the present Democratic organization! Is it not folly to attempt at
                        present a new party organization in the South, to co-operate with any other
                        party in the North than the Democratic party!</p>
                    <p>To those who think otherwise we commend the following extract from a letter,
                        written upon the subject of parties by the warm personal friend of 'Harry of
                        the West," General Leslie Combs, of Kentucky, which is equally applicable to
                        the other States of the South as Kentucky.</p>
                    <p>"As a veteran in the Whig army in times past, standing by it in all its
                        disasters, as well as in its brief period of triumph, I appeal to my brother
                        Whigs in Kentucky, what will you do? With which of the two great parties now
                        dividing the county will you co-operate? Are you for the negro  or the white man? If you
                        coincide with me in opinion, then I entreat you to assemble with the
                        Democrats, and all others of similar views in your respective counties, and
                        send your wisest and best men to Louisville, to bold counsel together to
                        save the State, and restore the Union as our immortal Revolutionary fathers
                        made. The recent veto message of President Johnson, and the action of the
                        Senate sustaining it, is calculated to warm the hearts of freemen, and give
                        hope that the usurpers and tyrants in Congress
                        will soon be put down, and honest men take their places.-Let us have harmony
                        and Union among ourselves, and Kentucky will at any rate, be safe." </p>

                    <p>By reference to another column, the Circular just issued by Col. Brown,
                        Assistant Commissioner of Refugees, Freedmen, &amp;c., for Virginia,
                        approved by Gen. Terry, will be found. By this order the officer and agents
                        of the Bureau, are prohibited from trying any criminal case, in which a
                        colored person is a party, except such cases as have been commenced prior to
                        the issuing of this order. The civil tribunals will hereafter, as in days
                        gone by, take cognizance of and try such cases according to the laws made
                        and provided. It is also made the duty of Assistant Superintendents of the
                        Bureau to be present at such trials, but not to act as Attorneys, or argue
                        the case with court or magistrate, or interfere with the proceedings, but
                        they shall report every case where injustice has been done to colored
                        persons, or justice refused to be done, by neglect or otherwise on the part
                        of officers of the law, and on the last day of each month make a detailed
                        report of such cases, as to whether the proceedings have been conducted with
                        fairness and impartiality and in accordance with the laws enacted,
                        applicable such cases.</p>
                    <p>While we unhesitatingly disapprove of a censorship over our Civil Tribunals,
                        and pronounce as utterly wrong, that justice shall be dispensed with the
                        Sword suspended over the heads of the officers of the law, and in hands of
                        some reckless individual, more anxious, perhaps, to find fault that to make
                        an unprejudiced report, yet, we are satisfied that there will be no
                        testimony on record, if fairly reported, which will give the lie more
                        directly to the charges made against us of prejudice against a class of
                        people, whom we have reared and nurtured among us and for whose welfare our
                        cares and desires have been persistent. Laying aside then the objections we
                        have stated above, we are not averse to seeing a mere reporter for the
                        Bureau in our courts, for we are satisfied that a sense of justice, and a
                        desire to act in exact accordance with law, will characterize their
                        proceedings in days to come as has ever been the case in the past, whether
                        it be "Rebel," Refugee, Indian or Negro, directly implicated or interested.
                        If fair reports be made [UNCLEAR] of officers or agents of the U. S.
                        Government, those radical gentlemen of the North, who have been unable to
                        see anything good in Southern protestations, will, if possible to do so, be
                        greatly enlightened in regard to the true feelings and intents of our
                        people. This much of good we expect from this order, but to guard against
                        one-sided reports of prejudiced officers or agents, who may be dotted here
                        and there in our midst, we suggest to our brethren of the press to make full
                        reports of each and every case tried, in which a colored person is
                        concerned, as principle or witness, even to the minutest particular, and
                        thus place it, as far as may be, beyond the power of malicious or
                        evil-designed persons to do us harm, by inaccurate or prejudiced reports</p>

                        to be sold at cost, or distributed gratuitously to those unable purchase.
                        Ministers and others may do a useful work by looking up families unsupplied,
                        or but partially supplied with the Scriptures, and seeing that they are
                        furnished. A large family Bible will be furnished at half price to those
                        desiring such a copy and unable to pay the whole price. Testaments may be
                        offered to children, white or colored, as an incentive to learn to read.</p>
