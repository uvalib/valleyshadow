<b>"Marching On."</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Responding to the assertion that "the columns of freedom march steadily
                    on," the author responds that in the wake of freedom there is only devastation,
                    destruction and death and asserts that ultimately "the columns of abolition
                    freedom" will stop "at the feet of its father, the Devil."<br>

                    <p>The columns of freedom march steadily on- </p>
                    <p>Yes, and in its wake is the graves of hundreds of thousands of our best
                        men-the bleaching bones of our brothers-a soil reddened with the blood of
                        our own kindred-solitary chimneys that mark the spots of desolated and
                        destroyed homes-outraged women -beggared children-a people robbed of their
                        liberty-plundered of their wealth-enslaved with debt and impoverished with
                        taxation.-A country shorn of its strength-despoiled of its glory-pilfered of
                        its greatness-its fields laid waste-its cities sacked-its towns
                        destroyed-its prosperity blighted-its flag disgraced-its Constitution
                        dishonored and its freedom made a mockery and its liberty a lie.-A race of
                        being torn from happy and contented homes and cast upon the highways and
                        by-ways of life to die. Yes, "the columns of freedom march steadily on," and
                        close upon its heels, grasping with cold, clammy hands, as if to stay its
                        onward progress, comes the corpses of the hundreds of thousands it has
                        murdered and trampled down; and all around and about it, with disheveled
                        locks, tattered garments and pleading looks, is the forms of outraged women,
                        begging with tearful eyes to be spared the horrors they have been subjected
                        to; yet it continues on, tramp, tramp, tramp--, crushing liberty, life and
                        justice-leaving nothing in its trail but blighted hopes, sorrowing hearts
                        and the blackness of despair. But it has about reached its end. A little
                        while longer, and with the "soul of John Brown," the columns of abolition
                        freedom will halt amid the smoke and flames of the infernal regions, at the
                        feet its father, the Devil.-Democratic Watchman,

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reports that Senator Trumbull has withdrawn the "Dews petition" from the
                    Senate floor after receiving a letter from W. J. Dews which claimed that the
                    signers of the petition were being pressured and intimidated into disclaiming
                    their affiliation with it. The editor disputes Dews' account, arguing that those
                    "who made public their statements did so voluntarily" and that Dews should
                    display the original petition to the community to see if any of the signatures
                    are forgeries.<br>(Names in announcement:  A. H. H. Stuart,  Joseph Segar,  Jas. Todd,  J. Frank Davis,  John D. Sheets)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Mr. Trumbull asked permission of the U S. Senate, on Thursday, May 24th, to
                        withdraw the original Dews-Todd petition presented by him, leaving a copy of
                        the same which was agreed to.</p>
                    <p>This strange course was pursued in consequence of a letter being written to
                        him by Dews, of which the following is an extract: <br></p>
                    <p>"The rebels of this place through A. H. H. Stuart, of Staunton and Joseph
                        Segar, as I learn, have gotten the names from Washington of the signers of
                        the petition of the Union citizens of this county praying for troops,
                        &amp;c., which you recently presented to Congress. It was done for the
                        purpose of injuring us in every possible manner, as events have proved. The
                        rebels have even intimidated some of the signers, some six or seven, until
                        they have actually signed cards in the rebel papers, denying that the signed
                        the petition. I therefore respectfully request that you will cause to be
                        forwarded to me immediately the original petition in order that those who
                        procured the names may be relieved of this infamous charge against us of
                        forgery." <br></p>
                    <p>Dews knew, when he was writing, that the object of obtaining the lists of
                        signers was not to "injure us  in every possible
                        manner," even if Dews and Todd alone are intended to be meant by the term
                            us , and events have not
                         proved that the object, though the result of the republication of
                        the names of signers has been to call forth charges against the circulators
                        of that petition, which, unless done away with, may injure them, but not in
                            every possible manner. He knew that those who
                        made public their statements did so voluntarily 
                        and not from intimidation from any source. </p>
                    <p>The reason alleged for the withdrawal of the original petition is "to relieve
                        those, who procured the names, of the infamous charge of forgery." The
                        petition is again in the hands of Dews, and according to his letter, it is
                        incumbent on him to exhibit the petition and show that the signatures of
                        parties, who deny signing it at all, are genuine, and not forged by the
                        circulators of it. It seems there were four circulators of the petition,
                        each making affidavit to the list of signers obtained by himself, viz: W. J.
                        Dews, Jas. Todd, J. Frank Davis and John D. Sheets. Each one of these
                        parties swore that his respective list of signers were citizens of Augusta
                        and signed in his presence. Now some of these signers say they did not sign
                        this paper at all, and hence the necessity to show the petition and prove
                        the signatures to be genuine.</p>
                    <p>The exhibition of the petition may or may not prove the genuineness of the
                        signatures but we are at a loss to see how the charge of false swearing
                        against some of the circulators is to be done away with. They each make
                        affidavit to the list of signers obtained by themselves respectively, in
                        which it appears that they swear the names were signed in their presence and
                        the parties "are citizens of Augusta County." Now
                        we know that ten are citizens of Rockbridge, one or more of Rockingham, and
                        we learn that as many as six are citizens of Pendleton County, West
                        Virginia. Whether the charge made by some signers, that their names were
                        signed to the petition without authority, will be proved or disproved by the
                        exhibition of the petition remains to be seen, but we would like exceedingly
                        to see how the party or parties, who swore that the six citizens of West
                        Virginia, one or more citizens of Rockingham, and ten or more citizens of
                        Rockbridge, are citizens of Augusta, will relieve themselves of the dilemma
                        in which they are placed. </p>

                        the war, and when the enterprise was an uncertain and rather unpromising
                        experiment. It opened successfully, and before the war cloud burst upon us,
                        no college in the South had more brilliant prospects, nor has greater
                        satisfaction ever been given as to the proficiency of pupils. * * * * * *</p>

                        unremitting industry, through scholarship, and a conscientious discharge of
                        duty can resuscitate and put in successful operation the Wesleyan Female
