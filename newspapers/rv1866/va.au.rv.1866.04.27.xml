                    <p>On our first page to-day will be found the speech of President Johnson to the
                        soldiers and sailors, who complimented him by a serenade on the evening of
                        the 18th inst. The speech of the 22nd of February sent a thrill through the
                        patriotic heart of the nation, on account of its outspoken sentiments and
                        firmly expressed determination to defend the Constitution against its
                        enemies, no matter from what portion of the country they might come. He
                            <emph rend="italic">then </emph> relied upon his stern convictions of
                        right and his [UNCLEAR] sense of duty, and appealed to the people, to
                        sustain him. Struck with the manly and patriotic purpose of their President,
                        the people have exhibited marked manifestations of their approbation of his
                        course. Strengthened by their approval he has met the men, whom he denounced
                        in that speech-who would trample the Constitution in the dust to subserve a
                        party purpose, uncaring what might be the effect upon the country-with the
                        Veto of two most monstrous and unconstitutional measures.-Nothing daunted by
                        the passage of the Civil Rights Bill over his veto, the President pursues
                        the even tenor of his way and "takes no step backward," but, in accordance
                        with the line of his policy, issues his Peace Proclamation. Gaining strength
                        day by day, he suddenly finds coming to his support, by a just course
                        towards them, a very large and influential body of men, the U. S. soldiers
                        and sailors. His speech to them, on the occasion spoken of, in which he
                        again reiterated his sentiments, viewed in the light of past and passing
                        events, is, perhaps, the most important emission from President Johnson. He
                        calmly calls attention to the various steps he has taken to restore the
                        Union, "opening up custom-houses, appointing collectors, establishing mail
                        facilities and restoring all the relations that had been interrupted by the
                        rebellion," and declares that nothing remains to be done "to complete the
                        restoration of these States to their former relations" in the Union and
                        "finish the great ordeal through we have been passing" but to "restore the
                        great principle established in the Revolution," that of "no taxation without
                        representation," and "<emph rend="italic">admit representations</emph>" from
                        the South. </p>
                    <p>Thus detailing the steps he has taken, he asks with pointed force, "who has
                        been the usurping power? Who has been defeating the operations of the
                        Constitution?" These queries will be answered-aye are being answered now-in
                        a manner that will send fear to the hearts of the radicals, and brand them
                        with an infamy, which the remaining days of their lives devoted to an abject
                        penitence will not atone for or obliterate.</p>

                    <p>We regret our inability to publish, on account of its length, the admirable
                        charge to the grand Jury of Rockbridge, delivered by Judge H. W. Sheffey,
                        but give below the eloquent tribute paid to that eminent jurist and most
                        upright Judge, Lucas P. Thompson, so lately among us and whose death is so
                        sincerely lamented by our entire community. <lb/></p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Gentlemen of the Grand Jury</emph>: </p>
                    <p>Before proceeding to give you such charge the law requires, I beg to be
                        indulged in as saying a few words which, I trust, will not be considered
                        inappropriate to this occasion. I cannot enter upon the discharge of my
                        duties in this Court without saying a word of him who preceeded me in my
                        office, and who, by the choice of the constituted authorites of the
                        Commonwelath, has, for his learning and virtues, been promoted to a higher
                        post of judicial usefulness and honor. I am the successor of one who for
                        more than thirty-five years has expounded the laws in this Circuit-of one
                        who has been to myself a judicial father, and to the people of this Circuit
                        the protector of the defenceless, a tower of strength and refuge for the
                        weak, the persecuted, the wronged and oppressed, the guardian of the orphan
                        and the defender of the widow, and <emph rend="italic">always </emph> the
                        fearless scourge of wrong-doers of every grade;--in a word, of one who is a
                        Virginia genleman of the olden time and by universal consent a
                        conscientious, incorruptible, and unapproachably honest Judge! Lucas P.
                        Thompson has been a Judge in your midst for a period during which a
                        generation has been gathered to their fathers; and yet after all that long
                        service, although he has pronounced many thousand judgments, affecting the
                        lives, the liberties and the rights of this people, and has passed thro'
                        scenes and temptations of the most trying character, he lays aside the robe
                        of his judicial office as spotless and unsustained as when, more than
                        thirty-five years ago, in early manhood, he put it on. </p>
                    <p>Peace, gentlemen, has her victories as well as war; and often in the fearless
                        discharge of judicial functions has Judge Thompson, animated by a heroic
                        purpose to do right, achieved triumphs of the law which entitled him to
                        something better than the mere warrior's crown! I have myself seen him face
                        a fierce and angry crowd, which almost audibly demanded a sacrifice to the
                        passions of the hour, and standing <emph rend="italic">between </emph> the
                        helpless accused and the excited-almost infuriated-multitude calmly expound
                        the law, and fearlessly uphold <emph rend="italic">its </emph> shield of
                        protection over the rights of all, thus threatened in the person of the
                        meanest citizen. I have seen him again amidst the throes of our recent
                        struggle, in which our people and leaders deemed the most precious rights of
                        freemen were imperilled, and to which Virginia had solemnly dedicated all
                        her men and means-when military leaders were calling for more men-when the
                        Secretary of War sternly revoked all details, including those of the bonded
                        farmers, and ordered all to be hurried to the front-when his own home was
                        threatened, and his own people were about to be overrun-when <emph
                            rend="italic">loyalty </emph> was <emph rend="italic">sensitive </emph>,
                        and motives might be suspected,--I have seen him send forth the Great
                        Prerogative Writ of <emph rend="italic">Habeas Corpus</emph>, and with a
                        force of reasoning, utterly irresistible, and which afterwards other
                        distinguished Judges accepted as conclusive, demonstrate that the order of
                        the War Secretary was illegal and void; and then, with a moral courage,
                        which no intimidation could daunt-which no apprehension of personal
                        consequences could lessen-which no feeling of patriotism or self-interest
                        could affect, deliberately pronounce the judgment of the law and discharge
                        petitioners, taken from the very lines of the army! </p>
                    <p>To have had such a Judge for so many years wielding a silent but resistless
                        influence in favor of law and order, and justice and right, has been a
                        blessing which I trust has been appreciated by us all.</p>
                    <p>Our bar, than which none in the Commonwealth stands higher for honor,
                        integrity, learning and marked abilities, have been accustomed to se in
                        their Judge, the manifest spirit of the great lawyers and jurists of the
                        past; and before them he has always kept high uplifted, the standard of
                        professional honor and character. Our people, too, have been educated and
                        elevated in sentiment opinion and principles by his example and influence;
                        and the power of these, I trust, will remain with us and ours for
                        generations, to come, impelling us to reverence the law, to yield willing
                        obedience to its precepts: to regard its expounders as those who ought to be
                        clothed with the pure ermine of justice-as indeed the Vice-gerents of the
                        Almighty Judge in the visible affairs of men!</p>
                    <p>And now this great and good man lies upon a bed of extreme sickness-it may
                        prove to be a bed of death; and as calmnly and serenely does he turn his
                        eyes upon the Valley of the Shadow of Death, as he has been wont to look
                        upon danger and duty in his high office. His labors ended, at peace with all
                        men, full of gentle sympathies and affections, and with a sure faith, openly
                        proclaimed, in the priceless atonement, his example comes back to us, as
                        from the borders of the grave, and its light shall shine with steady luster
                        for our comfort and guidance for generations to come!</p>
                    <p>When I consider, gentlemen, not only the inherent responsibilities of the
                        sacred office I assume, but in whose pathway I tread, with unequal steps, I
                        can only invoke reverently for my guidance and direction, that "wisdom which
                        cometh from above," and resolve to consecrate all my powers to the discharge
                        of its duties!</p>

                    <p>OUR friend, W. A. Burnett Esq., the efficient Clerk of the county Court has
                        kindly furnished us with the following items of interest in the proceedings
                        of the County Court at its sitting on Monday last.</p>
                    <p>The usual certificates were granted to Messrs Henry B. Michie and Clement D.
                        Fishburn to obtain license to practice law.</p>
                    <p>The same Commissioners and officers who superintended the last election, were
                        appointed to superintend the election to be held on the 4th Thursday of May
                        next for Sheriff and Constables.</p>
                    <p>A list of 400 citizens of Augusta County selected, according to the code of
                        Va. Chapter 163, Section 4, to serve as jurors was submitted by the Clerk
                        and confirmed by the Court.</p>
                    <p>An order was made for the election, on the 4th Thursday of May, of a Justice
                        of the Peace in District No 1. to supply the vacancy occasioned by the death
                        of Jno. D. Brown Esq.,</p>
                    <p>J. Marshall McCue Esq. was unanimously elected Presiding Justice of the
                        County Court.</p>
                    <p>The consideration of the adoption of the "Fence Law" for Augusta County was
                        postponed till some future term of the Court, in order that the wishes of
                        the people might be more fully consulted and the Court enabled thereby to
                        act more advisedly.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Joseph Crickenberger, of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, upon
                        giving the required bond, was duly authorized to celebrate the rites of
                        Matrimony according to law.</p>
                    <p>Rev. Ephraim Lawson, (Colored) of the Baltimore Conference, upon giving the
                        required bond, was duly authorized to celebrate the rites of Matrimony

                    <p>WE call the attention of the Town Authorities to the condition of the wall on
                        the eastern boundary of the old burying ground, along Lewis street. Indeed,
                        repairing and fixing up the fence and wall all around, with a slight modicum
                        of whitewash, would improve its condition and appearance a great deal, but
                        it is especially necessary now on the eastern side. After a while it may
                        cost a larger amount to repair it.</p>

                        his office with universally accorded faithfulness and impartiality. But a
                        short time prior to his death, on account of his acknowledged learning and
                        ability, he was elevated to the bench of the Supreme Court of Appeals, but
                        owing to illness did not take his seat, and we who know and appreciate him
                        feel that the loss to the State is well nigh irreparable. In all the
                        relations private life, the nobleness of his character shone forth
