<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>While we have no voice in the National Legislation, we, nevertheless, can not
                        fail to look with interest to the doings of Congress. Though noting the
                        sayings and doings in that body we are totally at a loss to tell what our
                        status is. Indeed we think it would puzzle a philosopher to disentangle the
                        mesh [unclear] into which radical fanaticism has gotten the condition of the
                        South. When the Constitutional Amendment was passed it was intended that it
                        should be ratified by all the States, in which category the most ferocious
                        radical classed our Southern communities.--Then it was contended that by
                        secession we had lost our status as States and were conquered provinces and
                        to be dealt with as such. Now a member of Congress openly declares that upon
                        the ratification of the Constitutional Amendment, we must, in all fairness,
                        be allowed representation and admitted to our old position of States in the
                        Union, but if we reject it the whole military and naval power of the country
                        is to be used to thrust it down our throats. He plainly takes as the basis
                        of our wrong-doing the failure to ratify the Constitutional Amendment and
                        thus relieves us of all the alleged culpability on account of our acts of
                        secession and consequent war.--Another, not seeing as far into the
                        mill-stone, would reduce the States of the South into a territorial
                        conditions, re-organize the governments by the tools of Congress,
                        disfranchise our citizens, &amp;c., while a third would re-construct the
                        "District formerly composing the State of North Carolina," which would be a
                        precedent for action in regard to other States.</p>
                    <p>Now for the life of us we can't tell whether we are to be re-organized as
                        "fish, flesh or fowl," whether the Southenr States "so-called" are to be
                        considered as States, Territories, of Districts,
                        or when this long and much mooted questionis to be decided, so varied and
                        conflicting ar the opinions of those in power. This much we do know that
                        there is not enough of philosophic statesmanship in Congress to disposition
                        of the Southern States has gotten it. The only resort will be to cast aside
                        fanaticism and fanatical legislation, and fall back upon the Constitution
                        and common sense, and, as respect for the Constitution is but slightly
                        entertained in the Halls of Congress, and an approach to common sense is
                        vastly slower than a "snail's galley," we can reasonably expect that the
                        status of the Southern States will be the subject of declamation for
                        Congressmen yet unborn, and the youngest of us will die with the question
                        unsolved as to whether he was born in a State, Territory
                            or District.</p>
