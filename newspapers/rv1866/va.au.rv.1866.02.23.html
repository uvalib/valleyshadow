<b>The Sentiment of a Leader of the Privilege Class--Speech of Mr. Douglass</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Attacks a recent speech by Frederick Douglass in which he contended that
                    President Johnson's policies amount to a "'base and wanton surrender of all the

                        to surrender the nation into the "hands of the men with broad blades and
                        bloody hands." Is Andrew Johnson a traitor? or is this Douglass a base liar

                        table? That is the question. We are informed by a gentleman who came down on
                        the Chattanooga train, Thursday, that the Post Commandant closed the eating
                        house of Joiner &amp; Co., at Stevenson, Alabama, because two negro
                        soldiers were refused admission to dinner at the regular table. Upon their
                        complaint, captain Wartman sent a guard of negro soldiers, stating that if
                        they were not allowed to eat at the regular table, the house would be
                        closed. The landlord refused on the ground that his customers would leave
                        him; whereupon an order was issued closing the house at once. The

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Questions the motives of those who are arguing against the Valley Railroad
                    Bill in the Virginia Legislature by suggesting that the new line will undermine
                    the prosperity of other parts of the state. The editor suggests that "such
                    objections appear to us simply a desire to keep the Valley section down."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Valley Railroad Bill has been taken up in both Houses of the Virginia
                        Legislature and has caused some spirited remarks. The great objection urged
                        to the bill is that it will ruin the other Railroads and materially damage
                        the future prosperity of the State. This, the only objection, looks very
                        much like a last resort to defeat the bill. A charter has been granted which
                        will bring the Lower Valley, as far up as Harrisonburg, in direct
                        communication with points out the State, and, consequently, the productions
                        of that portion of the Valley will find their markets elsewhere than in
                        Virginia. By granting a charter to the Valley Railroad, the whole Valley
                        would be in direct communication by railroad with all the prominent points
                        in the State, and the trade of the Valley, instead of being compelled to
                        leave the State to find a market, would find its way to the Virginia cities.
                        It is objected that the advantage to be gained, by thus securing the trade
                        of the Valley to Virginia, is more than counterbalanced by the opportunity
                        afforded to the produce from the West and South West to seek a market
                        further North. This is equally a futile objection. The lines of
                        communication which the Valley Railroad would tap are the Va. &amp;
                        Tenn. And the Central railroads and Canal. All of these are tapped by the
                        Orange &amp; Alexandria Railroad. The distance from Salem to Baltimore,
                        by the Orange Road is shorter than by the proposed Valley Road, and besides,
                        by the former, the mass of freight would have the advantage of
                        transportation the entire length of two railroad lines as through freight,
                        the tariff on which is less than on way freight, under which class it would
                        fall if transshipped at Salem. And likewise for the Central Road and Canal,
                        the tariff would be less in proportion if the freight is transported to
                        Gordonsville and Lynchburg, respectively, than if transshipped at the
                        junctions with the Valley Railroad. For the same reason, markets begin
                        equally desirable, the tendency would be for freight to continue on the
                        through lines of communications to Richmond without transhipment at any
                        point.-Whether the latter would be the case or not; would both be at all
                        effected by the Valley Railroad, for access to the Northern markets is as
                        easy and over shorter lines of communication than it would be by the Valley
                        Railroad from any point of its crossing with these railroads or canal. How
                        any reasonable man can argue that the Valley Railroad would ruin the other
                        railroads of the State and damage her future prosperity, when, if the
                        reasoning is correct, more exaggerated causes are at work now than could be
                        brought into play by the Valley Railroad, we of the Valley can not see. Such
                        objections appear to us simply a desire to keep the Valley section down, and
                        cause us to regard the pronouncing, or approving of lightly wrought
                        panegyrics on our section as of no greater import than a passing wind. We of
                        the Valley have proven our devotion to the noble Old Commonwealth, and we
                        still desire her greatest prosperity, but if there is any thing which will
                        make us regard the old State with less veneration, it is to hear such weak
                        objections urged against a matter of the primest importance to us, and which
                        can not fail to advantage the whole State. The Valley people need and must
                        have the Valley Railroad, and it were high time such frail and untenable
                        objections to it were left off in Virginia's Legislative Halls.</p>
