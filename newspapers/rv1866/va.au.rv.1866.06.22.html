<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Predicts that war in Europe is imminent and criticizes a proposal by
                    Thaddeus Stevens to extend loans to Mexico to prevent the installation of a
                    monarchy as a measure that may bring the U. S. to war. The editor suggests
                    "Stevens turn his attention to the immediate reconstruction of this country, and

                    <p>By the latest reports the European peace conference had been abandoned in
                        consequence of the demands of Austria, rendering mediation an impossibility.
                        The belligerents are left to negotiate or inaugurate war, and her will
                        doubtless be the result. It is thought that Prussia will commence the war.
                        She has sent a circular to the neutral powers charging Austria with a
                        flagrant breach of treaties. The immediate result of this news here was to
                        send gold up to 159 Â½ in New York. Thad. Stevens became a little restless
                        also and proposed for the consideration of the committee on Foreign affairs
                        the loan of $20,000,000 to the Republic of Mexico, to prevent the overthrow
                        of its government and the establishment of a monarchy in its place. He
                        warmly advocated his proposition, and also the enforcement of the Monroe
                        Doctrine and did not seem to care that his proposition might be deemed a
                            casus belli. From this it would appear that
                        the impending war in Europe may not be without its effect on us and that we
                        may be involved in a contest also in a very short time. Our sympathies are
                        with the Republic of Mexico, but the course of Mr. Stevens, if carried out
                        by the Government, which up to this time has been persistently neutral and
                        only when the European sympathizers of Maximilian are about to engage in a
                        gigantic war, is desired to change its policy, looks very much to us like
                        national cowardice. Let Mr. Stevens turn his attention to the immediate
                        reconstruction of this country, and we will have no need in the future to
                        fear the powers of earth, whether they be at peace or war.</p>
