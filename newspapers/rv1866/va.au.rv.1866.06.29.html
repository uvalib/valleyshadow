<b>Hark Ye Girls!</b><br> (Column 07)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges women to remember that men want wives who can perform important
                    domestic chores, explaining that one cannot make a dinner from a piano. Women
                    who know how to cook and keep a house, the author contends, will make themselves
                    "worth catching."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It is nigh time that somebody told you a little plain truth. You have been
                        watched for a long time; certain class of you; and it is plain enough you
                        are laying plans to cheat somebody. You intend to sell chaff for wheat, and
                        there is danger that some of the foolish "gudgeons" will be sadly taken in.</p>
                    <p>It may not be your fault that you belong to the "one idea party"-that the
                        single idea of getting a husband is the only one which engrosses much of
                        your time or attention.-Your venerable mother of Eden memory, was called a
                        "help for man, and you are looking for a man to help you; to help you to
                        live in the half idle, half silly way which you have commenced. Men who are
                        worth having, want women for wives. A bundle of gew-gaws with a string of
                        flats and quavers, sprinkled with cologne and set in a carmine saucer-this
                        is no help for a man who expects to raise a family of boys and girls and
                        veritable bread and meat.</p>
                    <p>The piano and the lace frame are well in their places, and so are ribbons and
                        frills and tinsels-but you can't make a dinner of the former, nor a
                        bed-blanket of the latter. And awful as the idea may seem to you, both
                        dinner and bed blanket are necessary to domestic enjoyment. Life has its
                        realities as well as its fancies but you make it all a matter of decoration,
                        remembering the tassels and curtains, forgetting the bed-stead. Suppose a
                        young man of good sense and of course of good prospects to be looking for a
                        wife, what chance have you to be chosen?-You may cap him, or trap him, to
                        catch him, but how much better to make it an object for him to catch you!
                        Render yourself worth catching, and you will need no shrewd mother or
                        managing brothers to help you to find a market.-Lancaster Intelligencer. </p>
