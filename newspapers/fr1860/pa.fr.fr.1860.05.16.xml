                    <p>Among the swarms of male and female adventurers who lead lives compact of
                        subtlety and recklessness, says the New York <emph rend="italic"
                        >Tribune,</emph> and are drawn to great cities by a love of luxury and by
                        the surer field there afforded for a campaign against society at large, the
                        most subtle and dangerous of all would seem to be that arch adventuress--the
                        modern Fast Woman. Her prototype existed ages since, as long ago as when
                        Samson bartered everything for Delilah; or later, when "Thais. like another
                        Helen, fired another Troy." You can trace her down to latter times, through
                        all historical fact and fiction, finding her likeness in many a comedy of
                        Moliere, in many a novel of Fielding, or print of William Hogarth. But it is
                        in the exciting and fortune-making modern American life that she has more
                        fully developed her operations, gaining, at pleasure, the entree to our
                        changeful and not over scrupulous upper circles, and having her own wicked
                        say about half of our real-life tragedy and farce.</p>
                    <p>There was the body of a murdered women, found floating in the Jersey City
                        docks about a fortnight since. Her head, preserved in spirits, after days of
                        mystery, is at least identified by men, to whom, more than to the passing
                        crowd, it must seem a dreadful sight. For those features, now foul and
                        ghastly enough, to be sure, not long ago were a portion of their several
                        daily lives; not long ago those eyes, now "staring through muddy impurity,"
                        looked with the semblance of love into their own. For she was the lawful
                        wife of one, whom she deserted to lead the dashing life of an American fast
                        woman. Becoming accomplished in this life, she seized the other in her
                        toils; took charge of his body character and purse; debauched the first,
                        beclouded the second, scattered recklessly the contents of the third. She
                        shifted her abode, we are told, from place to place.--She lived at her
                        victim's expense, successively, at the Brandreth House, at the St. Denis
                        Hotel, at a doctor's in Astor place, at the St. Jullien Hotel, at the
                        Lafarge House, at more than one private boarding-house. All this within two
                        years. And when her provider saw through the flimsy veil of her affection
                        for him, she still maintained her extravagance, applying upon his terror of
                        exposure as skillfully as she had before played upon his yielding folly. She
                        spent $20,000 of this one man's money in two years. During this time she had
                        other visitors, doubtless other victims. How many she has ruined He only
                        knows who has at last called her to account. Such was the life, and such the
                        end, of one modern "fast woman." Well might the man we speak of, when asked
                        to identify those shapeless features, do so at his first glance and
                        shudderingly turn away!</p>
                    <p>It is only now and then that the career and terrible influence of the Fast
                        Woman are thus impressively set before the public. An act of violence is
                        committed, a bank forger ruins his family and himself, a broker comes to
                        grief, and to the story of his wicked excesses, there is the invariable
                        fast-women accompaniment. She does not share the criminal's trial and
                        conviction, however, and the world's interest in her soon passes by.</p>
                    <p>But she is everywhere and busily present in American cities, and in New York
                        most of all. Look, for a moment, at her method and appearance.</p>
                    <p>The Fast Woman is by no means a common harlot. In nine cases out of ten she
                        has never walked the streets, nor boarded in a house of bad repute. Only
                        once in a while one of the vulgar sisterhood rises, by superior shrewdness
                        and accomplishments to the ranks of the <emph rend="italic"
                        >demi-monde.</emph> The Fast Woman affects the private boarding-house. But
                        the hotel is the place to which she gains unquestioned access, where she
                        lives most at her ease, and is enabled (in her own language) to bag the most
                        game. And it is owing, first of all, to the wretched, conglomorate, [sic]
                        American hotel system that fast women of late abound in such numbers, and
                        are so dangerous to society.</p>
                    <p>There is always a mystery hanging about the Fast Woman's antecedents. One
                        thing is certain, though found on every New York square, she is rarely a
                        New-Yorker by birth. Few city girls, who have the accomplishments necessary
                        to render a fat woman's career successful, enter upon a fast woman's
                        life.--She comes to us after an apprenticeship in Boston or Philadelphia,
                        and she probably went to those cities from the country long before. But no
                        one city, not even New York, can detain her long. Her genus travel from spot
                        to spot. A placer failing them in Boston, they go "prospecting" to other
                        towns. From the Revere, where their last arrangement was "played out," they
                        come to the St. Nicholas to see "what they can make."--And in the Summer
                        they go in throngs from one watering-place to another. Generally two or
                        three unite their forces for the Summer campaign. Not unfrequently one
                        accompanies a genteel looking sporting man as his sister, while two others
                        figure as cousins or family friends. Together, they are a formidable set.</p>
                    <p>Mysterious as are Fast a Woman's antecedents, her presents, except in the
                        assumed Summer disguise refused to, are still more so. She comes to the
                        "respectable" private boarding-house almost always as a married woman.
                        Unfortunately her husband's business is of a nature that keeps him
                        travelling. He is the collector and general agent for some commercial firm,
                        or he is engaged in buying flour at the West, or he is sojourning in Europe.
                        The California story of the husband in successful San Francisco business,
                        and of remittances always expected, is about played out. The sobriquet of
                        "California widow" provokes suspicion at the outset.--Not a few fast women
                        hunt in couples; one who has passed through years of atrocious experience
                        unites her willingness to the beauty and youth of another new to the trade,
                        and the two, as mother and daughter, or more frequently aunt and niece,
                        easily locate themselves in any boarding-house they choose.</p>
                    <p>Once settled down in a new place, the Fast Woman's method is simple. It is
                        true that she alternates, through life, between stages of magnificence and
                        squalor. Rarely saving her extortionate gains, she is frequently unable to
                        pay her board, or buy her clothing, when fairly shaken off by an outraged
                        victim. But suppose her in funds, and just arrived on new ground. She has
                        her qualities, to begin with. She is a woman of passion, is handsome,
                        dressed with the usual good or bad taste of monied American females, signs a
                        little, plays a little, dances a great deal. Is quiet and behaves herself.</p>
                    <p>But, Mesdames Boarding-house keepers, you can always tell her by one sign.
                        Before she has been with you a week, she will be acquainted with every man
                        in the house who is open to attack--be he lawyer, broker, merchant, or
                        merchant's clerk--and will know very few, if any, of your lady inmates. The
                        latter, with their finer female instincts, will find her out, at any rate to
                        their own satisfaction. By-and-by, perhaps, though very quiet and
                        companionless at first, she will have many gentleman visitors. Perhaps you
                        will then recollect that when she applied for board she referred you only to
                        gentlemen--and highly respectable gentlemen they were, too--for information
                        as to her means and character. Now, if these things are in combination, you
                        may be wronging an innocent female in doing what we say you have a right to
                        do--that is, in strongly suspecting your fascinating and unprotected lady
                        border to be a Fast Woman, and, in keeping a very close watch upon her
                        movements--in expecting, sooner or later, to hear of her fastening herself
                        upon some fellow with more money than brains--to hear of her living in great
                        splendor at some hotel--to hear of her name vilely exposed in connection
                        with some startling case of fraud and dissipation--to hear, sooner or
                        later--of en evil ending and an uncared-for grave.</p>
                    <p>Much remains to say; but here we must quit the subject. If the Fast Woman
                        lives through all her reckless dissipation, through all the sloughs she is
                        ever in from the vengeance or desperation of her victims, to a period past
                        the bloom of youth, when she can of herself, ruin men no longer, she may
                        still gain a vile subsistence by linking her fortunes, as has been said
                        above, to those of some younger adventuress. Or she may degenerate to the
                        keepership of some houses supported by the lusts of men. But, in the one
                        case and in the other, it is a fearful retribution that the Fast Woman
                        incurs for the brief triumphs of a profligate youth.</p>

                <excerpt>"It is to be hoped, therefore, that we will hear no more about dissolving
                    the Union--so long used by locofocos as a political hobgoblin."</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The election of 1856 was carried, in some of the Northern States at least, as
                        much by the bug-bear cry of dissolution of the Union, if Southerners were
                        not permitted to have things just as they desired them, as from any other
                        single cause Locofoco stump speakers pretended to be greatly exercised in
                        their minds at the apparent prospect of breaking up our excellent form of
                        government, and establishing upon its ruins either a monarchy or the worst
                        form of anarchy. To have listened to their speeches and read their papers, a
                        person--sufficiently credulous to believe anything a locofoco says,
                        politically considered--could not have supposed that they themselves would
                        ever dare to encounter the fierce wrath of the "Union smashers." No person
                        of ordinary judgment could well have imagined that the next locofoco
                        National Convention which would assemble would not be able to nominate
                        candidates for President and Vice President, because of the Northern wing of
                        the party rebelling against the insolent dictatorship of their Southern
                        brethren--even at the risk of dissolving the Union.</p>
                    <p>The bursting up of the confederacy dodge must be about played out, since it
                        fails to produce any impression upon a locofoco President-nominating
                        convention, composed largely of Northern dough-faces. The manner in which
                        the "Union Smashers," Keitt, Pryor &amp; Co., were attended to in
                        Congress, within the last several years, by Northern representatives, has
                        shown the weak-kneed locofocos of the Free States that the Southern
                        braggarts are not half so dangerous as they would like people to believe
                        them to be--hence the nerve manifested at Charleston by Northern delegates.
                        If the braggadocios from the South, in Congress, had not been taken down by
                        truly brave men from the North, the hobgoblin of disunionism would have
                        frightened the whole Charleston Convention into submission.</p>
                    <p>There could be no stronger illustration given of the utter insincerity of
                        locofocos while pretending to believe the South desired to dissolve
                        copartnership with the great, industrious North, than was exhibited by that
                        very party at Charleston. If they believed that to offend Southern hot spurs
                        endangered the perpetuity of the Union, either they are all disunionists and
                        took the course they did to undermine the foundations of the glorious
                        Republic, or else they would have yielded to all the insolent, unreasonable
                        demands of the oligarchy.--They may take whichever born of the dilema [sic]
                        they prefer. It is impossible to escape from the consequences of their own
                        voluntary act. Either they do not believe that offending the oligharchy
                        [sic], as they did at Charleston, can effect the Union, or they have
                        precious little regard for the Union, about which they prate so much.--After
                        frightening a great many old women, and some timid men, at the North by
                        their unsightly hobgoblin--dissolution of the Union, and a bloody civil
                        war--the locofocos have shown by their recent course that there is no danger
                        to be apprehended from that source. It is to be hoped, therefore, that we
                        will hear no more about dissolving the Union--so long used by locofocos as a
                        political hobgoblin.</p>

                    carry their political principles with them, as an infallable [sic] directory,

                    <p>When will the Republican party learn the lesson that the Locofoco party carry
                        their political principles with them, as an infallable [sic] directory, into
                        every election, no matter what the office may be, and that they tenaciously
                        cling to their political friends, no matter what their qualifications. The
                        election of County Superintendent of Common schools, held in this place on
                        the 7th inst., abundantly attests this fact MR. SHOEMAKER sought and
                        obtained pledges of a large number of Republican Directors, on various
                        pretences, such as that it was not a political question, that there would be
                        no opposition, that <emph rend="italic">he</emph> voted for good men of
                        whatever party, and that he was not bound by party ties. All this in the
                        face of the fact, that he himself was elected on party principles three
                        years ago over MR. CAMPBELL, in every respect his superior in
                        qualifications. Still 21 of our unsuspicious Republican friends, with a
                        clear majority of ten votes in the last Convention, voted for MR. SHOEMAKER,
                        thus giving him two-thirds as many votes as he had political friend in the
                        Convention, and that on the ground that they had pledged themselves to
                        support him, while the Locofoco Directors, every man of them, voted for him,
                        all the time deploring the evil of making it a party question. MR. M'ELWAIN
                        submitted his name to the various DIRECTORS he chanced to meet, asking no
                        man to pledge himself until he would see who might be before the Convention
                        as candidates, receiving no pledges but one, and that one a Locofoco, who of
                        course, when the test came, voted for MR. SHOEMAKER. Let this lesson suffice
                        to teach our party, that the Locofoco drill-masters are always on the alert;
                        at every spring election that look ahead in order to see who the School
                        Directors will be in the tri- ennial Convention to elect the Superintendent.
                        Let our friends be on their guard against his insidious whinings about the
                        evil of making this a political question, while the fact stands out in bold
                        relief, that the Locofoco Directors, every man of them, voted in accordance
                        with, and against their pledges, for their party man.</p>

                    <p>Among other matter that was crowded out of our last issue was the result of
                        the Borough Election, held on Monday of last week. The following gentlemen
                        were elected to fill the respective positions named:</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Burgess</emph>--J. H. McCauley.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Town Council</emph>--Charles Hutz, Calvin M. Duncan,
                        Andrew Banker, Matthew Gillan, James King.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">School Directors</emph>--Joseph Clark, 3 years, D. K.
                        Wunderlich, 3 years, P. B. Housum, 1 year.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">Borough Auditor</emph>--Wm. Adams.</p>
                    <p><emph rend="italic">High Constable</emph>--George Gross.</p>
                    <p>The <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> claims the result as a Locofoco
                        victory, and we are glad it does. It goes to show Republicans that if they
                        can be deceived into the support of Locofocos under any pretext, by any
                        specious plea, or by any false cry, the result is afterwards crowed over as
                        a Locofoco triumph. Republicans are too apt to listen to the voice of their
                        adversary, and thus frequently contribute to disorganize their own ranks,
                        while the deceivers chuckle over the success of their plans, and grin at the
                        credulity of their dupes.</p>
                    <p>The little success that the Locofocos met with in this election, was brought
                        about by the hue and cry of extravagance on the part of the Republicans in
                        the management of our School and Borough affairs, oppressive taxation,
                        &amp;c., and headed their ballot "ANTI-TAX TICKET," the better to cover
                        up the trick, and enough of votes were thus seduced, to defeat a part of the
                        People's Ticket, and succeeded then only by mixing the names of other
                        Republicans than those regularly nominated with a few of their own "kith and
                        kin."</p>
                    <p>Now what is the truth of the matter? It is alleged that a "torrent of
                        extravagance" and a "wanton expenditure of the people's money" characterized
                        the management of our Borough affairs. We are surprized that such sweeping
                        charges should be made against Borough officials who were among our very
                        best, most judicious cautious citizens.--That our late board of Councilmen
                        improved our town in many localities by the most substantial and desirable
                        improvements, we freely admit; and that every improvement thus made,
                        probably without an exception, was urgently demanded by the <emph
                            rend="italic">Spirit,</emph> and when completed also approved by the
                            <emph rend="italic">Spirit,</emph> in its usual felicitous style, cannot
                        be denied.--Then where is the justice in its wholesale and unwarrantable
                        denunciation, or the fairness of its party friends in assailing those who
                        have but discharged their duty creditably to themselves and to our Borough.</p>
                    <p>Our Borough Debt may be some 7 or $8000. What is such a sum to Chambersburg,
                        compared with other towns? The whole of it could be paid by our people in
                        two years without serious inconvenience. We have nothing before us by way of
                        making a comparison, but we will venture the assertion that if a comparison
                        be instituted, there will not be found another town in Pennsylvania, of
                        equal size and population, that has so little [sic] debt, or whose people
                        are so lightly taxed. This debt, however, small as it is, was not all
                        contracted by the late board. The greater part of it has been hanging over
                        for years past.</p>
                    <p>If we are to have no more improvements by the town Council, the present Board
                        may congratulate themselves upon the fact that they find many of the streets
                        and alleys graded, picked and in fine condition, and several durable bridges
                        built. Of course it is understood by the vote by which they were elected,
                        that they are expected to make no further improvements, and any expenditure
                        of the people's money in such a foolish and useless thing as beautifying and
                        improving our town will be considered "wanton extravagance."</p>
                    <p>Certainly they will not so far disregard the voice of the people by which
                        their "democratic triumph" was achieved "to check the torrent of
                        extravagance that has gained the ascendancy," as to complete any
                        improvements that have been commenced by their predecessors; if, however,
                        they should determine, in their wisdom to fill a few mud holes, or repair
                        some of the streets in spots, it is to be presumed they will not undertake
                        to contract for any new improvement, the cost of which will exceed $233 1/3.
                        Any improvement contemplating a greater expenditure, will be regarded as
                        "wanton extravagance" by those who achieved so glorious a "democratic
                        victory" in the late election.</p>
                    <p>The purchase of fire apparatus of any kind they are not to think of. Our town
                        has been providentally preserved from the devouring element, and providence
                        will be as kind in the future as in the past--so that our new town fathers
                        need give themselves no trouble on this score. If the property of citizens
                        should, however, be wrapped in a devouring conflagration, and the result
                        should prove that we are destitute of sufficient means to stay it, that is
                        no concern of theirs. "Anti-Tax" was the cry upon which they were elected,
                        and it binds their hands as with a cord. Any provision, therefore, that
                        looks to the safety of the town in this particular, must be provided for in
                        the future, by the friends and advocates of "wanton extravagance," after,
                        may be, half the town lays in ashes.</p>
                    <p>We take the liberty to suggest to our new Board of Councilmen, the propriety
                        of shutting off the gas on our streets. Here would be a saving of several
                        hundred dollars, and who would be the poorer in consequence? This <emph
                            rend="italic">would</emph> be a stroke of economy, and it would go far
                        to enable them to pay the interest of our <emph rend="italic"
                        >crushing</emph> and <emph rend="italic">oppressive</emph> debt. Put out the
                        extravagant and costly light. Our grandfathers got along very well without
                        gas light, and so can we. To keep it up is only a "wanton waste" of the
                        people's money, and leads to "oppressive taxation." The spirit of
                        improvement must be repressed--the go-aheaditiveness of "Young America" must
                        be checked, the Rip Vanwinkle slumbers of Chambersburg must not be
                        disturbed, and of new town fathers will be held responsible for any
                        infraction of the rules that prevailed in the days of Adam and of Eve.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>By reference to a communication on the fifth page of this paper, it will be
                        seen that a Convention of Rail Road men is to be held in Harrisburg on
                        Wednesday, the 23d inst., to take into consideration the propriety and
                        practicability of building a Road to intersect the Connellsville and
                        Allegheny Road. Franklin county is deeply interested in this matter, and
                        steps should be taken without delay to have her represented in that
                        Convention. Chambersburg is, without doubt, the most practicable point from
                        which to start; as it is the terminus of the Cumberland Valley Road. As this
                        Road will eventually be built, should not the Penn. C. R. R. Company take
                        the matter in hand?--aided by the capitalists of Philadelphia. If it does
                        not, New York capital will, and Philadelphia will be injured to that extent,
                        by having trade and travel that the region of country through which it will
                        pass, and which naturally belongs to Philadelphia, diverted to New York by
                        way of the Lebanon Valley Road. Let the Penn. C. R. R. Company and
                        Philadelphia see to this matter. By this route a Road will be made sooner or
                        later. MR. HEGE, in 1938, in making a survey of this Southern route,
                        reported it as much more practicable for constructing a Railroad, than the
                        country through which the Cen. R. R. now runs,--an if that Company would
                        have adopted it, thousands upon thousands of dollars would have been saved
                        in the construction of their Road. As this Company now has a large interest
                        in the Cumb. V. R., it should make it the starting point for this
                        contemplated Southern route West, which would develope the resources of a
                        region of country rich in mineral and agricultural resources now laying
                        unproductive, but which would spring up and pour its flood of wealth over
                        the Cumb. V. R. into Philadelphia. If this is not done, New York will
                        eventually build this Road and derive the advantages flowing from it. This
                        matter is worthy of the earnest consideration of the Penn. C. R. R. Company
                        and of Philadelphia.</p>
                    <p>The New York Company propose to make Burnt Cabins a point, through Perry
                        County. Chambersburg is distant from Burnt Cabins but 22 miles by the common
                        road, but the Rail Road it might extend to 30, and the Penna. Central could
                        reach at that point from Chambersburg at <emph rend="italic"
                        >one-third</emph> the cost that the New York Company could. So that every
                        advantage is possessed by the Penna. Central and Philadelphia, if they are
                        wise enough to take advantage of it.</p>

                <summary>Article calls for Franklin Co. to move actively to secure Chambersburg as
                    the starting point for a proposed railroad to intersect the Connellsville and
