<b>Is Poverty A Crime?</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial criticizes Senator Wigfall of Texas for his comment that "poverty
                    is a crime." Editorial suggests that Democratic party is two-faced, appealing in
                    the North to the poor and working men and in the South condemning the poor and
                    working men.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have often told poor men that their bitterest foes were to be found within
                        the ranks of locofocoism. We have known that every principle which that
                        party advocates is in direct conflict with the best interests of poor
                        men--men who earn for their wives and little ones the necessaries of life by
                        their daily occupation. There can be no doubt that the passage of laws for
                        the promotion and protection of American labor against ruinous foreign competition--we mean
                        the products of foreign work-shops--is infinitely better calculated to
                        elevate poor men than is the policy of breaking down our working men and
                        building up those of other countries--a leading feature of locofocoism.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the fact that we have always been able to see that the policy
                        of the locofoco party was fatally injurious to the hopes and prospects of
                        all classes of community who earn their "daily bread by their own daily
                        labor;" yet we were not prepared for the bold, unblushing avowal made by Mr.
                        Wigfall, of Texas, one of the leading politicians, on Wednesday, last, in
                        the United States Senate, "that poverty is a
                        crime."</p>
                    <p>After this daring piece of locofoco affrontery, from a modern expounder of
                        the faith of that party, we may well expect that there will be no more
                        professions of friendship made, through empty resolves, for poor men by the
                        leaders in the North. Heretofore the song which the sirens of that party
                        were constantly singing--thereby enticing the thoughtless, charmed,
                        unsuspecting to their certain temporal ruin--was that of especial regard for
                        poor men; now, however, the tune is changed and we hear the jarring
                        discordant notes of tyranny denouncing poor men by declaring "that poverty is a crime."</p>
                    <p>Hitherto the rank and file of the locofoco party in the North, have followed
                        blindly, the bell-wethers of the party wherever they saw fit to lead, no
                        matter where, only so that the leaders hailed from the sunny South. These
                        dupes have been told, over and over again, that there was not, nor could
                        there be from the nature of the case, the smallest particle of sympathy
                        between the haughty owners of "working people" in the South and free
                        "working people" of the North; but the faithful adherent to "the party,"
                        being honest themselves, could not believe that their leaders--who made such
                        fine and strong professions of attachment to "poor men"-- could be so
                        utterly heartless, so false to all their pledges. Now, however, they can see
                        for themselves that the Republicans advocate the homestead bill--while
                        locofoco leaders say "that poverty is a crime."</p>
                    <p>If poverty is a crime, as is alleged by a certain locofoco United States
                        Senator, from the South, we may look for the passage of a law punishing
                        every "poor man" in the land for not being rich. If poverty is a crime, then
                        indeed, it must be punished. What is the nature of the suffering that these
                        haughty haters of "poor men" would inflict upon their helpless victims, if
                        they had the power? Doubtless if such men as Senator Wigfall had the control
                        of the Government (and who knows how soon his sentiments will prevail
                        throughout the South; for at one time the dogmas of John C. Calhoun, now the
                        sentiments whereby the whole locofoco party swear, were as unpalatable as,
                        we suppose, Northern locofocos would have us believe Wigfall's horrible
                        utterance to be) there would be a remedy commensurate to the evil. Poverty
                        being regarded as a crime its punishment would not be salutary by increasing
                        every "poor man" within the walls of a prison; but, doubtless the prolific
                        brain of Wigfall would invent something that would answer all practicable
                        purposes. He would exert his mighty intellect to
                        its utmost powers but what some method of inflicting punishment upon "poor
                        men," criminals in his sight for not being rich, should be discovered.</p>
                    <p>There is one solution to this apparent mystery; the denunciation of "poor
                        men" by a leader of the party which has always professed to be the special
                        friends of poor men. There is a reason for the position taken by the Texas
                        slave-driver. It is to be found in the fact that the general sentiment down South is that SLAVERY IS THE NATURAL AND
                        NORMAL CONDITION OF ALL "POOR MEN?"</p>
                    <p>It is high time for poor men in the North, who have heretofore assisted in
                        fastening upon their limbs the manacles of a slavery extending party, to
                        pause, before it is forever too late. Now they possess the power of saying
                        to slavery--their natural foe--remain within your present limits; extend no
                        further; thus far shalt thou go, but no farther; and here shall thy proud
                        tyranny be stayed; but hereafter--if the aggressions of slavery are not
                        arrested--the free men of the North, the bone and sinew of the land may be
                        unable to assert their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
                        The "poor whites" of the South are now in a condition of helplessness in
                        every respect as degrading as that of slavery itself. How long would
                        Northern "poor men" enjoy any greater liberty of slavery becomes--as locofocos desire it shall--national, and freedom becomes sectional?</p>
