<b>Disunion Begun</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Commentary on the House of Representatives' failure to organize itself as
                    evidence of disunion underway.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A new solution of the causes which prevent the great debating club at
                        Washington from organizing into a House, will be found in the fact that all
                        the antagonism which blocks the organization is in reality the insidious
                        beginning of that scheme of Disunion so repeatedly threatened by Southern
                        ultras. It would seem that under cover of hostility to Republican heresies
                        they are seeking to break up the Government by legislative
                        dislocation.--Northern Democracy is the supple tool for aiding in
                        accomplishing the treason. The discordancies which seem to prevent an
                        organization are mere shams, purposely maintained for Disunion objects. What
                        a weight of responsibility rests on the handful of men who unwittingly lend
                        themselves to promote them, by refusing to coalesce with the only real Union
                        party which now exists. The people of the North are unanimous that Sherman
                        must be adhered to, come what may. Opposition to him because of his
                        endorsing Helper, is too shallow a pretext to be seriously entertained. Had
                        he refrained from doing so, some other caveat equally fallacious would have
                        been put in. The Disunion conclusion being evidently a foregone one, some
                        pretext must be found. Anything would serve the purpose, and Helper happened
                        to turn up first. All glory in the compact brotherhood displayed by the
                        Republicans in this struggle, and believe that as Sherman has stood the
                        brunt of the battle, to him should be awarded the honors which are always
                        the share of the leader.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>If our brethren in England propose to sustain or to supplement with pecuniary
                        aid every church in the United States which regards the holding human beings
                        as property as a sin utterly incompatible with church-fellowship, they have
                        on hand a larger work than is furnished by the field of any Missionary
                        Society, or the congregations of any denomination of Christians in the
                        British Empire. While some ministers in Great Britain, with an ignorance of
                        American churches which is almost unpardonable, have put forth an appeal for
                        money to support at least one thorough
                        anti-slavery church in the United States, there are actually many thousands of such churches, which sustain
                        themselves without the least extraneous aid!</p>
                    <p>The recent allusion in our columns to Rev. D. Worth, now a noble confessor of
                        the faith of Georgia, has brought to us two communications on this subject,
                        which we gladly lay before our readers.</p>
                    <p>"Editors Independent; In the able and interesting editorial headed
                        `Deliverance through Martyrdom,' in your issue of Jan. 5th, are one or two
                        mistakes, which, with your permission I wish to correct.</p>
                    <p>"In the article alluded to you say: `In North Carolina there is a case of
                        persecution pointing towards the same result. Rev. D. Worth, who, like Mr.
                        Fee, is a missionary of the American Missionary Association, is one of the
                        most eloquent and powerful preachers in the Methodist Church,' etc.</p>
                    <p>"Now, so far as I am aware, there is no church in America called `the
                        Methodist Church.' There is the `Methodist Episcopal Church,' and the
                        "Methodist Episcopal Church, South,' but Rev. D. Worth could not
                        consistently nor conscientiously be `one' even `of the most eloquent and
                        powerful preachers, in either of these churches, seeing that both of them
                        fellowship slaveholders. You say most truthfully that `he has taken ground
                        openly against slavery as contrary to the Gospel of Christ;' but for so
                        doing he has arrayed against himself many bitter enemies, not the least of
                        which are found in the Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
                    <p>"There is also `the Methodist Protestant Church of America,' which, at a
                        Convention held at Springfield, O., in September, 1858, renounced all
                        complicity with the `sum of all villainies, and is now known as one of those
                        ecclesiastical organizations whose testimony against slavery is decided and
                        fearless. That Church, however, has never been known as `Methodist Church.'
                        Moreover, Rev. D. Worth is not a minister of that Church.</p>
                    <p>"There is another ecclesiastical organization to which it seems The Independent has been quite oblivious, known as
                        the `Wesleyan Methodist Connection of America.' This organization is not,
                        however, a church, but is a connection or union
                        of local churches, each independent of the other, although governed by the
                        same general rules, and founded on the same doctrinal basis. The more
                        prominent features of the Connection are these: Congregational in polity
                        -Methodistic in doctrines and general usages- non-fellowship with
                        slaveholders, their aiders or apologists and the maintaining of a decided
                        protest against the buying or selling of men, women or children, with an
                        intention to enslave them; or holding them as slaves; or claiming it is
                        right to do so. This Connection of antislavery churches has been in
                        existence nearly seventeen years, and was the result of a secession from the
                        Methodist Episcopal Church on account of the notoriously pro-slavery
                        character of the Church. There are now in the Connection nearly three
                        hundred ministers and licentiates, and churches or pastoral charges
                        amounting in the aggregate to twenty-five or thirty thousand members. Rev.
                        Daniel Worth is numbered among these three hundred ministers, and is
                        considered as `one of the most eloquent and powerful preachers in the'
                        Wesleyan Methodist Church, to which perhaps you alluded in giving the church
                        relations of our persecuted brother, would not feel flattered in being named
                        in connection with him, neither would he feel at all complimented in being
                        published as a minister in that Church, therefore this explanation may
                        perhaps be deemed as not inappropriate, considering all the circumstances of
                        the case.</p>

                    <p>Another correspondent in the same ecclesiastical connection, writes:</p>
                    <p>"The Wesleyan Methodist Connection has been in existence more than sixteen
                        years, having been organized in May, 1844, and has formed its churches, and
                        administered church discipline, under a General Rule prohibiting</p>
                    <p>"'The buying or selling of men, women, or children, with an intention to
                        enslave them; or holding them as slaves; or claiming that it is right so to
                        do.'</p>
                    <p>"Recent events in the South justify allusion to the missionary labors of this
                        body on slaveholding soil. In 1847 a Wesleyan church was formed in Guilford
                        county, N.C., consisting of fifty members, Rev. A. Crooks, of Ohio,
                        volunteering to act as pastor. A `great and effectual door was opened, and
                        so successful were the labors of Mr. C., that another minister was called
                        for. Rev. J. M'Bride responded, and reached the Southern field in September,
                        1849. These young men, in connection with Rev. J.C. Bacon, in Grayson
                        county, Va., succeeded in gathering over 500 members into the Wesleyan
                        churches. This aroused the fears of the slaveholders; they were harassed by
                        legal prosecutions and mob violence during one year, and at length were
                        forcibly driven away from the churches they had established, in 1851. Rev.
                        D. Worth, the Wesleyan Methodist preacher, who writes from `Greensboro Jail,
                        December 26, 1859,' is the successor of these men. I will add one suggestive
                        fact for the benefit of the Tract Societies. The origin
                            of this anti-slavery movement in North Caroling has been traced directly
                            to the circulation of an anti-slavery tract.</p>
                    <p>"The statistics of the Wesleyan body, as copied from The
                            Wesleyan in The Congregational
                        Quarterly for October, give the following result; Members, 21,000;

                    <p>We ask our Christian brethren in Great Britain to ponder these facts. The British Standard, The Patriot, and other papers
                        which have given currency to the ridiculous statement that there is on this
                        side of the Atlantic but one church in which God's Word is applied with
                        fidelity to the guilt of American slavery, owe it to their own reputation,
                        to the cause of truth, and to the honor of the churches here, to publish the
                        fact that there are in the United States thousands of churches which make it
                        a disciplinable offence to hold human beings as property. For their
                        convenience we recapitulate what has already appeared in The Independant upon this subject.</p>
                    <p>The United Presbyterian Church of North America (formed by the union of the
                        "Associate" and "Associate Reformed" Churches) has formally declared "That
                        slaveholding -that is, the holding of unoffending human beings in
                        involuntary bondage, and considering and treating them as property, and
                        subject to be bought and sold -is a violation of the law of God, and
                        contrary both to the letter and spirit of Christianity." This communion now
                        numbers 422 ministers, 77 licentiates, 676 churches, and 55, 453
                        communicants.</p>
                    <p>The Free-Will Baptists have a like declaration, and these now number over 500
                        churches and 60,000 communicants.</p>
                    <p>The United Brethren in Christ declare that involuntary servitude shall not be
                        tolerated in their communion. The Church numbers 1,278 ministers and 82,000
                        members.</p>
                    <p>Thus in these four denominations we find nearly 3,000 ministers, and upwards
                        of 200,000 church members formally pledged against the sin of holding human
                        beings as property. But this enumeration does not represent the half of the
                        numerical strength of the ministry and churches equally committed against
                        the sin. Few Congregational churches are
                        accustomed to legislate upon specific sins in the way of church rules. For
                        instance, we do not find in the rules of the
                        Church of the Puritans any declaration of the sentiment of that church
                        against the iniquity of holding men as property, yet who believes it
                        possible for one guilty of that sin to gain admission to the fellowship of
                        that church? Now there are hundreds of Congregational churches having no
                        specific rules upon this subject, in which it is no more possible that one
                        guilty of this sin should be admitted to fellowship than for a rum-seller or
                        brothel-keeper to be so received. There is no lack of testimony in
                        multitudes of churches against this sin. The Congregational churches have no
                        organic connection through which to make such declarations as are cited
                        above from other bodies; but several General Associations have taken decided
                        ground upon this subject. That of New York, for example, which virtually,
                        though not formally, represents some 180 churches with nearly 18,000
                        members, has declared that "the holding human beings as property is an
                        immortality, the renunciation of which ought to be made a condition of
                        membership in the Christian Church." There are several particular
                        congregations among the Presbyterians which take similar ground. We are sure
                        that English Christians will be glad to be disabused of any false
                        impressions that may have received as to the real strength of Christian
                        antislavery sentiment in the United States.--New York
