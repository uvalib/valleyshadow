                    <p>The presence of Archbishop Hughes at the late New York Douglas demonstration
                        at the Cooper Institute is here considered a very significant circumstance.
                        Southern politicians ask, "what does this mean?" They do not understand the
                        stronghold of Mr. Douglas upon the Roman Catholic division of our people. He
                        is emphatically their candidate, and not altogether from his well known free
                        and full recognition and defence, on all occasions, of the equal civil and
                        religious rights of our fellow-citizens who are aliens by birth and
                        Catholics in religion. Mrs. Douglas, one of the most beautiful and
                        interesting, one of the most amiable and fascinating, one of the most
                        intelligent and benevolent of our most distinguished women of the present
                        day, is a sincere, faithful and devoted member of the Roman Catholic
                        Church.-- Need we say more? Do we here now recognize the influence appealing
                        to the chivalry, the faith and admiration of the devout Catholic which he
                        cannot resist? Is it likely that Archbishop Hughes does not understand all
                        this? And do we not here discover that substantial underlying popular
                        element which will go a great way to account for the bold unyielding front
                        which Mr. Douglas maintains against his Democratic Presidential rivals and
                            enemies.--N. Y. Herald.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Locofocos are so terribly distressed at the "unheard-of bad treatment
                        which has been exhibited toward GOV. SEWARD, by the Republican Nominating
                        Convention, at Chicago, that apprehensions are felt lest these shedders of
                        crocodile-tears should, themselves, nominate the great Statesman from the
                        Empire State, when their Convention assembles, as it will in a few days, at
                        Baltimore. They profess to see so much that is great, grand and beautiful in
                        MR. SEWARD'S life and character that, judging by their past inconsistent
                        course, we deem it possible that they may startle the world by placing him
                        at the head of their own ticket.</p>
                    <p>MR. SEWARD met with a serious misfortune--the destruction of his buildings by
                        fire-- which caused him to visit his home in New York State; his return, a
                        few days since, to his seat in the Senate, was seized upon by the Locofocos
                        in that body, as a good opportunity for expressing their high admiration for
                        his many noble properties, both of head and heart. They crowded around and
                        almost killed him with kindness; seeming to forget that, a few months
                        before, when he returned from Europe, they, almost to a man, treated him no
                        better than if he were one of their slaves.</p>
                    <p>If these political hypocrits [sic] are so short of memory as not to remember
                        their bitter denunciations of MR. SEWARD, using a portion of his speech as
                        an excuse for preventing the organization of the lower house of Congress,
                        for two long months, at the beginning of the present session, calling him,
                        as they did, everything that is odious, in order to create public prejudice
                        against him, the people are not quite so forgetful. They will not soon
                        suffer to pass from their recollection the keen anxiety, on the part of his
                        Locofoco calumniators, to couple him, the great American Statesman, with the
                        foray of "Old John Brown," and his handful of deluded followers, at Harper's
                        Ferry.</p>
                    <p>The "irrepressible conflict," has been too precious a morceau to these
                        defamers of HENRY CLAY, DANIEL WEBSTER, WM. H. SEWARD, and every other great
                        man who did not belong to their own party, for our party to place any
                        confidence in their late professions of regard for the man they have
                        delighted so much to decry. We have no faith in the death-bed repentance of
                        old, broken down politicians. It is entirely too late for these men to
                        undertake to defend the fair fame of WILLIAM H. SEWARD from reproach and
                        obloquy. Why did not the Locofoco leaders in the U. S. Senate crowd around
                        Mr. S. when he made his debut there this session; especially as he had just
                        returned from a tour through Europe? The answer is, They were then afraid of him. Now
                        they consider him altogether harmless.</p>
                    <p>If MR. SEWARD had not signified his determination to retire from the
                        political world as soon as his present term in the Senate expires; if the
                        leaders of modern Locofocoism did not consider him as completely out of
                        their road; if they thought there was the smallest likelihood of his being
                        our candidate four years hence--after LINCOLN has managed the affairs of the
                        nation for one term, with unexampled economy, prudence, conservatism,
                        moderation, justice and honesty--for the highest office in the gift of the
                        people, there would be one of the present mock sympathy for him. Their
                        mottos are "Never to speak well of any man who may, be any possibility,
                        defeat one of their own party friends for any office." "Divide the
                        opposition, for then only are you to any extent sure of victory."
                        Consequently, the first would prevent their kind notice of Mr. S., and if
                        they did not think they were carrying out the sentiments of the second, they
                        would not speak well of him now, or treat him in a gentlemanly manner. They
                        hope to sour his mind, and especially the minds of his many warm, ardent
                        friends, by professing to accord to him and his talents the justice they
                        have so long withheld. They do not hesitate to declare that he, and none
                        other, should have been presented as the candidate of the Republicans for
                        the Presidency; but if his name now stood at the head of our ticket, these
                        same men would be busy, at present, diving into the filthiest gutters to
                        bring up the foulest dirt to fling at him. They stoop to conquer; and this
                        is an illustration of their debasing propensity.</p>
                    <p>It was, perhaps, an act of gross presumption in
                        the Republicans to undertake to form a ticket for themselves--without the
                        assistance of locofoco wire-workers. The locofocos know that the Republicans
                        are destined to control the affairs of this great nation after the 4th of
                        March next, and, as portion of the people who will live under their rule,
                        although they will oppose the change by every means as their command--fair
                        and foul--they seem to think that they should
                        have been consulted as to who would have been our
                            strongest man.</p>
                    <p>The nigger democracy are hard to please. If one of our great men says that
                        there is an "irrepressible conflict" going on in this country between Free
                        labor and slave labor, they instantly seize hold of the expression and
                        torture out of it all the horrors of civil war, and placing it side by side
                        with the John Brown raid, and Helper's book declare that the election to the
                        Presidency of the author of the sentiment by the Republican party, would be
                        an endorsement of Helper's book, a full recognition of the acts of John
                        Brown, and would be sufficient cause for a dissolution
                            of the American Union. Then, when the Republicans do not see
                        proper to bring forward the gifted SEWARD, the leaders of the Locofoco party
                        lift up their hands with, apparent, holy horror because
                            he was slighted. They pretend to shed an ocean of tears over the
                        misfortunes of a great man. They are hard to please--they will not be
                        satisfied. Congress might almost swim in the tears shed by locofocos over
                        the failure of SEWARD to receive the Chicago nomination; but large as is the
                        briny stream, it is not sufficient to wash out the record of the corruptions
                        of old Mr. Buchanan's administration.</p>

                    <p>At the recent Railroad Convention in Harrisburg, it was clearly shown that

                        for she has already over fifty miles in operation on this route, and by
                        extending from Chambersburg, can secure the advantages of the Southern

                        with the great central R. R. for several important reasons.</p>
                    <p>The route over the C. V. R. R., and through Cowan's Gap to Burnt Cabins, is
                        of the most favorable character.</p>
                    <p>The other, or New York route, to be independent of the Penna. Central R. R.,
                        must pass from Harrisburg through Sherman's Valley and reach Burnt Cabins at
                        about the same distance from Harrisburg, a that of the Cumb. Valley route.
                        From Burnt Cabins westward, the route is the same, whether made by
                        Philadelphia or New York.</p>
                    <p>Now, it is the duty of the people of Cumberland valley to arouse themselves
                        to vigorous and prompt action in presenting this matter to the capatalists
                        [sic] of Philadelphia, and inviting the Penna. Central R. R. Co. to
                        consolidate the remaining link in their own present Great Work. If this be
                        neglected, New York capital, enterprise and rock powder will force a passage
                        through even the Conococheague mountain and over the Concord Narrows, and
                        thereby secure to New York the possession of this thoroughfare for all time
                        to come.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The movement now on foot by New York capitalists to construct a Railroad
                        through Perry, Fulton and Bedford Counties, to the Connellsville road, thus
                        connecting New York and Pittsburg by way of the Lebanon valley, has, says
                        the Carlisle Herald, had the effect of drawing
                        the attention of the Philadelphians to the importance of securing the trade
                        along the southern tier of counties. The Cumberland Valley Road would have
                        been an important link in this projected New York route, had not the
                        Pennsylvania Rail Road Co. checkmated by the New Yorkers, by securing the
                        control of it; and the project now is, to connect with the Connellsville
                        road, by a route which will follow the course of the Cumberland VALLEY road,
                        and for some distance be parallel to it.</p>
                    <p>The Philadelphia North American, speaking on this
                        subject says:</p>
                    <p>"If this projected parallel route should be made, it would draw off the trade
                        of Bedford, Fulton, Somerset, and other counties, and particularly that of
                        the Connellsville road. This is a very serious consideration, and should
                        cause some vigorous action to be taken at once to insure the construction of
                        a link to connect the Cumberland Valley road with the Pittsburg and
                        Connellsville line, for which a good practicable route exists. A charter was
                        long since obtained for the purpose, but has lain dormant. This would render
                        the construction of the other line unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>Some movement of this kind is needed to develope [sic] the resources and
                        enhance the prosperity of the southern counties of Pennsylvania, now
                        isolated from the great routes of trade and travel. No very large amount of
                        money will be required for the work, not near so much as would be needed to
                        build the projected New York line. We know that no matter under what
                        auspices the section named shall be furnished with railway facilities, the
                        city of Philadelphia will be benefitted, as our prosperity is bound up with
                        that of the State. But we desire to see this work in the hands of our own
                        people, and therefore urge that it be taken up by the capitalists of the
                        city and the managers of the Pennsylvania rail road. It will be such a
                        tribute to the eastern division of Pennsylvania, that is from Harrisburg to
                        Philadelphia, as to increase very largely its profits, while at the same
                        time it will make the Cumberland Valley road more lucrative, and not
                        interfere with the regular business of the Pennsylvania road west of
                        Harrisburg."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Resolved, That we, the delegated representatives
                        of the Republican Electors of the United States, in Convention assembled, in
                        discharge of the duty we owe to our constituents and our country, unite in
                        the following declarations:</p>
                    <p>First.--That the history of the nation during the
                        last four years has fully established the propriety and necessity of the
                        organization and perpetuation of the Republican party; and that the causes
                        which called it into existence are permanent in their nature, and now more
                        than ever before, demand its peaceful and constitutional triumph.</p>
                    <p>Second.--That the maintenance of the principles
                        promulgated in the Declaration of Independence, and embodied in the Federal
                        Constitution, that all men are created equal: that they are endowed by their
                        Creator with certain inalienable rights: that among these are life, liberty
                        and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are
                        instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
                        governed: is essential to the preservation of our Republican institutions;
                        that the Federal Constitution, the rights of the States, and the Union of
                        the States, must and shall be preserved.</p>
                    <p>Third.--That to the Union of the States, this
                        nation owes its unprecedented increase in population, its surprising
                        development of material resources, rapid augmentation of wealth, its
                        happiness at home and its honor abroad; and we hold in abhorrence all
                        schemes for disunion, come from whatever source they may. And we
                        congratulate the country that no Republican member of Congress has uttered
                        or countenanced a threat of disunion so often made by Democratic members of
                        Congress without rebuke, and with applause from their political associates.
                        And we denounce those threats of disunion, in case of a popular overthrow of
                        their ascendency, as denying the vital principles of a free Government, and
                        as an avowal of contemplated treason, which it is the imperative duty of an
                        indignant people strongly to rebuke and forever silence.</p>
                    <p>Fourth.--That the maintenance inviolate of the
                        rights of the States, and especially the rights of each State, to order and
                        control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment
                        exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection
                        and endurance of her political faith depends. And we denounce the lawless
                        invasion by armed force of any State or territory, no matter under what
                        pretext, as among the gravest of crimes.</p>
                    <p>Fifth.--That the present Democrat administration
                        has far exceeded our worst apprehensions in its measureless subserviency to
                        the exactions of a sectional interest, as is especially evident in its
                        desperate exertions to force the infamous Lecompton Constitution upon the
                        protesting people of Kansas; in construing the personal relation between
                        master and servant to involve an unqualified property in persons; in its
                        attempted enforcement everywhere of Congress and the Federal Courts, of the
                        extreme pretensions of a purely local interest: and in the general and
                        unvarying abuse of the power entrusted to it by a confiding people.</p>
                    <p>Sixth.--That the people justly view with alarm the
                        reckless extravagance which pervades every department of the Federal
                        Government; that a return to rigid economy and accountability is
                        indispensable, to arrest the system of plunder of the public treasury by
                        favored partisans; while the recent startling developments of fraud and
                        corruption at the federal metropolis, show that an entire change of
                        administration is imperatively demanded.</p>
                    <p>Seventh.--That the new dogma that the
                        Constitution, of its own force, carries slavery into any or all the
                        Territories of the United States, is a dangerous political heresy, at
                        varience [sic] with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself, with
                        contemporaneous exposition, and with legislative and judicial precedent is
                        revolutionary in its tendency and subversive of the peace and harmony of the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Eighth.--That the normal conditions of all the
                        Territory of the United States is that of freedom. That as our Republican
                        fathers, when they had abolished slavery in all our national territory,
                        ordained that no person should be deprived of life, liberty or property
                        without the process of law, it becomes our duty, by legislation, whenever
                        such legislation is necessary, to maintain this provision of the
                        Constitution against all attempts to violate it. And we deny the authority
                        of Congress, of a Territorial Legislature, or of any individuals, to give
                        legal existence to slavery in any Territory of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Ninth.--That we brand the recent re-opening of the
                        African slave trade, under the cover of our national flag, aided by
                        perversions of judicial power, as a crime against humanity, a burning shame
                        to our country and age, and we call upon Congress to take prompt and
                        efficient measures for the total and final suppression of that execrable
                        traffic.</p>
                    <p>Tenth.--That in the vetoes by their Federal
                        Governors, of the acts of the Legislatures of Kansas and Nebraska,
                        prohibiting slavery in these Territories, we find a practical illustration
                        of the boasted Democratic principle of non-intervention and popular
                        sovereignty embodied in the Kansas and Nebraska bill, and a denunciation of
                        the deception and fraud involved therein.</p>
                    <p>Eleventh.--That Kansas should of right be
                        immediately admitted as a State under the Constitution recently formed and
                        adopted by her people, and accepted by the House of Representatives.</p>
                    <p>Twelfth.--That while providing revenue for the
                        support of the General Government, by duties upon imposts, sound policy
                        requires such an adjustment of these imposts as to encourage the development
                        of industrial interests of the whole country, and we commend that policy of
                        national exchanges which secures to the working men liberal wages, to
                        agriculture remunerating prices, to mechanics and manufacturers an adequate
                        reward for their skill, labor and enterprise, and to the nation, commercial
                        prosperity and independence.</p>
                    <p>Thirteenth.--That we protest against any sale or
                        alienation to others of the public lands held by actual settlers, and
                        against any view of the free homestead policy which regards the settlers as
                        paupers or supplicants for public bounty. And we demand the passage by
                        Congress of the complete and satisfactory homestead measure which has
                        already passed the House.</p>
                    <p>Fourteenth.--That the Republic Party is opposed to
                        any change in our naturalization laws, or any State legislation by which the
                        rights of citizenship hitherto accorded to immigrants from foreign lands
                        shall be abridged or impaired, and in favor of giving a full and efficient
                        protection to the rights of all classes of citizens, whether native or
                        naturalized, both at home and abroad.</p>
                    <p>Fifteenth.--That appropriations by Congress for
                        river and harbor improvements of a National character, required for the
                        accommodation and security of an existing commerce, are authorized by the
                        Constitution and justified by an obligation of the Government to protect the
                        lives and property of its citizens.</p>
                    <p>Sixteenth.--That a railroad to the Pacific Ocean
                        is imperatively demanded by the interests of the whole country, that the
                        Federal Government ought to render immediate and efficient aid in its
                        construction, and that as preliminary thereto, a daily overland mail should
                        be promptly established.</p>
                    <p>Seventeenth.--Finally, having thus set forth our
                        distinctive principles and views, we invite the co-operation of all
                        citizens, however differing on other questions, who substantially agree with
                        us in their affirmance and support.</p>
