                    catch with their uncovered hooks? What claim has John J. Crittenden upon the
                    confidence of Northern men?"</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The object of a movement of this character is, ostensibly for the purpose of
                        advancing a spirit of conservativeness, really, however, to defeat the
                        wishes of the People of the North, and promote the chances for success on
                        the part of the Buchanan Federalists.</p>
                    <p>In 1856 the most, if not all, of the very men who are now engaged in the
                        third, or "Union Party" movement, were to be found in the Filmore ranks. The
                        friends of free-thought, free-speech and a free press told the honest
                        portion of the men who were favorable to the election of Filmore that their
                        course was only calculated to assist Buchanan; that their own candidate
                        stood no earthly chance, and that they were being used by the locofocos as
                        the monkey used the cats paw -to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him
                        to eat.</p>
                    <p>Recent developments -testimony before the Senate's printing investigating
                        committee- shows that thousands of Dollars were used by locofocos to keep in
                        existence the third, or Fillmore party during the campaign which terminated
                        in the election of Old Mr. Buchanan. Men who used the money have sworn to
                        the fact. It is now a part of our history -a disgraceful portion, a dark
                        stain upon our escutcheon.</p>
                    <p>The movement at this time can have no possible effect other than to give aid
                        and comfort to the Federalists who are now in power with James Buchanan at
                        their head. No man with common sense can expect the election of a third
                        party candidate; then why do men who profess to oppose the Administration
                        assist in the inauguration of a movement which can only continue that party
                        in power -if its influence is felt at all.</p>
                    <p>How many of the friends of free white men, the advocates of free white labor
                        for the beautiful, rich, smiling Territories, which bound the sisterhood of
                        States on the West, do the leaders in the "Union Party" movement expect to
                        catch with their uncovered hooks? What claim has John J. Crittenden upon the
                        confidence of Northern men? His vote upon the question of raising a
                        committee in the Senate to investigate the Harper's Ferry raid is too fresh
                        in the minds of Northern men. Not one Senator from North of Mason &amp;
                        Dixon's line voted against raising that committee. They, however, wanted the
                        duties of the committee extended so as to reach the outrages upon Kansas by
                        David R. Atchison and other Southern men. On this part of the enquiry Mr.
                        John J. Crittenden, the chief mover in the third party, <emph rend="italic"
                            >conservative</emph>, "Union" enterprise, voted NO. He refused to allow
                        truth, justice and right to have their sway. He refused an act of simple
                        honesty to the North, and we are but right in looking with suspicion upon
                        all his actions now.</p>
