<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The State Committee of what is called the Democratic party, met at Cresson on
                        the 9th inst., for the purpose of settling the insurmountable difficulties
                        that now disturb the harmony and concerted action of the hitherto pliant
                        tools of the Southern Nigger-drivers. The Committee, in the midst of much
                        confusion, under whip and spur, and in defiance of a large minority, rushed
                        through a Resolution having in view a fusion of both wings of the Democracy
                        on a Union Electoral Ticket. But the thing will not work. The advocates of
                        Douglas throughout the State are most emphatic in their denunciation of this
                        attempt to drive them into the support of the disunionists and nullifiers.
                        The Harrisburg State Sentinel, (Douglas organ)
                        thus treats the action of the Committee, whom it styles a set of "political
                        gamblers:"</p>
                    <p>"Now, God save us from such a muss at this, cooked up in such a shape as to
                        confound reason, set at naught the usages and principles of the party, and
                        show us the world as a set of tricksters and sharpers bent on deceiving the
                        people and betraying the party.--Away with the whole arrangement! We
                        deliberately spit upon it and trample it under our feet as something too
                        vile for any honorable Democrat to touch. We venture to say that it will not
                        receive the approval of any honest DOUGLAS man in the State who has
                        intelligence enough to love his country and the party and hate the schemers
                        and intriguers who are moving earth and hell to ruin both. Away with it, we
                        say--as it was conceived in iniquity, let it perish in wrath.</p>
                    <p>We will support a clean, regular, Democratic Douglas ticket, or we will
                        support none!</p>

<b>(No Title)</b><br> (Column 5)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Repository notes that the editors (still unknown) of the Valley Spirit
                    are divided in their support of Douglas or Breckinridge, but that apparently the

                    <p>The Two Editors of the Lebanon Democrat have
                        quarrelled and separated, one of them being for Douglas and the other for
                        Breckinridge. The Douglas and Breckinridge question splits parties, splits
                        conventions, splits Locofoco editors--in fact does a splitting business all
                            around.--Exchange.</p>
                    <p>We do not know who the editors of the Spirit are, but we have understood that the proprietors occupy about the same political
                        position as the Lebanon editors, one being on one side of the fence and one
                        on "tother." But we do not apprehend a result like the above, on that
                        account.--For the sake of preserving the "harmony and peace" of the
                        Democratic family of the county, the friend of "Breck" appears to have
                        submitted to being ridden over, rough-shod by the Douglas interest, and thus
                        secured the "concord of sweet sounds" in the tones of the democratic
                    organ.</p>

                    <p>This excellent thoroughfare is now completed, and the second train of cars
                        has been put upon the track. On Wednesday, the 1st inst., the regular
                        opening of the Road took place. On that day the second train began to run.
                        The running time, for the present, is as follows:</p>
                    <p>Leaving Hagerstown in the morning of every day, Sabbath excepted, at 7
                        o'clock, the first train to this place arrives in time to form a connection
                        with the morning train for Harrisburg. The second train from Hagerstown
                        leaves there at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, arriving here about half past
                        four; but makes no connection with an eastern train. The first train for
                        Hagerstown leaves Chambersburg at 11.15 A.M.--about fifteen minutes after
                        the first train from Harrisburg arrives. The second train for Hagerstown
                        leaves here at 5.10 P.M.--about ten minutes after the arrival of the evening
                        train from Harrisburg.</p>
                    <p>The people along the route of the Franklin Railroad are under many
                        obligations to A. J. Jones and James Dull, Esq's., of Harrisburg, and Jay
                        Cook, Esq., and the Clarke brothers, of Philadelphia, for the substantial
                        road they have had constructed. These men contributed largely to the so much
                        desired result.</p>
                    <p>The company were very fortunate in securing the services of so excellent an
                        Engineer as William Woods, Esq. If a less experienced Civil Engineer than he
                        had been employed a very much inferior road might have been made; for, we
                        have been informed, by those interested in the road, that a set of
                        specifications were drawn up which, had they been followed, would have
                        produced a vastly inferior road to that which has been made. The probability
                        is that the specifications were drawn up by some person who knew very little
                        more than we do about civil Engineering, and we do not know enough to enable
                        us to lay a track less than one hundred yards in length--say from the
                        turn-table of the Cumberland Valley Railroad to the new warehouse of Messrs.
                        Wunderlich, Nead &amp; Co.</p>
                    <p>The Franklin Railroad Company have been very fortunate in the selection of a
                        General Agent--George B. Ayers, Esq. He is not only polite, accommodating
                        and gentlemanly in his intercourse with the public, but he is an
                        accomplished scholar, and a first-class man. The Conductor, Mr. John Miller,
                        is deservedly popular with the people; his kindness and politeness are fully
                        appreciated.</p>
                    <p>We notice that our spirited cotemparay, [sic] the
                            Greencastle Pilot, has shown the necessity of a flag-station at
                        the Brown's Mill Cross Roads--at Caufman's. This accommodation is greatly
                        needed, and the Company stands in its own light every day it neglects this
                        important station.</p>
