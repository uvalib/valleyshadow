<b>The Irrepressible Conflict</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Poem on slavery and the inherent conflict between it and freedom.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Oh! Land of Columbia! thy hill tops and mountains <br>Once echoed in
                        gladness the eagle's shrill scream; <br>And a welcome broke forth from thy
                        valleys and fountains, <br>That rose with the sounds of each murmuring
                        stream. <br>What tidings had roused thee from ages of slumber, <br>And
                        thrill'd thy dark forests with anthems of joy? <br>'Twas the songs of the
                        free, which in each lofty number, <br>Spoke freedom unmingled with servile
                        alloy. <br>Humanity long for the boon had contended, <br>While tyrants and
                        despots enthrall'd it with chains, <br>And free thoughts of man, from dark
                        prisons ascended <br>To Heaven, where justice eternally reigns. <br>To the
                        coast of New England now Heaven had guided <br>The pilgrims' frail bark
                        o'er the boisterous main; <br>And man stood redeemed from the laws that
                        derided <br>Religion and truth--the true freedom of man. <br>But the demon
                        of darkness, unconquered, then sped him <br>Across the Atlantic, for
                        victims to bind; <br>While the counsel of the demi god avarice, led him
                        <br>To plot the enslavement of body and mind. <br>How sad was the day when
                        a slave first was landed, <br>And trod thy free soil, O thou land of the
                        west! <br>Ah! how could thy sons, who but recently banded <br>As freemen,
                        now yield to the tempter's behest? <br>And why, when the thraldom of
                        England was broken, <br>And our flag, with its eagle and stars, was
                        unfurl'd <br>Oh! why the word slave still
                        remains to be spoken, <br>Or breathed from our altars and hearths to the
                        world? <br>But say, shall the plague-spot of Slavery forever <br>Defile
                        thee-cutcheon of Washington's home? <br>Or shall thy proud sons rise
                        potential, to sever <br>The chains of the slave? O, glad day, let it come!
                        <br>Shall LIBERTY be but a cloak to envelope <br>A scheme by which
                        slave-mongers still shall control <br>Their victims, and through that proud
                        watch-word develope <br>A system of shackles for body and soul? <br>The
                        "Union of State," the proud word that enchanted <br>The souls of the
                        fathers of freedom and right, <br>O, say, shall this "Union of States" be
                        cemented <br>By blood, in defence of this withering blight? <br>When Time
                        has accomplished, on untiring pinions, <br>This century, what shall thy
                        history be? <br>Columbia's land was the slave power's dominions, <br>While
                        banner's proclaimed it the land of the free! <br>O ye that enjoy in its
                        fullest fruition <br>That freedom from tyrants thy fathers proclaimed,
                            <br>Ye are tracing, in lines deep and dark,
                        the condition <br>Of MAN, as a slave, both in
                        body and mind. <br>The records of councils, of States and of churches,
                        <br>Of families and homes, when long years roll away, <br>Will be found in
                        the faithful historians' researches <br>When the actors have mouldered and
                        mingled with clay. <br>O think, while Columbia's annals preparing, <br>Of
                        those who projected the chart of the free, <br>Think well of your part in its history sharing-- <br>The page
                        which you write for descendants to see,
                        <br>While the shades of the fathers of freedom still linger <br>Around us,
                        and beckon us boldly to crown <br>Their labors with success, Oh let not a
                        finger <br>Be raised to detract from their temple's renown. Chambersburg,
                        March 12, 1860. M.</p>

<b>Party Aims</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Article specifies the differences betweeen the parties.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The great difference between the aims of the two principal political parties
                        of the day, is so marked that we propose to spread them before our readers,
                        in language so plain that he who runs may read, so that thinking men can
                        determine which party has the strongest claims upon the confidence and
                        support of the American people.</p>
                    <p>We begin with foes, the miscalled Democratic party. They, the leaders of that
                        party, profess to be the only body of men entitled to the name Democrat.--They endeavor, by false pretenses, to
                        gull the unsuspecting voter into the belief that their true title to the
                        succession is indisputable; because, forsooth, they have for a number of
                        years continued to bear that name; but they forget to say anything about
                            principles, which, after all, underlie all
                        parties and give them their only true name.</p>
                    <p>The origin of the Democratic party was the movement on the part of the gifted
                        patriots, THOMAS JEFFERSON, and his compeers, to arrest what they believed
                        to be the encroachments of power upon the rights, liberties and franchises
                        of the masses of the people. The Federal party being then in power, and the
                        laws which they were placing upon the national statute books being somewhat
                        suspicious in their character--having an apparent tendancy to encroachment
                        upon the perfect freedom of the people--the wise, great and good men who had
                        been recently emerged from beneath the dark clouds which hung like a thick
                        pall over the people during the ever-memorable Revolutionary struggle, the
                        eight years war, which terminated in securing to all the inhabitants of the
                        land the boon for which they sighed; the blessing they so earnestly pleaded
                        for from high heaven--perfect freedom--became seriously alarmed lest tyranny
                        should seize upon the rights of the unsuspecting masses the cruel hand of
                        oppression destroy every vestige of the temple of liberty.--Consequently, in
                        their zeal to preserve and transmit to posterity the priceless blessings of
                        freedom, these noble sons of liberty inaugurated a party, based upon the
                        Declaration of Independence, which they called Democratic; because its
                        objects and aims were the placing of the humblest man in the land upon an
                        equality with the haughtiest aristocrat in the country--for some few such
                        then, as now, dealt in Republican America.</p>
                    <p>The doctrines advocated at that time, the early days of the Republic, by the
                        old-time Federalists and the dogmas of the so-called Democratic party now, ar exactly the same. If, therefore, the
                        immortal JEFFERSON were upon earth now, he could not find a resting place
                        for his pure, patriotic Democratic principles, or for himself, in the ranks
                        of the party which arrogates to itself the exclusive right to be called his
                        successor. He battled for principles, not for
                            names or for men,
                        and, if the Federalists had entertained his sentiments, he would never have
                        raised an opposition merely for the sake of a new party--on matter what
                        might have been its prospects for popularity with the masses of the people,
                        whom he loved most tenderly.</p>
                    <p>Every feature in the teachings of the old Federal party which JEFFERSON
                        deemed obnoxious to just censure; every law they passed having the
                        slightest, apparent, tendency towards trespassing upon the blood bought,
                        inalienable rights of his countrymen; every attempt at centralization of the
                        powers of the Government in the hands of the few, to the everlasting injury
                        of the many, caused his large heart to expand with indignant determination
                        to arrest the insidious advances of power upon the inherent rights of the
                        unprotected working classes. His aims being pure and patriotic, he very
                        properly adopted the name Democracy, for his new party--the party of, and
                        for the people. Good, wise, wholesome councils prevailed and that party
                        became the idol of the people; that name (Democratic) the synonym of
                        freedom--the other party died out.</p>
                    <p>In process of time, however, a great change has taken place. Many of the
                        place men, the office-holders and office-seekers, who belonged to the odious
                        Federal party, cautiously wormed themselves into the Democratic
                        party--carrying with them all their detestible, centralizing, poorman-hating
                        dogmas of Federalism, which rendered their old party so very unpopular with
                        the people. The mere change of name with these men produced no more change
                        of sentiment than would the simple act of enveloping the body of a wolf with
                        the skin of an innocent lamb produce any change in that ferocious
                        animal--make it any less the blood- thirsty foe to every other animal, even
                        its own species. So soon as the inveterate enemies of pure Democracy--James
                        Buchanan, and other leaders--felt that they could, without danger, foist
                        their cherished Federal sentiments upon an iron-ruled party, the attempt was
                        made; the mask was thrown off and Federalism, in all its unblushing
                        nakedness and in its most disgusting form presented itself to the people and
                        asked to be taken to the bosom of honest men as a legitimate object for
                        their affectionate embrace. We have now, as a consequence of the controlling
                        influence such men have gained in the once pure Democratic party, the
                        mortification of seeing the party of JEFFERSON become the teacher of
                        Federalism--the unyielding exponant of the sentiments he battled against
                        with all his might.</p>
                    <p>In order to maintain, and to transmit to posterity, the undying principles of
                        which JEFFERSON, in his day, was the unflinching champion, the people, in
                        these latter days, have seen the necessity of forming themselves into a
                        party. Accordingly, with no other aim in view than the sacred preservation
                        of the priceless blessings of the life, liberty, and the pursuit of
                        happiness, the PEOPLE have organized themselves into a party, defensive in
                        its character, determined not to yield to the seductive tamperings of
                        inflated officials, pandering to their selfishness, but, actuated by the
                        nobler sentiments which controlled the fathers of the Republic, pledge their
                        lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor upon the altar of their
                        country's prosperity.--Such is the People's party--such its only aim.</p>
