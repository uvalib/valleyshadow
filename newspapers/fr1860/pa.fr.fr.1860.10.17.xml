                <summary>In his speech at Wigwam on Oct. 6th, A. K. McClure makes fun of the
                    Democrats'--Breckinridge, Douglas and Bell--attempt to fuse into one party. He
                    also criticizes the Evening Journal for 'assailing the private character' of
                    Col. Curtin.</summary>

                <excerpt>"Either slavery has no rights in the Territories, except those springing
                    from positive law of a local or municipal character, or, according to Judge
                    Douglas' own admission, the Southern construction of the Constitution and of the
                    principle of popular sovereignty is the only legitimate one, that the
                    Constitution, by its own force, carries slavery wherever it is the supreme law
                    of the land, that Congress is obliged to enact a slave code for its protection,
                    and that popular sovereignty means the power of the people to vote for slavery,
                    but by no means against it.--There is no escape from this dilemma."</excerpt>

                <summary>Carl Schurz' speech examines Douglas' efforts to 'solve' the slavery issue
                    by trying to satisfy the interests of both the North and South with his
                    self-contradictory doctrine of Popular Sovereignty. Schurz criticizes Douglas
                    for his disregard or intentional misinterpretation of the Declaration of
                    Independence and Constitution, for claiming his concept of Popular Sovereignty
                    is the same as Jefferson's, and for his indifference as to whether slavery is
                    finally voted into the territories.</summary>

                <excerpt>"In 1844 James K. Polk was declared to be a better Tariff man than Henry
                    Clay--the father of the Tariff policy. The masses in Pennsylvania then believed
                    the hollow profession of the leaders of the Locofoco party and were grossly
                    deceived. That time the fault was theirs who made the promise and broke it. This
                    time, if the people had again trusted their base deceivers the fault would have
                    been their own."</excerpt>

                    sturdy, industrious MECHANICS, whom the silk-stocking supporters of Breckinridge
                    call 'Greasy,' the bone and sinew of the Free North, whom aristocrats, upon the
                        <emph rend="italic">Spirit's</emph> list denounce as 'mud sills of
                    society.'" </excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>Under the above caption, the <emph rend="italic">Spirit,</emph> of this date,
                        gives a long list--containing over seventy names--of Honorables and
                        Ex-Honorables, Governors, and Ex-Governors, and other celebrities, including
                        the "Old Public Functionary," who are supporting the aristocratic,
                        nigger-driving candidate--John C. Breckinridge--for the Presidency. Formerly
                        that paper professed to belong to the "dirty shirt" party; now it is trying
                        to button-hole the grandees of the land. WE have looked in vain for the name
                        of Bill Boyle among the distinguised [sic] supporters of the great
                        Kentuckian. The party, doubtless, has become too grand to have a rag, tag
                        and bob-tail list-which accounts for the absence of our neighbor's <emph
                            rend="italic">beautiful</emph> phiz from the picture gallery which he
                        presents.</p>
                    <p>We call the special attention of the working-men of this county to the list
                        of kid-glove, ruffled-shirt <emph rend="italic">gentlemen,</emph> whom the
                            <emph rend="italic">Spirit</emph> parades with so much display, as the
                        "Supporters of John C. Breckinridge." Not one poor man to be found in the
                        list. Not one mechanic there. Not one laboring man to grace the column. The
                        reason is obvious; the niggerized party care nothing about POOR WHITES.
                        Their whole concern is for the owners of slaves.</p>
                    <p>Those who are for ABRAHAM LINCOLN for the Presidency, are of a different
                        stamp; they are: POOR WHITES, who earn their daily bread by honest toil; the
                        frugal FARMERS, whom the supporters of Breckinridge style "small fisted;"
                        the sturdy, industrious MECHANICS, whom the silk-stocking supporters of
                        Breckinridge call "Greasy," the bone and sinew of the Free North, whom
                        aristocrats, upon the <emph rend="italic">Spirit's</emph> list denounce as
                        "mud sills of society." These, a glorious host, who did so nobly in October,
                        and who will repeat the dose in November, are the supporters of LINCOLN.
                        Compare the lists and see which is really the most honorable in a Republican
                        county.</p>

                    whites. The Repository wonders where Bill Boyle's name is--that he must not be
                    grand enough.</summary>
