<b>The Nationals</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editorial accuses Democratic Party of sectionalism and affirms the
                    Republican Party's committment to national unity.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The great objection to the Republican party, which has been urged by the
                            harmonious democracy, especially by the
                        Southern wing of that party, or, to speak more plainly, that portion which
                        hails from the sunny side of the Potomac -for every leading man and a large
                        majority of the masses in the North are as completely southernized as if
                        they had never breathed the pure air of freedom in their lives -is that it
                        is sectional, while their party, the great democratic party, is National, and is not confined to North or South.</p>
                    <p>So great is the love for the American Union, as it is, which fills the bosom
                        of every honest man in the North -and they, as lovers of the Union, are to
                        be found almost exclusively in the ranks of the Republican party -that to
                        raise a hue and cry against a party on the score of want of fidelity to the
                        existing Union of States, has proven sufficiently powerful in its pernicious
                        effects upon our party to defeat its candidate for the chief magistracy
                        -putting into that position an infinitely more
                        sectional man than our candidate. Having met with that amount of success by
                        their false charge, they continue to reiterate it hoping thus to keep the
                        advantage they have gained. To hear the disunion croakers, the Southern
                        locofoco Congressmen, of both Houses, bellowing at the top of their voices
                        against Sectionalism one would suppose that they were entirely too National
                        to ever think of preferring the men of their own section to those of any
                        other portion of the confederacy. Their acts and their professions, however,
                        are so widely at variance that no person, however willfully blind, can fail
                        to see the difference.</p>
                    <p>These Nationals have a controlling majority in the
                        Senate of the United States, and could set an example worthy of imitation.
                        If they were sincere in their opposition to sectionalism, they would, whenever an opportunity presented, show to
                        the world that they, ensconced in their pure robes of Nationalism from the petty storm of sectionalism, were not to be moved from their high and holy
                        purpose of knowing no North, no South, no East or no West; but their whole
                        country.</p>
                    <p>How do the weak-kneed, loud-mouthed Nationals act
                        when they have the power? An examination of the standing Committees will
                        show the hollow falsity, and shallow emptiness of all the pretensions of
                        these warped partisans who are constantly repeating the story of their
                        abhorrence of everything like sectionalism.</p>
                    <p>The Senate is composed of sixty-six members. Of this number thirty are from
                        Slave States, and thirty-six from Free States; yet, with this decided
                        majority from the North in that body, the South, the Nationals, appropriate almost all the Committees of that body to
                        themselves.--These are twenty-two standing Committees appointed by the
                        Senate. These committees prepare for the deliberation of that body all the
                        business which originates with the Senate. Of the twenty-two, the
                        anti-sectionalists,(?) the haughty slaveocrats, have selected sixteen of
                        their own number as chairmen. This, however, in them, is not sectionalism.
                        Oh no, they are Nationals; all they do is for the
                        good of the whole country. What matters it whether they give the North any
                        of the offices or not? The North has no right to complain at any treatment,
                        however indignant, which it may suit the self constituted expounders of the
                        constitution to offer.</p>
                    <p>In the last Presidential contest the hue and cry raised by the
                        horror-stricken democracy at the prospect of Fremont's election, was based
                        upon the unparalleled sectionalism of filling both the government with
                        Northern men -both from one section of the country. Then Sectionalism meant the exclusive appropriation of important
                        offices by the people of one Section of the land. Now, however, the same
                        thing is done by Southern Locofoco Senators, and not one locofoco newspaper
                        from Maine to California makes the charge of sectionalism. What is the
                        reason that they all become dumb dogs, which cannot bark, when they have a
                        just cause against, and should denounce their Southern masters? </p>
                    <p>As will be seen by reference to the list of chairmen of all the committees of
                        the Senate, published in another column of this paper, all the important
                        committees -embracing Foreign Relations, Military Affairs, Finances, Navy,
                        Territories, Commerce, Judiciary, Auditing Claims, Post Offices,
                        Revolutionary Claims, Public Lands, Claims, Private Lands, District of
                        Columbia, Indian Affairs and the Congressional Library are presided over by
                        Southern men- those too who profess to be National in all their political views and actions, and express
                        supreme abhorrence for everything like sectionalism.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, but six of the Senate's committees -and they of no kind of
                        importance- are headed by men from States North of Mason and Dixon's line.
                        This case is a marked instance of the insincerity of these deceitful
                        blusterers about the Republicans being sectional
                        in their aims. What better right, under the constitution, or upon the
                        principle of fair dealing, have Southern Locofoco Senators to claim and
                        absorb all these important posts than have any set of men to fill up
                        political offices with men from their own section of the confederacy? There
                        can no reason be given, unless we admit -which would be untrue- an
                        inferiority on our part -a want of capacity to discharge the duties
                        devolving upon those who fill public places of honor, profit and trust.</p>
                    <p>The weak-kneed Bigler, too truckling to resent the indignity offered him by
                        his Southern party friends, accepted the petty position which the
                        lords-of-the-lash assigned him -at the head of the committee on Patents. To
                        him above all others should the chivalry have given the position of chairman
                        of the committee on Finances, if they had had any desire to escape the odium
                        attached to what they have always considered a terrible political bug bear
                        -the charge of sectionalism. They knew how much his State -Pennsylvania- is
                        in interested in a revision of the present ruinous Tariff laws, and, if they
                        had cared about relieving him from the odium which attaches to his
                        subserviency to them and their "peculiar institution," they would have given
                        him the position which would have enabled him to make a little show of
                        friendship to his constituency. It would, also, have assisted them in
                        claiming to be the National party of the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>The Union-savers have been accustomed for so great a length of time to
                        charging upon others -and attaching odium to the same- all their own short
                        comings, that they have become emboldened, and no longer strive to conceal
                        their real character. They are the most exclusively sectional party in the Union, and have the audacity, in the face
                        of their brazen acts of sectionalism, to claim to
                        be the National party. We charged in 1856 that
                        the only way that party could claim to be National would be declaring Freedom sectional and Slavery National. They,
                        seeing the necessity for assuming this position, have taken this high
                        ground.</p>
