                <transcript>
                    <p>After a brawling, squabbling, fighting week's work, the Convention of the
                        Nigger Democracy at Baltimore, nominated Stephen ARNOLD Douglas, for the
                        highest office in the gift of the American people--the Presidency. There is
                        no man in that party so well qualified to be the standard-bear of that
                        faith-breaking band of partisans. His impious hand raised the fagot, applied
                        the match to the time-honored compromise between the North and the South,
                        and he it was, who let loose the hell-hounds of slavery, who have, for six
                        long, weary years, been pursuing, with deadly hate, the genius of our
                        Republican institutions--the goddess of LIBERTY.</p>
                    <p>Upon his head rests the maledictions of the innocent sufferers in Kansas. His
                        hands, indirectly, more than all others, are stained with the precious blood
                        which was spilled by the border ruffians of Missouri, in the Territory of
                        Kansas; for, unless he, or some one equally wicked, had torn down the till
                        then impassable barrier, there would not have been that bitter contest
                        between Freedom and Slavery in that smiling, teeming, beautiful Territory.
                        The fathers of the Republic, in their wisdom, had dedicated all that vast
                        domain, North of the Southern boundary of Missouri, forever to Freedom. No
                        slavocrat dared to raise his hand against the sacred compact; but as an
                        ARNOLD was found during the Revolution a foe to Liberty, so an ARNOLD again
                        stepped forward and boldly walked where angels would not step. The bloody
                        right hand of Douglas smote fair Freedom in her very temple--on her own
                        sacred soil.</p>
                    <p>There never was, perhaps, a time, in our history as a people, when peace more
                        universally reigned throughout our borders than in 1854, when, the bad man
                        ambitious Stephen ARNOLD Douglas, madly attempted to destroy the whole
                        superstructure of Freedom in America. Both the great parties of the day had
                        agreed, in their Conventions of 1852, that the subject of slavery, being
                        local in its character, should be left to the control of the States in which
                        it exists; and that it should, thenceforth, no more enter into national
                        politic, or be admitted, as an exciting topic of angry discussion, into the
                        Halls of Congress. All was calm. Everywhere repose and quiet rested
                        cheerfully among the people. No person dreamed of a coming storm. Had one
                        been predicted, the person who would have uttered the unwelcome news would
                        have been branded as a false prophet.</p>
                    <p>Beneath the composure which mantled the face of our political firmament,
                        there was a dark, fiend-like spirit brooding. A creature in the form of a
                        man looked with longing eyes to the office of Chief Magistrate of the
                        American Republic. How to reach the much-coveted place became the topic of
                        his waking meditations; and the desire to rule over thirty millions of
                        Freemen haunted his dreams. He felt that if he waited till the people
                        selected him as a reward of merit, he would never, never reach the summit of
                        his unrighteous ambition--for he who is not a <emph rend="italic">true
                            patriot</emph> has no <emph rend="italic">just</emph> right to aspire to
                        succeed Washington. In an evil hour he determined to scale the walls and
                        enter, or destroy the temple in his wicked attempt. He knew that the North
                        were jealous of Freedom, and that the South were crazy over Slavery. Here,
                        then, soliloquized the cunning schemer, is my only hope for reaching the
                        goal. If I can with one hand destroy the harmony between the two sections,
                        and with the other present an olive-branch, I may be able to escape
                        detection as the incendiary, and, by means, of trickery, although a devil,
                        may cause the multitude to cry forth behold a god--a great pacificator.</p>
                    <p>Any being less presumptuous than Stephen ARNOLD Douglas, after beholding the
                        temple of peace in flames, the work of his own hand, would have shrunken
                        away from the gaze of an astonished, startled, indignant people. He,
                        however, had commenced his work of destruction for the accomplishment of his
                        own personal aggrandizement, and, although the execrations of an enraged
                        nation rang in his ears, pressed wildly forward without knowing whither;
                        watching only the star of promise to his ambitious hopes--keeping his own
                        spirits up by freely pouring distilled <emph rend="italic">spirits</emph>
                        down, he seemed not to know or care what became of the country, so he were
                        made its ruler. The final settlement is now about to be made between the
                        people, whom he wronged, whom he so wantonly outraged, and himself--the
                        base-hearted disturber of the public peace. He is now in the position where
                        the masses can show him how much he is loathed for his infamous conduct in
                        ruthlessly trampling under his unhallowed feet a sacred compact. He will be
                        taught a lesson that may serve as a warning, throughout all coming time, to
                        every traitorous villain who entertains in his wicked heart a design upon
                        the welfare of his country. May the fate of every foe to the best interests
                        of the community in which he lives be such as will be meted out to S. ARNOLD
                        Douglas, on the first Tuesday of November next, and the word traitor will no
                        more be applicable to men; for none will covet a similar reward for vile
                        mean services.</p>

                    to the world that you 'happen to know; just what the Committee wanted to know

                <transcript>
                    <p>Of all the pitiful attempts at bringing reproach upon our town that we have
                        ever seen the one in the <emph rend="italic">Spirit,</emph> of the 20th,
                        takes the lead. In the face of the fact that John E. Cook, the principal
                        character--next the old Brown, himself, as appeared in evidence--in the
                        Harper's Ferry raid, was arrested within the limits of Franklin County was
                        brought to Chambersburg by two of her citizens; was taken to a hotel in this
                        place; from thence to the office of a Justice of the Peace, in the
                        night-time without any military escort; received a hearing and was committed
                        to prison, and upon a requisition of the Governor of Virginia being endorsed
                        by the Governor of Pennsylvania, after being in our goal several days and
                        nights, was given up, <emph rend="italic">without any attempt, whatever, at
                            rescue,</emph> to the authorities of Virginia, where he was taken,
                        tried, convicted, sentenced and suffered the extreme penalty of the law, we
                        have an editorial in the organ of locofocoism in this county declaring that
                        it "will certainly be news to the people of this section of the country,"
                        that there was no "evidence to show a conspiracy to rescue Brown or his
                        associates from prison in Virginia."</p>
                    <p>We, in the name of the law-abiding citizens of Chambersburg, demanded of the
                        Editors of that sheet <emph rend="italic">the evidence</emph> which they
                        have in their possession of any such conspiracy. If there were anything of
                        the sort in existance they must have been privy to it--and the only parties
                        in this place who knew anything about it. Therefore it devolves upon them,
                        as good citizens, to expose to the contempt which would certainly be visited
                        upon them, every man who was directly or indirectly concerned in any such
                        unlawful transaction. Justice to the innocent demands that the guilty should
                        be exposed. So sweeping a charge includes every man in the community. Out
                        with the names of the guilty, and enable the innocent to go untarnished.</p>
                    <p>We never before heard of anything of the sort; nor do we believe the base
                        calumny. The people of Chambersburg, without respect to party, should hold
                        an indignation meeting and compel Messrs. Ripper &amp; Mengel to make
                        known all the knowledge they possess in relation to this grave, this serious
                        charge. They say, in plain English, that they "happen to know that a number
                        of men from northern counties in this State, came as far as this place <emph
                            rend="italic">for that purpose."</emph> Why not tell who they were,
                        where they came from, and with whom they held intercourse.</p>
                    <p>It is most remarkable that these two astute young men should "happen to know
                        so much" that nobody else in the community knew. Stranger still, that they
                        should be in possession of so rich a vein of political ore and neglect to
                        allow the Senate's Committee to work up the material for the benefit of the
                        locofoco party--as every body else here (except these two "knowing" ones)
                        happen to know that the only object that committee ever had in view was to
                        make capital for that party in this presidential campaign. Now, however,
                        after the Committee have finished their labors, without being able to
                        implicate any person outside of the few mad followers of Brown, these
                        foul-mouthed slanderers, unblushingly publish a base libel upon the good
                        people of this community--with the hope of making a little capital out of
                        the Harper's Ferry raid, in spite of the failure of the Senate's Committee.
                        There never was a greater outrage perpetrated upon this or any other
                        community. There never was a more wicked lie fabricated against innocent
                        men.</p>
                    <p>Why did not the "knowing ones" inform the Senate's Committee that they could
                        give important information upon a subject which engrossed the attention of
                        five Senators, ever since Congress assembled? Why lay your hands upon your
                        lips till the Committee were discharged and then, <emph rend="italic">when
                            you might not be called upon to swear to your chunk of a lie,</emph>
                        declare to the world that you "happen to know" just what the Committee
                        wanted to know all winter--aye for the last six months.</p>
                    <p>Being in possession of information as important as you would have us believe
                        you had in your keeping, and refuse or neglect a proper opportunity of
                        communicating the name to the enquiring authorities--when they were busily
                        engaged in pursuing the same--causes the possessor to be equally guilty with
                        the most wicked conspirator. Therefore if Messrs. Ripper and Mengel refuse
                        to inform the people of this Country all they know about this conspiracy,
                        they must be held as accessories.</p>

                    <p>The nabobs who control the machinery of the locofoco party despise poor men
                        as though it were a crime not to be born with a good spoon in a person's
                        mouth, or not to have inherited, from rich ancestors large estates. If a man
                        has money or lands, or if his means are invested to human beings--slaves--no
                        matter how mean, no matter how wicked he is, the leaders of the self-styled
                        democratic party are willing to take him by the hand and lead him to the
                        most elevated seat in their political synagogue. But if a man has the
                        misfortune to be poor; to own nothing in this world but himself, his hands
                        and head, no matter how well he has stored his mind with useful knowledge,
                        he is considered by these haters of poor men-- locofoco leading partizans
                        [sic]--as a mere "mud sill," and of no consequence in this country.
                        Everything that party can do to make the rich richer and the poor poorer is
                        cheerfully done.</p>
                    <p>During the session of Congress which has just been brought to a close, the
                        Republicans-- the true friends of poor men--were all in favor of passing a
                        law giving to every poor man a homestead, of one hundred and sixty acres of
                        land, in any of our great smiling territories. The Republicans in the lower
                        House of Congress passed such a bill; but when it got into the Locofoco,
                        poor-man-hating Senate, it was killed without much ceremony. Senator Green,
                        of Missouri, a leading pro-slavery Locofoco, in his wicked hatred of poor
                        white men, gave utterance to the following bitter, outrageous language about
                        poor whites who were to be benefited by the passage of the homestead bill:</p>
                    <p>"What is there honest in giving my property away to some poor, infamous
                        scoundrel? Do it, if you dare. I defy you. Do it! Do it! You vote away my
                        property to the lazaroni--to those infamous scoundrels who won't work for a
                        living, because you want their votes. You may get them, but they will spit
                        on you."</p>
                    <p>Is it not remarkable that the leaders of the Nigger Democracy, the
                        pro-slavery deities of the party--Messrs. Hammond, Wigfal, Green and
                        others--in speaking of poor white working men invariably apply to them the
                        most opprobrious epithets--"Mud Sill," "Small-fisted Farmers," "Greasy
                        Mechanics," "Criminals," "Poor infamous Scoundrels," and "Lazzaroni?"</p>
                    <p>Nothing but the most violent hatred could induce American Congressmen and
                        United States Senators to resort to such billingsgate. There is no excuse
                        for this hatred of poor white men in this country. Neither the Constitution
                        or the laws give to rich men any privileges or immunities which the poorest
                        and humblest man in the land is not as much entitled to as his rich
                        neighbor. We despite the party that looked down on poor men.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the bitter opposition of some of the pro-slavery Locofoco
                        Senators to the passage of a homestead bill giving lands to the landless and
                        homes to those who have none, the House succeeded in procuring the passage
                        of a bill about half as good as the one they had passed; the Senate agreed
                        to it, for the purpose of getting the House to pass a bill providing for a
                        loan to meet the outstanding debts of the Administration; but the President,
                        in his hatred for poor white men, has heartlessly vetoed the bill--thus it
                        fails.</p>

                    <p>The determination of the Council to widen East Market street, has set the
                        elevated individuals in that part of our town in a commotion, as it will
                        probably cause a downfall of fences and beauty. Serves them right, what
                        business had they to build there and spoil that rocky, romantic spot? What
                        business had they to rout those innocent "Toat Islanders" from their pens
                        and free the county of so much expense? Why didn't they remain on low
                        ground? When people take such high grounds, in advance of the will of the
                        town, they should be brought down a peg. While the Council are at work they
                        might as well have the houses torn down and "Toat Island" restored again to
                        its primitive beauty.</p>
                    <p>We would not stop here, either. On New England Hill the road take a turn as
                        unsightly as that over the railroad. Have it graded, gentlemen. The hill is
                        too high and the road too crooked. The owners of lots there will no doubt be
                        grateful for the kind act. Beside, some of the Council have lots there, for
                        which they will be thankful (?) to have any improvements made upon the front
                        of said lots. Then we would advise the filling of Water street, from the
                        corner of Queen to Washington street. The street there is too low and
                        pavements too scarce for pleasant travel or walking. There will be an
                        advantage in such work as the filling of that part of Water street, it being
                        near the residence of a member of the board, he could oversee the work, and
                            <emph rend="italic">commence right at his own door.</emph>--We throw out
                        these suggestions, fully aware of the fact that the present Council were
                        elected as an Anti-Tax Council; but we see no use in standing still and
                        seeing one part of the town improved (?) and the other part not. We would
                        call upon the owners of lots on New England Hill and Water streets to have
                        the above improvements made. Then Mr. Wm. Chambers might as well be made to
                        throw part of his lot into the street, and the improvement continued by
                        tearing down part of the houses owned by Messrs. Seibert, Miller, Trostle,
                        and others on that street, so as to make it wide enough to accommodate the
                        travel. What a jolly time we will have when all these improvements are
                        carried out. Let Messrs. M'Lellan, Sharpe and Nixon rant and foam--let
                        Messrs. Chambers, Seibert, Miller, &amp;c., object and frown, the town
                        has spread, so must the streets. Now as to the trifling matter of damage,
                        which will have to be paid, that is nothing. The last statement showed a
                        balance in the treasury of seven dollars. The citizens will find the
                        advantage (in taxes) and won't grumble <emph rend="italic">much.</emph>
                        Whilst these outside barbarians, who objected to coming into the borough,
                        are being chastized for their stubbornness by having the beauty of their
                        property destroyed, the Council might as well remove the unsightly stones
                        which disfigure our streets at the principal crossings--it's so annoying to
                        have, in muddy weather, to raise one's foot up to put it on a stone. Away
                        with the stones and give us the pure mud. Trusting that the inhabitants of
                        the town will see the necessity of the above improvements, we leave the
                        subject for them to reflect upon and act accordingly.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday morning last, about one o'clock, some of the wicked young men of
                        our town, tied a heavy stone to the rope attached to the whistle of the
                        Locomotive, while the engine was standing in the diamond, and then "moved
                        their boots" down West Baltimore street; consequently the valve remained
                        open, with a full blast of steam, until the stone was removed. Such a noise,
                        as was then produced, is very seldom heard. It continued until Mr. Wentz,
                        the engineer, arose from his bed, and reached the engine, which was about
                        ten minutes. Nearly all the inhabitants of our quiet town, and many persons
                        for miles around, were aroused from their slumbers.--<emph rend="italic"

                        himself to as many cigars as he wanted and all the money he could find,
                        which, it is said, was not much. This gentlemen, if we may call him such, is
                        known, and those directly interested should evidently apply the full length
                        of the law.--<emph rend="italic">Greencastle Pilot.</emph></p>

                    <p>The boasted unanimity of the South, say the New York <emph rend="italic"
                            >Tribune,</emph> in opposition to "Black Republicanism," is precisely
                        that which has long been maintained in Austria, France and Naples, and by
                        like means. There are but very few avowed Republicans in the Slave States,
                        simply because no one can be an active Republican and stay there, save in a
                        few localities along the border, unless he takes his life in his hand and
                        holds it at the mouth of the pistol, as Cassius M. Clay does. Hundreds who
                        have subscribed and paid for the <emph rend="italic">Tribune</emph> are not
                        allowed to receive it; thousands who would gladly take and pay for it are
                        deterred from doing so by terror. The Republican party is daily defamed in
                        fifteen States of the Union, but not allow a hearing in reply. To circulate
                        the facts whereof we rest the justification of our faith is prosecuted and
                        punished as a felony; while to advocate our principles and nominate tickets
                        in their behalf would, throughout nine-tenths of the Slave regions, expose
                        free white men to be hunted like wild beasts. And thereupon we are taunted
                        with being a <emph rend="italic">sectional</emph> party!--Whose fault is
                        that?</p>
                    <p>John Van Buren is said to have remarked lately that there was no despotism in
                        Europe which could compare in cruelty and meanness with that now tyranizing
                        in the Slave States and gave as a reason that the European despots had such
                        a number of subjects that they were obliged to establish some general rule
                        of action; while an enlightened public sentiment, together with a desire of
                        maintaining characters for generosity, had given to their conduct some show
                        of justice and liberality. But, said the Prince, your little one-horse
                        despots are not restrained by any such considerations, and do not govern
                        even by anything so respectable as their absolute will, being often
                        controlled more by the merest caprice. An occurrence of the last week
                        furnishes evidence in affirmation of these views. John B. Brown is a farmer
                        and dairyman residing in the County of Alexandria, Va., about four miles
                        from the Long Bridge, on the farm formerly owned by the late Gov. Van Ness.
                        For many years since the purchase of this farm, he has supplied a goodly
                        portion of the citizens of Washington with milk, and a variety of other
                        necessary products of his well-cultivate land. Being a man of mind and much
                        observation, he had naturally become a Republican, and was a delegate from
                        his State to the late National Convention at Chicago. This, of course,
                        greatly enraged the fire-eating Democracy of his neighborhood. One day last
                        week, being in the City of Washington, he procured from the Post-Office his
                        papers--the <emph rend="italic">Tribune,</emph> the Baltimore <emph
                            rend="italic">Sun</emph>, and the Washington <emph rend="italic"
                        >Star.</emph> He also obtained, during the day, four copies of the Helper
                        Compend, not for circulation, but for the use of himself and his family.
                        Such is the lynx- eyed espionage of the despotism to which we have alluded,
                        that Mr. Brown had hardly crossed the Long Bridge, on his way home, before
                        he was seized, searched, and, for having these terrible publications in his
                        pocket, he was compelled to give bail in $2,000 to escape confinement in the
                        common jail. We venture to say that neither Austria nor Naples, in the
                        palmiest days of her tyranny, ever exceeded this outrage upon personal
                        freedom.</p>
                    <p>And what must be the character of a social system that shows such horror at
                        the disposition of the people to read and investigate the publications of
                        the day? May we not say of such despots, in the language of an ancient
                        volume: "Ye hate the light because your deeds are evil?"</p>
                    <p>--Or, take another case, just developed in Kentucky, where a son-in-law and
                        two or three grand-children of an aged slaveholder, named Southerland, have
                        joined in a suit to compel him to continue a slaveholder, against his own
                        conscience and will. The case is thus stated by the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Somerset</emph> (Ky.) <emph rend="italic">Educator</emph>--Pro-Slavery
                        journal:</p>
                    <p>"Owen Southerland, living on Green River in Casey county, some four or five
                        miles above Liberty, who is a man now about eighty years old, by his own
                        energy, industry and economy, assisted by his industrious and frugal
                        housewife, acquired a very large estate, a part of which is some fifty-five
                        or fifty-seven slaves. A month or two ago, it became noised about in the
                        county he was about to set his slaves free by deed of manumission. His
                        grandchildren, some of them, and his son-in-law M'Whort becoming satisfied
                        that such was the cose [sic], and that he would soon execute it prosecuted
                        legal proceedings, charging that pun as in his dotage and rather imbecile,
                        and especially that his negroes had an <emph rend="italic">undue influence
                            over him,</emph> and that on this account he was incompetent to control
                        his property, and prayed an inquiry into the matter with the view of having
                        a committee appointed to take care of his property. He executed a deed
                        freeing all his slaves, and was preparing to remove them from the State,
                        when the plaintiffs had an attachment issued against them, and they were
                        detained. The case came up for trial week before last, at the Casey Circuit
                        Court, but was continued until next November term."</p>
                    <p>--Can't the adjourned Democratic National Convention, or its Richmond shadow,
                        say a word for this unhappy man? Where are the "rights of property" and
                        their Constitutional guarantees, when a free, white citizen is thus treated?
                        If it is so important to secure a slaveholder's right to his own negroes in
                        Nebraska, why shouldn't he be afforded a kindred liberty to "do as he likes
                        with his own" in Kentucky also?</p>
