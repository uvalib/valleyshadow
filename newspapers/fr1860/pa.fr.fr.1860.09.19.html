<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A meeting of anti-Douglas supporters who endorsed the present
                    administration and the nominee, William P. Schell, for this district, but they
                    could not come out against the resolutions of Douglas' party, for fear that they
                    might be ousted from the Democratic party.<br>(Names in announcement: Col. James B. Orr, Mr.  Brewer,  William P. Schell)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The meeting which the administration, anti-Douglas men of this County held in
                        the Court House on Saturday last, was very much larger than what we had
                        expected to see. The old, tried veterans of the party were here in their
                        strength. The foes of the "little giant" showed that they were alive and
                        kicking in old Franklin County.</p>
                    <p>The meeting assembled about one o'clock and was called to order by the
                        election of Col. James B. Orr, of Orrstown (where they "cannot go white slavery") President, and the chosing [sic] of
                        a number of Vice Presidents and Secretaries--among the latter of which was
                        another Orr.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brewer offered a preamble and a series of Resolutions which he read to
                        the meeting. Prominant [sic] among them were two, one endorsing the
                        administration of James Buchanan, and the other endorsing the nomination of
                        Mr. Buchanan's trusty friend, William P. Schell, the nominee of the Nigger
                        Democracy for Congress in this District--both of which the gentleman read
                        with a significant air of triumph.</p>
                    <p>Among the Resolves was one going it strong for the Breckinridge (Cresson
                        fusion) electoral ticket, and another pretending to favor the election of
                        the County ticket of the Nigger Democracy. Everybody understood the meaning
                        of the last-named resolution; if they had dared to rebel against the action
                        of the Douglas nominating convention which placed that ticket before the
                        party for their support, tyrannical though the proceedings of that
                        Convention were, according to their own representations, they knew that the
                        Douglas men would have called a meeting and have read the Breckinridge men
                        of this County out of the party. This was more than they were prepared to
                        encounter. They were satisfied with passing an empty set of resolutions
                        against the action of the recent Douglas Convention, and saving themselves
                        within the pale of the party by promising to support the ticket which that
                        anti-Buchanan Convention put in nomination.</p>
                    <p>After the Resolutions were read a young gentleman from London was called upon
                        and took the floor. He proceeded to discuss the resolutions in a style which
                        was very creditable for one of his years--he having evidently not tarried in
                        Jerricho long enough for his beard to have grown--and which, having been
                        carefully committed, was very well declaimed. If he had given credit to
                        Webster, and other statesman from whom he quoted the most beautiful portions
                        of his sophomorical exhibition, he would not have seemed to be guilty of
                        plagiarism.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Brewer followed in his usual, easy style; but had like to draw tears from
                        "eyes unused to weeping" by declaring that there was danger of Washington's
                        grave being translated to some foreign land if the Cresson fusion ticket,
                        and its candidate, John B. Breckinridge, should be defeated.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Douglas--not the "little giant," but our fellow-townsman--next responded
                        to the calls of the meeting in a short speech, which never touched one of
                        the Resolves, nor enlightened the people on the all-important subject--the
                        object of the meeting.</p>
                    <p>After the last speaker took his seat the Resolutions and preamble were passed
                        in a lump. One of the orators of the occasion asked another of them to call
                        for three cheers, and he asked the third speaker to call for them, but, as
                        neither liked to venture upon so hazardous an undertaking, the meeting
                        dispersed as quietly and solemnly as though they had just been attending a
                        funeral.</p>

                    &amp; Co.) --and yet not allowing Democratic opponents (of Douglas
                    candidates) to advertise for their elections in the Spirit.<br>(Names in announcement:   Keyser,   Toms,   Hamsher)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The last few issues of the Valley Spirit have been
                        loud in denouncing certain Locofoco leaders of this place as the "town
                        clique." What caused the Spirit to break faith
                        with its life-long friends? The managers of that journal have certainly
                        belonged to the "town clique" for some years themselves. We have been
                        informed that an humble number of their party, residing at Fayetteville, who
                        aspired to fill one of the Court House offices, sent to the Spirit office, a short time before the meeting of
                        the Douglas convention, his advertisement accompanied with the cash; but the
                            Spirit, and the "town clique," refused to
                        give him a hearing. The bold few who compose the "town clique" had
                        determined to choke off every person in the party who would dare to run in
                        opposition to the present incumbents--all good, true, loyal Douglas men. The
                        course of the Spirit is somewhat strange, while
                        busily engaged denouncing the Douglas men of Chambersburg as being "the town
                        clique" it is industriously engaged assisting the Douglas leaders to elect
                        the Douglas candidates of the "town clique"--Keyser, Toms, Hamsher &amp;
                        Co.</p>

<b>Good News</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A response to a Spirit article, which stated that Lincoln's ugliness chased
                    away all his family's and neighbors' 'darkies.'<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>According to a silly article in the Spirit, our
                        candidate for the Presidency, "honest ole Abe," is so homely that in his
                        infancy his personal appearance frightened all his father's darkies so badly
                        that they ran off from their master; and as he grew larger, and mingled with
                        other boys, he frightened the slaves of his neighbors so that they took to
                        their heels, which caused the owners of human chattles [sic] to beseech him
                        to leave Kentucky.</p>
                    <p>If this be true, it is one of the strongest arguments in favor of the
                        Election of Mr. LINCOLN, for if he can be of so much service as to frighten
                        all the darkies in the country to leave, we will have, what we should
                        have--a nation of Free Whites. The Spirit, then,
                        unless its love for Sambo is too strong, will assist in the consummation of
                        so desirable a result.</p>
