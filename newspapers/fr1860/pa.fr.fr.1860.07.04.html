<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Messrs. Editors:--It was my privilege to attend the examination of the pupils
                        of Rosedale Seminary, in this place, under the care of the Rev. Henry
                        Reeves, on the 28th inst. The examination was highly creditable to the young
                        ladies and teachers.</p>
                    <p>The teachers manifested considerable tact in the examination of the various
                        classes. They were perfectly at home in the different branches upon which
                        their examinations were based. Rosedale Seminary is in a flourishing state.
                        The Principal and teachers have the reputation of being well qualified for
                        their trust, and must necessarily command public attention.</p>
                    <p>Its location is a lovely one, sufficiently retired for a Young Ladies
                        Seminary, and it would seem only necessary that its position should be
                        known, in order to secure a large amount of public patronage.</p>
                    <p>On the evening of the same day the graduating class, composed of five
                        interesting young ladies, each of whom read an original essay in Franklin
                        Hall to a large and intelligent audience. Their subjects were well chosen,
                        and the compositions chaste and elegant, and would have done credit to much
                        older heads.</p>
                    <p>Before the Valedictory Essay was read, Diplomas were severally presented to
                        the graduates by Rev. Dr. B. S. Schneck, with the accompanying degrees. It
                        might be deemed invidious to draw comparisons between the several Essays. I
                        feel that I am not exaggerating, when I say they were of the first order. I
                        hope Rosedale Seminary may enjoy the patronage it so justly deserves.</p>

<b>Speech of Hon. Abraham Lincoln: Delivered February, 1860, Before The Cooper
                    Institute</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A speech almost two pages in length, primarily a discussion of the
                    constitution and its authors and whether the two allowed for Federal control in
                    Federal Territories. Lincoln argues that because a large number of the authors
                    voted for prohibition of slavery in the Northwestern territory, then they gave
                    clear indication that the territories were not free from federal control.<br>
