<b>Important News From Georgia</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Since Gov. Brown expects few Southern states to actually organize a

                    (who have been most active in passing laws that oppress the South), ie. taxes on
                    their goods, seizing their property, repeal of penal and civil codes that
                    protect their safety. He also wants money for a military fund. The Repository

                    that oredered them to wear identification badges and put them under the
                    supervision of a white man, who could re-enslave them at a whim. Any free

                    bill will provide opportunities for Western livelihoods free of slavery.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The battle has been fought and the victory won! The spirit of the people rose
                        with the fierceness of the contest!--The loud, wild, angry war-whoop of
                        disunion did not frighten the brave sons of liberty! The more terrible
                        appeared the foe, the more valliant [sic] became the army of the free! No
                        struggle, since the formation of our Government, was fraught with such
                        important principles! A long list of abuses, frauds, peculations and crimes
                        filled up the measure of the party in power. Bankruptcy, as a necessary
                        consequence of the ruinous policy of the dominant party, covered the land
                        with its sable pall since the inauguration of the existing Dynasty.
                        Idleness, want and starvation, the necessary adjuncts of a depression of the
                        industrial interests of any nation, were obtruding their unwelcome form into
                        the dwellings of our working people. Endurance ceased to be a virtue, and
                        resistance became an absolute duty. The times required decisive action; the
                        people rose in their might and applied the proper remedy.</p>
                    <p>After the 4th of March, 1861, another administration, another class of men
                        will take hold of the helm of the old ship of state. They will begin with a
                        clean sheet; no foul blots mar the pages of their record. No party ever was
                        more loyal to the whole country--more devoted to the best interests of all
                        classes of society, than is the Republican party. The poor man, desirous of
                        employment, has the prospect of work in the Tariff policy of our
                        party--which seeks to foster every branch of American industry against
                        ruinous foreign competition. He who wants a home for himself and little
                        ones, who has no means to procure one, is cheered with the expectation of
                        the speedy passage of a Free Homestead bill--knowing that "honest old Abe"
                        will never veto such a measure. All who desire the beautiful prairies of the
                        far West preserved sacred from the polluting foot-prints of a slave, will
                        feel their hearts bounding with joy as they read, not only in the public
                        prints of the day, but in the sparkling eyes of Freedom's honest devotees,
                        the glad news of the Victory of liberty over oppression; of truth and
                        justice over falsehood and cruelty.</p>

<b>Our Hopes</b><br> (Column 4)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A reminder that, although the Republican candidates have been elected, both
                    houses of Congress have a Democratic opposition and will make things difficult
                    for the new administration.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Great as has been the triumph of Republicanism, much as is the good that will
                        result therefrom, we must not permit our hope of reform to blind our reason
                        to the true state of the facts. We have, it is true, elected our candidate
                        to the Presidency; but he will go into power under somewhat adverse
                        circumstances. Both branches of Congress contain a majority arrayed in open
                        hostility to his administration. No matter how wise, how patriotic, how
                        necessary the measures he may recommend, they have the power to thwart him
                        at every point. If they undertake to act the part of the dog in the manger,
                        the people will see and know with whom rests the responsibility of
                        nonaction.</p>
                    <p>As matters stand, we must not expect too much--we must not look for as great
                        results as if we had a working majority in each house of Congress. Honest
                        Old Abe will do all that his friends expect, all that they promised, to
                        bring the country back to the beaten path of rectitude and honor--as
                        travelled by the earlier administrations. His warning voice will be plainly
                        heard, from the helm, above the fierce raging of sectional storms and
                        partisan strifes, commanding the old vessel, in calm tones, giving a word of
                        encouragement to the wary, and inspiring new confidence into all around by
                        the dignity of his bearing. If we do not accomplish all that we could
                        desire-- pass a fair, equitable Tariff; carry the Free Homestead bill, and
                        build a railroad to the Pacific--we can at least rejoice to know that none
                        of these great measures will receive injury at the hands of Mr. Lincoln; for
                        such bills he has no vetoes in reserve. Holding the country in peace,
                        preventing any further injury to the people, is cause for bright hopes for
                        us in the near future. The day of bribery and corruption; of buying
                        unrighteous congressional enactments is gone. The future, therefore, looks
                        bright and cheerful. Lincoln's administration will prove the harbinger of
                        better things to come.</p>
