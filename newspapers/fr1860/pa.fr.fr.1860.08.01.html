<b>Douglasism Waning</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Nothern Democrats and others are choosing to support Breckenridge instead
                    of Douglas, because Breckenridge claims the Slave issue has been validated by
                    the Supreme Court, whereas Douglas says that it has yet to be decided. Douglas
                    lost many Northern supporters during his battles with the Buchanan
                    administration.<br>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>One after another the leading politicians of every section of the land,
                        especially that portion in which the Nigger Democracy have their chief
                        strength, the South, are falling into the Breckinridge and Lane ranks, and
                        are turning their backs upon the "little giant." Different causes have
                        united in producing this result. It is seen that Douglas and Breckinridge
                        are contending for the same thing,--the unlimited spread of slavery--but by
                        very different means. The one openly declares that the Supreme Court has
                        already decided that Slavery is the normal condition of the poor man, and
                        that his rich neighbor may justly reduce him to
                        bondage for their mutual benefit; and that, such being the proper condition
                        of poor men, slavery is the highest type of civilization, and rightfully
                        enters into every portion of our domain; and where it does not now exit,
                        Congress should speedily send it . The other says that the highest judicial
                        tribunal has not yet disposed of this question, but when it does, if in the
                        way the other indicates, (and he knows that a majority of all Judges are
                        slave-owners) we are all bound to obey its inhuman, its unnatural decree.
                        The one is openly fighting for oppression; the other is covertly seeking to
                        accomplish the very same object. All, therefore, who desire to see the fair
                        surface of our beautiful Territories blasted, as with mill-dew, by the
                        withering blight of slavery, and who have the courage to advocate their
                        principles, are losing no time in joining the Breckinridge wing of the
                        distracted, rent party. Those who desire the overthrow of Freedom, and the
                        crushing of poor white laboring men, but who are ashamed to declare their
                        purpose openly, are seeking to accomplish their wishes in a sneaking,
                        underhanded way by voting for Douglas.</p>
                    <p>Both branches of the Nigger Democracy are sufficiently inimical to the
                        happiness of the working classes, and to the prosperity of the whole
                        country; but, what that of Breckinridge is openly proclaiming its poisonous
                        sentiments, the advocates of Douglasism are endeavoring to accomplish all
                        that the other seeks for, only they fight behind a masked battery; they
                        refuse to permit the people to see what they wish to accomplish.</p>
                    <p>The Douglasites have sought to cover up the bane to Freedom--the oppression
                        of free laborers by the spreading of slavery, which destroys all demand for
                        free labor--by sugar- coating the pill with the peculiar covering of
                        Squatter Sovereignty, which appears to be the right of the people to decide,
                        but which, as explained by its father, Stephen Arnold Douglas, means that if
                        the people are not willing to have slavery, and if the Supreme Court says
                            they must, then as loyal subjects of this
                        kid-glove, black-gown aristocracy, they have nothing to do but submit.</p>
                    <p>The slavery propagandists of the South greatly prefer the Breckinridge
                        doctrine--that the question has been settled by the Supreme Court--to that
                        of Douglas, which leaves the matter for future decision. The dough-faces of
                        the North, who have long been accustomed to obey Southern dictation, seeing
                        what is most likely to give satisfaction to their masters, are has tening
                        [sic] to array themselves on the side of Breckinridge. Thus the Douglas
                        ranks are steadily becoming weaker and weaker. So it will go on, until that
                        wing of the party becomes so weak in the knees that it will be utterly
                        unable to stand upon its feet.</p>
                    <p>The vaulting ambition of Douglas which led him, in his eager pursuit of
                        presidential honors, to dash a flaming fire-brand into the political
                        magazine of the nation, resulted as would a similar act, by any other
                        madman--literally speaking--in an awful explosion. His political hopes and
                        aspirations have received a shock from which they will never recover. It is
                        utter madness for him to see to be President of the United States, by the
                        votes of the People.</p>
                    <p>While Douglas was fighting the administration of James Buchanan, the time he
                        was seeking his re-election to the Senate, he drew around him many admirers
                        in the North; but when he so meanly succumbed to the leaders of the
                        slavery-expansion dogma, who also control the administration, as he did on
                        his return to the Senate, they found out the extent of his sympathy for the
                        masses of society, and in their indignation at his insincerity, will now do
                        everything in their power to expose to public gaze the band of infamy which
                        his perfidy has fastened upon his brow. He is, of all the candidates in the
                        field, the least likely to win, and the least worthy of the confidence of
                        the great, indusrious [sic] American people. That his cause is waning, is
                        becoming more and more apparent every day. If something is not soon done to
                        create a reaction, there will scarcely be enough votes cast for him to swear
                        by.</p>

                    <p>The Republicans of this Congressional district will soon be called upon to
                        place in nomination a candidate for Representative to the national
                        Legislature. It is every way important that all districts in the North which
                        are now represented by able champions of Free Speech, Free Labor, Free Homes
                        for free men, Freedom of the Press, and proper Protection to American
                        industry should continue in the same hands. We have as eloquent, as talented
                        and as worthy a member of Congress--in the Hon. EDWARD McPHERSON--as is to
                        be found in the country. Every dictate of prudence and patriotism teachers
                        us that where we are faithfully represented, and can again procure the
                        services of honest, reliable men, we should never hesitate for a moment
                        about our course.</p>
                    <p>Let us then nominate the gifted young advocate of our cause, who has won for
                        himself so enviable a reputation during the one term he has served in
                        Congress, without a dissenting voice. This district is entirely too doubtful
                        for us to run any risks about carrying it. Mr. McPHERSON has carried it
                        once, and his name is surrounded with the prestige of success which will add
                        materially to his prospects again. Let us have, then, the gifted McPHERSON
                        for our candidate, and there will be no doubt of his election.</p>

                    as to take away some support of locofocoism in Pennsylvania.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Several times, recently, the Spirit has harped
                        upon the subject of negroes voting The sap-heads are to dumb to know that a
                        few years since negroes had the right to vote in Pennsylvania; that they
                        exercised the right, and that they voted the Locofoco
                            ticket. We remember having seen, upon more than one occasion, in
                        this county, certain Locofoco township politicians leading up their "culled
                        brethren" to the polls and voting them for Jackson, for Van Buren and,
                        generally having them to go "the whole hog" for the D-e-m-o-c- r-a-c-y.</p>
                    <p>The right of suffrage was never denied to negroes in this State till after
                        the adoption of the present constitution, when they were deprived the
                        privilege of assisting to fasten locofocoism upon the people. The
                        Legislature which provided for the revision of the Constitution was composed
                        of a majority opposed to the heresie of locofocoism. The Governor who
                        approved the law--honest old Joseph Ritner--will scarcely be claimed by the
                        locofocos as belonging to their party. The Convention which framed the
                        present Constitution, depriving the SPIRIT'S friends of
                            their former privilege, was composed of a majority of Whigs.
                        After giving the whiners of the Spirit, who
                        lounge around the street corners in idleness, no person appreciating their
                        professional worth, all this "light" upon their
                        favorite theme, we shall not be surprised to see them wearing crape in their
                        distress over the loss of their sable coadjutors.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The demoralization of the Democratic party caused by the recent serious
                        division into opposing and bitterly relentless factions, is likely to do
                        more damage, says the Philadelphia City Journal,
                        than the original engineers of the movement ever calculated upon. The split,
                        however easily effected, and however unavoidable under the pressing
                        contingencies of the case, was an undoubted surprise to the great mass of
                        Democratic voters. Outside of the immediate leaders and the mercenary camp
                        followers, whose only watchword is, "To the victor belong the spoils!" and
                        whose only principles are the traditional "loaves and fishes," there is a
                        large element of the party which really is imbued with true patriotism, and
                        whose devotion to the Democratic standard is based upon an earnest
                        conviction that the aims of the organization are elevated and beneficent. IF
                        they have adhered to candidates, becase [sic] regularly indorsed by the
                        conventions of the party, this adhesion has not been through any servile
                        attachment to men, considered apart from certain well-recognized principles.
                        If they have rejoiced over well-won victories, it has not been from personal
                        satisfaction at the elevation of particular leaders, but only because the
                        successful candidates have been identified, by a consistent record, with the
                        cardinal ideas of true Democracy.</p>
                    <p>We make no account of an equally large fraction of the Democratic forces who
                        have no fervent, but who, through ignorance or indifference, have been
                        content to go to the ballot-box and blindly vote any ticket, the names on
                        which are sanctified by the aroma of "regular nominations." This floating
                        element in the present embarrassment of two Democratic Presidantial [sic]
                        candidates, will be about equally divided between Breckinridge and Douglas.
                        This supposition is based on the fact that, not knowing the essential
                        difference of principle between the two candidates, they will select either
                        side which promises the surest success. As the result is doubtful between
                        the two chiefs, so far as the numerical show of votes is involved, the
                        prospect is certain that the inert mass of the substratum of the Democracy
                        will be severely exactly in two.</p>
                    <p>But of the intelligent element--the truly conservative portion, to which we
                        have already made allusion--the future disposition in the canvass is by no
                        means certain. The ties of traditional harmony, which have bound the party
                        into a powerful and constantly victorious unit, have ceased to have any
                        longer the power of cohesion.</p>
                    <p>The party obligations of fealty to party nominations cease as a matter of
                        course, and all the members of the organization are free as air to vote for
                        any candidate they may please to choose. Their minds are equally free to
                        study and examine the patriotic platform of the Republican candidates, and
                        to recognize there the ancient cardinal principles of old-fashioned
                        democratic faith. The conservative record of Mr. Lincoln, the moderation of
                        the Republican leaders in their political views, and the universal devotion
                        of all Republicans to the Constitution and the Union must, as a matter of
                        necessity, draw off to the Republican standard a very large portion of those
                        who have hitherto been affiliated with the Democracy. Once the doors of the
                        Democratic fold are wide open, the freed flock are ready to go at once to
                        "fields and pastures new." The stampede has begun already and in all parts
                        of the country, old-line Democrats are coming out by thousands in favor of
                        Lincoln and Hamlin. The indications are abundant that the campaign of 1860
                        will resemble the tornado of 1840. The probabilities are, that the
                        Republican ticket will carry in November a larger popular vote than was ever
                        accorded before to any national candidates. The cause is onward and upward,
                        and every day and hour the political skies grow brighter and brighter.</p>
