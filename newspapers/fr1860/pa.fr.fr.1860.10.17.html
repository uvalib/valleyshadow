<b>Great Meeting At The Wigwam. Telling Speech Of Col. McClure</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>In his speech at Wigwam on Oct. 6th, A. K. McClure makes fun of the
                    Democrats'--Breckinridge, Douglas and Bell--attempt to fuse into one party. He
                    also criticizes the Evening Journal for 'assailing the private character' of

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors mention that the vote for the First Congressional District has

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Carl Schurz' speech examines Douglas' efforts to 'solve' the slavery issue

                    for his disregard or intentional misinterpretation of the Declaration of
                    Independence and Constitution, for claiming his concept of Popular Sovereignty
                    is the same as Jefferson's, and for his indifference as to whether slavery is

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A response to a Spirit's article titled with the above quote. The article
                    was a list of over seventy names of Breckinridge supporters--all of them wealthy
                    whites. The Repository wonders where Bill Boyle's name is--that he must not be
                    grand enough.<br>(Names in announcement:  Bill Boyle)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Under the above caption, the Spirit, of this date,
                        gives a long list--containing over seventy names--of Honorables and
                        Ex-Honorables, Governors, and Ex-Governors, and other celebrities, including
                        the "Old Public Functionary," who are supporting the aristocratic,
                        nigger-driving candidate--John C. Breckinridge--for the Presidency. Formerly
                        that paper professed to belong to the "dirty shirt" party; now it is trying
                        to button-hole the grandees of the land. WE have looked in vain for the name
                        of Bill Boyle among the distinguised [sic] supporters of the great
                        Kentuckian. The party, doubtless, has become too grand to have a rag, tag
                        and bob-tail list-which accounts for the absence of our neighbor's beautiful phiz from the picture gallery which he
                        presents.</p>
                    <p>We call the special attention of the working-men of this county to the list
                        of kid-glove, ruffled-shirt gentlemen, whom the
                            Spirit parades with so much display, as the
                        "Supporters of John C. Breckinridge." Not one poor man to be found in the
                        list. Not one mechanic there. Not one laboring man to grace the column. The
                        reason is obvious; the niggerized party care nothing about POOR WHITES.
                        Their whole concern is for the owners of slaves.</p>
                    <p>Those who are for ABRAHAM LINCOLN for the Presidency, are of a different
                        stamp; they are: POOR WHITES, who earn their daily bread by honest toil; the
                        frugal FARMERS, whom the supporters of Breckinridge style "small fisted;"
                        the sturdy, industrious MECHANICS, whom the silk-stocking supporters of
                        Breckinridge call "Greasy," the bone and sinew of the Free North, whom
                        aristocrats, upon the Spirit's list denounce as
                        "mud sills of society." These, a glorious host, who did so nobly in October,
                        and who will repeat the dose in November, are the supporters of LINCOLN.
                        Compare the lists and see which is really the most honorable in a Republican
                        county.</p>
