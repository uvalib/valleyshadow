<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Complaints of the mistreatment done to Kansas by the President and
                    Congressmen who did not give it statehood. The writer mentions the economic

                    investment until it becomes a state. Mention of recovery from the recent
                    drought. Also mention of free negroes being kidnapped or killed by

<b>(No Title)</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An opinion that girls should spend time on modern languages, instead of

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>As a general rule, we think girls had better learn modern languages than
                        ancient. One reason for this opinion is, that a girl of good abilities and
                        superior resolution can obtain a respectable knowledge of a modern language
                        in two or three years; whereas to become truly proficient in Latin or Greek
                        is a ten years' labor. A moderate acquaintance with these two languages
                        would, however, be beneficial to any young lady, and two or three years'
                        study of them, in connection with other branches, could do no harm. The
                        study of a foreign language is, in the highest degree, beneficial and
                        educating. With regard to mathematics, we should not desire a daughter of
                        ours to go beyond arithmetic, algebra; and the first six books of Euclid's
                        geometry.</p>

<b>The Difference</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An humorous observation of the double standard applied to the behavior of
                    men and women in public. Affectionate displays by men are tolerated, but if done
                    by women, then indecent.<br>

<b>Foul Corruption</b><br> (Column 1)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A criticism of James Buchanan's term as President--that although he
                    promised an honest term, it has been full of bribery and theft, including the
                    embezzlement of funds by Isaac Fowler, during his term as Post Master of New

<b>Forced Into It</b><br> (Column 2)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>an Observation that the Northern Democrats have little backbone as they
                    constantly give in to the Southern Democrats' demands--such as repealing both
                    the Tariff of 1842 and the Missouri Compromise. The Northern Democrats showed
                    some back-bone at the National Conventions in Charleston and Baltimore, but only
                    for self-preservation upon return to their constituents. They have lost much
                    support for abandoning "Popular Sovereignty."<br>

<b>Highly Appropriate</b><br> (Column 3)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Abraham is the appropriate Republican candidate since he is a perfect
                    example of what good will happen if the Republicans' policy of "Free homes for
                    Free white men" prevail. Give a poor white man land in the territories and he
                    will become 'the self-made man.'<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The position of the Republican party has been, from its formation, one of
                        hostility to the spreading of Slavery over the fair, fertile surface of our
                        wide-spreading western Territories; without, in
                        the least, desiring to interfere with that system of labor, and domestic
                        polity, in the States where it exists. Our
                        doctrine has been, Free homes for Free white men; the Territories ar for the
                        sons and daughters of poor whites, and are not intended as places for
                        rearing human beings for the auction block.</p>
                    <p>There could not, therefore, be anything more highly appropriate than the
                        selection by the Republicans of Abraham Lincoln as the standard-bearer of
                        that party. He is the son of a poor man; he, by indomitable perseverance,
                        raised himself from the depths of poverty and obscurity to be one of the
                        first men of a great nation of Free men. He was reared in the wilds of our
                        new western country, and is an excellent proof that Freedom is the proper
                        condition of our broad, smiling Territories. Had he been raised in the
                        South--where he was born--in all probability he would never have raised
                        above the level of that abject, depressed class of human beings, the most
                        wretched on earth, the poor whites of the South; but a kind Providence led
                        his mother to emigrate with her small children, after the death of Abraham's
                        father, to a young Free State, and great things are in store for the
                        self-made man, as a necessary result of the Free institutions of Free
                        States.</p>
                    <p>His high moral character, not being addicted to any of the vices of the age,
                        renders his selection in other respects highly appropriate. The object of
                        our form of Government is to elevate mankind, raise the bowed down, and
                        provide an asylum for the oppressed and down- trodden sons of grief and
                        sorrow, wherever they may hail from. The design of the founders of the
                        Republic was to people the far West with toiling, intelligent, frugal
                        farmers to our shores for the stricken children suffering from wrongful
                        treatment are thrown wide open, so that the seekers after quiet homes from
                        every nation on earth might enter freely and find the object of their
                        search.</p>
                    <p>Elect Abraham Lincoln, the man of the people, the child of poverty, the youth
                        of perseverance and application, the successful lawyer, the gifted
                        statesman, the champion of Freedom, of Free homes for Free men, of keeping
                        Slavery out of, so that poor white men may enter into the rich, teeming
                        Territories of the great West, and the objects and aims of the great and
                        good men who established our Free form of Government will be carried out in
                        every particular. There is no man in the nation whose selection would have
                        been so highly appropriate. From the ranks of poverty and laborious
                        industry, he can fully appreciate the position of the millions of poor men
                        in the land; raising himself, by herculean efforts, under the benign
                        influences of Freedom, his election will prove of incalculable benefit to
                        every class of our citizens--especially will it be calculated to increase in
                        the minds of the people a proper admiration of Republicanism.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The anniversary of our Nation's birthday, passed off very pleasantly. The day
                        dawned amidst the thunder of cannon by the Chambers Artillery, Capt. P. B.
                        Housum, commanding</p>
                    <p>The morning sky was overhung with clouds, and many hopes for a pleasant day
                        seemed to be blasted; but at last the clouds were dispersed, and the weather
                        turned out most propitious.</p>
                    <p>The Lutheran and Presbyterian Sabbath Schools of this place, according to
                        previous arrangements, proceeded to the Rail Road, where a very large train
                        of Cars were in readiness to convey them, the former to Greencastle, where
                        they where [sic] to meet the Lutheran Schools of Greencastle and Hagerstown
                        in a union celebration of the day; and the latter to Hagerstown, where it
                        united with the Presbyterian School, of that place in a similar
                        demonstration. We have understood that at both Greencastle and Hagerstown,
                        the best of feeling prevailed, and that all were delighted with the
                        ceremonies of the occasion.--Hundreds of our citizens had assembled at the
                        Depot to witness the departure of the train that was to convey such a dense
                        mass of our cherished ones to these distant points.--When the train was put
                        in motion, with the flags and evergreens, and beautiful devices with which
                        the locomotive was decorated, it presented a sight long to be remembered.
                        All returned about 7 o'clock, in the evening, much delighted with their
                        excursion, and without an accident or any circumstance occurring to mar the
                        pleasures of the day.</p>
                    <p>With the departure of so many children from our midst, with their teachers
                        and many of their parents, our streets were left comparatively deserted.</p>
                    <p>Social parties celebrated the day differently, in pic-nics, fishing parties,
                        &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>The Chambers Artillery, Capt. P. B. Housum commanding, paraded our streets in
                        full feather, and we must say, that we never seen the Company present a
                        finer appearance. Their ranks were well filled; their marching,
                        counter-marching and other evolutions that we observed them going through,
                        we thought well done. As thy marched through the streets, they fired a
                        National Salute of thirty-three blank cartridges, by sections. In the
                        Diamond several discharges of musketry took place by Company, and in each
                        instance, the report was as the report of one gun. The firing by Company was
                        better executed, in our opinion, than that by sections. The Company then
                        proceeded to the residence of Hon. Geo. Chambers, after whom it has been
                        named, and saluted him by a discharge of musketry by company, which was
                        exceedingly well done. The Judge came to his door and in a neat, appropriate
                        and patriotic address acknowledged the compliment.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The counties along the Southern portion of Pennsylvania at this time offer
                        inducements to enterprising and intelligent settlers rarely to be found,
                        even in our country, where broad acres are so abundant. We will state a few
                        of the reasons.</p>
                    <p>The Counties of Franklin, Fulton, Bedford, Somerset, Fayette, Huntington and
                        Washington contain a large number of as fine land as is to be found in the
                        country. The bottoms are broad and rich, most of the hills are arable, there
                        is an abundance coal and iron, the country is all healthy and the climate
                        mild and favorable; yet the lands can be had for a very moderate price.
                        Speculation has never visited the region and therefore the actual settler
                        can go there. There are reasons for this. In past years the taxes have been
                        high in the state and these counties, except a small part of Huntingdon have
                        enjoyed no benefits of the works for which the tax has been levied. The
                        state debt is now being decreased while the property is being enhanced, and
                        the days of high taxes have therefore gone by, and the seeker after good
                        positions can therefore turn his attention there with every prospect of
                        satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>There is no class of our population that so directly feels the benefit of
                        works of internal improvement as the owner and tiller of the soil, and while
                        rail roads add to the value of far western lands, it has now come to be well
                        known that the long distance from market is a heavy tax on the products of
                        the soil, and therefore the high price given by the first impulse has not
                        been maintained and sensible men are in a way to look nearer home for
                        investment of money and muscle.</p>
                    <p>The question then occurs, will the southern counties which we have named in
                        Pennsylvania, be opened to market by rail road, and how soon, who will do
                        it? We will answer these questions from our stand point and as the case
                        presents itself to us.</p>
                    <p>Gov. Clinton and his compeers, many years ago, wisely built the New York
                        Canal, necessarily through the state and to the great lakes. It built up
                        towns and created wealth along the line. That was the foundation of the
                        Central N. Y. rail road which was built from city to city as a local road,
                        not as a national highway. New York wanted a road into the City to cut off
                        the trade taken by the Central and Great Western to Boston and the Erie rod
                        was built where it is United States the state of Pennsylvania was not then
                        open to the construction of roads to New York. Wisdom has come by age and
                        now all states welcome roads from all points; but many of the prominent men
                        of New York had deep interests in these roads; the crash of 57 exposed the
                        grade, with many sharp curves and twenty miles longer from Harrisburg to
                        Pittsburg than the line we have named.</p>
                    <p>At Pittsburg the river is bridged and the whole northwest is open by the
                        shortest possible rail road to Chicago. A road is being built to
                        Steubenville, Ohio, where another bridge is incourse of erection across the
                        Ohio, River, opening the centre of the state through roads already made.</p>
                    <p>The side of Pittsburg, by the construction of some thirty miles to
                        Washington, the Hempfield road is reached, terminating at Wheeling Va. the
                        western terminus of the Baltimore and Ohio road, where another rail road
                        bridge is being built across the Ohio river thus at once opening the
                        shortest and best possible route from New York to St. Louis thro' the
                        Central Ohio and its connections.</p>
                    <p>The distance from New York to Cincinnati by this latter route will be 705
                        miles with light grades and few curves, while by the Central N. Y. road it
                        is 922, and by the present Pennsylvania route 763.</p>
                    <p>How much is to be made? About 150 miles all together which will cost to make
                        and stock as a fist [sic] class road not more than eight millions of
                        dollars, and probably much less. And being built with cash instead of bonds
                        at 50 cts. to the dollar, and for a great through national road, instead of
                        turning aside to every man's farm, it will be a paying road.</p>
                    <p>Do you think the owners of the soil along such a route will be content until
                        it is made? They will not let it sleep; but give to it all the energy and
                        means they can raise, as it will enhance their property beyond measure. They
                        will not probably be able to raise all the means; but what they cannot raise
                        New York will so soon as the matter is fully understood,</p>
                    <p>There are now circumstances that are directing the attention of thinking men
                        in this city more than ever before to this matter. The British Grand Trunk
                        rail road through Canada has made giant strides during the last year. It is
                        now finished to Detroit, and better stocked than any road in this country,
                        at a cost of over $60,000,000. It is now absorbing a large amount of the
                        western produce and extending its arms in every direction by the leasing of
                        our western roads, evidently aiming to secure an interest in and control of
                        the Pacific railroad whenever our Congress shall provide for its
                        construction. We all know New York must defeat this effort. She cannot do it
                        by the Erie road and the broad guage extension. It is too long, crooked, of
                        high grades, runs through too poor a country, and like the Grand Trunk too
                        liable to obstructions by snow and ice. The enlarged cana- [sic] will not
                        fully serve because half the year closed by ice; while the great Washington
                        route rail road through Pennsylvania will have none of these difficulties to
                        contend with, and with a double track and ample stock will pour more produce
                        into New York than she now receives by any other route, and forming the
                        shortest line between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic, will soon become
                        the world's favorite highway.</p>
                    <p>When will it be made? It may be delayed by the inactivity or folly of
                        interested parties along the line, or the want of intelligence or
                        concentration in New York but we believe it will be completed in three
                        years.</p>
                    <p>We have given our reason at length why we suggest to enterprising
                        correspondents to seek locations in Southern Pennsylvania.--N. Y. Homestead Journal.</p>

                        this errant, and undoubtedly ungrateful fugitive, who makes so many
                        pretensions, has cleverness enough to invent so many tales, and is covered
                        with so many scars--will the good Dr. in return, answer us a question or
                        two? We want to know about those scars, partly from moral, but chiefly from
                        surgical motives.</p>
                    <p>How cam there to be a shot in Littleton's right wrist on the inside of his
                        arm? The Boy, we presume, is not trusted with firearms, and if he were, we
                        do not well see how he could shoot himself in that particular spot. Neither
                        is it very likely that he could have been shot by any of his companions when
                        sporting, as recreation of that sort, we believe, is not a favorite in his
                        class of the happy prolaries of the sweet South. If we were a Northern white
                        man and mechanic, one of our unhappy "mud-sills," we should think he had
                        been shot at with some murderous intention; but that, we know, is a thing
                        they never do on the other side of the border.</p>
                    <p>Now, on one of his eyes is "a small scar." Is this also from a shot? Did a
                        part of the charge that lodged in the wrist just fall short of a lodgment in
                        the brain also? Or was it some other assailant of the citadel of life that
                        failed to make a breach here in the walls.</p>
                    <p>"On the right leg and thigh," also, there are "several scars." Possibly, gun
                        shot. That they are on the right side, also, favors that supposition.
                        Perhaps it is these that cause "the rocking walk," for gun-shot wounds are
                        sometimes known to be inconvenient, and even crippling. But if the
                        supposition be correct that a charge of buck-shot has left these wounds and
                        scars, propound to us the occasion, good Doctor, of such shooting. Here and
                        there among us is a man who has brought home from war some honorable scars;
                        here and there a man whom some accident has crippled; but we do not remember
                        ever to have heard before of a case like this, where a wretch is scarred
                        over half his body with marks of wounds, one of which, at least, was made by
                        shot, and others, it is rational to conclude, have a similar cause. Hides so
                        peppered are unknown among us, except it be of beasts. Are men thus used in
                        Mississippi?</p>
                    <p>We reiterate our promise--Dr. Cooper shall certainly hear from us if we hear
                        from Lit. But our report may not be as mollifying to the Doctor's outraged
                        fellings, as his salve, we do not permit ourselves to doubt, has always been
                        to the wounds of Lit. On the whole, we think that Boy has had shooting
                        enough. We hope he has a pass of some sort. We trust his ability to "tell
                        any kind of a tale to suit his purpose," will stand him in good stead; and
                        his laudible anxiety to get to the Black Republicans shall be gratified, if
                        we fall in with him, for he shall go at once to the headquarters of the
                        nearest Republican Club. They are law-abiding men, and will render due
                        obedience to the Fugitive Slave law, when properly brought home to their
                        consciences and reason. But if Littleton gets among them, and Samuel Cooper,
                        M. D., is not very close behind him, the chances of a Commissioner for a ten
                        dollar fee will be, in that case, small. As Littleton makes "some pretension
                        to proper language, as he can read and write," a pretension and
                        accomplishment to write, it is very clear, that Dr. himself has no title, we
                        should not be willing to guarantee that some rough fellows in this
                        neighborhood might not, if they are caught the two together, give up the M.
                        D. to the copper-colored as a fugitive from justice, with rather more
                        readiness than they would hand over the boy to the M. D. as a fugitive from
                        labor. Not that we approve of such conduct, but we think there might be some
                        disposition to such behavior among the rougher sort of the "dam
                    scoundrels."</p>
