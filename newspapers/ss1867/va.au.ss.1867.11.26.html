                        eloquent and directly to the point, and impressed all with the conviction
                        that none should fail to vote at the election upon the adoption or rejection
                        of the Constitution. The simple issue now is whether the white race is to be
                        ruled or not by the colored race.</p>

                    <p>It is very far from our purpose needlessly to excite the public
                        apprehensions. Rest and quiet are absolutely necessary for the resuscitation
                        of our impoverished Commonwealth, and we hold that hand most useful in this
                        exigency which shall best succeed in pouring oil on the troubled waves of
                        the commotion around us. Yet we should be recreant to a high public duty, if
                        this day we failed to declare our solemn conviction that a servile war is
                        impending in the South. The information which we receive from all parts of
                        Virginia, from our own correspondence, and from the columns of our
                        cotemporaries in interior towns, furnishes positive, emphatic and
                        irrefragable proof that the negroes are everywhere banded in secret, sworn
                        leagues, which hold almost continuous sessions daily, nightly hourly,
                        debating, discussing and preparing for an open atrocious and merciless war
                        of violence, rapine and pillage upon the whites.</p>
                    <p>Under the instigation of the handful of white wretches who lead them, the
                        objective point of the negroes has been all along the possession of the
                        negroes has been all along the possession of the lands, the houses, and, in
                        general terms, the property of their late masters. The plan of the Radical
                        congress to put these negroes into power as the political masters of the
                        South opened up a way for the attainment of their object, under the forms of
                        law, by ordinances of "Convention," "Legislatures" and such like bodies,
                        composed of negroes. It was intended that the enactments of these bodies
                        under the names of "confiscations," "disfranchisement," etc., should deprive
                        property-holders of their vested rights and turn their possessions over to
                        the negroes under the shadow of numberless pretexts. The great re-action in
                        Northern sentiment, and the plainly expressed determination of the Northern
                        people no longer uphold Congress in its diabolical undertaking to make
                        political masters of our late domestic slaves, and thus degrade white men
                        for the crime of being white, has only infuriated the fierce passions of the
                        negroes, and they are now preparing to siege by force what they have
                        hitherto hoped to acquire without open violence as the fruits of the
                        punitive policy which has characterized Congress in dealing with the white
                        "rebels" of the South. This is the philosophy of the present situation.</p>
                    <p>The bitterness of the negroes now contrasted with their previous docility and
                        tractability, presents no phenomenon in either the political or social
                        aspect. It is but the effect which follows cause. The seed of hostility
                        between the races took root in the feculent soil of an avaricious greed for
                        the possessions of other people, which was implanted in the breasts of the
                        negroes by the miserable wretches who hoped thereby to serve their own
                        purposes. Such plants spring up with marvelous fecundity, and, like all
                        noxious plant, are difficult to eradicate when they once germinate. It was
                        impossible but that negroes should continue to entertain the notions with
                        which their minds had been filled, and when the re-action in Northern
                        sentiment blasted their hopes of the early realization of their legislative
                        schemes for the plunder of their former masters, it would have been a marvel
                        had that circumstance altered their wishes in the premises. On the contrary,
                        it only created a vengeful desire to repair that disappointment by the
                        appliances of violence. And accordingly they have proceeded to organize for
                        violence.</p>
                    <p>In their secret political leagues they have found the ground already broken
                        for their purposes, and in the nightly meetings of these conclaves, they
                        openly discuss their schemes of violence, and gloat over the feast of rapine
                        and pillage to which they invite themselves. So far do they carry these
                        things that they even, as near Lynchburg, mark out each individual white man
                        for death, and determine the method of his destruction; or, as in
                        Mecklenburg county, concert measures for the early seizure of the white
                        men's possessions and name the day on which they will "occupy the land"; or,
                        as in this city, make open threats to shed the blood of white men until the
                        "streets shall run knee deep in blood"; or, as in all
                            parts of the State, procure arms, ammunition, knives, pikes and
                        bludgeons, and proceed to organize into companies, regiments and other
                        military formations. </p>
                    <p>A pregnant fact connected with these atrocious proceedings is that the
                        leaders most truculent and boldest are some of the "delegates" lately
                        elected to the Convention soon to assemble in this city. These men
                        instinctively perceive that they must return to the base obscurity from
                        which they have risen only as the turbid stream throws up mire an filth,
                        unless they can make the negroes permanently masters in the South, and they
                        seek to avert their doom by these measures of violence.</p>
                    <p>It is not necessary here to discuss any further the causes which have led to
                        the present alarming situation. We have only to meet the facts as they
                        stand. It is scarcely worth while either to predict the result of these
                        proceedings if they continue in operation. No white man can take any
                        pleasure in the thought that these poor negroes are hastening their own
                        destruction by their truculent conduct.</p>
                    <p>History furnishes no example of a successful servile war, and this is not the
                        age in which teachings can be disregarded with impunity.-The first gun fired
                        from a negro regiment, the first drop of white blood spilled in such a
                        contest, will unite the white people of America in the indissoluble bonds of
                        a common race or color. It will exemplify in a twinkling that "blood is
                        thicker than water," and the people of the North will rise in a solid
                        phalanx, unparalleled, except when they received the news that Fort Sumter
                        had been captured.</p>
                    <p>But it is better to prevent crime than to punish it. The atrocious designs of
                        the negroes would never have been conceived, or if conceived, would have
                        been nipped in the bud, but for the fact that they know the defenceless
                        condition of the whites against whom they entertain these designs. The
                        negroes are all armed, and well armed. The whites have scarcely a fowling
                        piece among them. This is the secret of negro truculence. In view of this we
                        call upon Gen. Schofield, in the name of the white people of Virginia,
                        instantly to take measures for the public safety. We most solemnly and
                        earnestly call upon him to garrison the towns and villages of the State with
                        reliable and well armed troops, who will be on hand to suppress the first
                        attempt at an outbreak. Let him do this without a moment's delay, or it may
                        be too late.</p>
