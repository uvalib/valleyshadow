<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The following article from the Enquirer and
						Examiner so clearly, forcibly and admirably expresses our views that
						we adopt it and present it thus prominently in lieu of what we may have
						written ourselves upon the same subject. We hope that the length of the
						article will not deter any of our readers from giving it a careful perusal. </p>
					<p>It was Ralph Waldo Emerson, we think, who said: "The lesson of life is
						practically to believe what the years and the centuries say against the
						hours." Let us profit by the suggestion. Let us heed the lessons of the
						centuries speaking against the teachings of the hour. Let us draw wisdom and
						take warning from the former. It will inspire us with fortitude and hope to
						disregard the threats and alarms of the latter.</p>
					<p>The lesson of the hour is indeed a dark and dispiriting one. It tells us that
						hope has departed, that effort is vain, that we are a conquered people, and
						must accept what terms a capricious conqueror may impose. It tells us of the
						dark clouds that lower, the dangers that threaten, and advise us to avert
						destruction by bowing to the storm. This is what the hours say.</p>
					<p>But what say the centuries? They tell us that though Truth may, for a time,
						be trodden down, though Might may temporarily triumph over Right; though in
						the conflict for Freedom superior force may conquer-yet no people ever permanently lost their liberties except through their
							own recreancy to principal. And the centuries further say that
						whenever and wherever a people have lost their liberties by their own
						voluntary surrender of principle, they have never
							regained them. When a people put the yoke on their own necks and
						thrust their own hands into the manacles, then indeed is their future
						without hope. </p>
					<p>Hitherto the South has not proved recreant to the principles for which she
						fought. Virginia is scarred all over with the testimonies of her devotion.
						Shall she now lay down all she retains of her glorious name "in the brave
						old days of old" and voluntarily assume the livery-not of her conquerors,
						but of her conqueror's camp followers? We have yielded the conflict in arms
						to overwhelming odds, but when General Lee surrendered his sword, it was to
						grim Necessity, not to Grant. When the States repealed their ordinances of
						secession it was only a formal expunction of what was already a dead letter
						in law. When they ratified emancipation it was only acknowledging that the
						war had left them too weak to preserve the institution of slavery any
						longer. Do the advocates of "co-operation" think that necessity compels us
						to "co-operate?" Can it be shown that we are obliged
						 to enlist in the Black Republican party, and march with them to the
						accomplishment of their ends? Shall we presume the necessity of it before
						exhausting all means of escape or resistance? Have we, indeed, exhausted all
						such means? Have we, indeed, exhausted all such means? The sword has
						failed-we would not again draw it from its scabbard. But is there no weapon
						mightier than the sword? There is! It is the patient
							fortitude of a heroic people. The courage to
							endure is greater than the spirit to
						achieve. In many a stern clash of arms we have displayed the heroism of action, let us now display the
						sublime heroism of suffering. Suffering becomes
						holy, and is robbed of it sting when incurred in behalf of high principle.
						It is this which has cheered the martyr at the stake. It was this which came
						with soothing presence to the "earlier Virginians," and enabled Washington
						to give Valley Forge the grandest page in American history. Devotion to
						principle has sweetened the scaffold and smoothed the edge of the
						executioner's axe. It has gilded poverty with a lustre which wealth could
						ever boast. It has given the peasant a grace and dignity richer than the
						diadems of royalty. Suffering for principle! It is the baptism of fire,
						through which God purifies his chosen. </p>
					<p>We may be compelled to stand by, while others slay Truth; but why dip our own
						hands in her blood? Let others bear "the deep damnation of [her] taking
						off." not ourselves Unless slain by us she will assuredly rise again, not
						like Banquo's ghost to shake her "gory locks" at us, but as a rejuvenated
						and smiling goddess-a Venus to point the way to a Hespedrian clime of fate.
						Well may she say "though my enemy slay me, yet
						will I rise again." But alas, if slain "in the house of her own friends" she
						falls to rise no more. </p>
					<p>Our refusal to "co-operate" may continue our exclusion. We may suffer from
						it. But let not the hour provoke us to impatience. Let us remember what the
						centuries say: The patient endurance of suffering for
							the sake of a great principle is always rewarded by the triumph at last
							of that principle. Freedom draws her nutriment from the breasts
						of none but heroes; and if a people are willing to
							barter principle for ignoble ease ,
						she takes her indignant flight, never more to return. </p>
					<p>The centuries teach another lesson, too. Where a people are seduced from
						principle by the promise of advantage-when they close their ears to the
						voice of the centuries and hearken to the syren of the hour-they not only
						lose the principle which they barter, but fail to obtain the promised price.
						Too late they find that principle died in the hands of its purchasers, and
						absolves them from all promises.</p>
					<p>Better listen to the centuries. They have a voice of hope for all who know
						how to "suffer and be strong." They say that the madness of the hour must
						some day yield to returning reason. The breath of passion is transitory.
						Violent excitement soon exhausts itself. Action and re-action are
						proportionate.</p>
					<p>But, what if, by our own act, we deprive ourselves of the opportunities which
						lie hid in the lap of the future? If we mention the injustice of the hour by
						"co-operation," if we endorse and adopt as our own, what Radical legislation
						has prescribed for us-how shall we escape the
							consequences of our own action. We will ourselves have destroyed
						our legal remedy, and the verdict of the centuries will be against us. </p>
					<p>No! Let us posses our souls in patience. Let us retain our reverence for
						principles, though for a while overthrown, confident that they will rise
						again if we are mindful of their memory.</p>
					<p>It is a hard , this disbelieving the hours and trusting the centuries,
						but it never was 02 more important to learn it than now.
						The real battle has come. It is a sterner conflict than Shiloh or Gettysburg
						for the issue is not a principle-the principle is acknowledged by us all-but
						it is devotion to principle. The greater includes
						the loss. If Southern devotion to the principle of justice shall shine out
						clear, bright and steadfast , amid all the storms
						of rage and persecution, then that principle itself sill ultimately illumine
						the darkness of our future. But if our devotion to truth, honor and
						constitutional right cannot outlive the ordeal through which it is now
						passing, then indeed may we sing the requiem of liberty. No fire from heaven
						will rekindle her extinguished torch. </p>
					<p>The Promethean spark is in our own bosoms. Our destiny is in our own hands in
						spite of all our enemies may do. Only we  can
						make or mar our fate. If we are true to principle, it will be true to us. If
						we desert it, it will scorn us. If we listen to the hour, the centuries will
						sing us no song. If we accept the present, we throw away the future. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>"We are to-day the victims of the most gigantic crime of the of the
						nineteenth century. Not only have the people of ten great States been robbed
						of the most valuable portion of their property, but what was yesterday a
						"chattel," is to-day clothed with political powers of which the most
						cultivated of the white race of the South have been stripped. To-day, the
						people of many of the Southern States are at the mercy of a race brutalized
						by centuries of slavery. Thousands of the best, ablest, purest and most
						gifted of our statesmen, orators, authors, soldiers and advocates have been
						outlawed; while every adult male negro, however corrupt, ignorant, and
						beastly in instincts and vices, has been clothed with all the rights of
						citizenship.</p>
					<p>Is there a Virginian who believes there is a just God and can doubt that the
						vile party which has thus sought to degrade and dishonor as must sooner or
						later fall beneath the wrath of all seeing Providence, which permits no
						great crime to escape chastisements and retribution? All us must feel that
						sooner or later this merciless party will be hurled from power, and
						reparation made from the cruel wrongs which it has committed.</p>
					<p>None know better than the leaders of the Radical party, that, it has violated
						too grossly every right of the citizen, and trampled too unblushingly upon
						the Constitution, for its existence to be tolerated one moment after the
						reason of the nation regains its throne. Hence it is seeking to commit the
						people of the section which it has outraged, insulted and trampled upon, to
						an endorsation of the hideous crimes which have almost annihilated its
						prosperity-It trembles at the thought of the final judgment of the nation
						upon its deprivation of ten millions of people of all their constitutional
						rights, and upon its enfranchisement of hundreds of thousands of illiterate
						and brutal blacks. It is, therefore, seeking by threats and promises to
						secure the "endorsation" of the South of the every offences for which the
						Radicals will be one day punished by defeat and loss of power, and then
						hanged in chains by history. It is seeking to make us "acquiesce" in the
						infernal outrage which it has inflicted upon us in order that when the day
						for vengeance and retribution comes we shall not be able to do our part in
						the overthrow of our oppressors.</p>
					<p>And if their schemes for our political self abasement are successful, we
						shall not be able to hold up our heads like a brave but unfortunate people,
						and resume our former proud position in the family of States. When we have
						voluntarily entered the "African Church Convention" as the equals,
						associates and "co-operators" with Hunnicutt, Underwood and our late slaves,
						we shall be utterly corrupted, prostituted and debauched; we must forever
						thereafter hid our faces in the dust and cry "unclean," "unclean." We shall
						by that act of indecent and most unmanly and ignominious surrender of
						principle, show that we have become the helots of the negro, and that we
						merit all the foul abuse which those with whom we have "affiliated" have
						heaped upon us. When we have pledged ourselves to "extend and perfect the
						organization" of the Radical party, we will have dishonored the memories of
						our dead soldiers, thanked Congress for outlawing our noblest and bravest
						men, declared our humble gratitude for the annihilation of all our rights
						and rejoiced that our late "chattels" have been made our equals. The

					<p>"If it (emancipation) should ever be effected it will be through the agency
						of the Federal Government controlled by the dominant power of the Northern
						States of the confederacy against the resistance and struggle of the
						Southern. It can then only be effected by the prostration of the white race,
						and that would necessarily engender the bitterest feelings of hostility
						between them and the North. But the reverse would be the case between the
						blacks of the South and the people of the North. Owing their emancipation to
						them, they would regard them as friends, guardians, and patrons, and centre,
						accordingly, all their sympathy in them. The people of the North would not
						fail to reciprocate, and to favor them instead of the whites; under the
						influence of such feelings and impelled by fanaticism and love of power,
						they would not stop at emancipation. Another step would be taken-to raise
						them to a political and social equality with their former owners by giving
						them the right of voting and holding public offices under the Federal
						Government. We see the first step towards it in the bill already alluded
						to-to vest the free blacks and slaves with the right to vote on the question
						of emancipation in the District [of Columbia.]-But when once raised to an
						equality they would become the fast political associates of the North,
						acting and voting with them on all questions; and by this political union
						between them holding the white race at the South in complete subjection. The
						blacks, and the profligate whites that might unite with them, would become
						the principal recipients of the Federal offices and patronage, and would, in
						consequence, be raised above the whites of the South in the political and
						social scale. We would, in a word, change conditions with them-a degradation
						greater than has yet fallen to the lot of a free and enlightened people, and
						one from which we could not escape should emancipation take place, (which it
						certainly will if not prevented,) but by fleeing the homes of ourselves and
						our ancestors, and by abandoning our country to our former slaves, to become

					<p>The following is a copy of the Supplementary Reconstruction bill as it passed
						both Houses on Saturday, the 13th , inst:</p>
					<p>Be it enacted, &amp;c., That it is hereby declared to have been the true
						intent and meaning of the act of the second day of March, one thousand eight
						hundred and sixty-seven, entitled, "An act to provide for the more efficient

						on the twenty third day of March, on thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven,
						that the governments then existing in the rebel States of Virginia, North
						Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Florida,
						Texas and Arkansas were not legal State governments, and that thereafter
						said governments, if continued, were continued subject in all respects to

						and to have effect until disapproved, whenever in the opinion of such
						commander the proper administration of said act shall require it, to suspend

						professing to hold or exercise, any civil or military office or duty in such
						district under any power, election, appointment, or authority derived from
						or granted by, or claimed under, any so-called State or the government
						thereof, or any municipal or other division thereof; and upon such
						suspension or removal, such commander, subject to the disapproval of the
						General aforesaid, shall have power to provide from time to time for the
						performance of such duties of such officer or person so suspended or
						removed, by the detail of some competent officer or, soldier of the army, or
						by the appointment of some other person to perform the same, and to fill
						vacancies occasioned by death, resignation or otherwise.</p>
					<p>3. That the General of the armies of the United States shall be invested with
						all the powers of suspension, removal, appointment and detail granted in the
						preceding section to district commanders.</p>
					<p>4. That the acts of the officers of the army already done in removing in said
						districts persons exercising the functions of civil officers and appointing
						others in their stead are hereby confirmed; provided, that any person
						heretofore or hereafter appointed by any district commander to exercise the
						functions of any civil office may be removed either by the military officer

						who are disloyal to the Government of the United States, or who use their
						official influence in any manner to hinder, delay, prevent, or obstruct the
						due and proper administration of this act and the acts to which it is
						supplementary.</p>

						supplementary to an act entitled 'An act to provide for the more efficient
						government of the rebel States,' passed March second, eighteen hundred and
						sixty-seven, and to facilitate restoration," passed March twenty-third,
						eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, shall have the power, and it shall be
						their duty, before allowing the registration of any person, to ascertain
						upon such facts or information as they can obtain, whether such person is
						entitled to be registered under said act, and the oath required by said act
						shall not be conclusive on such question, and no person shall be registered

						shall also have power to examine, under oath, (to be administered by any
						member of such board) any one touching the qualification of any person
						claiming registration; but in every case of refusal by the board to register
						the applicant, and in every case of striking his name from the list as
						hereinafter provided, the board shall make note or memorandum, which shall

						Constitution of the United States or not, and who has afterwards engaged in

						to the enemies thereof, is entitled to be registered to vote, and the words
						"executive or judicial officers in any State," in said oath mentioned, shall
						be construed to include all civil offices created by law for the
						administration of any general law of a State, or for the administration of
						justice.</p>
					<p>7. That the time for completing the original registration profited for in
						said act may, in the discretion of the commander of any district, be
						extended to the first day of October, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven; and
						the boards of registration shall have power and it shall be their duty,
						commencing fourteen days prior to any election under said act, and upon

						period of five days, the registration lists, and upon being satisfied that
						any person not entitled thereto has been registered to strike the name of
						such person from the list, and such person shall not be allowed to vote.-And
						such board shall also, during the same period, add to such registry the
						names of all persons who at that time possess the qualifications required;
						and no person shall at any time be entitled to be registered or to vote by
						reason of any Executive pardon or amnesty for any act or thing which,
						without such pardon or amnesty, would disqualify him from registering or
						voting.</p>
					<p>8. That section four of said last-named act shall be construed to authorize
						the commanding General named therein, whenever he shall deem it needful, to
						remove any member of a board of registration to appoint another in his
						stead, and to fill any vacancy in such board.</p>
					<p>9. That all members of said boards of registration, and all persons hereafter
						elected or appointed to office in said military districts, under any

<b>Grim Statistics</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We learn from the Charleston Mercury , that
						General Howard's official report, which we have not seen, states the
						decrease of the negro population of the South to have been 1,308,000 since
						their emancipation! If these figures represent the real mortality among our
						colored citizens, it requires little prophetic power to foretell what the
						fate of the whole race will be, unless they improve their condition. </p>
					<p>This awful loss is attributed to causalities of war, epidemic diseases,
						intemperance, and reckless living.</p>
					<p>We trust these grim statistics will not be lost upon the thoughtful and
						intelligent freedman.</p>
					<p>Bayne, Henson, and that class should devote their talents to the moral
						improvement of their people; and we hope they will at once attack all the
						vices which beset their race with courage and resolution.</p>
