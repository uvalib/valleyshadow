					<p>General Lee's Opinion of its Practicability and Importance. <br></p>
					<p>Letter from the Hon. John B. Baldwin <br></p>
					<p>LEXINGTON, VA., May 20, 1867,</p>
					<p>MY DEAR SIR-The documents relating to the Covington and Ohio railroad which
						you had the kindness to send me, give the pleasing assurance, as far as I
						have been able to examine them, of the practicability of completing that
						great work. The cautious estimate of Mr. Whitcomb, superintendent of the
						Virginia Central Railroad, gives the cost of finishing the road to the point
						of steamboat navigation on the Kanawha at $5,700,000-and he shows very
						satisfactorily from the steady increase of receipts which has attended every
						extension of the road that the company can undertake the work, and pay out
						of its net revenues the interest on the amount required for each additional
						stage of the road besides the interest on its present debt. When the road
						shall reach the point of communication with the steamers from the Ohio,
						there will be such a large and increasing business, that I think there can
						be no doubt that its completion will be ensured to any point desired; and
						with a maxim grade of less than 30 feet per mile, what mountains of merchandize can be transported from the western
						rivers to the waters of the Atlantic!-Taking Cincinnati as the centre of
						this trade, the transportation by this route will not only be shorter in
						miles as stated in the reports than the more Northern routes, but will be
						the easiest, and will beet with the least interruption in winter, and the
						freight over the road can at all times be landed at points accessible to
						ocean steamers. When these facts are known, there will be, I hope, no
						difficulty in procuring the requisite funds, as capitalists can feel assured
						of the payment of their interest and principal. </p>
					<p>Wishing every success to the road,</p>
					<p>I am, with great respect,</p>
					<p>Your obedient servant,</p>
					<p>R. E. Lee.</p>
					<p>HON. JOHN B. BALDWIN. <br></p>
					<p>STAUNTON, June 5th, 1867.</p>
					<p>Robert H. Maury, Esq.: </p>
					<p>MY DEAR SIR-Yours of the 4th instant is just received, and I hasten to reply.
						The letter of General Lee was written in answer to one from me, sending him
						a copy of the pamphlet published by our commissioners. The letter of such a
						man, on such a subject, containing no restriction upon the use to be made of
						it, I regard as public property, and as such you are at liberty to use it. I
						sent the original to a friend in New York, who takes a lively interest in
						the success of the Covington and Ohio Road, and who, in acknowledging the
						receipt of it says: "The letter of General R. E. Lee will be valuable not
						only for the furtherance of the enterprise, but, to me, it will be a
						souvenir which will be kept with great care as coming from a great and good
						man; a man whose character in my estimation has no superior."</p>
					<p>I see from the Dispatch, of this morning, that our
						contract has been signed, at Wheeling, by the West Virginia Commissioners,
						and I hope that the meeting called for Friday night is an earnest of the
						purpose of the Central Railroad and the City of Richmond to enter at once
						upon this great work with a full sense of hits vital importance to every
						interest in Virginia an especially to all that concerns the manufacturing
						and commercial future of the State. </p>
					<p>I wish I could be present at the meeting, but I find that professional and
						private business, too long postponed for matters of mere public concern,
						imperatively demands my present undivided attention.</p>
					<p>The more I think of the arrangement made with the Central Railroad the better
						I like it, and the more I see in it of hope and promise for the great work
						about which we have thought and talked and worked so earnestly
						together.-Allow me to state very briefly a few of the reasons which give me
						such encouragement.</p>
					<p>1. The Covington and Ohio Road, standing alone, has had merit enough to
						attract the earnest interest of such men as Pell, and Cottenet, and
						Grinnell, and Cutting, and Fish, and to induce them to make active efforts
						to obtain the funds by negotiation in Europe, to enable them to undertake
						and construct the road as and an independent work. These gentlemen are no
						mere speculators or charter brokers; they stand in the very front rank of
						intelligent, sagacious men of capital and of character, whose well
						considered approval of the enterprise goes as far as human judgment can, to
						stamp the work as one of real, substantial merit.</p>
					<p>2. These gentlemen, when planning the construction of the Covington and Ohio
						road, as an independent work, as a matter of course had in their
						contemplation the benefits and advantages to be derived from a connection
						with the Virginia Central road, as a means of receiving and forwarding trade
						and travel. But they had no expectation of any financial connection between
						the two roads, and certainly they never anticipated the possibility of
						making an arrangement by which the two roads, when completed, should be
						worked together in such a manner as to give to the Covington and Ohio road
						the entire earnings of their whole line, to the extent of 8 percent. Upon
						its full cost before the Central road should receive one dollar, and yet
						this is the effect of our recent contract.</p>
					<p>3. The whole line from Richmond to the Ohio is 428 miles long, of which the
						Covington and Ohio is 223 miles and the Central is 205 miles. If completed,
						and worked as separate establishments, having all the benefits of the
						connection in trade and travel, but with distinct accounts and profits there
						could be no doubt that the Central road of 205 miles would be far more
						valuable and profitable than the Covington and Ohio road of 223 miles. The
						new arrangement, however, proposes that all the profits shall go to the
						Covington and Ohio road until they reach 8 per cent upon the outlay for its
						construction, and then that Central road shall begin its receipts out of the
						common earnings.</p>
					<p>4. The stockholders of the Central railroad could never have been induced to
						consent to such an arrangement except upon the conviction that the road when
						completed to the Ohio river, will pay 8 per cent on the entire cost, and
						thus in the end bring about equally among the owners of the two divisions of
						the road.-It may be that the real result will fall somewhat short of this
						expectation, but it is hardly possible that it will fail so entirely as not
						to insure the eight per cent. upon the outlay for the Covington and Ohio
						road. A profit of four or five per cent. on the entire line would be ample
						to meet the requirement of the eight percent. preferred stock, and the
						experience of all the great through lines establishes such a result as among
						the certainties of railroad enterprise.-Even the Central road, in its
						incomplete state, before the war, was actually paying six per cent. on its
						debt and five percent. On its stock besides setting apart a sinking fund.</p>
					<p>5. The best consideration I have been able to give the subject satisfies me
						beyond a doubt that the preferred stock for completing the Covington and
						Ohio road will be a reliable eight per cent. stock free from taxation. If
						this conviction can be impressed upon the minds of capitalists the making of
						the road may be considered an accomplished fact, and it seems to me that
						just here is the point to which we should address our first and most earnest
						efforts. We must render this eight per cent. certain beyond controversy and
						palpable to the most common observation. To do this, it has occurred to me,
						is the proper mission of the cities of Richmond, Petersburg and Norfolk.-Let
						these three cities unite in a guarantee that this preferred stock shall,
						either permanently or for a given number of years, yield eight per cent. and
						let them make efficient and reliable preparation to make good this guarantee
						by a reliable contribution of any deficiency and I think the stock would
						pass in every market for what it professes to be-an eight per cent. stock
						free from taxation. In any ordinary times such a stock for a Virginia
						enterprise would find a home market and even in these times it could hardly
						fail to command the capital required.</p>
					<p>6. Upon the whole I begin to feel a conviction that this great enterprise
						must go on under some auspices and in some form or other. The line when
						completed will have such advantages of distance, grades, curves, climate,
						local business and through connections, that it cannot much longer escape
						the attention of sagacious capitalists as a railroad merely, and its
						importance as the best and shortest outlet for the great products of the
						West seeking the eastern markets will command the interest of all engaged in
						that great commerce. The road will be built, and if fairly and justly
						managed it must do more to build up every Virginia interest than any thing
						that has been done in the way of internal improvement, or than all that has
						been done put together. It should not, however, escape the attention of our
						people that the control of such a line is an object to be struggled for, and
						that already there are symptoms of a movement having in view that object,
						and looking to connections which may go far to deprive us of the chief
						advantages of the work. I hope the people of Virginia will be wise in time,
						and will secure not only the first fruits, but the great harvest to be
						expected from this long hoped for improvement.</p>
					<p>I find and I have written you at greater length than I intended. I know the
						interest you feel in the subject, and you know that I never tire of talking
						and writing about it.</p>
					<p>Yours truly,</p>
					<p>JOHN B. BALDWIN.</p>

					<p>The registration of voters for the 1st 2nd, and 3rd Districts will commence
						on Saturday next, and 22nd of June, and continue, one week only, to
						Saturday, the 29th of June-not to the 29th of July, as erroneously published
						in the advertisement of the "Registration Notice" last week. The places of
						registration for these districts are the following: For the 1st District,
						the Courthouse; for the 2nd, the Market House, in Staunton, and for the 3rd,
						Middle brook.</p>
					<p>But comparatively few will be disfranchised, if the citizens generally avail
						themselves of the opportunity to register as they should certainly do. No
						one not disfranchised by the law should suffer himself to be disfranchised
						by his own neglect or refusal to register. It is unfortunately true that the
						time allowed for registering is very short, and that the time appointed
						occurs at a very busy season of the year, yet no one should allow anything
						but positive physical inability to prevent him from registering within the
						time assigned. It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of
						registering. No one can possibly ever have any cause to regret that he
						registered, but he may have, and most certainly will have, cause to regret
						that he failed to do when the opportunity was presented. From the 22nd to
						the 29th of this month the opportunity to acquire the privilege of voting
						will be presented-after that time, it will be too late, and the opportunity
						will be lost forever. Don't hesitate, don't delay, but go at once to the
						place of registering and have yourself enrolled a voter. It matters not
						whether you wish to vote at the next election or not, you should acquire the
							right to vote, that you may vote when you may
						wish to do so. As we have frequently said, we think that all who can should
						not only register but vote. The first duty is to
						register, and none should fail to do so. There will be time enough, after
						registering, to consider the propriety of voting. If we could speak with the
						voice of a trumpet, we would din the ears of all male citizens over
						twenty-one years of age with the emphatic admonition: Register! REGISTER!! REGISTER!!! </p>
					<p>Every citizen is entitled to register and vote who is not forbidden by the
						three following circumstances combined, namely:</p>
					<p>1st. He must have held some State or Federal office before the war. </p>
					<p>2nd. He must, as such officer, have taken an oath to support the Constitution
						of the United States.</p>
					<p>3rd. He must, after having done these things, have given aid and comfort to
						the war in some practical and voluntary manner.</p>
					<p>Unless all these things combine, no one is disfranchised. That is to say,
						those who may have held office and sworn to support the Constitution, can
						register if they did not afterwards aid the rebellion, and all who aided the
						rebellion in any way can register and vote if they did not hold an office
						and take an oath to support the Constitution.</p>

						L. Tate, Cornelia M. Patterson, and Bettie J. Johnston. </p>
					<p>The following young ladies have completed the prescribed course of study at
						the Seminary and being Proficients in all the schools, received diplomas as
						full graduates: Misses BETTIE K. GUY, MATTIE L. TATE and CORNELIA M.
						PATTERSON. In order to become a full graduate the pupil must be proficient
						in the following studies: 1, English Literature; 2, History; 3, Mental and
						Moral Science; 4, Mathematics, including Algebra, Geometry, Plane and
						Spherical Trigonometry, and Conic Sections; 5, Natural Philosophy; 6,
						Chemistry; 7, One Ancient Language; and 8, One Modern Language.</p>
					<p>The Rev. Dr. Moore then delivered an address to the young ladies of the
						Seminary. It is impossible for us, in the limited space at our command, to
						give a sketch of this admirable address, which was replete with humor,
						pathos, and wholesome instruction. All who were present pronounced it a
						perfect gem of its kind. The performances of the choir added much to the
						interest of the occasion, and we are sure the entire assemblage was highly
						gratified with all the exercises of the evening.</p>
					<p>On Thursday evening, a musical entertainment was given in the principal
						school-room of the Seminary. A very large audience, overflowing into other
						rooms and the porticoes, testified their interest by remaining till a late
						hour of a sultry night. A number of pieces were performed on pianos with a
						degree of skill which, we are told by better judges than we pretend to be,
						would have excited the admiration of the most accomplished musicians. The
						Cantata of the Spring Holiday was then performed or rendered (we confess our
						ignorance as to the proper term), under the leadership of Dr. Brown. It was
						the first performance of the kind we had ever attended, and we can best
						express our appreciation and enjoyment to fit by saying that, late as the
						hour was, we regretted at the close that the performance was over.</p>
					<p>The young ladies of this school, from abroad, whose presence has enlivened
						our town during the past session, have now dispersed to their respective
						homes, and our best wishes for continued health and happiness attended them.
						The number of pupils last year was ninety-six and of teachers, ten. We
						congratulate all connected with the Seminary upon its highly flourishing
						condition and prospects, in common with the similar institutions located
