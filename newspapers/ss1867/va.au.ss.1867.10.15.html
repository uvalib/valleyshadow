					<p>By the apportionment of representation which has been made by General
						Schofield, though there is a majority of 13,000 white votes in the State, a
						large majority of the districts are under the control of the negroes. By
						this ingenious device it is so arranged that the minority is to rule the
						majority. If a Convention is called, it is absolutely certain it will be
						under the control of the Radicals and the negroes. Do we want such a
						Convention? Do we want voluntarily to pass under negro rule? All who do,
						will vote for  the Convention; all who do not,
						will vote against  it. </p>
					<p>The recent elections show a great change is going on in the North. Let us try
						and keep off the Convention 'till that change is complete. If radicalism is
						forced on us by the present Congress, the next Congress can relieve us from
						it. But if we voluntarily put fetters on ourselves, Congress cannot take
						them off; for Congress will have no jurisdiction to undo what we do
						ourselves. We say, then, vote AGAINST a Convention, if you want to protect
						your liberty and your property.</p>

<b>The Nominees</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Presents the Conservative nominees to the upcoming Convention, as selected

					representative, a radical, or republican or renegade or negro!"<br>(Names in announcement:  Joseph A. Waddell,  Powell Harrison)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The necessity for concentrating  the conservative
						vote of the county and district so as to secure the election of persons
						worthy to be trusted in this important crisis, was the occasion for the
						assemblage of the meeting last Saturday, and the nomination of Conservative candidates. </p>
					<p>It is never possible to make nominations to suit the preferences of
						everybody, and no sensible man expects that result; but we venture to say
						that considering the range for selection no more acceptable ticket to the
						community at large could have been agreed upon, and a common interest now
						requires of all, regardless of personal preferences, the patriotic duty of
						aiding the secure the election of such men as the representatives of Old
						Augusta, and to prevent the degradation of seeing ourselves misrepresented
						by radicals, renegades, or negroes!</p>
					<p>The nominations are doubtless less agreeable to the nominees  themselves than to anyone else, and only a sense of
						patriotic duty induces them to accept the position. </p>
					<p>JOSEPH A. WADDELL is too well and favorably known to require any introduction
						to the voters of Augusta co.</p>
					<p>POWELL HARRISON is not so publicly known, yet he has already gained a high
						reputation for integrity, intelligence and ability, and is thoroughly
						identified in feeling, interest and sympathy with the Conservative people of
						Augusta and Virginia. Both are able debaters, and the old county will lose
						nothing of its ancient prestige at their hands.</p>
					<p>JAMES C. SOUTHALL, of Albemarle, the district nominee, is a fit associate of
						our county nominees, and every way worthy of the support of the people of
						Augusta. No one in Virginia now holds a higher position as a "gentleman and
						scholar" and christian patriot. He is the highest type of Conservatism; his
						purity of character, and clearness of intellect gave the amplest guarantee
						of his entire trustworthiness. His leading editorial, in the Chronicle , which we publish to-day, shows that his
						political sentiments are in full accord with the Conservative sentiment of
						this community. </p>
					<p>The registered vote in the district is so close between the radicals, and
						Conservative, that it is indispensable for every 
						Conservative to cast his vote for the same
						candidate-otherwise we are defeated, and the Conservative-so close is
						the contest-by one single vote! Augusta has for
						the sake of a common cause and to present one on whom all Conservatives can
						unite, generously yielded her natural preferences for one of her own sons,
						and tenders the honor to an esteemed citizen of a sister county. Let us then
						as individuals make good this generosity, and giving over any personal
						preferences cast every  vote for James C.
						Southall, and thus avoid the mortification of contributing by our
						supineness, or selfishness, to the disgrace of having as our representative,
						a radical, or republican, or renegade or negro! Heaven forbid it! </p>

<b>A Few Words to the Colored People</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges black readers not to be misled by "designing people" who "try to
					array you against your old masters," warning that if "you listen to the counsels
					of these bad men, do you think the men of property will employ those who turn
					against them?" Emancipation, according to this logic, was part of a larger and
					more grandiose plan by northerners to drive blacks "out of the Southern States
					into Mexico" so as "to make room for themselves" as Southern laborers.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>An election is at hand, and in the Providence of God, you are called on to
						take part in it. No one doubts your wish to do what is best for yourselves
						and the country. The question is, how can you best promote these objects?
						You will find plenty of designing people, who, for their own wicked
						purposes, will seek to mislead you. They want offices and power for
						themselves, and they wish to use you, as the monkey used the cat's paw, to
						draw the hot chestnuts out of the fire. Such men will try to array you
						against your old masters, and get you to vote, in solid column, for these
						pretended friends. Will you advance your interests in this way? Who now
						gives you employment? Who furnishes your houses, and fuel and food and
						clothing? Is it the man who seeks to mislead you, or those against whom they
						seek to array you?</p>
					<p>Suppose you listen to the counsels of these bad men, do you think the men of
						property will employ those who turn against them? If they do, they will act
						differently now, from what they have done heretofore. There are thousands of
						white people in the North, and tens of thousands of Irish and Germans, who
						want the employment and the profits of the business you now have. Do you
						wish them to get it? Do you wish to give it up in their favor? If so, prove
						to the men of property that you are against them, and their interests, and
						the country will soon swarm with white servants and laborers, and you will
						see your error when it is too late.</p>
					<p>Do you think the Northern people set you free out of any love they bore for
						you? By no means. They did it through necessity, not to help you, but to
						hurt the people of the South. Who brought your forefathers from Africa and
						made them slaves? It was the people of the North. They sent their ships to
						Africa, and either stole or traded for negroes, and brought them here and
						sold them to the people of the South?</p>
					<p>All the Northern States once had slaves.-What did they do with them? Did they
						set them free? By no means! They sold them South, and then cried out against
						the wickedness of slavery!</p>
					<p>Are they your friends now? Do they want to give you the right to vote, and be
						on an equality with whites, in the Northern States? Let the late vote in
						Ohio, where the people decided against negro suffrage, by fifty thousand
						majority, answer the question.</p>
					<p>Have you ever thought of the reason why Northern people were so anxious to
						get rid of slavery? Was it from affection to you? Quite the reverse. There
						are thousands of poor white people in the North, who want to come here.-They
						want the places you now hold, and the profits of the employment you now
						have. In a word they want to root you out, to make room for themselves. As
						long as you had intelligent and powerful masters to protect you, they could
						not do this. They saw it, and like cunning fellows as they are, they made a
						flank movement on you, and sought to do indirectly, what they could not do
						directly. The first step was to sever the connection between you and your
						old masters, and thereby withdraw their protection from you. To this end,
						they set you free, and are trying now to array you against those with whom
						you were born and raised. As soon as they get you fairly cut loose from the
						protection of your old masters, and in the position of a dog without an
						owner, they will kick and cuff you at pleasure, and there will be not one to
						defend you. You will fall between two stools.-You will lose your old
						friends, and gain no new ones.</p>
					<p>Let any colored man or woman, go to any Northern State, and try to get
						employment in any factory, or as driver of a street car, or as hackman,
						&amp;c., and see who soon he will be pelted with stones, or beaten with
						clubs!</p>
					<p>The fondness of the Yankee for the negro is all pretense. Before five years
						you will see another negro excitement in the North. This time it will be not
							for , but against 
						the negro.-It will be to run him out of the country. This was Lincoln's
						idea, as expressed by him to a colored delegation which called him. </p>
					<p>Northern interest stimulated abolition, to make you defenceless, and now that
						you are defenceless, the Northern people will drive you out, to make room
						for themselves. They drove your fathers out of the Northern States, and they
						will drive you out of the Southern States into Mexico. Mark what we say and
						remember it!</p>

					<p>UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA</p>
					<p>October 8th, 1867</p>
					<p>At a meeting of the Washington Society of the University of Virginia, the
						following preamble and resolutions were presented and unanimously adopted:</p>
					<p>Whereas , in the mysterious wisdom of Almighty God
						our honored and esteemed friend, A. H. H. STUART, JR., has been called from

					<p>Whereas , "The silver chord hath been loosed, the

						warning come teach us that "in the midst of life we are in death." </p>
					<p>Resolved 2 nd, That in
						the death of A. H. H. STUART Jr., the Washington Society has lost a member
						whose strong right arm was extended in her darkest hour of trial to lift her
						from the ashes of her desolation and make her once more a bright and shining
						light; one whose dignified and gentlemanly demeanor, whose nobleness of soul
						and unblemished reputation rendered him an ornament to her all; and one in
						whose unobtrusive virtues and manly character, we recognized an undercurrent
						of deep and powerful intellect, which with his accustomed application and
						indomitable energy was destined to have made him a brilliant ornament to his
						family and friends; a strong and shining pillar in the Washington Society
						which the accumulating friction for the coming years could but have
						burnished into more effulgent brightness; and a worthy and influential
						member of society, whose power and example must have been felt in whatever
						sphere he might have been called to act. </p>
					<p>Resolved  3rd. That we
						tender to the family and friends of the deceased, our sincere condolences
						and sympathy in the hour of trial, assuring them that while they bend in
						heartbroken anguish over the tomb of a departed relative, the Washington
						Society sheds scarcely less bitter tears over the grave of her fallen son. </p>
					<p>Resolved 4 th, That in

					<p>Resolved  5th That
						these resolutions be spread upon the Minutes of the Society, and a copy

					<p>Three or four days have elapsed since the dark and horrid transaction
						narrated below transpired at or near Flewelling's Cross Roads, Miss. A young
						lady of the highest respectability and amiable character was proceeding to a
						neighbor's house, where a party to which she had been invited, was given,
						when she was overtaken by a negro, and forcibly drawn from the high road
						into the woods, her cries stifled by a cloth of some sort pressed over her

						there detained for a week, while the black scoundrel effected his purpose
						without the miserable victim being able to offer the slightest resistance.</p>
					<p>Two men who were out hunting unexpectedly came upon her, still tightly bound

						up the ghost-the monster dying a most horrible death. The girl was conveyed
