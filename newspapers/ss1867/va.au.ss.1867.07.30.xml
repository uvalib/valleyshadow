				<head>Negro Representatives--Reaction in the North</head>

				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>In view of the majority of negro voters in many districts in the Southern
						States, the New York <emph rend="italic">Herald </emph>, a Republican paper,
						anticipates that they will elect negro representatives to Congress, and that
						the result will be a re-action in the Northern States against the Republican
						party. The more reflecting portion of the Northern people are beginning to
						apprehend that they have permitted their hostility against the Southern
						people to evoke a spirit which will not down at their bidding. The <emph
							rend="italic">Herald </emph> is frank enough to confess, what we have
						often stated, that the northern people have stronger prejudices against the
						colored people than we of the South. </p>
					<p>The <emph rend="italic">Herald </emph> says: </p>
					<p>"We may be sure that negro equality, proclaiming itself through negro voices
						from both Houses of Congress, will make a profound impression opened the
						public mind throughout the North. <emph rend="italic">We apprehend that the
							result will be a general re-action against the Republican party in the
							Northern States; for we know that there is a stronger wall of white
							prejudice against the North than exists in the South</emph>." </p>
					<p>[UNCLEAR] will come home to roost," and the Northern coop will be sure, in
						the course of time to be full. "Wicked inventions will return to plague the
						inventor," as the people of the North will be a great while experience.
						Retributive justice will overtake them.</p>

				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>John Minor Botts has written a letter to "James H. Bannister, Alexander
						Jackson, and other colored friends," and after a lengthy exposition of his
						views of the situation, lays down the following platform of principles which
						are to actuate him in his course at the forthcoming Convention:</p>
					<p>1. That Secession is not a blunder simply, but a crime to be punished.</p>
					<p>2. That the first allegiance of every citizen to his country, and not to his
						State, which is only a component part of his country.</p>
					<p>3. A liberal and enlarged system of education for all at the public expense.</p>
					<p>4. Impartial suffrage and equality in political and legal rights, without
						regard to race or color.</p>
					<p>5. Free thought, free speech, and a free press, without licentiousness or
						depravity, throughout free America.</p>
					<p>6. The recognition and perpetuation of universal liberty, whether heretofore
						constitutionally perfected or otherwise.</p>
					<p>7. The maintenance of the public faith and credit by the payment of the
						public debt created for the perpetuation of American liberty, and the
						repudiation of the Confederate debt created for our enslavement.</p>
					<p>8. Encouragement of Northern Republicans to settle among us as free-holders
						or lease-owners, as far preferable to the schemes now on foot to introduce
						Irish and German Democratic voters as common laborers.</p>
					<p>9. To give elevation and responsibility to labor, that industry in all
						honorable pursuits may be appreciated.</p>
					<p>10. Universal amnesty and restoration to the great body of the people, who
						were misled or seduced into the war by the more artful or wicked men, but
						exclusion from all political power hereafter to those who were instrumental,
						either by speaking, writing, or preaching, in bringing on the war. This is
						nothing more nor less than they would do with all opposed to them if they
						had the power.</p>

				<head>Eligibility of Negroes</head>
				<origin>Lynchburg Republican</origin>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>Whilst the Radical are forcing negro suffrage upon the South because they
						expect the negroes to vote with them, and to aid them to secure office and
						retain power, yet they have shown no disposition to render th negro eligible
						to office. They think the negro will do to vote, as he is expected to vote
						with them, but it will not do to elect the negroes to office. Upon this
						subject the Lynchburg <emph rend="italic">Republican </emph> says: </p>
					<p>"The truth is, the Radical party have never yet dared to declare the negro
						eligible to office. No such provision is anywhere made in the reconstruction
						acts, and those acts have been so frequently reviewed and mended that we
						cannot suppose the omission to be accidental. Not only in their own section,
						but also in their provision for the government of the Southern States, the
						Radical leaders hesitate to commit their party to this measure. The negro
						will serve all the uses they have for him by casting his vote for their
						candidates. When it comes to opening the way to official preferment to <emph
							rend="italic">him </emph>, the noisy friends of the colored man, and the
						blatant champions of his equal rights, will be found either silent or
						opposed to his claims. </p>
					<p>The fact illustrates the hollow hypocrisy and dishonesty of the men who
						elevate themselves as the only friends of the negro. In all sincerity they
						feel no interest in his welfare, except so far as he can be made to answer
						their purposes. That done, they do not experience one-tenth of the sympathy
						or care for him which is felt, but not ostentatiously paraded, by those
						among whom he was born and raised. The colored people do not at present
						appreciate this truth, but they will acknowledge it, in all its crushing
						force, before many years shall have passed above their heads.</p>

				<transcript>Radical Meeting. <p>In accordance with the [illegible] as published in
						handbills, a meeting of the Radicals, white and black, was held in the Court
						House on yesterday, Monday, for the purpose of sending delegates to the
						Radical Convention, which will meet in Richmond on Thursday next.</p><p>The
						majority of the meeting were negroes who occupied the lawyers' chairs in the
						bar, and the main body of the Court House below, whilst their white
						co-operators were literally, "pushed to the wall," forming a white fringe to
						the black body.</p><p>On motion of Jacob Bear, Mr. Jno. Yates was called to
						the chair.</p><p>On motion of A. T. Maupin, Mr. Geo. W. McCutcheon was
						appointed to act as Secretary.</p><p>The object of the meeting was explained
						by David Fultz, Esq., in a speech of half an hour's length. The speech, we
						learn, was conservative in its character.</p><p>Mr. Fultz moved that a
						committee be appointed by the Chairman to report preamble and resolutions,
						whereupon the Chairman appointed the following persons as the members of
						that committee:</p><p>David Fultz, Sam'l Cline, Sam'l Driver, white, and
						Philip Rozelle and Benj. Downey, colored.</p><p>During the absence of the
						committee, the meeting was addressed by David Davenport, colored.</p><p>The
						following delegates were appointed to attend the meeting in Richmond: David
						Fultz, Rev. Geo. A. Shuey, Jno. Yates, whites, and Benj. Downey and Aaron
						Shoveller, colored.</p><p>The resolutions not having been furnished us in
						time for this issue, are not published.</p><p>After the adoption of the
						resolutions, the meeting was addressed by E. L. Houff, white.</p><p>His
						speech elicited considerable applause from the "colored men and brethren"
						present.</p><p>Philip Rozelle, colored, also addressed the meeting after the
						conclusion of Mr. Houff's speech.</p><p>We understand that he expressed his
						strong disapprobation of the <emph rend="italic">Spectator </emph>, and
						recommended its editor to go to the editors of the other papers here to get
						proper ideas. </p><p>We were not present at the meeting, and are indebted to
						a friend for the above account of the proceedings.</p><p>Such a scene was
						presented in that meeting was never exhibited in this county before. <emph

					<p>In early manhood, having been brought by the grace of God to the light of the
						knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus, he made a public profession of his
						faith and connected himself with the German Reformed Church, in which he had
						been born and nurtured. Having changed his residence from Rockingham county
						to Augusta, in the neighborhood of Union Church, then under the care of the
						late Dr. Headren, he connected himself with the Presbyterian church, and was
						for about a quarter of a century, an elder in that church.</p>
					<p>Rarely is it the privilege of any church to be blessed with a member or
						office bearer, who in his walk and conversation more consistently adorned
						his christian profession. While living, he was a witness for the truth, the
						word of God was his rule of life. His faith and hope were built on that rock
						which is christ.</p>
					<p>He was a man of sound judgment, of strict integrity, liberal of his substance
						as God had prospered him, kind and affectionate as a husband, father,
						neighbor and friend; a father to the orphan, his loss will be deeply felt by
						his family, his neighborhood, and the church of which he was a member-but
						they mourn not as those who have no hope.</p>

					<p>Your paper lately announced that on the 27th ult., Mrs. SARAH J., wife of Mr.
						Jos. P. Ament and daughter of Jacob Ruff, of Augusta county Va., departed
						this life, aged 86 years, and that on the 29th ult., she was borne with
						loving hands to her burial.</p>
					<p>Such is the concise record that sooner, or later will tell the brief history
						of us all, the number of years that we live; the fact of death and burial;
						but underneath this record which all may read, there is an unwritten
						history-often eventful, always interesting-telling of struggles with life's
						duties-of trials and sacrifices, and of heroic conflicts-of loves and of
						hopes and of moral achievements that will live long in the memory of a
						loving circle, and leave the enduring fragrance and blessing there.</p>
					<p>In such unwritten histories are doubtless hid life's noblest efforts and best
						accomplishments.-There let them rest. They need not be blazoned abroad in
						order to do their work. Real worth and wealth of character will always tell.
						They need to human tongues; they have a thousand ways to speak.</p>
					<p>The modesty of our departed friend would shrink from a word of eulogy, but I
						do not think she would object to have it known, to the honor of her Savior
						that she found great support in her Christian hopes that they alleviated and
						lightened the long sufferings of a sick room, and made the day of her
						departure a time of peace and triumph.</p>
