<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>There must be something radically wrong in the head or heart of any man who
						could view without much admiration, the general demeanor of the colored
						people of this Commonwealth during and since the war. We merely express the
						feeling of every fair-minded man, when we pay a willing tribute to the
						fidelity, honesty and diligence with which they discharged their duties as
						slaves, while their masters were absent in the field, and to the extreme
						moderation with which, when let alone, they conducted themselves, in the
						change from their servile condition to their present state of freedom.</p>
					<p>When we remember these facts, we gather confidence that, in the discharge of
						the new duties thrust upon them by the late action of Congress, they will
						disappoint the hopes of those who are now desirous to see that conflict of
						races begun which the war failed to excite. The good conduct, to which we
						have alluded, entitles the colored people of Virginia to expect, at the
						hands of the whites, fair-more fair-treatment in the new civil relation. It
						justifies them in expecting a generous and friendly confidence, a frank and
						open dealing, and the best and most disinterested counsel.</p>
					<p>To that end, it behooves both races to recall some facts which will go far to
						show how each stands to the other:</p>
					<p>1. The colored people should remember that the late war was not waged by the
						North to set them free. This is capable of the clearest proof. Mr. WADE, the
						present president of the Senate, and the man relied on to take Mr. JOHNSON'S
						place, in the event of impeachment, said on the 18th of December, 1860,
						after South Carolina had seceded:</p>
					<p>"I do not blame the people of the South, because I think they have been led
						to believe that we, to-day, the dominant party, are their mortal foes, and
						stand ready to trample their institutions under foot."</p>
					<p>Mr. LINCOLN, in his inaugural address, on the 4th of March, 1861, said:</p>
					<p>"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution
						of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right
						to do so; and I have no inclination to do so." </p>
					<p>Immediately after the first battle of Manassas, Congress passed, almost
						unanimously, the following resolution:</p>
					<p>Resolved , That the war is waged by the Government
						of the United States, not in the spirit of conquest or subjugation, nor for the purpose of overthrowing or interfering with
							the rights or institutions of the States." </p>
					<p>These extracts might be largely multiplied, but they suffice to prove that
						the North did not enter this war to free the slaves. It is historically
						true, that no attempt was made at general emancipation until it was
						discovered that the whites could not be enslaved without freeing the blacks.</p>
					<p>The Yankees simply made use of the Southern negro to help them out of a
						difficulty that they had not the skill to deliver themselves from. The
						North, therefore, deserves no credit for the act, nor does Mr. LINCOLN, who
						reluctantly, and only after much protest, agreed to issue the Emancipation
						Proclamation.</p>
					<p>2. The colored people should remember that in a majority of those Northern
						states in which the Republican party controls the government, the blacks are
						denied the rights of citizenship to-day. And they should remember that four
						Northern States have recently resolved, by large votes, not to extend
						suffrage to the colored people-to keep them out of the pale of citizenship,
						although their numbers are so few that they could have not influence in the
						elections-and although the negroes thus disfranchised have long been free
						and educated, and in some cases wealthy. This shows the hollowness and
						hypocrisy of the pretended friendship of the Republican party.</p>
					<p>3. The colored people of the South should remember that for generations to
						come, probably forever, the great majority of their brethren must be
						dependent for employment on their old masters and hirers, the resident white
						people of the South; that these will be their neighbors and friends; as for
						many years they have been, when the few soldiers that are here shall be
						withdrawn, and the reign of law shall be resumed. The strangers that may
						come among you, endeavoring to excite hostility between you and the whites,
						have no interest in you, or in the State of which the act of Congress
						declares you voters. They come to ask your help to maintain in power a party
						which imposes in one year more taxes on you, than your true friends levied
						in the past fifty. When they have used you, they will turn their backs on
						you-like these Freedmen's bureau officers, who tempted you to work on their
						plantations and cheated you out of your wages.</p>
					<p>And the whites will do well to remember that for all the infamies of existing
						legislation, the negroes are as little accountable as they are for their
						freedom; that the blacks are now, and must long continue to be the fixed
						laboring population of the State; that if the good people of Virginia do not
						instruct them in their rights to inform the as to their duties and convey to
						them such intelligence as to current questions as they are capable of
						receiving, the incendiaries who thirsted so eagerly, during the war, to see
						a war of extermination waged by the blacks on the whites, will fill their
						minds with their fatal poison, in the hope that their taste for our blood,
						not yet satiated, may be gratified abundantly.</p>
					<p>Both parties can easily see that nothing but mischief, the suspension of
						employment, the decay of agriculture especially, poverty, distress, and the
						ultimate destruction of one party or the other, can follow a fixed
						resolution to substituted enmity for harmony between them.</p>
					<p>He who counsels this, is no friend to either race.-Rich.
							Examiner. </p>

<b>How is It?</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that convening a convention would "do violence to the honor of
					Virginia" since the Sherman-Shellabarger bill calls for state conventions to
					adopt the constitutional amendment to be recognized by Congress.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>We would like to be informed how it is that it was impossible for the
						Legislature to adopt the proposed Constitutional amendment (Article XIV)
						without doing violence to the honor of Virginia, and that would not be doing
						such violence for the people of Virginia to vote for calling a Convention
						under the provisions of the Stevens-Sherman Shellabarger bill which provides
						not only for the adoption by the Legislature of that same  amendment, but in addition, requires the incorporation
						into our State Constitutions of the right of suffrage to all "male citizens
						of the State twenty-one years old and upwards, of whatever race, color or previous condition, who have been
						resident in the State one year previous to election," and exception such
						persons as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion. If it
						would do violence to the honor of Virginia, to adopt the Constitutional
						amendment, it follows, a fortiori, that it would
						do so to comply with the provisions of the Stevens-Sherman-Shellabarger
						bill. </p>
					<p>Those voting "for the Convention," will vote for it to do what is required in
						the S. S. S. bill, for if the Convention shall not comply with the
						provisions of that bill, there is no use in calling it at all. That bill
						requires the adoption of the Constitution which, will disfranchise many of
						our best and most valuable citizens whilst it will grant suffrage to every
						male negro twenty-one years of age. When such a Constitution shall have been
						adopted by the Convention, and when that Constitution shall have been
						ratified by the vote of the people-under the restricted suffrage of the
						whites and unrestricted suffrage of the negroes-and when the radical
						Congress shall have approved it, and when the Legislature, elected under
						such Constitutional Amendment, and when said amendment shall have become a
						part of the Constitution of the United States, then the State may be
						represented to Congress, if she will elect such representatives will take
						the iron clad oath in other words, send Radicals to Congress. This is the
						feast to which we are invited, after complying with the terms mentioned.</p>
					<p>To reject with disdain, as the people of Virginia did, the Constitutional
						Amendment, and then to vote for a Convention to carry into effect the
						provisions of the S. S. S. bill, would be; it seems to us, "to strain at a
						gnat and swallow a camel."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>On the first page we publish in full the able message of the President
						vetoing the supplementary reconstruction bill, for such a document, as the

						The Veto, is practically, a nullity. The message was read, and although it

<b>Radicals on Sandy Foundation</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that Radicals are on the verge of losing their hold on power and
					that Southerners will only help the Radicals by calling a convention.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>It should be borne in mind that whilst the Radicals have a large majority of
						Representatives-the districts being Gerrymandered to accomplish that
						purpose-the popular majority is very small in many of the Northern
						States.-The margin of popular majority being small, it would not require
						much change in popular sentiment to overthrow the Radical party. They are
						conscious of this fact, and moreover of the fact that the changes which are
						now taking place are from the Radical to the Conservative party. The
						Radicals feel that the supremacy of their party is based upon a sandy and
						slippery foundation, and that it is in danger of being overthrown at the
						next elections. Murmurs of impatience and mutterings of dissatisfaction
						already strike their ears, and they fear that they forebode the approach of
						a storm of popular indignation. This accounts for the fact that the present
						Congress, though it contains a larger majority of Radicals, is less violent
						than the last. Two years have elapsed since the termination of the war which
						was waged on the part of the North professedly for the preservation of the
						Union, and yet the Union is not restored. The Radicals have prevented
						restoration, and the people, who desire restoration, are becoming impatient
						at the delay, and will soon resolve to supply their places with those who
						will labor to restore the Union, instead of legislating to prevent it, as
						the Radicals have done. The open violation of the fundamental principle of
						republicanism-that Governments should rest upon the consent of the governed-by establishing military Government over
						the Southern States and of that other great principle, a corollary of the
						first, upon which Government was originally established-that there should be
						no taxation without representation-by taxing us heavily whilst denying us
						representation, has caused the more sober and reflecting people of the North
						to pause and think, and the result of that pause is, that the masses are
						becoming aroused to a sense of the danger of their own liberties, and the
						importance of a change of their representatives. </p>
					<p>To relieve themselves of the embarrassment they are now suffering, the
						Radicals in Congress have adopted the ingenious device of submitting to the
						vote of the Southern States the question whether or not they will vote to
						call Conventions to adopt Constitutions in accordance with the provisions of
						the unconstitutional acts which they have adopted. They threaten much worse
						terms if these be not adopted, call upon Stevens to beat his Chinese gong,
						labeled "confiscation," and suppose in that way to frighten the people of
						the South to vote for conventions. If they do vote for them, then their
							consent  is given
						, and the responsibility of forcing a government upon the people
							against  their consent is removed from the
						shoulders of the Radicals. They have woven the web and set the net-will the
						Southern people walk into it. </p>
					<p>"Walk into my parlor</p>
					<p>Said the spider to the fly."</p>
					<p>Will the Southern people go to the rescue of the Radicals by voting for
						Conventions?-Whilst we fear they will, we earnestly hope they will not</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>The Enquirer  very properly urges that "our
						citizens should take special pains to explain to the colored people, that
							their  happiness, even more than ours, is
						imperiled by these sewers of dissension for interested purposes; that no
						community, divided against itself can be prosperous or tranquil, that in
						such collision the weaker party will always be the chief sufferer, and will
						ultimately be destroyed, that it is their interest and duty to cultivate
						kindly and co-operative relations with those among whom they live, and on
						whom they are greatly dependent, rather than with
						strangers who are at a distance, and whose professed friendship is wholly
						selfish and unreliable. The common destitution of both whites and blacks as
						compared with the former abundance, and the inability of one person to help
						another, brought about by outside interference, ought to teach the dullest
						that nothing but misery for all can flow from a continuance of such
						interference. </p>
					<p>As extraordinary pains are and will be employed to incite the colored people
						to hostile relations with the whites, so unusual pains should be taken to
						expose the wickedness of the attempt and the hollow professions of
						friendship on which it proceeds. The colored people deserve great kindness
						and consideration at our hands for the admirable behavior of nearly all of
						them amid the trials of the war. From long association our people feel a
						personal kindness and sympathy for them which no other white people
						entertain. The Yankees are professing  a
						wonderful tenderness for them just now; but it is merely a spurt  of at a distance
						sympathy, or a cold political game in which the whites are to be injured and
						the negroes sacrificed, to promote a party success. </p>
					<p>A man is badly off if his friends are at a distance, and his enemies close at
						hand. The person who should choose  such a
						condition of things, would, by every one, be pronounced a simpleton. Such a
						choice is now presented to the negroes of the South, by the politicians of
						the North. The Southern people ought to take care that before the choice is
						made, it should be fully explained to them. They should also take more than
						usual pains to convince them that we are their real as well as their natural
						friends, and to engage them to unite with us in resenting the interference
						which would produce a mutually injurious alienation and hostility." </p>
