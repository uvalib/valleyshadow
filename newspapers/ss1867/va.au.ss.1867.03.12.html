<b>Our Duty and Policy--Reaction in the North</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that Southerners can effect a change in Northern sentiment only by
                    resisting encroachment on their constitutional rights. If, however, Southerners
                    give "consent to acts violative of the Constitution and subversive of their own

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Whether or not the South will ever be restored to equality of political
                        rights with the Northern States, and whether or not Republican Government
                        has failed in this country, depend upon the fact whether or not the
                        oppressive and unconstitutional legislation of the Radicals in power will
                        have the effect to bring about a wholesome reaction in the Northern States.
                        If the great mass of the citizens of those States have so degenerated and
                        have become so indifferent to the preservation of constitutional liberty as
                        to allow the constitution-the covenant of the liberties of our country-to be
                        recklessly disregarded and ruthlessly trampled upon by the servants of their
                        choice, without severely rebuking them, and arising, in the majesty of there
                        strength, and hurling them from power, as soon as an opportunity at the
                        ballot presents itself, then has our Government, as a Republic , failed, and Ichabod may be inscribed upon it, for its
                        glory has verily departed, and Liberty has been slain in the temple of her
                        worship. It is said that a "good citizen never despairs of the Republic."
                        Though hope has been crippled, we do not despair. We still entertain the
                        belief that a reaction in the Northern States will take place, especially if
                        the oppressed citizens of the Southern States comport themselves as we think
                        they should. </p>
                    <p>They should stand calmly though firmly  upon the
                        broad basis of their constitutional rights.-They should not ask more, nor
                        agree to accept less, than the rights guaranteed to them by the
                        constitution. This is the true position which every man, who is a friend of
                        constitutional liberty should occupy. We are under the most solemn
                        obligations-many of us under sworn obligations-of fidelity to the
                        constitution. It is our duty to perform strictly the duties it imposes, and
                        to resist, to the utmost of our power, infractions of its provisions. As we
                        are powerless and are denied all participation or voice in the halls of
                        legislation, we can only exhibit our fidelity to the constitution by
                        refusing our assent to any unconstitutional act and by enduring with
                        fortitude whatever may be wrongfully imposed upon us by those in power who
                        are faithless to their constitutional obligations. In this way, we will be
                        true to our duties, and will be rendering efficient, though mute, service in
                        defence of Constitutional liberty. The degree of our fidelity will be
                        measured by the amount of suffering we are willing to endure, and the
                        sacrifices we are willing to make. </p>
                    <p>If the Southern people will have, as we hope they will, the firmness and
                        heroic fortitude to occupy and steadfastly to maintain the position we have
                        indicated, they will present as sublime a spectacle as has ever been
                        exhibited in the annals of any people.</p>
                    <p>Not only our self-respect and duty, but sound policy and expediency, dictate
                        this line of conduct. The conservatives of the North, who will contest the
                        elections with the Radicals, stand upon the platform of the constitution and
                        the equality of Constitutional rights between the States, and from that
                        impregnable position wage war in defence of the Constitutional rights of the
                        people of all the States alike, and as long as we maintain our position on
                        the same platform, in the midst of the most trying scenes which ever tested
                        the patriotism and fortitude of any people, we will command their highest
                        respect and enlist their warmest sympathies.-If, on the contrary, the people
                        of the South through want of firmness and fortitude, voluntarily surrender
                        and give their consent  violative of the
                        Constitution and subversive of their own just rights, they will thereby
                        paralyze the strong arms of the Conservatives who are defending [UNCLEAR] ,
                        and tried who, then, must needs leave as to our fate, and the hope of that
                        reaction which would have effected our redemption will be extinguished, and
                        we will be left to grope our way, under the most oppressive burdens in the
                        darkness of despotism-stumbling and falling over the dismembered fragments
                        of a broken Constitution. </p>
                    <p>God moves in a mysterious way.</p>
                    <p>His wonders to perform;</p>
                    <p>He plants his footsteps in the sea,</p>
                    <p>And rides upon the storm. <br></p>
                    <p>Ye fearful saints, fresh courage takes</p>
                    <p>The clouds ye so much dread</p>
                    <p>Are big with mercy and shall break</p>
                    <p>In blessings on your head.</p>
                    <p>We have faith that, if the people of the South shall be true to the right , and shall stand successfully the test of
                        the trying ordeal through which they are passing Providence will make the
                        every means which the Radicals adopt to oppress us the means by which our
                        redemption shall be effected. </p>
                    <p>They send the military here, without cause, to hold despotic surveillance
                        over us.-We are satisfied that nothing could tend more strongly to
                        strengthen the Conservatives in the North and to effect that very reason
                        which is our only hope that our Constitutional liberties will ever be
                        restored to us. From beneath the heel of military despotism, our mute,
                        though potent , appeal would strike a chord of
                        sympathy in the bosom of every man in the North who entertained the
                        slightest respect for Constitutional liberty. Though helpless we should be
                        strong-though mute, we would be eloquent. </p>

                    <p>The Judiciary committee in Congress made a report on the impeachment

                        in his district, of the male citizens over twenty-one years of age, resident
