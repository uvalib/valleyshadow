<b>Ebb of the Tide</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Uses recent election results in New Hampshire to suggest that "the
                    destructive tide of Radicalism is about to ebb."<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>At the recent State election in New Hampshire the Radical majority was
                        reduced from five thousand to three thousand. In a vote of 67,000 the
                        Radicals only carried the State by 3,000. The same ratio of reduction would
                        give the conservatives a majority of 10,000 in New York, 5,000 in
                        Pennsylvania, and sweep New Jersey, Nebraska and Oregon. The people of the
                        South should be of good cheer, they should not yield to despair, for there
                        are signs that the destructive tides of Radicalism is about to ebb. The ark
                        of the constitution may find an Ararat to rest upon sooner than we suppose.
                        We are now looking out with hope to see the return of the dove with the
                        olive branch of peace.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The House of Delegates, on Wednesday last, passed a bill, the object of which
                        is to prevent drunkenness and consequent disorder and rows at elections. The
                        provisions of the bill are very stringent-forbidding all persons, licensed
                        or unlicensed, from selling or giving away liquor, either by wholesale or
                        retail, at any locality near a place of voting, and punishing every offender
                        by a fine of not less than twenty nor more than one hundred dollars, an by
                        imprisonment not exceeding two months. If rigidly enforced, as it should be,
                        it will have a great tendency to prevent collisions and ill feeling,
                        especially in the new order of things, when every precaution will be
                        necessary to preserve the peace and quiet of the community.</p>
                    <p>P. S. This bill passed the Senate on Friday last and is now, therefore, a
                        law.</p>

<b>Southern Teacher Vindicated</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>

                    charged with denouncing Winfield Scott as a traitor, but was vindicated by an

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Miss Kate Eidson, a worthy and intelligent lady of this county, is the
                        Principal of a select school for young ladies in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania.
                        As she was from the South, the Republican, a
                        Radical paper published there, with the view of injuring her school and
                        exciting prejudices against her, asserted that she "denounced Gen. Winfield
                        Scott as a traitor to his country," and added, "that parents who will send
                        their children to a school where such sentiments are inculcated by the
                        teacher, must be either in sympathy with the worst rebel opinions and
                        passions, or sadly misapprehend their duty as parents." </p>
                    <p>Mr. D. Carskadden, who was chiefly instrumental in obtaining her services as
                        teacher, takes notice or the remarks of the Republican, and successfully vindicates her and places the brand of
                        falsehood upon her asperser in the following plain language: </p>
                    <p>"As I was mainly instrumental in procuring her valuable services for the
                        position which she fills with such signal ability and acceptableness to her
                        patrons, I feel it my duty to pronounce this precious piece of information a
                        foolish and unmitigated falsehood, as can be established by every pupil in
                        the school capable of giving testimony. What a miserable, pitiable, cowardly
                        creature must that ban be who prostitutes his position as a public
                        journalist, in attempting by such innuendoes, to bring into unfavorable
                        notoriety an unprotected female far away from her home and friends and among
                        strangers! I would not trouble you, Messrs. Editors, for the space in your
                        paper to contradict this slander, if its author was as well known and duly
                        appreciated outside of town as he is in it, where every one seems to know
                        his real value."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Col. Cyrus B. Baldwin, formerly editor of this paper, we are informed, died
                        of camp fever on the 25th of June last, at Okalona, a village on the Mobile
                        and Ohio railroad, about twenty miles from his late residence, near Houston,
                        Miss.</p>
                    <p>He had been for some months before an officer in our Southern army under Gen.
                        Beauregard, and was probably in the battles near Corinth. A wealthy planter,
                        a distinguished lawyer, a wise counsellor, an enterprising and liberal
                        citizen, a warm and faithful friend, an ardent patriot, a most genial and
                        pleasant companion, a high-toned and spotless, and polished Southern
                        gentleman, Col. Baldwin was universally regarded as one of the finest men in
                        Northern Mississippi; and his sudden death, in the prime of life, in this
                        great crisis is bewailed as a public calamity. His unsolicited election to
                        the secession codvention of Miss., by the
                        unanimous vote of his countrymen, attests the high estimation in which he
                        was held at home. He had previously been a member of the Legislature of
                        Mississippi. One of the earliest advocates of Southern independence, he felt
                        himself bound to draw his maiden sword for his country, notwithstanding the
                        natural delicacy of our constitution, which made the hardships and exposure
                        of the camp doubly hazardous to his life. Fully aware of the peril he was
                        encountering he voluntarily and deliberately went to the field from an
                        imperative sense of duty, with his life in his hand, to offer it upon the
                        altar of his beloved country. </p>
                    <p>In the character of Col. Baldwin, we are informed by those who knew him
                        intimately, there was no erratic brilliancy. He was a modest, quiet, prudent
                        man, remarkable for the full and harmonious development of all his
                        faculties, moral and intellectual-for the poise and balance of his
                        character-for an extraordinary endowment of masculine common sense-the
                        rarest and most valuable of all the mental faculties; and for the purity and
                        amiability of his private life. A more indulgent master to his numerous
                        servants, a more faithful friend, or a more devoted husband and father never
                        lived. At home he was all love and affection, the most cheerful and playful
                        of men, and the idol and joy of his family circle.-What words can express
                        their grief and loss!</p>
                    <p>Colonel Baldwin was in the prime of matured manhood, probably a little
                        upwards of forty years old. He left a young widow and three daughters, two
                        of them unconscious infants.-While his numerous friends mourn his premature
                        death, surrounded by everything that can give dignity and happiness to
                        mortal man, they feel some consolation in remembering his elevated and
                        spotless character, his large and warm heart, his useful and honorable life,
                        and his martyr death in the service of his beloved country.-When it was
                        announced to him that his last hour had come, he calmly replied, "I am
                        ready!" and folding his arms upon his breast he expired with the heroism of
                        a Christian philosopher.</p>
                    <p>On a quiet summer evening, amidst a crowd of weeping friends, his remains
                        were interred in the family burying ground of his father-in-law, Wm. Gates,
                        Esq., on the edge of a magnificent prairie, a few miles west of Aberdeen
                        Miss. There they will sleep forever in peace, undisturbed by the tramp of
                        hostile armies, the roar of cannon and the shock of battle.</p>
                    <p>"No king of fears, in him appears</p>
                    <p>Who shuts the scene of his human woes;</p>
                    <p>Securely laid beneath his shade,</p>
                    <p>The dead alone find true repose." </p>
                    <p>Col. C. B. Baldwin was the third son of Capt. Joseph C. Baldwin, and a
                        brother of the late Judge Joseph G. Baldwin, of California. He came to
                        Staunton from Winchester, where he was born, when a mere child, and resided
                        here until he grew up. From Staunton he went to Lexington, where at the
                        early age of eighteen, he edited the Gazette, with ability and credit. From
                        Lexington he emigrated to the Southwest, editing successively the Alabama State Intelligencer, at Tuscaloosa, and the
                        Sumter County Whig, at Livingston, Ala., and
                        settling permanently at Houston Miss., where he acquired reputation and
                        wealth, by the practice of his profession. At the time of his lamented death
                        he was supposed to be worth a hundred thousand dollars. He was a gentleman
                        of talents and the highest worth and social position. </p>
