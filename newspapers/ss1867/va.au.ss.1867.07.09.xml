                <transcript>
                    <p>The white people of Albemarle, or a portion of them, have held a meeting at
                        Charlottesville and resolved that hereafter they will be Republicans, or at
                        least act with the Northern party so-called. The meeting appointed some
                        forty-five delegates to represent "the white people" of the county in "the
                        unconstitutional Union Convention" to be held in Richmond under the auspices
                        of Botts, Hunnicutt &amp;c.; and the names of the delegates are familiar
                        to us as those belongings to the representative men of Albemarle. In past
                        years it was not uncommon for people to change sides in politics-from the
                        weaker to the stronger especially-and we thought we were prepared for any
                        occurrence of the kind. But after all, the Albemarle movement takes us by
                        surprise. It does seem very strange to see gentlemen, some of whom were
                        recently leaders of the <emph rend="italic">Secesh </emph>, all of a sudden
                        whirl themselves over on the Radical platform along side of the Thad.
                        Stevens and Ben. Wade, to say nothing of Botts and Hunnicutt. So it is,
                        however, and hung in the party and on the platform, they are of course
                        invested with all the rights and privileges of the most orthodox of their
                        faith. They are doubtless prepared to "lay down the law" as to the
                        principles and policy of the party. This will be a convenience to us.
                        Heretofore, when we wanted to know what the Radicals were doing or going to
                        do, we had to enquire of Pennsylvania, Ohio, or Massachusetts; but now we
                        have only to call over the Ridge, and Albemarle will give us the answer. We
                        want to know one thing forth [UNCLEAR]-are the Albemarle Republicans going
                        to be felt a date[UNCLEAR]? Their own bacon is safe, do they exclamation
                        make ours? [UNCLEAR] </p>
                    <p>But seriously, what do these gentlemen expect to gain by their movement?
                        Credit for <orig reg="temerity">timerity</orig>? Not a bit of it. A grim
                        smile no doubt passes over old Thad. Steven's face while he reads their
                        proceedings. They remind us of a fable which Aesop ought to have written, if
                        he did not: Once upon a time, the robins were in great fear of the hawks,
                        and after trembling in their boots for a long while, hit upon a wise
                        expedient-they held a formal meeting and solemnly resolved that thenceforth
                        and forever they would be hawks. We do not read that the hawks were induced
                        thereby to cease whetting their beaks. </p>
                    <p>Let us, while yielding obedience to authority, maintain a manly fortitude in
                        the midst of suffering, and not, like "the people of the land," for fear of
                        the Jews pretend to be Jews ourselves. Thus shall we save our self-respect
                        and secure the respect of the world, our enemies included. Let us do right,
                        calmly waiting for a change in the popular feeling at the North, and
                        especially trusting in God, who still governs among men.</p>

                <summary>Referring to a recent Republican meeting in Albemarle, the editor expresses
                    surprise at "gentlemen" who were leaders of secession now supporting the Radical
                    platform and encourages readers to "maintain a manly fortitude in the midst of
                    suffering" rather than follow the example of the Albemarle group.</summary>

                    <p>The New York "Herald" says there never was a finer opportunity for Northern
                        capitalists to invest their money than the South no affords, and cites, as
                        an instance, that one of the famous sulphur springs of Virginia, which was
                        worth, before the war, two hundred thousand dollars, can now be purchased
                        for fifty thousand dollars. The "Herald," therefore, advises Northern
                        capitalists, instead of stock-jobbing and using their money for all sorts of
                        kite-flying speculations, to invest in Southern property. This, it adds,
                        would be the right way to reconstruct the South, and it is the
                        reconstruction the Southern people most need.</p>

                    <p>MOLLIE A., infant daughter of John D. and Susan E. Hemp, aged 1 year, 8
                        months and 1 day, was drowned on the 29th ult., by falling into a spring on
                        the farm of Mr. John Baylor, near Baylor's Mill. It was left by its mother
                        in the care of its grandfather Hemp, who was working with some hay near the
                        house. He having missed the child for some five or ten minutes, went in
                        search of it and found it in the spring. It was still living when taken out
                        of the water, but died very shortly afterwards.</p>

                        order. A great concourse of sincere mourners followed the remains of the
                        deceased to the grave. He was beloved by all who knew him, and we sincerely

                <transcript>
                    <p>Our Town was very quiet on last Thursday, the 4th. Although the stores and
                        shops were kept open there was comparatively no business transacted. A large
                        number of our citizens availed themselves of the opportunity to breathe the
                        mountain air by going to Goshen with the Augusta Fire Company, who,
                        according to previous announcement, made a picnic excursion to that place.
                        Early in the morning a large crowd of ladies and gentlemen were assembled at
                        the Depot, prepared to take the train and participate in the festivities and
                        amusements of the day. At six o'clock, the train, consisting of three
                        passenger cars and two flats, was crowded with a joyous and happy part of
                        ladies and gents, and the conductor giving the command-"all aboard!"-the
                        engineer pulled the string-"toot! toot!!"-and off we went, feeling joyous
                        and happy-"free from every care." In a few minutes we came to a stand still
                        at Swoope's Depot, where, we remained for about half an hour, waiting the
                        arrival of the passenger train from the West. During our stay here, some of
                        our party, who had been too slow to get to breakfast before they left
                        Staunton, went into the house of our friend, Mr. Dull, the agent at Swoope's
                        Depot, where, through the kindness of the accommodating hostess, a cup of
                        kindness of the accommodating hostess, a cup of hot coffee and other nice
                        eatables were served, much to the enjoyment and satisfaction of all who
                        partook of Mrs. D.'s hospitality.</p>
                    <p>The passenger train arriving and passing on to Staunton, we were soon
                        "switched" on to the main track and in a few minutes we found ourselves</p>
                    <p>"Whizzing through the mountain,</p>
                    <p>Buzzing o'er the vale, Bless me this is pleasant</p>
                    <p>Riding on a rail." Especially it is pleasant when in company with jolly crowd
                        and seated in close proximity to a pretty girl.</p>
                    <p>We arrived at Goshen at an early hour in the day, and the crowd was soon
                        divided off into different parties, each choosing for themselves the kind of
                        amusement they wished to engage in. A large number went to dancing, some
                        went fishing, some rolled ten-pins, some went to a swinging, singing, and to
                        hers rambled about the country ,</p>
                    <p>"O'er the hills and far away." A few members of the Stonewall Band were with
                        the party and added interest in the occasion by discoursing sweet music.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the persons who went from Staunton there was a large number of
                        persons present from the surrounding country and all, we believe, without a
                        single exception, enjoyed themselves to the fullest extent.</p>
                    <p>After dinner the Fire Company was formed by Capt. Waters and went through the
                        very pretty movement, called the "Snake Drill," and before the dispersion of
                        the crowd, our friend Y. Howe Peyton, being spontaneously called upon,
                        delivered a very eloquent and appropriate little speech.</p>
                    <p>Lemonade and all kinds of good eatables were to be had in the greatest
                        profusion.</p>
                    <p>Much credit is due to Capt. Waters and the committee of arrangements of the
                        Fire Company, Messrs. Hardy, Fagan, Fifer, wholes and Scherer, for the
                        orderly and pleasant manner in which the whole affair was managed, and also
                        to Mr. H. A. Goodloe, the keeper of the hotel, for the kind and hospitable
                        manner in which he entertained the large crowd.</p>
                    <p>About seven o'clock, the party were "all aboard" again, bound for Staunton,
                        and arrived here, after a most pleasant ride of about two hours,--all
                        perfectly delighted, with the pleasures of the day.</p>
                    <p>Excursion parties of this character might be had often as they furnish a vast
                        amount of innocent amusement and recreation to our citizens.</p>

                <transcript>
                    <p>1. Never marry for wealth. A woman's life consisteth not in the things she
                        possetheth.</p>
                    <p>2. Never marry a fop who struts about dandylike, in his gloves and ruffles,
                        with a silver headed cane and rings on his fingers. Beware! There is a trap.</p>
                    <p>3. Never marry a niggard, close-fisted, mean, sordid wretch, who saves every
                        penny, or spends it grudgingly. Take care lest he stint you to death.</p>
                    <p>4. Never marry a stranger, whose character is not known or tested. Some
                        females jump into the fire with their eyes wide open.</p>
                    <p>5. Never marry a mope or a drone, one who drawls and draggles through life,
                        one foot after another, and lets things take their own course.</p>
                    <p>6. Never marry a man who treats his mother or sister unkindly or
                        indifferently. Such treatment is a sure indication of a mean and wicked man.</p>
                    <p>7. Never, on any account, marry a gambler or a profane person, one who in the
                        least speaks lightly of God or religion. Such a man can never make a good
                        husband.</p>
                    <p>8. Never marry a sloven, a mass who is negligent of his person or his dress,
                        and is filthy in his habits. The external appearance is an index to the
                        heart.</p>
                    <p>9. Shun the rake as a snake, viper, a very demon.</p>
                    <p>10. Finally, never marry a man who is addicted to the use of ardent spirits.
                        Depend upon it, you are better off alone, than you would be tied to a man
                        whose breath is polluted, and whose vitals are being gnawed out by
                    alcohol.</p>
