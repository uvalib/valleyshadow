<b>Radical Address to the People of the South</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that "fresh humiliation, outrage and final ruin" will be the lot of

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radical Congressional Committee have issued an address to the people of
                        the South. The intention of the Reconstruction acts, and the policy of
                        Congress are defined. It declares that the Radical party will exact
                        compliance with condition making renewal of civil war impossible, and that
                        it will secure the freedmen the full and equal rights of citizens. It asks
                        the freedmen to sustain with their votes, this policy and all the people of
                        the South to freely accept universal suffrage, to unite in the establishment
                        of public schools, and to favor the distribution of lands. It affirms that
                        "if the people of the States lately in rebellion shall cheerfully and in
                        good faith reorganize their governments upon the principles of the laws
                        passed by Congress, there will then remain no causes of difference between
                        the various sections of the country."</p>
                    <p>This is a brief abstract of the address; and the following is an extract. It
                        will be seen that the finality is not yet,
                        according to this: </p>
                    <p>"Congress reserves to itself the full and unrestricted right of judgment
                        whenever a State presents itself for admission into the Union.-That right
                        will be exercised fairly and generously. But yet in the interest of peace
                        and loyalty certain conditions an precedents are laid in laws. These must be
                        met. But beyond these conditions Congress must be satisfied also that the
                        people of the proposed States respectively are, and are likely to be, loyal
                        to the Union, by decisive and trustworthy majorities; that the institutions
                        are framed upon the basis of equality, and that they will, from year to
                        year, and from age to age, contribute to the peace, progress and prosperity
                        of the States and of the country."</p>
                    <p>The amount of all this is, says the Lynchburg Republican, that when the people of the South obey all the
                        requirements of he military bills, and then elect a Radical delegation to
                        Congress, and then do any thing else that may be required of them, they may,
                        perhaps, be admitted to the Union. This is what we have predicted all along
                        would be the case, and, therefore, we are not surprised at the new demand.
                        If our people can see anything encouraging in this we confess we can't. We
                        see nothing but fresh humiliation, outrage and final ruin so long as the
                        Radicals rule. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"We sincerely trust that the people of Virginia will take care that not a
                        vote be lost by their failure to register. We do not advise them to neglect
                        their agricultural pursuits, to meet at the cross-road ground, and upon the
                        court greens to listen to gaseous orators, but we do implore them to
                        register in their magisterial districts without delay. The white race cannot
                        lose the ascendancy which it has enjoyed in Virginia since the settlement at
                        Jamestown, unless our people are criminally indifferent or apathetic. The
                        stake which they have in the approaching elections is not one of those empty
                        political triumphs which, before the war used to excite such intense
                        interest among all classes. Their political rights, and the safety of life,
                        liberty and property are all involved in the issues which have been thrust
                        upon us by the military act. Every white man who fails to register will
                        deserve to be execrated as an enemy of his race, and as an unnatural husband
                        and father, whose name should be held in reproach by his descendants as one
                        who failed to defend his birthright when it was in jeopardy. The rich and
                        the poor, the great and the bumble, are alike interested in the registration
                        of every white voter in the State."</p>
                    <p>The triumph of a party like that, which has made a
                        terrestrial Inferno of Tennessee, would crush the mechanic by completely
                        paralysing the energy of the capitalist, and drive the wealthy from the
                        State by the wolfish agrarianism which it would inaugurate. We do not ask
                        every Virginian to aid us with all the force of talents, energy, public
                        spirit and mans which God has blessed him in making the registration as
                        complete as possible, for the purpose of denying to the negro a single right
                        which can be claimed for him as [UNCLEAR] of his liberty. By no means. But we wish, when a complete and thorough registration has
                            revealed the strength of the white men in this State to teach the
                            blacks, by our liberality towards them, that their best friends are
                            their former masters. When we have demonstrated to the deluded
                        negro followers of the demoralized white men who have poisoned their minds
                        against us, that we are master of the situation, we can afford to make the
                        lesson of our magnanimity and justice impressive. </p>
                    <p>"If the white men of this State, who have not been disfranchised, will take
                        care to register and vote, they will not only secure, beyond the possibility
                        of danger, their political rights and property, but they will be in
                        condition to aid in the work of speedy reconstruction upon terms not as
                        disadvantageous as they would be made by the triumph of Radicalism."</p>

                    <p>Of three negroes tried for this term of the Circuit Court for the detestable
                        offence of houseburning, two were acquitted and one sentenced to the mildest
                        penalty allowed by the law. The circumstantial evidence indicated that each
                        was guilty, and it was obviously the sympathy felt for the ignorance and
                        helplessness of the negro that induced the benefit of the doubt in his
                        favor. If they had been white men, on the same evidence, they would have
                        "gone up," sure. Our people do what they think right, and will never punish
                        prisoners in defence to "public sentiment," much less to political
                        prejudice.</p>
