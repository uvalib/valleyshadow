				<head>The Convention Called--How to Defeat the Schemes of the Radicals</head>
				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>The election for or against a Convention to frame a Constitution for this
						State, in accordance with the unconstitutional legislation of a Radical Rump
						Congress, and for delegates to represent the sovereignty of this glorious
						old State in that body, took place this day a week ago, and the result is
						that the Convention, as expected, has been called by a very large majority,
						and the delegates elected by the worst class of mean whites and by nearly
						the solid vote of the negroes will constitute about two thirds of that body
						whose duty it is to frame the organic law of the State. The large majority
						of the white and negro Radical representatives in the Convention will know
						about as much about framing a Constitution as a pig does about astronomy,
						and yet their stolid ignorance is the least objection which the great body
						of the people have to urge against them. The <emph rend="italic">animus
						</emph> which possesses them-the almost fiendish spirit which actuates
						them-their predetermined purpose to violate every principle of liberty and
						justice-it is this, connected with their power, by virtue of their
						controlling majority, to give effect to their demoniac desires, which so
						justly inspires the minds of our people with such gloomy and fearful
						forebodings. </p>
					<p>It is not our purpose now to indulge in lugubrious complaints or vain
						repinings that the Convention has been called and will be constituted of
						such objectionable components, or to explain how these results were brought
						about.</p>
					<p>We could assign reasons for it as "plentiful as blackberries in July," but
						that is not now the work before us.</p>
					<p>We propose to cheer the saddened hearts of our people by showing them that
						there is still a way to escape the direful fate which impends over them-that
						all is not lost which is in danger-that there is still a possibility, yea, a
						probability, that they may be enabled</p>
					<p>"<emph rend="italic">From the nettle, danger, to pluck the flower,
						safely.</emph>" </p>
					<p>The Constitution which will be framed by the Convention will be as worthless
						as waste paper till it be ratified by the registered voters of the State.
						The Constitution will fail to be ratified unless at least one-half of the
						registered voters vote upon the question of ratification. If the number
						voting be a majority of the registered voters-including those voting for and
						against-then a majority merely of those <emph rend="italic">voting </emph>
						will ratify. But as it requires at least one-half of the registered voters
						to <emph rend="italic">vote </emph> to effect ratification, if <emph
							rend="italic">none </emph> will vote who are opposed to ratification, it
						will require one-half of the whole number of <emph rend="italic">registered
						</emph> voters to vote in <emph rend="italic">favor </emph> of ratification
						to effect that object. </p>
					<p>This being so, it would seem that our people should have no difficulty in
						perceiving that it is the true policy of those who wish to defeat the
						ratification of the Constitution to have it universally understood that
							<emph rend="italic">none </emph>, so desiring should vote upon the
						question at all. Then ratification would fail, and the bottom would drop out
						of the Radical reconstruction tub, unless the friends of ratification could
						rally a vote which would be equal to one-half of the whole number of the
							<emph rend="italic">registered </emph> voters. By this mode of
						procedure, those who oppose ratification would have the benefit of <emph
							rend="italic">every </emph> registered voter who failed, from any cause,
						to vote, for such voter would count in the number of <emph rend="italic"
							>registered </emph> voters, however he might have voted had he gone to
						the polls, and the number cast in favor of ratification must, in that case,
						be at least half of the <emph rend="italic">whole </emph> number of voters
							<emph rend="italic">registered </emph>. </p>
					<p>This mode gives the opponents of ratification the benefit of the registered
						vote, not only of every voter who agrees with them in sentiment, but who
						could not or would not go to the polls to vote with them, but it gives them
						also the benefit of every registered voter who fails, from <emph
							rend="italic">any cause, to vote</emph>, however much he may have
						differed from them. In this way, the strength of their opponents may be made
						serviceable to them-every straggler from the polls would be added to the
						force of the grand army practicing the strategy of "masterly inactivity." </p>
					<p>To defeat the Radical schemes for radicalizing and enslaving the people of
						Virginia, her citizens have two great duties to perform, on of a positive
						and active character, and the either negative and passive. The former is, to
						increase as much as possible the number of registered white voters; and the
						latter, to get them to agree <emph rend="italic">unanimously not</emph> to
						vote upon the question of ratifying or rejecting the Constitution. </p>
					<p>Under the reconstruction acts of Congress, it is the <emph rend="italic">duty
						</emph> of the Boards of Registration, after giving <emph rend="italic"
							>reasonable </emph> notice of the time and place, to open their offices
						for the space of <emph rend="italic">five </emph> days, commencing <emph
							rend="italic">fourteen </emph> days prior to <emph rend="italic">any
						</emph> election under said acts, to revise the registration lists, and to
						add to such registry the names of all persons who may possess, at that time,
						the requisite qualifications, and who have not been already registered. </p>
					<p>We append Section 7th of the last of the reconstruction acts which contains
						the following provision:</p>
					<p>"The Boards of Registration shall have power, and it shall be their duty
						[ITAL it shall be their duty] commencing fourteen days prior to <emph
							rend="italic">any election under said act</emph>, and upon reasonable
						public notice of the time and place thereof, to revise for a period of five
						days the registration lists; and upon being satisfied that any person not
						entitled thereto has been registering to strike the name of such person from
						the list. And such Board shall also, during the same period, add to such
						registry the names of all persons who at that time possess the
						qualifications required by said act who have not been already registered." </p>
					<p>Thorough and efficient organization should be adopted to ensure the
						registration of <emph rend="italic">every white</emph> man who may possess
						the requisite qualifications at the time the offices of registration will be
						opened, fourteen days prior to the election for the ratification or
						rejection of the Constitution which will be adopted by the convention. No
						one can fail to see the vast importance of having the number of white
						registered voters as <emph rend="italic">large as possible</emph>. The white
						men who will fail to register at that time should be considered not only an
						enemy to liberty, but to his race-he should be <emph rend="italic">marana
							maranatha</emph>. </p>
					<p>Having quoted the law to show that we still have an opportunity to increase
						the number of registered voters, we will now quote our authority for the
						statement that, if <emph rend="italic">none </emph> shall vote in <emph
							rend="italic">opposition </emph> to ratification, it will require one
						half of the whole number of voters registered to vote in <emph rend="italic"
							>favor </emph> of it to effect ratification. </p>
					<p>The 5th section of the Supplementary Reconstruction act reads as follows:</p>
					<p>"That if, according to said returns, the Constitution shall be ratified by a
						majority of the votes of the registered electors qualified as herein
						specified, cast at said election, <emph rend="italic">at least one-half of
							the registered voters voting upon the question of such
						ratification</emph>, the President of the convention shall transmit a copy
						of the same," &amp;c. </p>
					<p>From this extract from the law, it will be seen that, upon the question of
						ratification at least one half of the registered voters shall vote, or the
						Constitution fails to be ratified, and the whole fabric of Radical
						reconstruction falls to the ground. It is for us to prevent, if possible,
						more than one-half of the registered voters from voting upon that question.
						Let us get as many to register as possible, and then prevent as many as
						possible from voting upon the question of ratification-either for or
						against.</p>
					<p>At this time, we think this is our true policy, and the only mode of escape
						from the direful fate which impends over us and our posterity.</p>

				<summary>Elections last week called for a Convention to draft a Constitution,
					although the editor argues that the "white and negro Radical Representatives in
					the Convention will know about as much about framing a Constitution as a pig
					does about astronomy." To thwart their "fiendish spirit" and "demoniac desires"
					the author offers a plan of "'masterly inactivity.'" Since law dictates that the
					Constitution must be approved by a majority of the registered voters, the editor
					urges every white man to register but not vote. Under these circumstances, "the
					white man who will fail to register," and then not vote, "should be considered
					not only an enemy to liberty, but to his race."</summary>

				<head>The Complexion of the Elections</head>
				<origin>Richmond Dispatch</origin>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>Every one, says the Richmond <emph rend="italic">Dispatch </emph>, who has
						not been made acquainted with the thorough system of organization through
						secret societies of the negro population of Virginia will be amazed to see
						with what unanimity they have voted everywhere for the Radical nominees.
						There has been no division amongst them. Not the slightest respect has been
						paid to personalities. They have voted as unanimously for the most
						inconsistent, corrupt, and disreputable men as they have for those in better
						standing. There is hardly a single one of their nominees who is respected in
						respectable communities; but there are some who are very much better than
						others. Their black constituents show, however, no greater deference to
						these than they do to all others. </p>
					<p>Naturally, these men must be all debased and depraved beings. First, in order
						to pave the way for the elevation by the negro vote to offices, in which
						they could never be placed by the white vote, they must alienate the negroes
						from the whites, and transfer their social relations from their own race to
						that of the negroes. This has been done, and these white persons have in the
						process unavoidably degraded themselves to a degree that makes them unworthy
						to associate with the blacks, whom they are merely using to gratify their
						low ambition.-They are doomed, ere long, to be valued at their true worth,
						even by the poor blacks, whom they have deluded, and finally to achieve
						their reward.</p>
					<p>A dreadful feature of this atrocious game is the complete alienation of the
						negro from the white people with whom he has been raised and with whom he
						must live.</p>
					<p>The returns from every county show that they are completely banded together
						as one man in a war-yet only political-against their people and their own
						best interests. It is the saddest feature of these monstrous times. Our
						citizens find that they have a body in their midst which is wholly and
						blindly antagonistic to them. No divisions amongst themselves-no appeals to
						reason from without-have made the slightest impression upon their solid
						union. It is a painful as it is incomprehensible.</p>
					<p>The white people of Virginia, however, can not shut their eyes to the fact,
						and should not fail to give to it the proper consideration.</p>

				<summary>Argues that the "unanimity" with which black men voted for Radical nominees
					"is as painful as it is incomprehensible." The white nominees who have attained
					their position through the votes of blacks, the author contends, have
					"unavoidably degraded themselves" and must "transfer their social relations from
					their own race to that of the negroes." Another "dreadful feature of this
					atrocious game is the complete alienation of the negro from the white people
					with whom he has been raised and with whom he must live."</summary>

					<p>Augusta County did not proclaim her detestation of the Radical scheme of
						Reconstruction, embracing the disfranchisement of her best citizens and the
						enormity of universal negro suffrage, with that emphasis which we
						desired.-She could and should have given a majority of 1600 against a
						Convention and for the Conservative ticket. We must confess that Augusta was
						remiss this time, but we feel satisfied that such will not be the case
						again. We would urge with great earnestness that <emph rend="italic">every
						</emph> citizen of the county, possessing the requisite qualifications, who
						failed, from any cause, to register before, will take good care to register
						when an opportunity will be again presented, so that he will be prepared to
						vote or not as his duty, at the time of election, may require. This is not
						time for the sentinels of liberty to be sleeping upon their posts. Every
						citizen, who is allowed to do so should arm himself with the freeman's
						weapon-the ballot-and should be ready and determined to cast it or not as
						his duty may demand.</p>

				<origin/>
				<commentary/>
				<excerpt/>
				<transcript>
					<p>On Monday night, the 21st inst., the anniversary of the establishment of the
						Staunton Lyceum, the following Officers elect entered upon the discharge of
						their duties: Col. Jno. B. Baldwin, President; Col. Bolivar Christian, Vice
						President; R. M. Guy, Esq., Secretary, and Marshall Hanger, Esq., Treasurer.
						Col. Jas. H. Skinner, the former President, in vacating the Chair, made a
						few brief and appropriate remarks welcoming the President elect, whereupon
						that officer-Col. Baldwin-before entering upon the duties of his office,
						delivered an inaugural address which was characterized with the practical
						views and good sense which uniformly mark his utterances. He became a member
						of the Lyceum, acting upon the principle that he always wished to be a
						participant in whatever would tend to promote the moral, social,
						intellectual, political or physical welfare of this community. He thought
						the Lyceum should be encouraged and sustained-that its benefits, moral,
						social and intellectual, were really very great. That the men should become
						members-some speaking and some contributing members-that such as did not
						become members should likewise be willing to contribute money to sustain the
						Lyceum and purchase a good library-that the ladies should encourage it by
						giving it the benefit of their presence, and the smiles of their approval.
						He concluded by introducing the orator appointed to deliver the anniversary
						address before the Lyceum, Y. Howe Peyton, Esq. Mr. Peyton delivered an
						eloquent address which was listened to by the large audience of ladies and
						gentlemen with rapt attention from the beginning to the close.</p>
					<p>The following question was selected to be discussed on next Monday night, the
						5th of November:</p>
					<p>"<emph rend="italic">Resolved </emph>, That the laws should prohibit the
						transportation and distribution of the mails on Sunday." </p>
					<p>The following members were appointed to discuss it:--In the affirmative, Rev.
						J. A. Latane and R. Mauzy-in the negative, Col. Jas. H. Skinner and Dr. C.
						R. Harris.</p>
