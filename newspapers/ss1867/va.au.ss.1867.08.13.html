<b>A Bitter Pill</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that at the Radical Convention in Richmond, Hunnicutt offered the
                    cooperationists "a bitter pill" to swallow if they join the Radical party in
                    Virginia, one that includes "every reconstruction act" and the "body and soul"
                    of blacks. The editor contends that David Fultz, the white delegate from
                    Augusta, would not consent to take this pill, "and returned to Staunton as fast
                    as steam could carry him after learning the character of the prescription."<br>(Names in announcement:  David Fultz,  Sam'l Cline)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The following is the bitter pill which Hunnicutt announced in the Radical
                        Convention the co-operationists would have to swallow if they wished to
                        become members of the Radical party in Virginia. He said:</p>
                    <p>"Now we tell the strangers that if they want to come with us they will have
                        to swallow a bitter pill. They must swallow the constitutional amendment,
                        the civil rights bill, the Sherman-Shellabarger-Wilson bill, the
                        supplementary bills, every reconstruction act, the iron-clad oath, the 17th
                        of April platform, Wardwell, Hunnicutt, and the nigger. [Cheers] Yes, the
                        nigger-his head, his feet, his hide, his hair, his tallow, his bones, and
                        his suet! Nay, his body and soul! Yes; all these they must swallow, and then
                        perhaps, they can be called Republicans. They must
                         affiliate with Hunnicutt and his set.' So the dose is ready for the
                        patients. Let them come up." </p>
                    <p>Those co-operationists who remained would have gulphed the pill, and
                        Hunnicutt seemed willing to give them a chance to do so, but the colored men
                        who controlled the body refused them the opportunity. The white delegate
                        from this county, David Fults, Esq., could not consent to do so, and
                        returned to Staunton as fast as steam could carry him after learning the
                        character of the prescription. Those cannot be surprised at the conduct of
                        Mr. Fultz who know him to be a man of character and intelligence with a high
                        sense of self-respect, but would have been surprised if he had remained
                        after seeing the character of the Convention and those who controlled it as
                        exhibited on the first day.</p>
                    <p>The motives, we doubt not, of Mr. Fulz, Sam'l Cline, and a few others who
                        participated in the meeting here which appointed delegates to that Radical
                        Convention, were good, but they acted upon a mistaken policy and upon a
                        wholly mistaken view of the annimus and purposes
                        of the party with which they resolved to co-operate. Of this fact they are
                        now, no doubt, convinced. The controlling element of that party require a
                        sacrifice which they cannot make unless we very much mistake their
                        characters. In speaking of the manner in which the co-operationists were
                        treated, the Lynchburg Republican  says: </p>
                    <p>"The 'Respectable' element is clean cut out by a single stroke of the
                        Hunnicuts scalpel. It is possible, indeed, that a few of the Albemarle
                        converts may remain with the party even now, and endorse those cruel and
                        scandalous resolutions which applaud the oppression of the Southern people.
                        But these few are the black sheep, who were always rotten at heart, and who
                        will do nothing to make Virginia Radicalism respectable by adding their
                        names to its rolls.</p>
                    <p>If there be one instinct of decency, one spark of State pride and love, one
                        thought of regard for the opinion of honorable men in the breasts of the
                        Albemarle party, they will all turn back with loathing now from the path on
                        which they had entered. We have always spoken with respect and charity of
                        the well-designing gentlemen who made this unfortunate and ill-timed. We have given them credit for being
                        impelled by worthy and patriotic motives. If they come back now, we shall
                        rest assured that our faith in their honor was not misplaced. If they do not
                        respect and reform, we shall know that they are not worthy of the name of
                        Virginians; that they are not worthy or her saintly dead; that they are not
                        true to her record of glory; that they do not deserve to be called the
                        kindred of her ever-patient and valiant people. </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR:--On the second of August, after much previous preparation, our
                        merry party set out for the romantic little
                        village of Goshen, where a Picnic was come off in honor of the Sunday School
                        of that place. Those of your readers who have visited this part of Virginia
                        know something of the sublimity of its scenery. If we had some one who could
                        give an adequate description of its beauties, it would, we think, soon
                        become a favorite resort for those who have an eye for the beauties of
                        nature.-But we must quit expatiating on scenery, and return to the Picnic.
                        We were rather late, and found an immense crowd assembled; but through the
                        gallantry of some gentlemen got very comfortable scats. We regret
                        exceedingly that we were not present at the opening exercises. The Rev. Geo.
                        B. Taylor, of Staunton, delivered a very instructive address to the
                        children, when was followed by excellent singing, remarks by the Pastor and
                        others. A large number of children were present, and the most perfect order
                        was preserved throughout the day. After a very cordial invitation, the
                        assembly repaired to the adjoining grove, where a bountiful repast was
                        spread, to which, all did ample justice; even the most fastidious could not
                        complain. When all were satisfied, we re-entered the Church, and were
                        generally entertained by Dr. Broaddus, and others. The whole affair was a
                        great success, and the conductors deserve much credit. </p>
                    <p>We now turned our faces homeward, feeling well repaid for going to the
                        Picnic. After riding some miles, we were appalled by the rapid progress of a
                        very threatening cloud. Bonnets, hats, &amp;c., were anxiously thought
                        of, and how greatly relieved were we, when a lady experienced in such trips,
                        presented a band box, which was stowed  under the
                        buggy seat. We veiled our heads, and reached home, showing marks of a refreshing time. LINNA. </p>
