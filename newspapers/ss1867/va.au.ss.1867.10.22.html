<b>Rail Road Subscription</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Farmer" decries the subscription of $300,000 for the Chesapeake and Ohio
					Railroad that will soon be submitted to the voters of Augusta. He urges readers
					to vote against it, arguing that it will benefit Ohio but not Augusta. If it
					does pass, the author expresses his hope that those with "manly fortitude,
					heroic patriotism, and enlightened regard" will "resist its collection by every
					lawful means."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>I learn from a communication in a Spectator  of
						recent date over the signature of "X," that the County Court at its last
						term made an order submitting to the voters of the county, the question of a
						subscription of three hundred thousand (300,000) dollars, to the Chesapeake
						and Ohio Railroad. I have not a copy of the act of the Legislature
						conferring this authority upon the Court, and am therefore unacquainted with
						its terms, or the date of its passage.-But whatever may be the provisions of
						the act, or whenever it may have been enacted, it is obvious that a state of
						things exists at this time in Va. neither contemplated nor foreseen by the
						Legislature. </p>
					<p>The law under which this proceeding is to take place, doubtless authorizes
						the Court to submit the question to the qualified voters of the country. At
						the passage of this act of the Assembly, "the qualified voters" were a
						portion of the citizens of the State clearly ascertained and accurately
						distinguished, by the Constitution, as possessing certain qualifications
						which entitled them to the exercise of the elective franchise. And to the
						citizens of the State, resident in the county, possessing these
						qualifications, and to none others, was the Court authorized to submit such
						questions. An act of the Legislature authorizing the Court to submit a
						certain question to the vote of one class of citizens, can confer no
						authority upon it to submit the question to an entirely different class.
						And, this question of subscription will be submitted to, and decided by, the
						votes of persons to whom the Legislature never designed to grant such
						authority; whilst a large number of the persons by whose votes the law
						intended this question to be determined will be excluded from any voice or
						influence in its decision. It is perfectly evident that the Legislature
						never intended the decision of such persons except those authorized by the
						Constitution and laws of the State. It, therefore seems to me that the legal
						authority of the Court to submit this question to the represents voters of
						the county is extremely doubtful.-This order of the Court will, however,
						afford an opportunity to a large number of persons to bind heavy burdens for
						other people's shoulders, whilst they will not touch them, with so much as
						one of their fingers.</p>
					<p>If this subscription should be carried, I hope there will be found a goodly
						number of the people possessing enough of that manly fortitude, heroic
						patriotism and enlightened regard to legal rights which animated John
						Hampden, to make them resist its collection by every lawful means. A tax
						imposed in this way is as much in contravention of justice and the
						constitutional rights of the citizen, as was the imposition of "ship money"
						by Charles the First.</p>
					<p>It is incumbent upon the advocates oft his subscription to show, that the
						county has some special and peculiar interest to be advance by the
						completion of this railroad. Will it open a new market for its surplus
						products? It certainly will not. Because it penetrates a country having a
						large surplus of just such products as Augusta county wishes to sell. The
						State of Ohio will not want to purchase our wheat, corn, hay, apples,
						whiskey or pork, for the reason that these are the very products she has for
						sale. The road, however, will accomplish one result, it will bring Ohio
						products into direct competition with us at our very doors.-But, if it will
						open to us no new market it will, doubtless, increase our facilities for
						reaching our present one. It will be borne in mind that the Chesapeake and
						Ohio Railroad is merely an extension of the Central. We will, therefore only
						have our present facilities of getting our surplus to market, burdened with
						all the increased transportation consequent upon the extension of the road
						to the Ohio river. Those persons who live along the line of a railroad can
						tell whether the transportation of the way
						freight is ever postponed to through . Or
						if they cannot at present, perhaps they will be able to do so when the
						Central cars are flying "onward to Richmond," freighted with Ohio what and
						flour, whilst theirs moulds and rots in the depots, and the tax collector
						sells milch cows and plough horses, to meet the county subscription of
						$300.000. </p>
					<p>But if it will not increase the facilities of getting to market, perhaps it
						will cheapen the cost. It may do so, but I can see no reason why it should.
						When the Central reaches the Ohio river it will have to compete for freight
						and travel with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. And to do this successfully
						the charges upon through freight and travel will have to be reduced to the
						lowest figure, which is the mere cost of transportation to the
						Railroad.-This will obviously be a great advantage to Ohio. But wherein will
						it ensue to the benefit of Augusta? I can see but one advantage she can
						derive from it, and that is one highly honorable to her disinterested and
						enlarged liberality. The already high charges upon her surplus products will
						have to be kept up, if not increased, in order to enable the road to carry
						Ohio products at a low rate. Noble, generous, magnanimous Augusta!!</p>
					<p>But if it will not cheapen, immediately, the cost of transportation, perhaps
						it will establish a rival line, the natural competition between which and
						the Central will eventually reduce freights to a reasonable amount.
						Certainly it will not, for being a mere extension of the Central, it will
						only enlarge the sphere and lengthen the field for the display of the
						admirable administrative and executive abilities of the present Directory.</p>
					<p>But if the completion of the road to the Ohio river will neither increase our
						facilities of getting to market, nor reduce the cost, the subscription of
						$300,000 will surely so reduce  our taxes, and
						make the payment so facile , that it will be a
						real pleasure to meet Towberman and Lightner with their ticket bags. And
						even if this small  subscription should
						unexpectedly increase our taxes, the prospects ahead, both politically and
						financially, are so bright and encouraging, that we ought not to hesitate at
						increased pecuniary undertakings. The advocates of this subscription can
						safely assure the people that the "clouds," which, at present, hang so
						portentously over their heads are "big with mercies," and to guarantee that
						they shall "burst in blessings on their heads." </p>
					<p>Some hundreds of years hence, as some antiquarian son of "old Augusta"
						examines her must records, how his heart will swell and exult, as he reads
						her history, and learns that whilst she paid twenty
							thousand dollars for bringing the railroad to her county seat and
						geographical centre, with a generosity and magnanimity unparalleled, she
						taxed herself three hundred thousand dollars to
						make a road for the benefit of the people of Ohio! </p>
					<p>FARMER.</p>

<b>Reaction Against a Convention</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Expresses satisfaction that most newspapers in the state, "except avowed
					Radical ones," have now joined the Spectator's opinion, urging their readers to
					vote against the Convention. The author also argues that if the election were

					would be defeated "notwithstanding the negro vote in favor of it."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
					<p>Nearly all the papers in this State, except avowed Radical ones, are now
						earnestly calling upon the voters to vote against
						 the Convention. For many months the Spectator
						 occupied this position "solitary and alone." The policy advocated by
						the Spectator  from the beginning, without
						"variableness or shadow of turning," is now endorsed by a large majority of
						the white voters of the State, and if the election were postponed a month
						longer, the Convention would be voted down, notwithstanding the negro vote
						in favor of it. The course of the Spectator has been satisfactorily
						vindicated. </p>
					<p>This is but another illustration of great truth that principle should never
						be discarded, and that the right , if
						persistently maintained, will ultimately triumph. The people should never
						cease to cling to the right, and to hope for its success. In the language of
						Buckle, whom we have several times quoted recently, "in any country which
						pretends to be free let no one be disheartened by the temporary overthrow of
						the Right. Weak, vain, and vicious theories soon perish when brought forth
						into that strong current which makes Truth only the more robust. There is no
						device nor cunning which can long delay the march of Public Opinion-and
						Experience soon tears to pieces and tramples under her
							feet those flimsy disguises and stratagems by which bold and bad men
							seek to pervert or mould to their own benefit the destinies of a great,
							free and enlightened people." </p>

<b>Against a Convention</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Disparages the Petersburg Index's "complacent assumption" that they were

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>

						month since, the Index  was fairly and squarely
						committed to the opposition to the calling of a Convention. </p>

					<p>Promptly in response to our call upon the press answered the Lynchburg Republican , the Norfolk Virginian , the Winchester News  the
						Warrenton Index , the Staunton Spectator , the Fredericksburg News  and Herald , and in fact all
						the papers of Northern Virginia against a Convention.-Petersburg Index, Oct 17th. </p>
					<p>The complacent assumption of the Index that the Staunton Spectator responded to its  call to
						oppose a convention, made "about a month since," will excite the
						responsibilities of the readers of the Spectator 
						who know that it has been opposing the Convention not only "about a month"
						but for about seven  months-ever since it has
						been presented for the action of the people. </p>
					<p>Since we commenced our opposition to the call of the Convention, the editor
						of the Index  constructed what is known as the
						Petersburg Platform, mounted it, and earnestly called upon the people to
						rally upon it. </p>
					<p>If there be any credit due to the journal which was first to oppose the call
						for a Convention, that credit is certainly  due
						to the Spectator , for it did not hesitate at
						all, but took that position as soon as the bill was passed, (four or five
						months in advance of any other paper) and has maintained it earnestly and
						consistently to the present time. If all the other papers had been as
						prompt, decided, and earnest in opposition to it, the call for a Convention
