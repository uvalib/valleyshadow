<b>The Object of the Convention</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that any "conservatives" who vote for a convention "will vote in
                    company with Radicals and negroes." Such men, the article suggests, may be

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Radical plan of reconstruction was devised by the Radical Congress for
                        the purpose of ensuring the rule of the Radical party by Radicalizing the
                        Southern States, and that was to be accomplished chiefly by incorporating in
                        both the State and Federal Constitutions the privilege of universal negro
                        suffrage. All who are in favor of accomplishing these objects, and who wish
                        to do so even in gross and palpable, yea confessed, violation of the
                        constitution, will vote for a Convention called for those purposes. That
                        extreme Radicals and negroes will so vote may be expected, but that
                        conservatives should vote with them may well excite surprise. It will be
                        hard for a professed conservative to vote that way without exciting the
                        suspicion that he has an axe to grind. Those who vote that way will vote in
                        company with Radicals and negroes, and those who contemplate doing so may
                        profit by reflecting upon the fate of the stork in the fable which was found
                        in company with the geese, and which had its neck wrung in spite of its
                        protestations of innocence-being judged by the company it kept. Those who
                        vote that way may have cause to regret it as long as they live.</p>

<b>Reaction--Stand by the Right</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Summarizes the editorial position of the Spectator since the promulgation

                    now under way, and will ultimately "overwhelm in righteous ruin the usurping,

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>It will be remembered that when the Radical Congress, which was not, in fact,
                        a Constitutional Congress at all, but merely a fraction of a Rump Radical
                        Congress, adopted the Radical plan of re-construction, so-called, and
                        submitted it for adoption or rejection to the vote of the suffragans of the
                        Southern States, that this journal earnestly maintained that both principle
                        and expediency demanded that they should reject it. Principle demanded it,
                        because it was in violation of the Constitution which all were under the
                        most solemn obligations to support, maintain, and defend, and because it was
                        subversive of every principle of Constitutional liberty, an designed for the
                        humiliation and degradation of the Southern people. Expediency demanded it,
                        because if the Southern people should remain true to themselves, true to the
                        Constitutional rights of the whole people of the country, North and South,
                        cling to the constitution as the mariner clings to the last plank of the
                        shipwreck when night and the tempest close around him, and the people of the
                        North had not so degenerated as to have lost all respect for Constitutional
                        obligations, all love for Constitutional liberty, and all regard for justice
                        and equality of rights, it would follow, in the course of time, as surely as
                        that the day succeeds the night, and that reason triumphs over passion, that
                        a reaction of sentiment would take place in the minds of Northern
                        people-that, at first, it might be so small as hardly to be perceptible, but
                        that it would continue to increase in force an swell in volume till, like a
                        might flood, it would over flow the whole North, and overwhelm in righteous
                        ruin the usurping, despotic, oppressive, unconstitutional Radical party.</p>
                    <p>Entertaining these views and animated by these hopes, we counseled our people
                        to remain firm and steadfast, to exercise heroic fortitude and patient
                        endurance, to suffer with philosophic stoicism and christian resignation
                        such evils as might be forced  upon them, nolens volens, but not, for any consideration, to
                        become particeps criminis to their own vile
                        degradation and base humiliation. We exhorted them to remain true and
                        faithful to the pure and bright record which illumines and illustrates their
                        glorious history-not to sacrifice, through the want of moral courage, that
                        enviable and glorious fame which it required so much time, and the exercise
                        of so many noble and virtuous qualities to attain. </p>
                    <p>We entertained and expressed the belief that, however the people in other
                        parts of the South might act, the large majority of the white voters of the
                        great and noble Augusta, gallant little Highland, and patriotic Bath would
                        enter their solemn protests against the unconstitutional radical plan of
                        reconstruction by voting "against the Convention," called for the purpose of
                        carrying that plan into effect, and that too, by the voluntary action of the
                        voters of the South. Our confidence in the patriotism and firmness of the
                        voters of these counties is as great now as it was months since, when we
                        first gave expression to it.</p>
                    <p>Believing that the restoration of the South to constitutional rights was
                        dependent upon a reaction in the sentiments of a portion of the Northern
                        people, and believing that reaction would certainly take place if the people
                        of the South should have the moral courage to plant themselves firmly and
                        steadfastly upon the platform of their constitutional rights, and believing
                        that reaction would be expedited by extreme, oppressive and unconstitutional
                        legislation on the part of the fraction of the Rump Radical Congress, we did
                        not lament the passage of the military bills which placed the Southern
                        States under the rule of bayonets, for we felt that an appeal from under the
                        bayonets would be the strongest that could be made to any liberty-loving
                        people, and that, if the people of the North retained any just sense of the
                        value of liberty, and of their own interests, such as an appeal would be
                        heeded, and a wholesome reaction would be the result. That our views were
                        correct has been attested by every authentic expression of opinion which has
                        been given in the Northern States since that time. No election, municipal or
                        State, has taken place in any of the loyal States, so-called, since that
                        time, which has not confirmed the views we entertained and expressed, and
                        endeavored to impress upon the minds of the Southern people.</p>
                    <p>The reaction we anticipated has commenced, and that, too, more rapidly than
                        we had allowed ourselves to expect.</p>
                    <p>Not long since we inquired of a distinguished Confederate General, whose
                        heroism and patriotism are equaled by his piety and christian virtues, and
                        had spent most of his time since the war in the Northern and Western States,
                        what were the views entertained by the friends of the South in those States
                        and what course they desired the Southern people to pursue in reference to
                        reconstruction, and were gratified to learn from him that the friends of the
                        South in the North concur exactly with the views maintained by this journal
                        and desire the South to act as it has recommended.</p>
                    <p>A friend who has had a conference with one of the ablest and most
                        distinguished conservative divines of the Empire State of the North informs
                        us that the distinguished minister corroborates the statements made to us by
                        the Confederate general in reference to the views and wishes of the friends
                        of the Constitutional liberty in the Northern and Western States.</p>
                    <p>We have mentioned these facts for the encouragement of those who are resolved
                        to remain true to the principles of the Constitutional liberty, and who
                        cannot be induced either by persuasion or intimidation to make a voluntary
                        sale of their birthright for less than a mess of pottage. There may be some
                        who, not controlled by principle and acting upon mistaken views of
                        expediency, would advise a different line of conduct. "Hearken not to the
                        voice of the charmer, charm he never so wisely," Be true to the right.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"The purpose of the Radicals is to put the Southern States under negro
                        control. The proscription of whites, military rule, and universal negro
                        suffrage, are the expedients. The scheme is now in process of execution. If
                        successful it envelopes the South in the blackness of night. It puts the
                        government in the hands of utterly incapable persons, led by depraved
                        mercenaries. It puts the power of taxation in the hands of paupers, who
                        would thus have the means of confiscating, for their own advantage, the
                        property of the people under the forms of law. In short, vice, ignorance,
                        and rapacity, inflamed by the animosities of race and caste, would be
                        enthroned; while intelligence and virtue would be doomed to retirement and
                        persecution, and industry and property to spoliation.</p>
                    <p>"Some of our people have been proposing to 'co-operate' in establishing the
                        domination that is thus to destroy us. This, which would in the best view be
                        gratuitous and monstrous, is under the actual facts of the cease utterly
                        astounding! If the registration rolls revealed an irresistible majority for
                        those on whom the Radicals rely, 'co-operation' would be idle.-But when the
                        figures which have been published in this paper, disclose the contrary; when
                        it is abundantly manifest that it is only necessary for the assailed class
                        to stand together, in order to secure the control of the State; the policy
                        which would, by co-operation,' transfer power to the minority, and inflict
                        the precise evil which it should be a special and absorbing anxiety to
                        avert,--it is nothing short of insane!-It is impossible to comprehend it, as
                        the deliberate conviction of a balanced intellect and straightforward
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>"We desire to say to the New York Herald , that
                        while the people of the South, in submission to superior force, are
                        compelled to obey, and do obey, the violent and unconstitutional decrees of
                        which they are the victims,--yet they do not approve them, do not endorse
                        them, and look forward not  with hope, but with
                            terror , to their consummation in the
                        'reconstruction' which the Radicals contemplate. We believe that such
                        reconstruction will be the gigantic horror which the Herald  describes. We believe it is the duty of every good
                        citizen, and of every selfish citizen, in whatever section of the country he
                        may reside, to interpose to avert evils in which, though unequally, all will
                        share. Dragged along to our fate by a power we may not dispute,--like a
                        helpless vessel towed by an insane pilot to Niagara's fatal plunge,--we hail
                        with joy the recognition of our peril by the Herald
                         and its co-auditors, and the hope of relief which it inspires. Let
                        them not relax their efforts nor soften their cries, through any
                        representations made by any here, that the people of the South are stupidly
                        insensible to the approaching terrors, and even desire a settlement on that  basis, as preferable to the present unrest! </p>
                    <p>"We appeal to our people to support this effort, to avert the doom
                        predestined for us by the Radicals. To 'co-operationists' we would say, here
                        is a 'co-operation' that is wise and legitimate and honorable. Let us not be
                        insensible to these exhibitions of interest in our unhappy condition, and of
                        a desire to rescue us from some of its chief calamities. Let us not
                        discourage them by severely hugging  our
                        unconstitutional, intolerable, ruinous chains, in the eyes of the world, and
                        expressing impatient pinings for the day when, under the name of
                        'reconstruction,' they are to be forever riveted! Let us rather implore the
                        relief of which the hope is excited, by earnestly, anxiously, persistently
                        testifying to its vital and indispensable necessity, and to our full sense
                        of the horrors which otherwise impend!" </p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Died, on the 13th, on Middle River, near Churchville, ANNA LAURA, daughter of
                        G. W. and M. S. Lilly, aged one year, nine months and twenty five days.</p>
                    <p>She was the second child of her parents and much beloved by them, and all who
                        knew her.-But she was dearer to her Heavenly Father, so He took her from
                        this world of sorrow to Himself where she will grow in loveliness, and be
                        caressed by a greater circle of friends. Her youth will never decay; her
                        beauty never fade; nor will the blighting influences of sin effect her
                        innocent soul. She drinks at the fountain of the "water of life" freely. She
                        wears a robe made "white in the blood of the Lamb." She bathes ever in the
                        "pure river of water of life," and under "the tree of life, on either side
                        of the river," she securely abides, singing the song of heaven, learned by
                        none but the heavenly choir. Much happiness did she afford her parents while
                        she lived, and now they should rejoice that she is forever happy. As a
                        heavenly messenger, she soothed many of their cares, and delighted them with
                        her innocent company; but, at a moment they least expected, she took her
                        flight</p>
                    <p>To a world of light,</p>
                    <p>Beck'ning as she sped</p>
                    <p>To follow the dead,</p>
                    <p>From a world like this</p>
                    <p>To a world of bliss</p>
                <br>
