                <excerpt>"The morals of this county must be slightly on the decline. We presume the
                    negroes, as usual, furnish the bulk of the criminal business. Our free colored
                    population possess the glorious privilege of going to law, and they enjoy their
                    freedom with a rush until they get into jail when its area is somewhat
                    circumscribed."</excerpt>
