                    <p>A band of colored musicians from Hagerstown visited this place on Monday
                        last. They discoursed some very fine music through our streets and after
                        enjoying themselves among their "free brethren," on this side the line,
                        returned home to "bondage," in the evening train, very well convinced, we
                        have no doubt, that the worst form of Slavery that can possibly exist may be
                        found among the negroes of Pennsylvania. We believe it is the custom in
                        Maryland, at Easter time, to allow the negroes the largest liberty, and this
                        Band had the audacity, on this occasion, to come into a free State as if for
                        no other purpose than to show the sympathizers of John Brown, deceased, that
                        their pikes and Sharpe's Rifles were not required to improve their
                        condition, and that all the Republican philanthropy expended on the slave
                        could be more appropriately used in bettering the condition of the free
                        negro in the North.</p>
