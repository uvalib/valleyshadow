<b>Regular Nominee</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit changes its position and decides no longer to support Douglas.
                    It denies that Douglas is really the regular nominee of the party, since he
                    never received the required two-thirds of the vote from the National Convention.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The only hold Mr. Douglas has on the Democratic party is that he claims to be
                        the "regular nominee." Take that away and his last and only prop is knocked
                        from under him. Let us briefly examine his claim: The National convention
                        expressly decided that it required two-thirds of the whole vote of that body
                        to impart regularity and validity to a National nomination. The two- thirds
                        of the Convention was 202. Mr. Douglas never received that vote. The highest
                        vote he did receive on any ballot was 181 1/2. Had the Convention remained
                        in session until dooms-day he could not have received the two-third
                        vote--the vote necessary to make him the "regular nominee." It was secession
                        alone that gave him a nomination of any kind. He is merely the nominee of a
                        conclave of his partisans.</p>
                    <p>How does the case stand with Mr. Johnson; We suppose that he claims to be a
                        "regular nominee" also. Mr. Fitzpatrick declined the honor of running on the
                        same ticket with Mr. Douglas, so did Mr. Yancey. But the convenient Mr.
                        Johnson accepted the nomination from the hands of three men in a back parlor
                        of a hotel at Washington. How easily regular nominees are manufactured
                        now-a-days! The Democratic party we trust will not suffer itself to be
                        cheated and deceived any longer by this clamor about regular
                    nominations.</p>
                <br>

<b>Bad Faith</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>States that the paper can no longer support Douglas because he flip-flopped
                    on a key issue. In 1856, Douglas said that no power could deprive slave-holders
                    in the territories of their slaves after the Supreme Court stated that slavery
                    was recognized in the territories. However, in the Lincoln-Douglas debate at
                    Freeport he stated that the Territorial Legislature could legally exclude
                    slavery.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The chief objection to Judge Douglas is his want of faith. In July, 1856, in
                        his seat in the United States Senate, he declared that if the Supreme Court
                        should decide that slavery was recognized in the Territories under the
                        Federal Constitution, there was no power on earth could deprive the owner of
                        his rights. Mr. Douglas then agreed to submit the whole question of slavery
                        in the Territories to the adjudication of the Courts. After the question was
                        decided, however, in favor of the equal rights of the South in the
                        Territories, Mr. Douglas declared, at Freeport, that it did not "matter what
                        the decision of the Supreme Court might be, the Territorial Legislature
                        might legally exclude slavery, either by
                        non-action or unfriendly legislation."</p>
                    <p>It is because Mr. Douglas has thus shown his hands--because he has declared
                        that he would submit to the decision of the Court, and they declared that
                        the decision might be legally overthrown by a
                        Territorial Legislature, that the Constitutional Democracy can no longer
                        trust him. They have no confidence in a public man who openly proposed to
                        cheat any section of the Union out of the rights adjudicated to them by the
                        Supreme Court, especially by such unmanly legislative tricks as "non-action"
                        or "unfriendly legislation."</p>
