<b>Speech of Hon. J.P. Benjamin of Louisiana</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Transcript of speech delivered by Senator Benjamin of Louisiana in response
                    to speech given by Senator Douglas, which accused the Democrats who seceded from
                    the Convention of disunity. Benjamin attacks Douglas for going back on his
                    promises during Kansas-Nebraska to accede to the dictates of the Court, which
                    Benjamin argues were clearly set forward in the Dredd Scott case.<br>

<b>[continuation of Benjamin's speech]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Douglas responds to Benjamin, and says that the Senator from Mississippi
                    was not faithful to the Cincinnati platform and was reaching for too many rights
                    for the South. Douglas argues that the South gets all it deserves under the
                    Cincinnati platform.<br>

<b>To The Public</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Editor J.M. Cooper announces his resignation, due to his disagreement with
                    the leaning of the Democratic National Convention to nominating Douglas. He
                    asserts that Douglas abandoned the Cincinnati platform, repudiated the Supreme
                    Court, and caused the defeat of Democratic candidates in Pennsylvania. Since he
                    cannot support Douglas in good conscience, he feels he cannot continue to direct
                    a Democratic newspaper.<br>(Names in announcement:  J.M. Cooper,   Ripper,   Mengel)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--This world renowned philanthropist paid our town the honor of a visit last
                        week, and during her stay in the place was the guest of the Misses Chambers.
                        This lady has occupied her entire time for many years, and spent an ample
                        fortune, in efforts to improve the condition of that numerous and
                        unfortunate class of beings who fill the cells and dungeons of Poor Houses
                        and Prisons. It was through her exertions that the State Lunatic Asylum at
                        Harrisburg was established. She visited this place about fifteen years ago,
                        at the time she was memorializing the Legislature of the State on the
                        subject, and examined our Poor House and Prison, and published in her
                        Memorial a full description of their condition. This lady has obtained the
                        sobriquet of the "Crazy Angel," but we think the "Angel of the Crazy" would
                        be more appropriate.</p>

                        delighted with the deportment of the Band. They were ready and willing to

                        for the military. Their delightful music contributed greatly to the
