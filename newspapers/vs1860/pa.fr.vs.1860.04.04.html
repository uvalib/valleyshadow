<b>Post Office Affairs</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Complains of the time lag for mail between Washington and Chambersburg.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have borne with vexatious delays in the transmission of our mail between
                        Chambersburg and Washington City, till forbearance has ceased to be a
                        virtue. Our letters and papers could be conveyed between these points by an ox cart in less time than they frequently
                        take, and yet there is railroad all the way. Matter intended for last week's
                        paper, and deposited in the Post Office at Washington Friday afternoon,
                        reached us on Monday evening. It should have been here on Saturday, for the
                        first morning train from Washington connects straight through. Our last
                        week's paper, delivered at the office in this place on Tuesday afternoon,
                        had not reached our Washington subscribers on Saturday evening.</p>
                    <p>These are not the only instances of delay. If they were, we should not
                        complain. But this vexatious state of things has existed for six or eight
                        months, and our letters and papers have very often taken from one to three
                        days longer than above stated to pass between the points mentioned. Some
                        months ago, after waiting for the evil to correct itself, we made a brief
                        allusion to it, but without effect. We are now determined to thump out a
                        remedy somehow or other, and we give notice to all concerned that we shall
                        agitate this subject till the cause of our just complaint shall be
                    removed.</p>
