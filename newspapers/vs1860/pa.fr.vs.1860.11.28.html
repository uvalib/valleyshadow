                    the white trash in the car." When the conductor took hold of him, Sanderston
                    struck the man in the head. During the court case, he stated that he was in a

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have watched with an anxious eye the movements now going on at the South.
                        We believed that the election of Lincoln would induce some to the Southern
                        States to withdraw from the Union. Our fears did not magnify the danger. A
                        careful scrutiny of the doings of the people of certain Southern States, has
                        satisfied us that the American Union will be smaller three months hence than
                        it is now, unless the Northern States strike from their statute books all
                        laws that infringe the constitutional rights of the South. It is plain that
                        South Carolina and several other States are resolved on going out; and it is
                        certain that if the North attempts to coerce them the whole South will unite
                        in their defense.</p>
                    <p>But we do no yet despair of the Union. There is encouragement in the attitude
                        of Virginia, that ancient and glorious commonwealth, which never losses
                        sight of true principles and never swerves from the path of patriotism.
                        Virginia, whilst firmly maintaining the constitutional rights of the section
                        to which she belongs, will, we are told, remain in the Union and act as
                        mediator between the North and the seceding Southern States. She will
                        endeavor to obtain from the Northern States a repeal of their laws
                        obstructing the reclamation of fugitive slaves; and these being repealed,
                        she will use her influence to induce the seceding States to return to the
                        Union. She proposes to herself a great and glorious mission, and confiding
                        in her wisdom, her moderation and her patriotism, we believe that she will
                        be successful.</p>
                    <p>The present would seem to be a proper time for the final adjustment of the
                        questions in dispute between the North and the South. The quarrel has gone
                        on too long already. Let the two sections sit down calmly together and talk
                        over the points in issue, and if agreement is out of the question, let them
                        peaceably separate. We do not believe that it is impossible for them to
                        agree. The Northern people have apparently, but
                        we think not really, gone crazy on the subject of
                        slavery. Adroit politicians of mischievous propensities have caused the
                        enactment of obnoxious laws which are unknown to three-fourths of the people
                        in whose name they were enacted. How many, for instance, of the people of
                        Pennsylvania, are aware that there is on the statute book of the State a law
                        obstructing the recapture of runaway negroes? How many old Whigs are
                        prepared to hear that this law was drafted by a Whig Senator? How many
                        Democrats will learn without surprise that it was approved by a Democratic
                        Governor? Yet all this is the fact.</p>
                    <p>Now in spite of this law, we venture to affirm that the people of
                        Pennsylvania are not opposed to the recapture of
                        runaway negroes and are not in favor of obstructing the execution of the
                        fugitive slave law. They have in their midst more free negroes than they
                        want; and they know very well that if they prevent the recapture of runaway
                        negroes on their soil, the effect will be to increase largely the number of
                        negroes in the State.</p>
                    <p>What then ought they to do? The answer is plain. They ought to demand of
                        their Legislature the repeal of the obnoxious, irritating and unjust law
                        alluded to. If they permit that law to stand unrepealed, now that their
                        attention has been called to it, then it may justly be inferred that they
                        sympathise with those Northern Disunionists who would rather break up the
                        Union than carry out the provisions of the Federal Constitution.</p>
                    <p>Let this subject be agitated. Let the press, or at least the Democratic
                        portion of it, speak out for repeal.--Let the people petition the
                        Legislature to wipe out our nullifying law. Let Andrew G. Curtin, when he
                        takes the Governor's chair, be called upon to show whether he stands with
                        the slave-stealing Yankees who have settled in the Northern part of our
                        State, or with the great body of the people of Pennsylvania, who respect
                        that clause of the Constitution which provides that slaves who may run away
                        "shall be delivered up." Let the various aspirants to the dignified position
                        of United States Senator be compelled to show their hands. What say you
                        Messrs. McClure, Stevens, Wilmot, Moorhead, and the rest of that host of
                        Republican patriots who are willing to serve Pennsylvania in the Senate of
                        the United States--Are you in favor of retaining in force a law which
                        obstructs the execution of the fugitive slave law and practically denies to
                        the people of the South a right guaranteed to them by the Constitution?</p>
                    <p>There will probably be a separation of one or more States from the Union
                        before the obnoxious laws passed by some of the Northern States can possibly
                        be repealed. But the separation will not be final if Pennsylvania,
                        responding to the patriotic suggestions of Virginia, shall set her sister
                        States of the North the example of repealing an act conceived in
                        unreasonable hostility to the South, and beyond all question violative of
                        the just rights of the people of fifteen sovereign States.</p>
