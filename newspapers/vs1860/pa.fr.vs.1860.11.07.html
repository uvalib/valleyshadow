<b>Which Will be Best</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Asks readers to contemplate the best course for the nation: a united
                    country in which the South provides raw materials and markets for Northern
                    manufactured goods or a disunited country in which the South receives her
                    supplies from overseas and the North's prosperity declines as a result.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Reader, of whatever political faith you are which will be the best? That the
                        country shall remain whole and united as it is, the South being the
                        receptacle and market for the manufactories and workshops of the
                        North--furnishing the raw material and affording labor to toiling millions
                        of the North, and buying the goods again in return, thus causing general
                        prosperity all around,, or that it be disrupted, and the intercourse of the
                        two sections of the country severed, the South opening her own ports and
                        receiving her supplies of manufactured articles from foreign countries, and
                        leaving the work-shops and manufactories of the North desolate and without
                        market. Which will be the best? This is a matter for every voter to
                        consider. As the country now exists, the South is the market for
                        manufactories and workshops of the North. North cotton mills get their
                        cotton from the South, thousands of hands are employed in them, and receive
                        their pay for their work, and then the cotton goods are again sold to the
                        South. Other manufactories sell their articles of manufacture South. The
                        little town of Lynn, in Massachusetts, alone sells several millions of pairs
                        of shoes and usually South. The iron works and rolling mills of the North
                        find their best markets South. The cities of New York and Philadelphia, and
                        other northern cities, depend almost entirely upon their commerce with the
                        Southern States, and their teeming millions thus have prosperity.--Which
                        then will be the best? Will you elect Lincoln, the candidate of the
                        "irrepressible" Republican party, who will not receive a single elector 1
                        vote in any southern States and whose election incurs the risk of disturbing
                        the harmony of the several States as they now exist, or will you say it is
                        best to "let well enough alone," and contribute all in your power to his
                        defeat. It is for you, consulting your own interests and the interests of
                        the country to say, which will be best?</p>

<b>"We Will Make Her Submit"</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Senator Wilson, a friend of Lincoln, stated that the Republicans will make
                    the South submit if it refuses to on its own. The Spirit doesn't believe the
                    South will ever submit to black enfranchisement or equality. The North would
                    then have to invade the South.<br>

<b>[none]</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<b>It is not So?</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the "Massachusetts school" cannot tolerate slavery and thus
                    wants to abolish it, even if that means severing the Union. The Republicans are
                    abolitionists, despite what they say.<br>

<b>Nullifying States</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Republicans complain that Southerners want to nullify the Union. In
                    fact, Northern states are the true nullifiers.<br>

<b>Extract from Jackson's Farewell Address</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reprint of extract of Jackson's speech, in which he urges the citizens of
                    every state to "avoid everything calculated to wound the sensibility or offend
                    the just pride of the people of other States." The Union depends on maintaining
                    the affections of the people; it cannot be preserved "by the mere exertion of
                    the coercive powers confided to the General Government."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Another Abolition Ruse</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the denunciations of Lincoln made by the radical abolitionists
                    are a ruse to make people think that Lincoln is not really an abolitionist.<br>

<b>"It is Your Bull that has Gored My Ox"</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Claims that Northerners believe that it's fine to hang horse thieves
                    without due process, but it is an outrage for Southern men to hang slave
                    thieves, or men who seize slaves in order to free them. The Spirit believes that
                    this is a "strange inconsistency."<br>

</blockquote>
<b>Clergymen</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Criticizes a Methodist clergyman named T. M. Eddy, who wrote to the
                    President to complain about the treatment of Methodists in the South. He also
                    sent his letter to a newspaper, leading the Spirit to believe that he was really
                    after publicity. They have little sympathy for him, since the Methodists get

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges Breckinridge men not to scratch off the names of any of the electors
                    on the Democratic ballot, even though some of them are Douglas supporters. All
                    the electors are Democrats, and so all will vote to defeat Lincoln in the
                    electoral college.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Douglas' Conspiracy with the Black Republicans</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Urges straight-out Douglas supporters to analyze Douglas's position on
                    popular sovereignty. He will find that there is little difference between
                    Douglas and the Republicans. "We would ask Democrats to pause and reflect before
                    they are made the dupes of such a treacherous leader as Stephen A. Douglas."<br>
</blockquote>
<b>An Example for Democrats</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Encourages Democrats to follow the example of the gallant Gen. Lane in the
                    battle of Buena Vista and "Stand the fire and fall like men." If they do, the
                    Democrats will win.<br>
</blockquote>
<b>Spurious Electorial Tickets!</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Because the straight-out ticket has been withdrawn, some former

                    their own. The Spirit published this spurious ticket to warn Democrats not to
                    vote for it.<br>

<b>The Grammar Critic</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit makes fun of the "college-bred youth" who edits the Times
                    because he loves to quote Latin, cite Shakespeare, and correct the Spirit's
