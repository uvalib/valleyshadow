<b>The Cattle Disease</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The "dreaded cattle disease" appeared around Philadelphia and some of the
                    slaughtered victims have been sold in the Chambersburg market. The paper
                    encourages any farmer who has infected cattle to isolate and slaughter them.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A paragraph printed in our local columns, yesterday, which was copied from
                        the Doylestown Democrat, stated that the dreaded
                        cattle disease has appeared in the vicinity of Philadelphia, and that some
                        of the victims of it had been slaughtered and sold in our market. This
                        intelligence is of an alarming character, and it is to be hoped that prompt
                        measures may be taken to inquire into its truth, and to effectually prevent
                        the calamities which would inevitably result from this distemper.</p>
                    <p>A notable example of this course which honorable and magnanimous
                        cattle-owners should pursue, was furnished by a gentleman of New Jersey,
                        who, in 1857, discovered that the pleuro-pneumonia had broken our in a
                        valuable herd of imported cattle he possessed, and although they were valued
                        at $10, 000, he immediately had them all killed, and thus, by a very heavy
                        individual pecuniary loss, he saved the section in which he resided, and the
                        country generally, many thousands of dollars.</p>
                    <p>It is the duty of every man who discovers that his cattle are afflicted with
                        this disorder to completely isolate them from all other herds, and, if he
                        cannot see a reasonable prospect of curing them, having them killed and
                        buried. Where this is done in good faith there is no doubt, we think, that
                        the Legislature of the State would be willing to compensate the owner for
                        their loss, as has already been done by Massachusetts and many of the
                        European Governments. Any man who to, save a few dollars, sells a diseased
                        steer, that it may spread this terrible disorder through new districts, or
                        who has it slaughtered for food to be eaten by persons whose health may be
                        seriously injured by it, deserves severe punishment, and will cover himself
                        with lasting infamy. He who, to shield himself from a comparatively trifling
                        loss, assists to disseminate a destructive calamity, deserves the reproach
                        and scorn of every right minded citizen.</p>
                    <p>But now, when the disease, if it exists in the neighborhood at all, is
                        necessarily confined to but a very few localities, it can be easily arrested
                        if a proper spirit is evinced. Let all the afflicted cattle be properly
                        isolated or killed, and the expense, which in the infancy of the disease
                        would be but trifling, will, we doubt not, be cheerfully born by our State
                        Legislature, when the facts are fully brought to its notice.</p>
                    <p>Owners of affected cattle should not hastily conclude that their only escape
                        from loss is to sell their stock, and thus to rapidly widen the circle of
                        infection. On the contrary, while that course may lead them into serious
                        difficulties, there is another one far more just and honorable, and probably
                        equally remunerative, open to them, in destroying their diseased stock and
                        appealing to the Legislature for relief.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--On Sunday last, at the time of the funeral of Miss Smith, a number of
                        persons male and female desecrated the Cemetery grounds in a most shameful
                        manner. They trampled over the graves, broke down the shrubbery, plucked the
                        flowers and showed their bad-breeding and ill-manners in every possible way.
                        Such human hyenas should be excluded from the grounds altogether, and as
                        many of them are known we hope the Directors will give instructions to the
                        Keeper to not allow them to enter the grounds again, even should they come
                        with a funeral. There is a severe law against depredations of this kind and
                        we cannot see what delicacy the Directors need have in enforcing it. Make an
                        example of a few of them and the rest may be deterred from exercising their
                        evil propensities, in such a place when they know that fine and imprisonment
                        will be the consequence.</p>
