<b>The Transcript on the "Nigger Question"</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Includes an excerpt from the Transcript on what it terms "Nigger
                    Democracy," which aims to crush free white labor with slave labor. The Spirit

                    poor laboring white men.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The whole policy of the Nigger Democracy has been, for years, to crush out
                        Free White Labor and substitute the unpaid toil of negro slaves in the
                        places accustomed to be filled by white sons and daughters of industry who,
                        regardless of the sneers of the oligarchy, voluntarily prefer to work with
                        their own hands for an honest livelyhood to living in idleness supported by
                        the sweat and toil of a despised, abused, persecuted race of helpless,
                        hapless beings--poor, ignorant Africans.</p>
                    <p>We need scarcely tell our readers that the above elegant extract is from the
                        luminous editorial columns of the Transcript. It
                        bears so much evidence on the face of it of the stupendously brilliant mind
                        that presides over that sheet that there is no mistaking the source. Our
                        readers will recognize it at once, and without any trouble, as one of the
                            "feats of agility" that the smart editor of
                        that paper weekly performs, in conformity with its motto, that "it is
                        essential that public opinion be enlightened." Well, he is the boy to
                        "enlighten" it as "clear as mud," and we are sure our readers will feel
                        grateful to us for transferring this small sample of his light to our
                        columns, and thus allow the ambitious editor more room to spread himself, as
                        his own paper is becoming entirely too contracted for his extensive
                        pretensions, and wonderful capacity, to show off with advantage. We,
                        therefore, take him under "our wing" as one of our "tender brood," and considering the material we have to work on, we
                        hope to bring him out full fledged and able to crow like a respectable
                        "bantam" and earn a "livelyhood" by his lively scratching. The orthography belongs
                        exclusively to the Transcript.</p>
                    <p>It will appear by the extract from the Transcript
                        that the maudlin sympathies of its editor is strongly enlisted in behalf of
                        the "poor, hapless, ignorant Africans."--He means the niggers, of course,
                        but is too polite to his esteemed wooly-headed friends to call them by any
                        other name than that of "Africans." The Democracy, however, in his exalted
                        estimation, are "niggers"--he professes to know them by no other name than
                        that of "nigger Democracy!" His phelinx for the "poor
                            Africans" are so much worked up that his outrageously strong
                        christian propensities are excited to such a degree as to induce him to hug
                        the whole wooly-headed race to his bosom and boo-hoo over them as his
                        "tender brood," but the "Nigger Democracy" are not dark-skinned enough to
                        find a place in his affections. Should he be crossed in his love for the
                        nigger, it is to be hoped that he may not commit suicide, or die of a broken
                        heart, as the Democracy could not well get along without the valuable
                        assistance they expect from him in the present campaign.</p>
                    <p> We suppose we must take him as we find him--the embodiment of the Republican
                        party in Franklin county--the head and front of that institution--the organ
                        from which is ground out the music to which that party must dance--well
                        then, as the exponent of the principles of that party, we have from him
                        their platform on the "nigger question," in a nut-shell, in the above
                        extract. It is their intention to set the niggers all free and make the
                            "white sons and daughters of industry" take
                        their place. The negro must be the master and the white man the slave. The
                        "persecuted race of helpless, hapless beings--poor, ignorant Africans" may
                        "live in idleness" but "white sons and daughters" must work, work, work.
                        This is the doctrine laid down by the Transcript,
                        and we have long suspected it to be the aim of the Republican party, but
                        never before found an editor fool-hardy enough to make the declaration.</p>
                    <p>We feel loath to deprive the Transcript of the
                        pleasure it finds in terming us the "Negro Democracy," but after the love it
                        has expressed for the "ignorant African," and its avowed intention to set
                        the negroes free and enslave white men and women too, we must consider the
                        Republican party fairly entitled to be called the "nigger party." The Transcript cannot hereafter, with any show of
                        consistency, call us ugly names. I must give up the beauty and burthen of
                        its editorials, and acknowledge that it prefers the nigger to the white man,
                        or eat its own words.</p>
                    <p>Will the poor laboring white men, of Franklin county, be found in the ranks
                        of a party that is constantly expressing so much love and so much pity for
                        the nigger and not one word of sympathy or condolence for them? The "abused,
                        persecuted race of helpless, hapless beings--poor, ignorant Africans," is
                        the burthen of their song. All their efforts are now directed to stock the
                        sugar plantations of Louisiana, and the cotton fields of Georgia, with white
                        slaves in place of black ones, so that the nigger may be the nabob and live
                        in idleness. O! How they do love the nigger, and if they could only get him
                        to vote here, as they have in Massachusetts, their happiness would be
                        complete.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>While Philadelphia and Baltimore Merchants and Capitalists remain inactive,
                        as they too frequently do, New York has a competent and intelligent citizen
                        now going over the route of the Allegheny and Connelsville projected
                        railroad, gathering such information as will enable him to place as true and
                        correct a statement of the route as he can do by a visit and information
                        obtained from old surveyors before the Capitalists of New York. Mr. J. E.
                        Wharton, the gentleman alluded to above, arrived here on Thursday noon last,
                        had letters of introduction to many of our citizens, with whom there was
                        much communicated on the subject of the contemplated railroad; he appears to
                        have no fear of the controlling influence of the Pennsylvania Central
                        Railroad over the Cumberland Valley, he views the matter thus: they cannot
                        discriminate, or charge more than their charter allows, and the short
                        distance of the Cumberland V. R. R., being only fifty miles, is but a drop
                        in the bucket when the length of the Road from New York west and southwest
                        is taken into consideration. That New York must have an outlet to the great
                        west and southwest shorter than she now has to keep her commerce and
                        business in advance of Philadelphia and Baltimore where
                            she now has it. And who can blame them for acting on the
                        principal of the man whose only prayer was "bless me and my wife, my son
                        John and his, we four and no more," while we acknowledge a degree of
                        mortification, that Philadelphia the metropolis of our State thus far has
                        shown no disposition to avail herself by immediate action to secure the
                        advantages of this route to build up their city, compete with, and get in
                        advance of New York. We at Chambersburg, as well as Fulton, Bedford and
                        Somerset counties who have had to pay our full quota of State taxes for the
                        Canal and Central R. R., by which Philadelphians are enriched, and however
                        mortified we may be at their apathy, we hail with pleasure the action of New
                        York in the case, and feel disposed to vary the prayer alluded to and say
                        "Bless Chambersburg and the city who builds the road, we two and that will
                        do.</p>
                    <p>On Friday morning last, Emanuel Kuhn, Esq., an old surveyor of this county,
                        took Mr. Wharton in a carriage as far as Loudon.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hezikah Easton, who is perfectly acquainted with the locality of the
                        route from there to Cowans Gap, and form the Gap to the Burnt Cabins,
                        conveyed Mr. Wharton to Burnt Cabins, and when there, it was calculated from
                        the known anxiety of Mr. James Kelly to get out of the mountains by
                        Railroad, he would see to his comforts for the balance of the road to
                        Bedford, where Mr. Wharton will be put under the care, we suppose of the
                        Little Giant John Cesna and others, who can aid him.</p>
                    <p>In our next issue we expect to give some railroad statistics of Somerset
                        County, as she had either five or six delegates at the Harrisburg R. R.

                    <p>--If any of our readers desire to witness a specimen of the energy with which
                        individuals can go to work and repair their damages, when not trammeled by
                        Insurance companies, let them visit the scene of the late fire. Mr. Ditman
                        was not insured and he has his property now repaired and doing business as
                        usual. Mr. Ott was also not insured and he has his house now under roof and
                        will have it ready to remove into a short space of time. Mr. Deckelmayer,
                        the only party insured, owing to the dilly-dallying of the Insurance
                        companies, has been unable to make any repairs and is suffering a heavy
                        pecuniary loss every day. If Insurance companies wish to stand well with the
                        public they should act promptly and repair all damages that they have
                        stipulated to make good, or place the amount of insurance in the hands of
                        the owner of the property destroyed, that he may go to work at once and
                        repair the loss he has sustained.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--We take pleasure in informing the ladies and gentlemen of this place that
                        Mr. Solenberger has fitted out a safe and elegant boat in which parties can
                        enjoy a delightful boat excursion on the Conococheague. His terms are very
                        reasonable and the ride is certainly a safe and pleasant one, infinitely
                        more agreeable and conducive to health, than a drive through the dust and
                        heat of our streets. Mr. Solenberger may be found, every evening, at the
                        "wharf" at the Baptist church. We hope Mr. Solenberger's enterprise may be
                        liberally patronized. We would say to parents bring out your little ones and
                        treat them to a ride on our romantic and beautiful stream, and let them
                        enjoy the fun "as they sail, as they sail" and it will plant a bloom on
                        their hearts as well as their cheeks.</p>

                    <p>"Our friends here are active in pressing forward the Rail-Road project.
                        Agents, (now on the route exploring--see another article in this week's
                            Spirit,) have been appointed in New York to
                        press the claims of this road on Capitalists, and there is a constant
                        correspondence between that City and those interested in this road. Funds
                        have been raised to have a survey made, the New Yorkers to furnish the
                        engenuity. By their means we will be able to furnish statistics to convince
                        the skeptical as to the feasibility of the enterprise. When this is once
                        accomplished, the money will be forthcoming, so say the knowing ones."</p>
