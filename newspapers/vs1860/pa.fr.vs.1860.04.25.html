                    which compliments all the establishments it mentions.<br>(Names in announcement: Ex-Sheriff  Brown,   Bradley,   Keyler,   Foltz,   Miller,   Weist,   Grove,   Reilly,  D. Trostle,   Hutchinson,   McKenzie,  James Reamer)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--As quite a number of our Public Houses have recently changed proprietors it
                        may be of some advantage to persons visiting this place to know how they are
                        at present conducted.</p>
                    <p>Ex-Sheriff Brown, who recently took the stand on East Market Street, kept by
                        Keyler &amp; Bradley, is doing an excellent business, and all who put up
                        at his house speak of it as being kept in the very best manner.</p>
                    <p>The "White Swan Hotel," lately conducted by Foltz &amp; Miller, is now in
                        the hands of Messrs. Weist &amp; Grove. This house had formerly a very
                        large run of custom which has been considerably increased under the present
                        proprietors.--It is now kept in the best style and affords a comfortable and
                        convenient stopping place for all persons visiting town. The accommodations
                        at this house are of the first class and charges moderate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Reilly, we understand, is doing a fair share of business at the stand
                        formerly kept by Mr. D. Trostle, on West Market Street. We are informed by
                        persons who have put up at his house that it is kept in a very cleanly and
                        orderly manner--that his table is provided with the best the market can
                        afford--that the house throughout is well furnished, and that the
                        proprietor, and every one employed about the establishment, is attentive and
                        obliging. We have no doubt that Mr. Reilly will regain the custom this house
                        formerly had as he is determined to spare no exertion in conducting it in a
                        manner that will gratify and give entire satisfaction to its patrons. Give
                        him a call and you will find his house comfortable and pleasant and his
                        charges reasonable. We refer our readers to his advertisement in to-day's
                        paper.</p>
                    <p>The "Franklin House," the principal Hotel in the place and which has recently
                        been so admirably conducted by Messrs. Hutchinson &amp; McKenzie, will,
                        we learn, shortly change proprietors. Mr. Jas. Reamer well known over the
                        country as one of the best Hotel keepers in the United States will take
                        charge of this popular house. Under the management of Mr. Reamer this house
                        will be placed on an equality with any first class city Hotel, and will
                        doubtless attract, by the very superior manner in which it will be kept, a
                        large share of the patronage of the traveling public, as well as become a
                        favorite place of resort for a majority of all others who visit our town on
                        business or pleasure.</p>
                    <p>Our Hotel accommodations are, we believe, equal, if not superior, to those of
                        any other town in the State, while our terms are considerably less. A
                        knowledge of this fact should, we think, induce many to become sojourners
                        with us and our town a place of summer resort for the parched up denizens of
                        our cities.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editors removed the blame of the bad condition of Market street from

                    fill in the holes.<br>
</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--The Town Council have been "standing the raps" for some time about the bad
                        condition of the crossing, on Market Street, near the Post Office. We are
                        now informed that the Gas Company, in digging to find a leak in one of their
                        pipes, caused these cavities that, in bad weather, have made this crossing
                        so unpleasant. The Gas Company have, heretofore, been very prompt in making
                        repairs, whenever they have disturbed the condition of the streets or
                        pavements, and we hope, in this instance, so great a nuisance, caused by
                        them, will not be overlooked any longer.</p>

                        have noticed some tall specimens of fast horsemanship on our streets since
                        its promulgation. An example will be required to be made of somebody before
                        the law is respected.</p>
