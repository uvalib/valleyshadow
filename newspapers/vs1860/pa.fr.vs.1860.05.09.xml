                <excerpt>"We are confident that the hopes of the Republicans will not be realized,
                    and that they will not have the pleasure of seeing the Democratic party
                    sectionalized. But what must be thought of a party which rejoices at the
                    prospect of seeing the whole country broken up into sectional parties? Can such
                    a party have at heart the maintenance of the Union?"</excerpt>
                <transcript>
                    <p>The Republican newspapers are rejoicing over the Democratic split of
                        Charleston, and uttering congratulations upon the prospect it opens for the
                        election of a Republican President. It affords them intense pleasure to see
                        the only national party in the country distracted and torn by the slavery
                        question. They point to it as an evidence that an irrepressible conflict
                        exists between two sections of this Union, and reiterate the taunt of the
                        Southern extremists, that the Democratic party, as represented by the
                        regular Convention, is now a sectional organization. It is perfectly fair in
                        a party point of view that our enemies should take every advantage of
                        difficulties in the Democratic ranks, but the transactions at Charleston
                        will excite other emotions in the hearts of those who love this Union and
                        tremble at the thought of its disruption. The division of the Democratic
                        party by a geographical line upon the question of slavery , is the most
                        ominous disaster that can happen to the country. When this bond is broken
                        what remains to hold us together? What other national organization can take
                        the place of the Democratic party, in case it is broken and scattered? This
                        is a serious question, not only for Democrats, but for all men.</p>
                    <p>Within the last ten years sectional violence has snapped asunder many of the
                        bonds that held the country together. The Whig party, which was national,
                        gave way first, and the sectional Republican party took its place. Several
                        of our leading religious denominations have been broken in two across the
                        line dividing free from Slave States, and those that still retain a national
                        character are often disturbed and agitated by the conflict. The breaking of
                        these bonds all tend to alienation and the loss of that close fellowship
                        necessary to safety. In the midst of the contest, while other powers gave
                        way, the Democratic party alone, of all political organizations, withstood
                        the shock. It alone furnished a rallying point for all national men. It
                        alone withstood the destructive powers of Northern and Southern
                        sectionalism. If the cause of nationality proves too heavy for it to carry,
                        and the contending forces succeed in mastering it, we have indeed reached a
                        point in our national history when reflecting and patriotic men may well
                        inquire how long the country can survive this internal war--how can it be
                        rescued from the madness of sectional factions? It will be a dark day for
                        the country when there is no longer a national party to look to.</p>
                    <p>But, notwithstanding the difficulties at Charleston, we believe that the
                        Democratic party will retain its national character, and that its
                        organization will be maintained in every State in the Union. The platform
                        adopted by the Convention has not a tinge of sectionalism in it, and the
                        withdrawal of some of the extreme delegations only affords evidence that the
                        platform is not sectional. The action of the Southern sectionalists is in
                        fact a protest against the nationality of the Democratic party. It is well
                        understood that these delegates do not present the unanimous opinion of
                        their constituents, and while States like Virginia, North Carolina,
                        Kentucky, Tennessee, Maryland and Missouri remain firm, we have a better
                        index of Southern opinion than that derived from the action of the
                        extremists from Alabama and Mississippi. The irrational and sectional
                        proceedings of the ultra men who desire to break up the Democratic party
                        because they failed to engraft their peculiar notions upon the party creed,
                        will be condemned and repudiated by the majority of their constituents,
                        whose safety depends upon preserving the nationality of the Democratic
                        organization.</p>
                    <p>We are confident that the hopes of the Republicans will not be realized, and
                        that they will not have the pleasure of seeing the Democratic party
                        sectionalized. But what must be thought of a party which rejoices at the
                        prospect of seeing the whole country broken up into sectional parties? Can
                        such a party have at heart the maintenance of the Union?</p>

                    <p>--The School Directors of the county assembled in Convention, in this place
                        on Monday last, and organized by the appointment of Geo. W. Zigler, Esq., of
                        Greencastle, to preside over their deliberations. The convention was largely
                        attended and its proceeding conducted in a harmonious and business like
                        manner. The Directors present from the several districts and boroughs, in
                        the county, were all gentlemen of the highest respectability, and displayed
                        a degree of intelligence, in the transaction of business, that we do not
                        often see in similar public bodies, and which augurs well for the cause of
                        Education in Franklin County. The principal business of the Convention was
                        the selection of a County Superintendent. The choice fell on the former
                        Superintendent, Mr. P. M. Shoemaker, of Upper Strasburg, who was reelected
                        by a very complimentary vote, and the salary of his office raised from five
                        to six hundred dollars. Mr. Shoemaker has done good service in behalf of our
                        Public School System, and aided no little in bringing it into almost
                        unanimous favor with the people, and we are happy to perceive that his
                        labors have been appreciated by the Directors of the county. His
                        re-appointment is a merited compliment and a just reward, to a good and
                        faithful public officer.</p>
