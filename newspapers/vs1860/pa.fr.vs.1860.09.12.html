<b>The Northern Disunionists</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Argues that the Republicans should not blame southerners for disunion since
                    so many Republicans have long sought to break up the Union. The abolitionists
                    realize that it is impossible to abolish slavery under the current system of
                    government. Instead, they hope to drive the South to secession and then blame
                    southerners for destroying the Union.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We hear a great deal from the Black Republicans in denunciation of the
                        disunionists of the South. We think that reproof, like charity, ought to
                        begin at home. And if our Black Republicans were to look at home for
                        disunionists to reprove and condemn, their efforts would be rewarded by the
                        discovery of a larger number of more malignant, more mischievous and more
                        determined enemies of the union, as our fathers made it, than Yancey ever
                        beheld in his most exaggerated dreams.</p>
                    <p>For many years a large number of persons at the North have made abuse of the
                        South almost their sole occupation. Not content with the freedom they
                        enjoyed, they have made constant war upon the institution of slavery. Their
                        numbers have, at various times been swelled by accessions to their ranks
                        from the disaffected elements of the great parties into which the country
                        was generally divided. But it was not until the formidable old Whig Party
                        lost its great and patriotic leaders CLAY and WEBSTER, and fell to pieces,
                        that the Northern Disunion Party assumed proportions that filled the lover
                        of his country with alarm.</p>
                    <p>For the last five years the air of the North has been surcharged with
                        envenomed assaults upon the South. Every insulting epithet that malignant
                        ingenuity could invent, has been applied to the Southern people. We need not
                        repeat these epithets. They are seen in every Republican newspaper and they
                        are heard whenever a Republican orator opens his mouth. They can be uttered
                        but for one object, and that object must be to exasperate the South to the
                        point of withdrawing from the Union.</p>
                    <p>Does it need an argument to prove that this must be the object of these
                        constant declaimers against slavery? What else can be their object? They
                        know very well that they can never set one single bondman free by all their
                        furious declamation against slavery. They know that fierce denunciation will
                        never induce the people of the Southern States to abolish slavery. They know
                        that Congress cannot abolish it. They know that the Constitution of the
                        United States, guarantees the Southern people the peaceable possession of
                        their slaves, and they know that the South will never surrender her
                        constitutional rights.</p>
                    <p>These Northern nigger-eaters are determined to break up the Union. But they
                        wish to conceal their agency in the work of dissolution. Hence, instead of
                        openly avowing their purpose, they go at it "behind the bush." They do not
                        preach disunion openly, but they employ every means at their command to
                        drive out the South and throw upon that section the odium of dissolving the
                        Union. They want the damning work done, but they also want to escape the
                        responsibility of doing it.</p>
                    <p> Their cunning will not serve them. Their purpose is apparent, and if they
                        accomplish it they will have to answer to their names, when the roll of
                        traitors is called. They cannot escape by the "stop thief" yell of "YANCEY!
                        YANCEY!" for the impartial historian will record the fact that though Yancey
                        may have lighted the funeral pile of the Union, it was
                            them that built it and placed the blazing torch in his hand.</p>

<b>Why He Emigrated</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Claims that Lincoln emigrated from Kentucky to Illinois because he was so
                    ugly that he frightened away the slaves. As a result, the slaveholders of
                    Kentucky requested that he leave. The abolitionists nominated him for president
                    because they hope that he can scare away all the slaves in the country.<br>

                    recently switched its support from Lincoln to Douglas. The Times took this
                    action, according to the Spirit, because it is actually a Republican paper that
                    is attempting to sow discord in the Democratic party by supporting a straight
                    Douglas ticket.<br>

<b>The Right Talk</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Post calls for all good Democrats to reject Forney's movement and
                    support the Cresson compromise, which they believe will ultimately help Douglas.
                    If the party splits, Lincoln will undoubtedly win the state.<br>
