<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Editorial Comment: </font>The editor of the Democrat, John Wentworth, was "one of the chief actors
                    in securing Lincoln's nomination at Chicago." According to him, "the sentiments
                    of Sumner's late speech in the Senate, are the sentiments of Mr. Lincoln and the
                    Republican party." In a still later article the same paper says that the
                    Republican party is in favor of "the political equality of all men [ital.] Negro
                    citizenship and negro equality is then boldly proclaimed as "the chief
                    cornerstone of Republican organization![ital.]" We invite attention to the
                    following, and commend it to the especial attention of those who prate so much

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spirit accuses Col. A. G. Curtin, the Republican candidate for
                    governor, of radically changing his position on immigrants. In 1856, Curtin was
                    an "active and zealous propagandist" against the foreign born. As a Republican,
                    he suddenly "finds in our foreign born citizens everything worthy of admiration

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>--If conformity with the resolution of the County Meeting the Democrats of
                        the several townships in this county, will meet at the proper place, in
                        their respective districts, for the purpose of electing delegates on</p>
                    <p>SATURDAY, AUGUST 25, 1860.</p>
                    <p>These Delegates so elected will assemble at the Court House, in this place at
                        10 o'clock, A.M., on <br>TUESDAY, AUGUST 28, 1860, <br>to nominate a
                        County Ticket to be supported by the Democracy of Franklin County at the
                        general election on the second Tuesday (the 8th) of October next.</p>
                    <p>We trust that our Democratic friends throughout the county will turn out and
                        take an interest in the Delegate elections. These are trying times in the
                        party and it requires our best and most cautious men to guide the helm
                        aright, and the most careful and judicious management to prevent matters
                        from getting worse. If the moderate men of the party will attend the
                        Delegate elections and see that proper men are sent as Delegates to the
                        Nominating Convention it will be the first and most important step toward
                        harmony and success in this county. But if our primary elections be
                        neglected, or left to the management of a few men who take but little
                        interest in the success of the party generally, and who seem to care little
                        whether strife or harmony prevails in its ranks, it will have a bad
                        influence and a falling off of party strength must be the consequence. At
                        this time, more than any other, it behooves every Democrat to exert himself
                        to promote unity and harmony in the party if he desires its success. On the
                        subject of the Governor there is but one sentiment among the Democracy of
                        this county--all are enthusiastic for the gallant Foster, and it is our
                        honest conviction that we can nominate a County Ticket that will be
                        triumphantly elected. Would we then sacrifice all because there exists a
                        difference of opinion on the subject of the Presidency? We must agree to
                        tolerate this difference but it should not be mixed up with our State or
                        County affairs. We want union and harmony in our ranks and we cannot have
                        that and keep up the quarrel, at the same time, about our Presidential
                        nominee.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the formation of a County Ticket we do not doubt but the utmost
                        harmony and good-feeling will prevail. There is no scramble for office in
                        our party. The Convention can select the most tried and trusty men from the
                        ranks of the whole party and not be confined in its choice to a column of
                        applications for office in a newspaper. The Democratic party in this county
                        are not hopelessly in a minority. Whenever we have presented the right kind
                        of men to unite and bring out a full party vote, we have succeeded in
                        electing them, and there is no reason why we cannot do so again. The good
                        sense of the Convention, we trust, will keep down all irrelevant issues and
                        introduce no resolutions, or expressions of preferences, that should have a
                        tendency, in any way, to distract or disturb the harmony of the party. In
                        this county there is no necessity for measures of that sort. We must unite
                        in one solid body on our State and County ticket and let President making
                        alone for the present if we do not want to be beaten for everything.</p>
