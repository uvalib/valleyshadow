                        here, on Wednesday last, and put the day through by a grand pic-nic,
                        military parade, and the other fixens of a jollification in such cases made
                        and provided. The Transcript establishment
                        contributed its quota in observance of this grand "'bobolition selbration"
                        by hoisting a flag, or rather a rag, tied on a rail, from one of its
                        port-holes, on which is the picture of a Crow with the name of Abe Lincoln
                        underneath. It was a very fit occasion for the Transcript to show its colors and proclaim its abolition
                        principles.</p>
