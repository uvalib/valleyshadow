                    <p>It is a custom among the colored folks to celebrate the first of August in
                        commemoration of the emancipation of the Slaves in the British West India
                        Islands. The colored population of this and neighboring towns assembled
                        here, on Wednesday last, and put the day through by a grand pic-nic,
                        military parade, and the other fixens of a jollification in such cases made
                        and provided. The <emph rend="italic">Transcript</emph> establishment
                        contributed its quota in observance of this grand "'bobolition selbration"
                        by hoisting a flag, or rather a rag, tied on a rail, from one of its
                        port-holes, on which is the picture of a Crow with the name of Abe Lincoln
                        underneath. It was a very fit occasion for the <emph rend="italic"
                            >Transcript</emph> to show its colors and proclaim its abolition
                        principles.</p>
