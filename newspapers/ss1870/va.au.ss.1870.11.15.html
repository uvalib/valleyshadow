                    <p>For the Spectator.</p>
                    <p>EMORY, Va. Nov. 5th, 1870.</p>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR: -- We, the Students and Faculty of this College, have organized a
                        Memorial Association for the purpose of taking care of the graves of the
                        Confederate Soldiers here interred. At our usual meeting, held a few days
                        since, for the elections of officers for the subsequent term, on motion of
                        Prof. Jas. A. Davis, it was</p>
                    <p>Resolved, 1st., That we inquire into the
                        expediency of erecting a monument to their memory.</p>
                    <p>Resolved, 2nd., That each member be empowered to
                        solicit contributions in this vicinity, and elsewhere, and forward the same
                        to the Treasurer of said Association.</p>
                    <p>We have expended a considerable amount of labor and money in putting the
                        graves in a condition becoming a christian community, and our treasury is
                        exhausted. Will not the friends and patriots of the sunny South contribute
                        something to consummate an end so noble in the sight of God? Ah! the
                        citizens of this glorious old Commonwealth foster in their hearts too vivid
                        a recollection of the past; they hold in too great a reverence the names of
                        those who fell on the bloody plains of Manassas, Gettysburg and
                        Chancellorsville, battling for their trespassed rights and country's honor,
                        to even hesitate in granting this little request as a testimony of their
                        gratitude.</p>
                    <p>When the whole State was overrun by an overwhelming force of the enemy, and
                        with fire and sword they ruthlessly spread devastation on all sides; when it
                        seemed as if the lurid lightnings of the great Jehovah had burst asunder
                        from their sombre hiding places, prognosticating immediate destruction to
                        every creature -- like the little Spartan band at Thermopylae -- the proud
                        sons of Virginia were seen staunch, choosing rather to perish than forsake
                        the posts which the voice of their common country had assigned them.</p>
                    <p>Never did brighter jewels adorn the pages of history, and although the casket
                        in which they were contained is now broken, yet in no wise does it detract
                        from their lustre and magnificence, but only adds more glory and celebrity
                        to their former fame to know that they were crushed in the cause of liberty
                        and humanity.</p>
                    <p>Do we not owe such worthiness some tribute of respect? I know the unanimous
                        response of the multitude. Forbid it God! that Virginia shall be remiss in
                        her duty -- that she now in her greatest prosperity should pluck one gem
                        from the coronet of her future greatness. Our fathers, now sleeping placidly
                        beneath the cold and weltering sod, still moist from the breath of two
                        contending armies, would cry out with indignation to think they were so soon
                        forgotten. I will refrain, for fear that while I depict, I may do injustice
                        to their illustrious deeds; but permit me to ask you to remember that the
                        civilization of a nation is judged by the care it takes of its dead. I hope
                        the age of commemoration is at hand. Now let us demonstrate our gratitude --
                        not by vaunting words, but by stretching forth the strong arm of prosperity
                        and plenty, and erect a suitable monument to celebrate their heroic actions.</p>
                    <p>Any contributions will be kindly and thankfully received, and properly
                        expended.</p>
                    <p>Yours, very truly,</p>
                    <p>S. S. H.</p>
                    <p>N. B. -- Papers duly appreciating our design, will please copy.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>About half past seven o'clock, on last Saturday night, our city was thrown
                        into a state of intense excitement by the discovery that Mr. Joseph Black,
                        of Keezletown, Rockingham county, had been stabbed to death, at the house of
                        Mr. John W. Bush, of this place. Mayor N. K. Trout had a jury of inquest
                        summoned immediately, consisting of Messrs. John B. Scherer, S. H.
                        Lushbaugh, F. M. Young, Joseph F. Tannehill, M. P. Funkhouser, G. G. Bunch,
                        Geo. A. Smith, Y. M. Bickle, H. Ker, Wm. L. Balthis, Jno. B. Hoge, and M.
                        Doom, who proceeded at once to hold an inquest over the body of Mr. Black,
                        and after an examination, made by Dr. Hanger, and a hearing of the case
                        before the mayor, the jury rendered a verdict "that the said Jos. Black came
                        to his death from wounds inflicted with a knife by one Geo. W. Smiley, and
                        that said Geo. W. Smiley feloniously and unlawfully murdered the said Joseph
                        Black."</p>
                    <p>Smiley and Black were both bricklayers in the employment of Mr. Wm. Jordan;
                        were very intimate friends, and were both boarding at the house of Mr. Bush,
                        where Black was killed. Messrs Black and Smiley are both men of families --
                        the former living in or neer Keezletown, and the latter near Mt. Crawford.</p>
                    <p>At the trial before the jury of inquest, nothing was elicited showing cause
                        for the killing. -- No grudge or difficulty was known to exist between them,
                        but, on the contrary, they had always been bosom friends. They ate supper
                        together on the evening of the killing. After supper Smiley left the house,
                        and in a few minutes returned again, entering at the front door, went to a
                        bureau in the front room, took a carving knife therefrom, proceeded at once
                        to the dining room, where Black was engaged in conversation with Mrs. Bush,
                        and ordered him out of the house, and at the same time commenced an attack
                        upon him with the knife. When Smiley told Black to get out of the house,
                        Black said, "let me out, then," and, at the same time commenced retreating
                        backwards through an intervening room into the front room, where Black
                        picked up a chair and threw it at Smiley. Smiley retreated from the house by
                        the front door, and Black ran out of the back door, fell a few steps from
                        the house, and died in a few minutes. In the affray he received a severe
                        cut, extending from the corner of the left eye through the temple into the
                        ear, severing the temple artery; another deep stab just above the left hip
                        bone, another a few inches above and to the left of the last, a slight cut
                        just below the navel, and a severe cut on the right hand, probably received
                        while warding off the cuts of Smiley.</p>
                    <p>Smiley made his escape and up to our going to press has not been arrested.
                        There is a reward of $100 offered by the city authorities for his arrest,
                        and there will probably be a reward offered by the State.</p>

                        certificates as provided in section 27, of the general election law, the
                        judges of election having failed to sign their names to such certificates;

                        Pastures Township, were thrown out on the same ground, and for further
                        reason, that it does not appear that the Judges and Clerk, at said precinct
                        had ever been sworn in as said officers. The Poll Book at Peaco's Mill in
                        Beverly Manor, was also thrown out upon the ground of informality in the
                        certificate required by said Sec. 27, and for further reason that the
                        certificate of the number of Electors showed there were twenty-five votes
                        cast when in fact there were thirty-seven votes cast. The Poll Book at
                        Churchville was not taken into count with the general result, because of its
                        having been taken from the Clerk's Office of the Court to which it was
                        returned before the meeting of the Commissioners for reasons above stated,

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Josie B. Richardson, wife of Charles A. Richardson, died on October 13th.
                    She was 18 years old. "A few short months ago she was the blushing bride, but
                    'nipped by the winds untimely blast' she has gone to her reward of rest, beyond
                    the reach of disease and decline. Mrs. R. was left motherless at quite a tender
                    age but was raised by her aunt Miss Henrietta Brooks in the way she should go,
                    consequently she was religious in her feelings and life, but did not make a
                    public profession until in 1868."<br>(Names in announcement:  Josie B. Richardson,  Charles A. Richardson,  Henrietta Brooks)</blockquote>
