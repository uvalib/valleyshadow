<b>The So-called Rail Road Tax</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>This article argued against those who equated a county subscription to the
                    Valley Railroad with a burdensome tax. The latter said the high fares railroads
                    charged when not faced with competition amounted to a much larger financial
                    burden for farmers than using public money to invest in a new competitor.<br>
