<b>Excitement in Richmond--Tempest in a Teapot</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor described a recent incident where two mayors, one popularly
                    elected and the other appointed under the enabling act, fought for control of
                    Richmond. The appointed mayor, Chahoon, upon being told to vacate his office,
                    occupied a police station house and refused to concede his office to mayor-elect
                    Ellyson. In the ensuing chaos, fights broke out with casualties on both sides.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Since Wednesday last, there has been great excitement in Richmond caused by
                        the functus officio appointees of the military
                        holding on to their offices in defiance of the State authorities and in
                        violation of the laws of the State. The Radicals have fallen into the ditch,
                        which they digged for the Conservatives. It will be remembered
                        that, in the Convention which framed the State Constitution, the Radicals
                        had a controlling majority, and believing that they would also have a
                        majority in the Legislature, and be able to elect a Radical Governor, with a
                        view of ousting from office at once the Conservative office-holders of the
                        State, they made no provision, as had been uniformly done before on the
                        change of Constitutions, to legalize the official acts and to retain in
                        office, till their successors could be elected or appointed in accordance
                        with the provisions of the new Constitution or laws passed in pursuance
                        thereof, those who were in office at the time. It results from this omission
                        -- supposed to have been designed with the motive indicated -- that, on the
                        adoption of the new Constitution, all the offices were vacated, and
                        consequently no validity could attach to the official acts of those holding
                        the offices thus vacated. It was to remedy this evil that the Legislature
                        passed the "Enabling Act," legalizing the official acts of the present
                        office-holders till their successors could be elected or appointed, and
                        authorizing the Governor, in the interim, to make
                        appointments. The Constitutional authority to pass the enabling act is given
                        in the 22nd section of the 5th article of the new Constitution, which is as
                        follows: "The manner of conducting and making returns of election, of
                        determining contested elections, and of filling vacancies in office in cases
                        not specially provided for by this Constitution, shall be prescribed by law;
                        and the General Assembly may declare the cases in which any office shall be
                        deemed vacant where no provision is made for the purpose in this
                        Constitution."</p>
                    <p>The right of a Legislature to prescribe by law the manner of filling
                        vacancies in office in cases not specially provided for in the Constitution,
                        is thus given in express terms. The Governor, in appointing a new Council
                        for the city of Richmond, acted in accordance with the law, and the law is
                        in accordance with the Constitution, as is shown by the section above.</p>
                    <p>Against this law the Radicals are rebelling, and destroying the peace of the
                        commonwealth. It is surmised by some that it is a scheme to provoke such
                        violence on the part of the Conservatives as may furnish a pretext to
                        Congress to put the State again under military rule, that the Radicals may
                        continue to hold offices in opposition to the wishes of the people.</p>
                    <p>That the Governor had a legal right to appoint a
                        new Council we have no doubt. The policy of his
                        doing so we do very much doubt. We have been of the opinion that it would be
                        better to allow the present incumbents to retain their offices till they
                        would be charged in the regular mode prescribed by the Constitution -- those
                        to be elected by popular vote to remain in office till the time for
                        election, as prescribed by the Constitution, shall arrive.</p>
                    <p>We have digressed from our purpose, which was, to give briefly the occurrence
                        in Richmond.</p>
                    <p>On Wednesday night, the City Council appointed by Gov. Walker under the
                        Enabling act, elected Henry K. Ellyson Mayor, and chose a new Chief and
                        Captain of Police. Thursday morning about day the new Chief, Maj. John Poe,
                        applied at the lower Station House for possession, but was refused. Later in
                        the day Mayor Ellyson applied by letter to Mayor Chahoon for the Mayor's
                        Office, books, &amp;c., and was refused, Chahoon declaring that he was
                        in the office by law, and would not yield until elected. Chahoon, who had
                        possession of the lower Station House, proceeded to swear in special
                        Constables to the number of one hundred and fifty, including about twenty
                        colored. Ellyson then proceeded to swear in abut two hundred special
                        officers, and surrounded the lower Station House, where Chahoon and his
                        specials were, the plan being to arrest any of them who came out. Mayor
                        Ellyson had possession of the City Hall, and all the other public buildings
                        except the Station House, which was held by the opposite party. The old
                        police force divided about equally between the two Mayors. -- There was a
                        crowd of 1,000 blacks and many whites congregated about the lower Station
                        House, which was the point of interest. Chahoon sent, through his counsel,
                        ex-Governor Wise, a letter to Governor Walker, stating his position and
                        asking assistance to maintain his authority.</p>
                    <p>Governor Walker in reply to Mayor Chahoon's application, said that Mayor
                        Ellyson being legally elected under an act of the Legislature, he could not
                        recognize any one else as Mayor; that Chahoon was incapable of holding the
                        office under the law of Virginia, as he already held a Federal office; that
                        no breach of the peace could occur without Chahoon's act or approval; that
                        he should resort to peaceful judicial remedy, if he wished to test the
                        question of right; and finally, that he should obey the laws and sustain the
                        constitutional authorities.</p>
                    <p>Ex-Gov. Wise, R. W. Hughes and L. T. Chandler were the counsel for Mayor
                        Chahoon, who, with about thirty men, were in the lower Station House; the
                        besieging force having cut off gas and water, and forbid any provisions to
                        be sent them. A crowd of colored men bought out a bake shop and commenced
                        throwing bread up to the besieged, but they were driven off by the special
                        police.</p>
                    <p>At dark mayor Ellyson and Chief of Police Poe, and others were arrested by
                        the U.S. Marshall for having refused a revenue officer permission to see
                        Chahoon in his character as United States Commissioner. They were bailed
                        until Friday. A company of troops was brought into the city by order of
                        General Canby.</p>
                    <p>On Friday morning, Mayor Ellyson and Chahoon had an interview with Gen.
                        Canby. The Chahoon party still held the lower Station house, with the
                        exception of three or four who yielded to hunger and came out -- having had
                        nothing to eat since Wednesday night. In the afternoon, General Canby
                        interfered with the municipal troubles by sending a guard of soldiers and
                        raising the siege at the Tower Station House, and giving free egress and
                        ingress to all having business there. This action he says had no reference
                        to the question of the Mayoralty, but was taken purely as a precaution
                        against any acts of disorder or violence. This act was applauded by the
                        friends of Chahoon, and was protested against by Ellyson as unwarrantable
                        interference, with the civil law of the State. When the military took
                        possession of the station house Mayor Ellyson's police left, and being
                            attended by the crowd of colored men charged
                            the station; about fifty shots were fired and two or
                        three colored men wounded.</p>
                    <p>Daniel Henderson, colored, was shot and killed by a special policeman, for
                        resisting the officers while clearing the streets around the Lower Station
                        House.</p>
                    <p>At night, the newly appointed City Council met and passed an ordinance
                        abolishing the station houses in the hands of Chahoon's police, authorizing
                        Mayor Ellyson to call out the Fire Brigade as police, pledging the city to
                        pay all the special police sworn in by Ellyson, and authorizing the City
                        Court to be held in the City Hall, and pledging Mayor Ellyson the support of
                        the Council in his efforts to maintain the peace of the city against the
                        lawless men conspiring against it.</p>
                    <p>The casualties of the day were one man killed and three wounded.</p>
                    <p>Both Mayors are acting and holding courts -- and Richmond is thus suffering
                        from a dual government, which, in this case, is worse than no government at
                        all.</p>
                    <p>Chahoon has his headquarters in the Lower Station House, where the military
                        guard in Ellyson's headquarters are at the City Hall. Ellyson's police
                        patrol the city.</p>
                    <p>P.S. -- We expected to give in this issue the occurrences of Saturday
                        attending the contest of the contending parties in Richmond, but in
                        consequence of an accident on the Railroad the cars did not arrive till we
                        had gone to press, and we were thus prevented from receiving the news of
                        Saturday in time. The mail which was delayed by this accident contained
                        another letter from our Richmond correspondent which we regret did not
                        arrive in time to be used.</p>

<b>The Republican Conference</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Reported on the Republican conference for the re-organization of their
                    party. Claimed that the Conservative party was the only party fit to take
                    control of the State and ensure unanimous consent among Virginians.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>In last week's issue, we noticed the fact that a meeting of Republicans was
                        held in Richmond to re-organize their party in this State. -- In speaking of
                        that meeting, the Dispatch says:</p>
                    <p>"The recent demonstration in this city, produced by a galvanic battery
                        brought from Washington, was out of time and out of order. Its main efficacy
                        was to galvanize Porter into the semblance of life without benefitting the
                        health or improving the strength of anybody else concerned."</p>
                    <p>It was a movement, says that journal, "to abolish the triumphant party and
                        divide the State between two other parties -- neither of which the people at
                        this time have any idea of joining.</p>
                    <p>The effort will fail. The State is not ready to embroil itself in national
                        parties. It has to take care of its physical interests now, and to use all
                        its influence to suppress political disturbance and prevent the division of
                        the State upon a line of color and race. It is essential to our prosperity
                        that there should be no such division. It would alienate labor from capital,
                        and cause fresh disturbance in domestic industry to the serious injury of
                        the State.</p>
                    <p>The Conservative party is calm and collected, and will yet hold the reins for
                        some time. -- That party alone can preserve order and repress sectional
                        discord. It alone can expedite the recovery of the prosperity of the State.
                        -- The Government that it will organize will command respect and confidence
                        at home and abroad, and secure their good effects to the people of Virginia.
                        No party that can at this time take its place can do this. Therefore it is a
                        matter of vital importance that the Conservative party should stand firm and
                        hold the State under its control. The people know it, and are determined,
                        with extraordinary unanimity, that this shall be done.</p>
