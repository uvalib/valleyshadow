<b>The Political Action of the South</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The French newspaper Courrier des Etats-Unis speculated on the political
                    prospects of the South. The paper predicted that the South will turn to her own
                    economic interests, but that she will continue to influence national politics
                    simply by virtue of her cohesiveness and size as long as the region acted as a
                    political unit.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The French Courrier des Etats-Unis is discussing
                        the probable course of the South and its relations to the parties of the
                        North. It conceives that the South will hold the balance of power and be
                        able to decide the party conflicts of the Union. This supposition takes for
                        granted that all the Southern States will be a unit. This will depend on
                        circumstances -- but the probabilities are in favor of such a result.</p>
                    <p>The Courrier proceeds to consider what will be the
                        policy of the South. It thinks there would be no difficulty in answering, if
                        the questions of to-day and those soon to arise were the same which fomented
                        the antagonisms and inflamed the hate of the past. But most of the questions
                        which led to discord heretofore are finally settled, and sentiment cannot long hold out against interest. That which the
                        South has now to consider is, not how it may avenge the wrongs of the past
                        and revive abolished institutions; but to devote itself to its economic
                        interests, to its finances and credit -- to its ways of communication -- its
                        railroads and canals; in a word, everything that will substitute wealth and
                        prosperity for the smoking ruins of the war. Now, the party that will give
                        to the South the strongest guarantees for the development of its riches --
                        for the revival of its agriculture and commerce, will be that which can most
                        surely count on its political support. In this, the South will have neither
                        to repudiate its friends nor compound with its enemies. -- Parties are
                        nothing more than a shadow of their former selves. The principles which
                        constitute them, the opinions or interests which separate them, are no
                        longer what they were. -- Their names alone survive -- their signification
                        is entirely changed; all is new, and a new start is to be made. The South
                        has only to consult its most important interests, to choose its friends and
                        its enemies.</p>
                    <p>From this situation it results that the South is henceforth not only mistress
                        of its own destines, but, in a great measure, the arbiter of those of the
                        entire country. That is a capital point which all will have to take into
                        consideration. One serious matter, for example, and which should weigh upon
                        the policy of the present Administration is, that the Presidential election
                        of 1872 will depend in a great degree on the attitude of the South; and if,
                        as seems probable, General Grant should desire a renewal of his trust, he
                        should strive during his three remaining years to counterbalance the
                        unfriendly disposition of the Radical majority of Congress towards the
                        Southern States. -- Here lies without doubt the key to the next election;
                        for it is beyond doubt that the South, with common interests with the West
                        and common sympathies with the Democrats of the North, would be able to
                        dictate conditions to the Republican party. This makes a situation entirely
                        new.</p>
                    <p>There are the views, says the Richmond Whig, of an
                        enlightened foreigner who has never been slow to avow his sympathies for the
                        wrongs and sufferings of the South. They strike us as founded in good sense,
                        and justified by a wise appreciation of the situation.</p>

<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Virginia Advance asked Virginians to forget old prejudices and habits
                    in order to rebuild the state. Also urged them to uphold the pledges made by the
                    state during the process of readmission.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Virginia Advance says that "the duty of Virginians is now so plain and
                        patent that it is almost a work of supererogation to point it out. The same
                        calm dignity and political purity which shed such lustre upon her past
                        history should be maintained in the future, and the pledges which she has
                        made, however much they may conflict with former prejudices and opinions,
                        should be kept in spirit and in letter. We must recognize the fact that
                        there has been a radical change both in our political and pecuniary
                        fortunes, and prepare ourselves to grapple with the emergency. Let us cast
                        aside old prejudices and old habits and work together for the political,
                        social and material redemption of our State. It is better to "take up arms
                        against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them," than to sit supinely
                        down and be engulfed by its waves."</p>

<b>The DILEMMA OF RECONSTRUCTION</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Claimed that either the southern states were not in the Union at the time
                    of the ratification of the fifteenth amendment, which would thus void the
                    amendment, or these states were never out of the Union, in which case the
                    reconstruction acts were void.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Southern States were required to ratify the fifteenth amendment as a
                        condition of restoration to the Union. As they could not be trusted to come
                        in and then ratify it, they ratified first and then came in. They were,
                        therefore, not in the Union when they acted on the constitution, or else
                        they were never out of the Union. Either, then, all the reconstruction laws
                        of Congress are invalid, or these Southern ratifications of the fifteenth
                        amendment are invalid. If the States were in the Union there was no need to
                        admit them, and if they were not in the Union they could not participate in
                        making laws for States that are in.</p>
