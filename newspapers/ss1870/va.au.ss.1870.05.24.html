<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper printed a laudatory biography of Col. John B. Baldwin. "Among the

                    <p>No man of ordinary perception and reflection can doubt that our institutions
                        are undergoing a gradual and radical change. No one but an idiot imagines
                        that the Constitution of the United States is aught but a dead letter, an
                        exanimate form, and that the only Supreme law of the land is the will of
                        Congress. No one but a blind man fails to see that the checks and balances
                        adopted by the founders of the Government for the preservation of our
                        political equilibrium are all destroyed, and the executive and Judiciary
                        department absorbed by Congressional oligarchy. The only hope of the country
                        is a union of all conservative men, whether Democrats or Republicans, to
                        wrest the Government from the hands which now hold the reins, and which are
                        bent on turning the car of liberty into a Juggernaut of Despotism, crushing
                        beneath its ponderous wheels the last vestiges of free institutions.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Baltimore Sun claimed that the Republicans planned to appeal to

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Washington correspondent of the Baltimore Sun says: Advices from radical
                        sources in Virginia indicate that the republicans of that State intend to
                        make an appeal to Congress for a supplemental reconstruction, on the ground
                        that the conservatives are inciting outrages against the Freedmen, and are
                        endeavoring to keep the colored republicans away from the registration now
                        going on all over the State. -- It is possible that this is a mere threat,
                        but the dissatisfaction of the Virginia radicals at the conservative course
                        of Gov. Walker is known to be strong enough for them to appeal to Congress
                        to remand Virginia to the condition of Georgia. Congress, however, declined
                        to interfere in the Richmond mayoralty contest, and it is somewhat doubtful
                        if it would heed a demand for interference with the general condition of
                        affairs."</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Gentlemen: -- In presenting to you this morning a
                        ticket in opposition to the Court-house meeting, we offer a few facts for
                        your consideration. We do not seek office by dividing the races. We desire
                        and recommend that the colored voter act independently and intelligently,
                        and vote for the best and most suitable men to fill the offices. Then there
                        will be peace and harmony, and our town continue to improve and prosper; but
                        as long as this strife between the races is kept up there will be no peace,
                        no prosperity -- especially as this is a local election.</p>
                    <p>If the gentlemen who originated the meeting at the Court-house had been moved
                        by a patriotic desire to promote the best interest of the town, and not by a
                        selfish, vindictive spirit to tyrannize over others, why did they not invite
                        the voters to vote for whom they pleased at the primary election, and let it
                        be declared that the highest candidates should be the choice of the people
                        to be voted for on the day of election? This would have been just and fair
                        to all parties. But a few gentlemen undertake to say who shall administer
                        the affairs of 800 legal voters of the town of Staunton and tell you that
                        you must vote for their choice or not vote at all. Can it be that you are
                        willing to submit to such dictation? We are not -- and beg leave to submit
                        to you an independent ticket, and give you an opportunity to say who you
                        will have to serve you -- a right denied you by the Court-house meeting.</p>
                    <p>We call upon the masses of voters to brake loose from this
                        despotism. Have minds of your own and vote as you please, and let
                        consequences take care of themselves. With this brief statement we submit
                        this independent ticket to the voters and to no secret leagues, and we mean
                        to contest every inch of ground, step by step, and leave the consequences
                        where they justly belong -- at the door of the gentlemen who originated the
                        Court-house meeting.</p>
