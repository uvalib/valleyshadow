<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Editor of the Staunton Spectator.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir -- In the Spectator of June 28th, you have admitted an article from
                        a person signing himself "Augusta," which much surprised myself, and others
                        who had supposed you friendly to the Valley R. R. It may have emanated from
                        a personal friend, or an old supporter of your paper, or a person holding a
                        position in society, which gave him an apparent right to be heard, or you
                        may think it fair to give both sides of the question. But let me ask you if
                        someone should write an article for your paper in favor of burning the town
                        of Staunton, or in favor of burning all the barns and mills in the county,
                        urging the citizens of the county to go to work and do it. Would you publish
                        it without comment, as you did this article? And yet such an article would
                        have much less tendency to injure the county than the one you gave room for
                        -- 1st, because it would be less likely to be heeded, and 2nd, if it was
                        heeded, and carried out, the county would be able to recover from the effect
                        of such destruction, and rise again to prosperity in far less time, as we
                        know from our late war experience, than it possibly can from the
                        consequences of defeat to the Valley R. R., yet perhaps it was well enough
                        to let the public see what the reasons, and arguments of the opposition are
                        so that we may know how to combat them, and expose their weakness and
                        absurdity. The great bugbear with "Augusta," seems to be the tax for the
                        enormous sum of $300,000 which has scared him out of his sober senses, and
                        set him to raving about a mortgage on his farm to pay it. Let us take his
                        own estimate, that the road will be worth nothing at all to any body, and
                        that the county will have to pay the whole subscription and interest for 30
                        years amounting to $840,000. -- How much is the amount to each person in
                        Augusta? By the census of 1860, there was 27,749 inhabitants, and at the
                        lowest estimate of natural increase the population must now be 40,000, and
                        in the thirty years to come during which the interest, and at the end of
                        which the principal is to be paid, the natural increase, with or without the
                        aid of the road, will make the number 80,000, which, divided into the
                        $840,000, gives $10.50 to each person in thirty years or 31 1/2 cents a
                        year. But, says "Augusta," the tax is to be laid upon the land, not the
                        population. Then let us see how it stand. I have not before me a statement
                        of the number of acres of land in Augusta county, but, by taking the scale
                        of the map. It cannot be far from 630,000 acres, which will make the tax
                        $133 1/3 cents per acre in 30 years, or less than an average of 4 1/2 cents
                        per acre, per year. Ah! poor "Augusta," he is going to be ruined by having
                        his land mortgaged for 4 1/2 cents per acre, or 31 2/3 cents for each member
                        of his family. There are facts and figures that cannot lie, and how
                        contemptible it makes the complaints of the croakers. Now is "Augusta" any
                        more happy in his facts than his figures. The promises and advantages to
                        which he refers are in a good measure as certain to follow as day follows
                        night. Railroads are no new experiment -- they have brought such advantage
                        wherever built all over the world, and the time has come when no country can
                        prosper without them, not such road, as the C. &amp; O. R. R., has been
                        running into the mountains and stopping, doing only a local trade between
                        sparsely settled districts and Richmond, but great through lines such as the
                        Valley R. R., and the C. &amp; O. R. R. will be when completed.
                        "Augusta" asserts there is no Valley R. R. Company. I can find no milder
                        term to apply to this statement than that it is false, and without
                        foundation, refuted in the very letter he refers to for proof.</p>
                    <p>The Valley Railroad Company is duly organized under an express charter from
                        the Legislature of Virginia, with President, Directors, and all the proper
                        officers of a Company with power to sue and be sued, and transact any
                        business lawful for a company to do. It is equally false that there are no
                        private stockholders. -- The amount of private stock I am not able to give;
                        but this I know: That $100,000 was subscribed by individuals, before the
                        Company was organized -- that I am a stock-holder myself, and that I, with
                        others, subscribed after the $100,000 was complete. Is the city of
                        Baltimore, the B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., the counties of Rockbridge,
                        Botetourt and Roanoke, the towns of Lexington and Staunton all fools to
                        subscribe $2,900,000 to a company that does not exist? What a pity this
                        Solon did not arrive in time and put us all on our guard. He has been very
                        direlect of his duty to hold his peace until all except Augusta has been
                        swindled. Again, "Augusta" tells us that the B. &amp; O. R. R., by
                        holding $1,000,000 of the $4,200,000 required to build the road, will hold a
                        controlling vote, (how?) and will manage the affair so badly that we will
                        lose both principal and interest, and in the next breath, tells us they
                        manage their own road so well that they make one million of dollars a month.
                        He also tells us that we have no security that the terms of subscription
                        will be complied with. The County Court has provided that the bonds of the
                        county are not to be given until the whole subscription sufficient to build
                        the road is complete; that the money shall all be expended in the bounds of
                        Augusta county, and the stock of the road secured to the county. In fact
                        every guarantee that the court could throw around the citizen has been done.
                        The fact is, "Augusta" is blindly beating the air in frantic despair at the
                        idea of having that 4 1/2 cents to pay, and it is impossible to follow all
                        the wanderings of his distempered mind. But one more point I must revert to.
                        He says this matter is being pressed upon the people of Augusta, only by the
                        inordinate ambition of one man. Whom on earth does he mean? Among the many
                        thousands, nay millions of people in the Valley of Virginia, in Baltimore
                        and in Tennessee, who are laboring with untiring energy and zeal, spending
                        their time and money to get this great enterprise under way. Does he mean
                        General R. E. Lee, who was chairman of the delegation to Baltimore from the
                        Valley, to solicit their aid and pledged our own to this great work? When
                        "Augusta" throws a stone into so large a crowd he ought to be careful who he
                        hits. Is it possible that the people of Augusta county are going to be
                        influenced by such absurd statements and arguments as those, to give up all
                        the advantages and profits of having her resources developed, her industry
                        stimulated by the influx of money that the building of the road must bring,
                        besides the lasting benefit of having the road, and the income to be derived
                        for all-time to come from the dividends of the stock all to save that 4 1/2
                        cent fiddle!!</p>
