<b>[No Title]</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Heavily criticized Radical measures involving using military force in
                    elections. Editor said the Radicals failed to secure victory every time they
                    used military force and would soon find themselves in ruins if they persisted in
                    using it.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"For the first time in the history of the country," says the Richmond Whig, "military interference in elections has been
                        legalized, and has become as universal as suffrage itself. It is one of the
                        curious contradictions of the times, that free suffrage should be made
                        subject to military force, and that the ballot and the bullet should be
                        brought into intimate association.</p>
                    <p>Such are the means resorted to by Radicalism to maintain its ascendancy. One
                        thing is to be observed -- that after trying all other means, shifts, and
                        contrivances, they have at length been driven to that last resort, ultima ratio, force. This brings them to the end of
                        their tether, and, if it fails, down they must go to certain ruin. It failed
                        in North Carolina, it failed here, it failed in New York, and it failed in
                        other places. Should it fail in the great Presidential battle of '72, as
                        seems likely, where will Radicalism be? The answer is plain: it will find
                        itself standing exposed to the very enginery of war it prepared
                        for its adversaries, and the only question is, whether that
                        enginery will be used against it, or whether those adversaries
                        will have the magnanimity to forbear its use?"</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Highly praised an address given by Jas. W. Baldwin in favor of temperance.
                    Fervently hoped for the success of the movement because alcohol "is the greatest
                    evil that afflicts our country."<br>(Names in announcement:  James W. Baldwin)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Friday night last, in the M. E. Church South, of this place, Mr. Jas. W.
                        Baldwin, on behalf of Staunton Council, No. 47, "Friends of Temperance,"
                        delivered a well-conceived, methodical, and interesting address, abounding
                        with good doctrine and wholesome counsel. In the language of Saint Paul, he
                        spoke "the words of truth and soberness." The address was of a character, in
                        temper, matter, and manner calculated to do much good, and we hope that such
                        will prove to be the case. Next to church membership, with young men
                        especially, membership in one of the temperance organizations is the most
                        important -- it furnishes them with a safe refuge from the dangers of "the
                        all-pervading destroyer," which annually slays its thousands and tens of
                        thousands, and inflicts woes unutterable upon countless families, which
                        otherwise would be blessed with happiness and prosperity. Intemperance,
                        though not the greatest sin, is the greatest evil that afflicts our
                    country.</p>

                    school will benefit.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Free School system, in many places, has proved successful -- in some
                        places it has been the reverse. Whether, in our midst, it will meet with
                        success and the approval of our people remains to be tested by practical
                        experience. We have no other alternative than to put the free schools into
                        operation; to encourage them to the extent of our power, and endeavor to
                        reap all the benefit we can from them. The tax to support them has been
                        assessed, and will have to be paid; and although it is not sufficient to
                        support the number of schools contemplated, the plan of the trustees to
                        raise the amount sufficient, by private subscription, should be encouraged,
                        as it seems to be the most feasible one, and one which will secure all the
                        benefits of the institution, without discriminating in favor of any
                        particular section of the Township.</p>
                    <p>To the greater portion of the people the public free schools will be a
                        blessing, because their tax will not amount to one-fourth the tuition of a
                        single child; and this class, (whose tax will be small, but who have
                        children to educate,) should contribute liberally towards raising the
                        additional sum necessary to carry out the programme of the trustees. --

<b>Conservative Party</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Called on all Conservatives to forget old party labels and unite under the
                    Conservative banner to ensure the reestablishment of southern prosperity.
                    Assured conservatives that their movement was sweeping the country, as indicated

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The organization of the Conservative party of Virginia was thought to be
                        merely local, and formed for an emergency -- self
                        preservation. It has already assumed a national character and its principles
                        will most certainly present the issues upon which the battle for the
                        Presidency in '72 is to be won. To Virginia belongs the honor of having
                        inaugurated what is now called the "Reform Movement in Politics." A close
                        analysis of the principles and issues which were carried so triumphantly by
                        the people of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky,
                        Alabama, New York, &amp;c., against politicians, the influence of the
                        administration and the force of bayonets, will be found to be the same
                        principles and the same issues upon which Virginia planter herself in 1869;
                        it will be further seen that where these principles were broadly and
                        squarely presented, divested of all collateral issues, the majorities were
                        much larger and the sentiments of the people more emphatic and decisive.</p>
                    <p>The example of Virginia has given 100 honest
                        representatives in Congress instead of 59. Call them Democrats,
                        Conservatives, Reformers, or what not, they are the representatives of the
                        people and exponents of the principles of the Virginia Conservative party.
                        Sixteen independent Republicans are also elected, whom it is said will
                        co-operate cordially with the 109 in the election of speaker and the
                        formation of the committees. Clearly we will have the power to control the
                        House of Representatives and direct its policy. What then? The formation of
                        a party based on the principles presented by Virginia in her local election
                        in '69, which will sweep away the whole Union as it did Missouri and other
                        States in the last election.</p>
                    <p>To all Conservatives, then, we have to say, stand firm -- be not drawn away
                        by any side issue -- forget dead issues -- ignore party name, and array
                        yourself under the banner and follow the lead of the man that promises the
                        quickest deliverance to honest men, and the speediest retribution to rogues
                        and carpet-baggers. -- Montgomery Messenger.</p>
