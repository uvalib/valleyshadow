<b>For the Spectator</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Augusta" made another attack on the proposed subscription to the Valley
                    Railroad. Argued that the citizens of the county were already heavily taxed on
                    their property and so did not deserve the extra burden. Also accused the
                    Railroad's supporters of using Staunton's votes to pass a measure the people of
                    the county had already rejected. Closed by urging all voters to go to the polls
                    and vote down the subscription a second time.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Voters of Augusta:</p>
                    <p>We used the word "Sharper" as it is used every day, as, "he is a sharp
                        editor," "he is a sharp lawyer," "he is a sharp trade," &amp;c.; but in
                        no offensive sense, meaning to be harsh. We said in answer to "Progress,"
                        not to the Central Committee, (for when our article was written the
                        committee had not been appointed", "there was something like a conspiracy
                        among the Railroad sharpers against the best interests of the country." If
                        you will read an article published in the Spectator, July 5th, you will find something from a pretty "sharp"
                        gentleman, who sometimes signs himself "Progress," making a proposition to
                        take the quote of stock allotted to Augusta county, upon the express
                        condition "that there shall NEVER be any Depot, Switch, Station or shopping place within the
                            bounds of Augusta county, except Staunton." Don't you think this
                        looks something like a conspiracy against the best interests of the county?</p>
                    <p>The address issued by twenty gentlemen of Staunton -- "men in whom the whole
                        county has been wont to confide" -- urging the county to vote on the 6th of
                        August, for the subscription of $300,000 to the Valley Railroad, has a
                        degree of plausibility about it; but we are struck with the fact that not
                            one countyman is to be found on the committee
                        urging this subscription. We have honored most of these gentlemen in the
                        past with our trust and confidence -- we have listened attentively to all
                        their arguments, and they have had their weight upon the various questions
                        agitating the county minds, and we are keenly sensitive that you should now
                        use the 900 votes of Staunton to force the county (not induce) into this
                        subscription of $300,000. We consider this proposition as going to sap the
                        very foundations of our dearest rights -- the right of property -- and we do
                        not think it a "proper means" to use in carrying this subscription, for
                        under an order of the Council, the census of Staunton was taken and 5,000
                        population reported, upon which the Legislature declared Staunton to be a
                        city under the new Constitution; elected her a Judge, and all the city
                        officials have been elected as such and qualified. -- This being a fact,
                        what right has the city of Staunton to vote in the county of Augusta. -- She
                        is a close corporation, and has no more right to vote in the county than
                        Richmond has to vote in Henrico county, or the county to vote in the city of
                        Staunton. -- His honour, the Judge of the county, has no jurisdiction in the
                        city of Staunton, not even power to protect the Revenue laws of the State;
                        hence, the revenue laws are violated in open day with impunity by
                        irresponsible parties, and as the city Judge failed to qualify there is no
                        redress. You can not so much as present one of these violators of the law
                        before the county grand jury.</p>
                    <p>And if the Judge of the county has no jurisdiction in the city of Staunton,
                        as it must appear from the facts, how, we ask, can he consider a poll to
                        open in the city on a question so vital to both city and county. We would
                        most respectfully call His Honor's attention to the fact, for we know that
                        justice and fair dealing are his object and arm, and should the city vote of
                        Staunton carry the subscription in the county, we hold it would be good
                        ground for a bill of injunction to prevent the bonds being issued. It won't
                        do, gentlemen, to use the new Constitution when it suits your purposes, and
                        when it does not, to take up the old one and use it. Old things have passed
                        away. -- And just here we would say, that a majority vote, instead of
                        three-fifths was in the bill, fixing the election as
                            prepared in Staunton, but was changed by the Legislature and made
                        three-fifths -- so says one of our Delegates.</p>
                    <p>Now when we consider that the city of Staunton has already voted $100,000 to
                        the Valley Rail Road, which will make a Rail Road tax of 60 cents on the
                        hundred dollars worth of property, and taking the basis of 1856 she will pay
                        Rail Road tax 60 cents, city tax 40 cents, State tax 50 cents, making $1.50
                        on the hundred dollars' worth of property, so that if a man is worth in
                        Staunton $1,000 he will pay $15 tax, if he is worth $10,000 he will pay $150
                        tax, if he is worth $20,000 he will pay $300 tax; if he is worth $50,000 he
                        will pay $750 tax, no less, and you yet want to add twenty cents more to the
                        Railroad tax. One might suppose this tax to be enough even for the
                        enterprising City of Staunton.</p>
                    <p>We allude to these facts in order to show that the vote of Staunton is used
                        solely and purposely to carry the subscription of $300,000 in the county. As
                        one of the Central Committee said; "If the county doesn't know her own
                        interest, the town will reach her, and force her into it." You may call this
                        a trick or by what name you please, but we submit this looks like there was
                        a "sharper" working the wires.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen of the Central Committee, we confess we feel humbled and wounded in
                        our reputation as Augusta county men, to see your names signed to such an
                        address. Why suffer such wholesale dictation to those who have trusted you
                        as the Conscript Fathers of Augusta. It was meet and right you should
                        present this vital question to the county upon its merits; but when the
                        intelligent land owners of the county said No, you should have submitted and
                        said amen, and not have countenanced any trick to trick the county into this
                        subscription, the second time.</p>
                    <p>This old county of Augusta is our county; it belongs to the people who
                        inhabit it. We are a laboring, not a speculating people, and must labor to
                        gain our subsistence. We are also a happy and independent people. We have no
                        debt on the county, thank God, to be voted away as the State stocks are
                        being parcelled out. We have a ready market for all our supplies, and you
                        city gentlemen now grumble at the price we ask you for butter and eggs. One
                        of our Conscript Fathers said, in a speech at the Court House on Court day,
                        that we should vote the $300,000 subscription, and the old ladies of the
                        county could sell their beans and cabbage while the Rail Road was being
                        built. We say we don't want our wives and mothers and sisters to peddle
                        beans and cabbage along the line of a Rail Road to Penitentiary convicts and Chinese laborers, in order to pay our
                        taxes. The same gentlemen urged you to vote this subscription in order to
                        break down the gigantic monopoly of the Chesa. &amp; O. R. R., and the
                        same gentleman asked you but a short time since to vote $300,000 to this (C.
                        &amp; O. R. R.) monopoly as the grandest improvement of the age, and you
                        said no. Now, does not this contradiction look strangely?</p>
                    <p>This Conscript Father, speaking of the Shenandoah Valley R. R. , said he did
                        not know anything about the purposes of that Road, but rather made sport of
                        that improvement. -- Ought he not to inform himself upon the merits of that
                        Road, before he undertakes to urge the county to vote the subscription of
                        $300,000 to the Valley Rail Road? -- The Shenandoah Valley Rail Road asks
                        nothing at the hands of the county, and it is an important improvement to
                        the East side of the country and the whole county, as it will pass through
                        Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to the city of New York. The President
                        says: "The Shenandoah Valley Railroad will be built regardless of any other
                        road and there is no contingency in which it will be abandoned in favor of
                        the Valley R. R." The survey has been completed, and is of the most
                        satisfactory character. We think this fact accounts for the hurry in getting
                        the county's subscription to the Valley Railroad. Now or never!</p>
                    <p>You tell us there will only be 15c tax on the $100 worth of property. Add
                        this to the other taxes and see how it stands: State tax, 50cts; county tax,
                        not less than 20c -- making 85 cents on the $100 worth of property. So that
                        if a man is worth $1000 he will pay $8.50; if he is worth $10,000 he will
                        pay $85; if he is worth $20,000 he will pay $170 tax or $105,465 to be paid
                        out of the labor of the county annually -- to say nothing of the United
                        States tax -- and these gentlemen living in the city will not touch it with
                        one of their fingers. We would advise you, gentlemen, to read the 45th and
                        46th verses of the 11th chapter of St. Luke.</p>
                    <p>All we ask, gentlemen, is to be let alone. -- We don't want our houses,
                        farms, stock, bonds, money, and property, both personal and real, to be
                        placed in trust to the B. &amp; O. R. R. for 30 long years, which will
                        be troublesome, as well as expensive. We have not asked for this road, and
                        we have told you once by our votes that we would not have you to rule over
                        us, and we will on the 6th day of August, render the same verdict. Voters of
                        the county, we leave this important question with you to decide on the 6th
                        day of August, and we say to you, do that only which you believe will
                        promote your interest, and not vote from mere impulse, expecting something
                        to turn up, for we well know if the road is built our resources will
                        increase so slowly as to be unobserved.</p>
                    <p>"'Tis better to bear the ills we have,</p>
                    <p>Than fly to those we know not of.</p>

<b>Voters of Augusta</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>"Augusta" called on all voters to turn out and vote down the Valley
                    Railroad subscription. Warned that if it passed, everyone's property would be at

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Railroad men have changed their policy. Now the $300,000 is to be carried
                        by storm. -- Be on your guard. There will be Railroad men from Staunton at
                        every voting place in the county, to influence a certain class of voters to
                        vote your property away. It is vital, therefore, to close up our ranks, and
                        prepare for the contest. Stop your plows on the 6th day of August, and go to
                        work, and as there is no opposing element of interest between you and your
                        hands, white or colored, your will is their will, therefore go with them to
                        the polls and keep them out of the hands of these Railroad men, who will
                        feed and drink them for their vote. If but one vote is lost, it may carry
                        the $300,000, and the county is lost, and the tax is upon you. Get voting tickets against the subscription; they are
                            ready for distribution. We call upon the widow, the orphan, the
                        mother, the wives and sisters of Augusta, to go to work. We tremble for your
                        safety, and our devout prayer is that our God will bless our united efforts
                        and save our homes from the clutches of a heartless organization that would
                        send you to the Poor House, when your protectors are laid in the cold grave,
                        to collect the last mite of taxes. AUGUSTA.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A short time since, quite a number of hand-bills in advocacy of the Railroad
                        tax were distributed over the county, which the President of the Valley Rail
                        Road, so-called, took the trouble, and with a flourish of trumpets to inform
                        the tax-payers of Augusta emanated from the Hon. A. H. H. Stuart. I hope
                        Col. Harman will not feel disgruntled if the said tax payers of the county
                        refuse to sneeze whenever Mr. Stuart's taste or inclination may lead him to
                        take snuff. The intelligent tax-payers of this county cannot afford to let
                        any one do their thinking or in the slightest degree indicate to them what
                        is or is not in their interest pecuniarily or financially. Mr. Stuart is
                        entitled to his opinion (and the right to change it) as I and every other
                        tax-payer, but that Mr. Stuart and others have erred in some of their facts
                        and figures is what I now intend to try to prove. It is urged that the whole
                        amount necessary to be subscribed before commencing the road is $3,200,000,
                        and $2,900,000 have been taken and Augusta is asked to take the remaining
                        $300,000 to insure the commencement of the work in a few months. I would
                        like very much to know where the remaining three millions and upwards is to
                        come from to complete the work, for it is asserted the estimated cost of the
                        Road from Harrisonburg to Salem is $6,598,963; again, I ask, where is the
                        deficiency of 3 millions and upwards to come from to complete the road. I
                        can tell you; the counties and towns along the line and through which the
                        road passes, will be called upon for an additional subscription. Yes,
                        Augusta will be asked to vote another $300,000, and you will be told the
                        $300,000 already voted, will be valueless, will be thrown away, unless you
                        vote an additional $300,000. And suppose you refuse, what then. The Company
                        must issues its bonds and sell them at whatever they will bring in the
                        market. What then -- the Company must mortgage the Road -- what plain
                        farmers call giving a deed of trust, to secure the payment of the bonds when
                        the bonds fall due. What then, will they be paid? I am inclined to think the
                        company will say we lack the spondolix, in other
                        words the money -- what then? the Road must be sold -- who is the purchaser?
                        Baltimore &amp; O. R. R. Company; your Road now in the hands of a
                        foreign corporation to do as they please with you -- your $300,000 gone,
                        sold for a mere song; for the Balt. &amp; O. R. R. Company would have no
                        competition in the sale and purchase of the Valley R. R., they owning the
                        Road from Harrisonburg to Baltimore. Now, fellow tax-payers, are you
                        prepared for this? -- look before you leap. Again, you are told the City of
                        Baltimore has agreed to subscribe $1,000,000 and
                        the Baltimore &amp; O. R. R. Company has agreed to subscribe another million; how is this? We were told by
                        Mr. Stuart and others that Baltimore City, and the Balt. &amp; O. R. R.
                        Company had subscribed one million each, now we are told they have agreed to subscribe another million; how is this?
                        We were told by Mr. Stuart and others that Baltimore City and the Balt.
                        &amp; O. R. R. Company had subscribed one million each, now we are told
                        they have agreed to subscribe one million each. I
                        speak by the card, for I quote verbatim -- from the address of the Central
                        Committee to the voters of Augusta county. In one breath we are told they
                            have subscribed and in the next breath they
                        have agreed to subscribe, a very marked difference between having done a thing and agreeing to do a thing. I will
                        tell you fellow-tax payers it looks a little queer to a man up a tree.
                        Again, admit that for argument sake that Mr. Stuart and others are right,
                        that Baltimore city has subscribed. What are the conditions? here they are:
                        that there shall be enough subscribed to construct the entire Road by those
                        solvent and able to pay. Now is such the fact? I assert there is not enough
                        subscribed to build the Road, and I do it without the fear of contradiction,
                        for the fact is notorious; then is Baltimore City bound for her million,
                        even admitting she has subscribed.</p>
                    <p>It is urged by some, that we will obtain Richmond prices for our produce. Was
                        such the fact when the Chesa. &amp; Ohio Road was building? I think not;
                        the idea of contractors paying more than market price for produce, to say
                        the least of it, it is simply absurd; any contractor buying above the market
                        I think highly probable never intends paying. This is not the first Rail
                        Road built through Augusta county and again I ask, did we obtain Richmond
                        prices then? if not then, why should we obtain them now. It is estimated the
                        cost of making the Road through Augusta will be $1,350,000, and therefore
                        that amount will be spent in the county; just as well argue that the cost of
                        running the Chesa. &amp; Ohio Road through the county is spent here;
                        wherever the contractors can buy the cheapest they will buy, and even grant
                        that they bought all their supplies of us, what does that prove only, that
                        we have sold to them instead of some other party. Does any one undertake to
                        say, if they had not bought our produce it would have rotted on our hands?
                        have we not a market for all we raise? are these contractors shut out from
                        the rest of the world, that they are compelled to bid against each other for
                        Augusta county's produce. Mr. Stuart informs us that the matter in issue is
                        wealth or poverty. I think Mr. Stuart risked a great deal on that assertion,
                        but I have charity enough to suppose he did not mean what he said. To talk
                        about poverty in connection with the old county of Augusta, "the Empire
                        County of Virginia" (another quotation from the Central Committee), and I
                        think one of the speakers on Monday characterized her as the Empire or
                        Greatest county of the South, and so she is Rail Road or no Rail Road, God
                        bless her, and for that reason I do not want to see her sold out to Shylocks
                        and sharpers foreign in feeling and without love and affection for her. It
                        is said the building of the Valley Rail Road is dependent upon Augusta's
                        subscription. I beg to take issue with those who make the assertion. If such
                        were the fact the Balt. &amp; Ohio Company would not have filled up the
                        gap from Winchester to Strasburg at a cost of 3/4 of a million, for it is as
                        clear as the noon-day sun, that a Road can never pay until a connection is
                        formed with the Chesa. &amp; O. Road; therefore it is to their interest
                        to make the connection upon the completion of the Chesa. &amp; O. R. R.
                        and no sooner.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart says the people of Augusta are now the victims of oppressive
                        monopoly. I and friend Sandy agree for once, but I will go a step further
                        and say all Rail Roads are monopolies. After speaking of the almost
                        unlimited power wielded by the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Company in its
                        rates of charges, he says: "people are obliged to submit to these exactions
                        because they cannot help themselves."</p>
                    <p>Again, Mr. Stuart says, corporations are proverbially without souls, and we
                        might add without hearts; they look to their own interests exclusively. What
                        do you think of that? Mr. Stuart's own language. And Mr. Stuart would advise
                        you, the tax payers of this county, to place yourselves at the mercy of one
                        of these soulless, heartless corporations, that look to their own interests
                        exclusively.</p>
                    <p>I confess I am somewhat surprised at Mr. Stuart giving such advice to his
                        fellow-citizens. He certainly does not expect them to heed it. But perhaps
                        he thinks this new found bantling of his has a soul; well perhaps it has,
                        may be about the size of a mustard seed. Again, another strong reason urged
                        is, that it gives us competition. I think they use the wrong word -- it
                        should be combination. What was charged upon flour from Staunton to Richmond
                        before the Rail Road to Harrisonburg was rebuilt? 56 cents. What is now
                        charged? 64 cents. Which does that look most like, competition or
                        combination. But says one of the tax party, they are 25 miles apart, so they
                        are, and so much more the reason for competition for the 25 miles of most
                        superior productive land that lies between them. This thing of competition
                        between Rail Roads is the greatest humbug of the day; "soulless and
                        heartless corporations, looking to their own interest exclusively," would
                        scarcely be expected to do any thing for the public advantage when
                        prejudiced to their own interest. Mr. Stuart says that the tax will be a
                        very small affair, 6 cents on the hundred dollars' worth of property, or 60
                        cents on the thousand, which would be six dollars on ten thousand. The
                        Central Committee says it will be $15 on ten thousand, and I do not suppose
                        the Committee would likely over estimate it. I confidently believe,
                        including collecting and disbursing, it will be $2.00 on the thousand, or
                        $20 on the ten thousand to pay the interest, which runs for thirty years.
                        Then a man worth ten thousand dollars would, in thirty years, pay six
                        hundred dollars interest, and at the end of the thirty years the principal
                        would fall due and his part of that would be $333.33 1/3, which added to
                        $600 would make $933.33 1/3, the man's share or part of principal and
                        interest who is worth $10,000, and in proportion for larger or small
                        amounts. The man worth $20,000 would pay double that amount, that is
                        $1,866.66 2/3. -- I would refer the tax-payers of this county to our sister
                        county of Rockingham. They taxed themselves $150,000 and are now pressed
                        down with taxation, and what have they to show for their $150,000 in the
                        shape of stock? nothing, or next thing to it, and so I fear it may be with
                        us. I would say to the tax payers, look out! beware how you vote this tax
                        upon yourselves, for when you cast your vote there is no recalling it -- the
                        Rubicon is crossed -- the die is cast. The 1st Saturday in August, the 6th
                        of the month, the vote will be taken. Don't fail to come to the polls. Come
                        one, come all.</p>

                    writers urging to vote against the railroad because they were only looking out
                    for their own interests instead of those of the county.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"Augusta" takes the liberty to refer to us personally, in a circular just
                        out. One word in reply: He terms the proposition made by us in the Spectator, July 5th, a conspiracy against the best
                        interests of the county. That proposal was only on condition that the County
                        refused to subscribe by that proposition. I simply said to the people of
                        Augusta, look now to your own interest -- there is a set of sharpers among
                        you who think that the Road will be built anyhow at the expense of other
                        people. If you trust to them, you will find if the Road is built without
                        your aid it will be built in such a way as to keep those who refuse to aid
                        the construction, from reaping the full benefit of it. "Augusta" and the
                        other sharpers of the opposition thought they had a nice pealed egg to eat
                        that others pealed for them; by that proposition I struck their elbow and
                        knocked the egg out of their hand, hence the yell of disappointment from
                        them. I helped to peal that egg gentlemen and I assure you there is a
                        conspiracy, if you chose to call it so, among those who helped peal it, that
                        they shall not steal it nor get the pleasure of eating it unless they help
                        peal it.</p>
                    <p>I have no interest in Staunton -- the exception was made in favor of
                        Staunton, because she had done her duty and subscribed $100,000. Do yours at
                        the election, August 6th, and you have all the benefits of the exception, if
                        not I promise you the Road shall never benefit those who vote against it, if
                        anything in my power can prevent. I believe this to be justice and will
                        stand responsible for it. "Augusta" is a Staunton man, and if you will look
                        at his remarks on the taxes of Staunton in this last article, you will learn
                        the secret of his opposition. It is not love for the County, but his love
                        for himself that actuates him.</p>
