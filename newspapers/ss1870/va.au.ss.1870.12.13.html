<b>President's Message</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Ridiculed Grant's message to Congress, saying it was entirely unoriginal.
                    Accused Grant of not implementing the fair policies he claimed to support,
                    thereby injuring "the true interests of the country."<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Alexandria Gazette, in speaking of the President's Message, say's that,
                        "it is, neither in style, nor matter, at all extraordinary. The tone towards
                        Great Britain and the Canadian authorities is, if not unfriendly, at least
                        sufficiently adverse as to please those who are not straight as to lean
                        over" -- the 'acquisition' of St. Domingo is still pressed -- the proposed
                        'Revenue reform' is pronounced against, &amp;c. -- The conclusion of the
                        Message gives what purports to be 'the policy of the Administration,' which,
                        as far as words are concerned, looks fair enough
                        -- the only difficulty being that the 'words' have not been carried out or
                        fulfilled by 'acts.' The real 'policy' of the Administration is to uphold
                        the Radical party, and to continue it in power -- in many instances to the
                        oppression of the people, and to the injury of the true interests of the
                        country.</p>

<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The annual Message of Gov. Walker is an able and manly document. Not having
                        room to publish it, in extenso, in this issue, we
                        publish in lieu thereof the following brief summary, by the Petersburg Index, of the chief points it touches:</p>
                    <p>The Governor begins by a just congratulation to the Assembly upon its past
                        acts, whence he immediately proceeds to the subject of the FINANCE. Reciting
                        several of the proposed schemes for the restoration of our credit, and
                        making a full disclosure of our relations, as to the State debt, with West
                        Virginia, the Governor earnestly recommends our assumption of the whole
                        former debt of Virginia, and urges the founding of it, principal and
                        interest, in new bonds of the State, such as were recommended in the Message
                        of March last, bearing date July 1st, 1871. Thus the first semi-annual
                        interest payment becomes due January 1st, 1872. In regard to the controversy
                        with West Virginia it is recommended that resort be had to arbitration, and
                        confidence is expressed in the willingness of the new administration of that
                        State to join us in such arbitration, though the present administration has
                        been deaf to our appeals for a settlement. In regard to the same subject the
                        Assembly is urged to limit their session to the constitutional term of
                        ninety days, and finally, the hope is expressed that under lessened expenses
                        in the future the State will be able to resume payment of interest on
                        January 1st, 1872. On the whole subject the Governor is firm for the credit
                        of the State and against all forms of repudiation, active or passive. It is
                        even suggested, though the manner is not pointed out, that native holders of
                        State bonds, so long as the interest is not paid, should receive a rebate of
                        taxes to that extent. The suggestion is thrown out chiefly, it appears, to
                        lead up to the urgent necessity of a return to the payment of interest.</p>
                    <p>Next to engage the attention of the Message is the question of a STATE
                        MILITIA. He urges the immediate organization of a general militia force,
                        including a regular State Guard for use at Richmond, at receiving the
                        municipal riots of the Spring, in Richmond, together with the Taylor
                        &amp; South Farm riots by negro squatters, as also the iniquitous recall
                        of the United States troops sent to preserve order, at the request of the
                        Assembly and the State Executive, he makes the facts of those cases, told in
                        firm and temperate tones, convey a telling rebuke to the President and
                        advisers, in whose counsel "partisan zeal usurps the place and functions of
                        official integrity."</p>
                    <p>BOUNDARY LINES form the next subject, and a history is given of what has been
                        done, with timely suggestions as to the future. Regarding the State
                        Penitentiary, the Governor recommends the suggestions of the report of the
                        commissioners heretofore appointed, and urges legislation looking to
                        enlargement and changes of our prison buildings and general system. He
                        reports a gratifying decrease of the cost of the convicts during the
                        incumbency of the present Superintendent.</p>
                    <p>On SPECIAL LEGISLATION the Governor makes some wise and timely remarks, which
                        it were well if the Assembly will heed, pointing out its cost, its
                        uselessness and its corrupting and demoralizing tendency, and declaring that
                        general legislation could preclude nine-tenths of what comes under the form
                        of special bills, charters, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>PRESENTATION OF BILLS heads the next subject, in which, for convenience and
                        thorough performance of official duty, it is urged that upon the passage of
                        bills, they be at once enrolled, signed by the presiding officers of the
                        House and sent to the Governor, whereby time would be given for him for that
                        examination called for by the veto power and made necessary by the oath of
                        office.</p>
                    <p>The Message then recommends a CODIFICATION of the Laws of Virginia and
                        concludes with congratulating the Assembly upon the peace and order reigning
                        in the State, and upon the courage of the people in striving with adverse
                        circumstances of debt, disappointment, poverty, political misrule and
                        providential calamity.</p>
                    <p>The tone of the Message is worthy of its subject and of its author. It is
                        such a paper as well becomes a Governor of this Commonwealth. Calm,
                        dignified, and clear, it makes no appeal to passion nor betrays a partisan
                        thought, but with a plain disclosure of our needs it points out how to meet
                        them, and with no undue eulogy upon our people, it yet recognizes those
                        quantities which have made Virginia the mother of men generous in prosperity
                        and in adversity steadfast, in peace upholders of law and order, and in war
                        famous for great deeds.</p>
