<b>Voters of Augusta</b><br> (Column 04)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Anonymous writer "Augusta" responded to "Progress"'s articles by attacking
                    the proposed subscription to the Valley Railroad. Told voters that it would
                    raise taxes and put control of the railroad in the hands of outsiders. Also
                    charged "Progress" with deceiving Augusta citizens into thinking the Railroad
                    will provide jobs when the Railroad companies will merely bring in Chinese
                    labor. Warned voters to go out and vote against the subscription lest a minority
                    of citizens foist the railroad upon the whole county.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>"Both sides should be heard,," is the sentiment of
                        an honest Editor, who is strongly in favor of the Valley Rail Road, in
                        response to an article by "Progress", who complains very bitterly, that the
                        Editor of the Spectator should have admitted an article opposed to the present system of building the Road. What a
                        terrible thing it would be for the free and intelligent voters of the good
                        county of Augusta to be subjected to the caprice, and under the control of a
                        set of Rail Road sharpers, who would rob us of our rights and dearest
                        priveleges -- the right to see and examine for ourselves the arguments pro and con upon every
                        question of public policy and have us as slaves to be the victims of their
                        affirmations and promises. When these men use taunting words, which mean
                        little when uttered -- because both sides of the important question are now
                        before the people -- are we not strongly to suspect some mischief working
                        near us? We hardly think you are prepared to embrace their glittering
                        phantom for substantial truth, and we desire to give you this friendly
                        notice, and ask you to examine this important question of voting $300,000 as
                        you would your own private business. It is your real duty, and we think the
                        least credulous may see there exists something like a conspiracy among the
                        Rail Road sharpers against the best interests of the county. We would advise
                        you to read carefully the article of "Progress." We are now and always have
                        been in favor of the Valley Rail Road, and also the Shenandoah Rail Road,
                        and we are in favor of good county Roads. Let us have them all, but we are
                        opposed to the present system of building the
                        Valley Rail Road, and it is to this important question we would direct your
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>On the 6th of August you will be called upon to vote to place your land under
                        contribution for 30 years to a greedy foreign corporation. We consider this
                        purely a business question, and all we desire is to give you the facts, that
                        you may, on the 6th of August, vote with your eyes open, as you would buy a
                        horse or an ox from your neighbor, but not from mere impulse; do that only
                        which will promote your interest. The most remarkable performance of these
                        gentlemen to carry their project and insure success, is the care with which
                        they have prepared a bill, in Staunton, and sent
                        it to the Legislature with the following provisions:</p>
                    <p>1st. A majority vote, instead of three-fifths, should carry the subscription
                        of $300,000.</p>
                    <p>2nd. The Town of Staunton, with 900 votes, which has already, by a separate vote, subscribed $100,000, should say
                        whether the county should subscribe $300,000.</p>
                    <p>And the Legislature has made it lawful for the Town of Staunton to say your
                        property shall be taxed. Is not this an outrageous proposition -- is not
                        their mischief in the design -- is there not cheating going on to entrap the
                        people of the county into the $300,000 subscription. We need not tell you
                        who is doing all this -- you know full well. Is not the question assuming a
                        startling aspect when such tricks are resorted to, to seize the county and
                        hand it over to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Rail Road. If these schemes are
                        accomplished, alas, alas for the county of Augusta. We think all good men
                        will agree with us that the bonds of the county should be issued with great
                        caution, and only where at least a majority of the legal voters of the
                        county shall order them. If this is not the case what security has any man
                        of his property. We don't desire to find any fault with our Representatives
                        in Richmond, but when a fault certainly has been committed, attended with so
                        much evil to the county, we have a right to complain of our Representatives,
                        and we do think our Representatives should have protected the county from
                        this enormity, and not have suffered 900 votes of the Town to tax the
                        property of the county. We can not say in this case, "well done good and
                        faithful servants."</p>
                    <p>The order of the Court fixing the 6th day of August, as the day of voting in
                        the county, also orders a poll to be opened in the Town of Staunton, to say,
                        whether the county shall subscribe $300,000.</p>
                    <p>Oh, the shame! the shame!</p>
                    <p>These gentlemen are not in the habit of working without any eye to profit.
                        They have strained every faculty and nerve in this labor of weeks and
                        months, and is this all with a disinterested regard for your interests? Is
                        there a Valley Rail Road Company? Let us examine this for a moment. After
                        the charter for a Valley Rail Road was passed by the Legislature of
                        Virginia, there was a meeting held in the Court House at Staunton, and in
                        order to save the charter, there was $100,000 of
                        stock subscribed, and a President and Directors elected, when it will cost
                        five millions of dollars to build the Road. This looks very much like there
                        was a Valley Rail Road Company. But if you could see the letters and
                        dispatches which have passed between the President of the Valley Rail Road
                        and the President of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Rail Road, we think you
                        would conclude with Mr. Garrett, that the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Rail Road
                        is building the Valley Rail Road. We say this is purely a business question,
                        and we should make the best bargain for the county we can. The Baltimore
                        &amp; Ohio Rail Road and the Pennsylvania Central are two great rival
                        corporations, both rich and powerful -- both have charters for a road
                        through the county -- both have surveyed their routes, the Valley Rail Road
                        on the West, and the Shenandoah on the East side of the county -- both are
                        struggling to build their rival roads. Both of these Roads are desirable to
                        the county, so that one part of the county will not rise up against the
                        other, and their interests clash, and sectional feelings be engendered. In
                        order to have harmony let us vote down the $300,000 to the Valley Rail Road
                        on the 6th of August, and canvass this important question with a view to
                        both Roads. We propose a systematic organization on the part of the county.
                        Let our supervisors meet at an early day, and by correspondence with the
                        President of these two Roads, have the true merit of each laid before the
                        county without prejudice, and we say to both Roads, that the people of
                        Augusta ask for nothing for which they do not offer an equivalent. But we do
                        not mean to be bound down by fetters and be quietly devoured by either Road.
                        In view of the near approach of the election, the 6th day of August, and the
                        determination to resort to any expedient to carry this subscription, we most
                        earnestly appeal to every voter to come out. Remember the 900 votes of
                        Staunton. -- Let us hold Township meetings and agree upon some plan to get
                        out a full vote. The friends of the subscription don't want any excitement.
                        They expect to carry the $300,000 by the votes of those who have no taxes to
                        pay and the 900 votes of Staunton, with the promise that it will give them
                        work. But they too will be deceived, for already it is stated that the
                        Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Rail Road intend to employ immediately one
                        thousand Chinese to work on their Road, and Chinese will be employed to
                        build the Valley Road also.</p>
                    <p>So vote in the interests of those who are now giving you employment. If you
                        stay away from the polls and suffer the subscription to be carried, you will
                        have 30 long years in which to reproach yourselves. Let us then for once,
                        join hands over a common cause.</p>

<b>Railroads and Taxation</b><br> (Column 05)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Anonymous writer "Progress" made another plea for Augusta citizens to
                    subscribe to the Valley Railroad. Pointed out that all other counties which
                    appropriated money for internal improvements gained wealth and prosperity far
                    beyond the taxes needed to carry them out. Urged Virginians not to let their
                    state fall into depression just to save a few cents in taxes.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Let any one examine a Rail Road map of the United States, and he will at once
                        see that Virginia has fewer lines of Road in proportion to her population
                        and extent of Territory than any other State in the Union. Then let him
                        consult the statistics of the U.S. Census and he will find that those States
                        which have been the most liberal in appropriations to internal improvements
                        and have taxed themselves the most for the purpose are now the most
                        prosperous and have the least public debts, while Virginia has made the
                        least appropriation, taxed herself the least, is now the most destitute and
                        has the largest public debt in proportion to her wealth and population.
                        These are significant facts and tell their own tale. Verily, in material as
                        in spiritual things, there is that giveth and yet increaseth and there is
                        that withholdeth more than is meet and it tendeth to poverty. Had Virginia
                        taxed herself 60 years ago to complete the James River and Kanawha Canal,
                        and 40 years ago to build the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Rail Road Norfolk
                        would now be what New York City is, and the State of Virginia even far ahead
                        of the now Empire State of the North, for her natural advantages were much
                        greater; nor has New York felt her taxation half so much as the State of
                        Virginia, for those taxes brought their own means of payment by the
                        diffusion of capital and stimulation of enterprise. -- The mistakes of the
                        past may be excused for they had not the light of experience on these
                        subjects, but the present generation cannot be excused for going to mill
                        with their wheat in one end of the sack and a sone in the other to balance
                        it, because their fathers went that way. To continue in that course of folly
                        and ruin is sinning against light and knowledge and will bring its own
                        retribution. We will continue to sink in the scale of material wealth until
                        we will be driven by poverty to seek a living in other countries, (how many
                        thousands of the sons of Virginia have already been) and a more enterprising
                        people will come in and develope the resources and enjoy the
                        blessings which we have foolishly rejected. God never meant that the
                        boundless material wealth of Virginia should be kept locked up from the
                        world by the people of Virginia. We can no longer act this dog in the manger
                        policy. We must either develope these resources or give place to
                        those who will. If we wait for others to build our Railroads, we will find
                        that they also, will possess our lands and reap the benefits. People of
                        Augusta, the time has come for you to decide whether you will fall into line
                        and take your place in the front rank of progress and prosperity, or shut
                        yourselves out and drag along in the old "from hand to mouth" track. On the
                        6th of August the destiny of Augusta county will be settled for many years
                        to come; are you going to show to the world that you have learned wisdom
                        from the past, or will you stick to the old "skinflint" policy, and keep
                        yourselves and your county poor to save a few cents taxes? The writer knows
                        that your own prosperity and that of the Valley of Virginia is depending
                        upon your voting for the subscription, and he would earnestly urge you not
                        to commit the folly, the absolute madness of defeating the subscription, and
                        thereby throwing away the $2,900,000 liberally subscribed by others, and
                        which you reject by refusing to subscribe your quota.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The New York Times, (Republican,) in referring to
                        the course of the Republican factions in the two branches of Congress,
                        intimates very strongly that the extremists are not reflecting truly the
                        sentiments of the people, and are devoting too much time to their sable
                        friends and auxiliaries. The Times thinks that
                        "the negro has ceased to be a central figure," and that attention is due to
                        other great interests. Besides, it believes that the party is in danger of
                        experiencing a crisis in its fate that will be fatal to its hopes of future
                        supremacy. The harsh measures that have been applied to the South, and the
                        still harsher measures -- of which there seems to be no end -- that are
                        daily occupying the thoughts of the Radical ministers of vengeance, will
                        not, in the opinion of the Times, secure
                        "pacification," nor even preserve the harmony of the party much longer. Says
                        the Times:</p>
                    <p>"Both houses are arrayed in two factions, the one seeking to inaugurate new
                        and harsh measures towards the South, and the other to secure pacification,
                        and to construct some wise and prudent policy independently of the old
                        issues of the war. There is no question how the great body of the people
                        stand as between the two. They are tired of the struggle which has so long
                        existed with regard to the negro, and desire to march with the times. The
                        world does not stand still, although the Republican party may. We must deal
                        with the live questions of the hour."</p>

<b>Reduce the Taxes</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The article argued that the United States debt was decreasing, and, as a
                    result, the present tax-burden should be reduced. Both sections were still
                    suffering from the war, and expected growth will help pay down the debt much
                    easier in the future.<br>

<b>Our Correspondent "Augusta"</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>While he wished to print articles from both sides of the issue, the editor
                    came out in favor of the Valley Railroad. Responded to the arguments of the
                    railroad's opponents and insisted the county would benefit greatly if the voters
                    supported subscription.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>So far as we have been concerned, we have kept our columns open, as well to
                        the friends as to the opponents of the Valley Railroad subscription. As for
                        ourselves, we are in favor of the subscription, and think the voters of the
                        county should endorse it. We consider it to be a matter of vital importance
                        that this question should be settled now and finally. We do not understand
                        what our correspondent proposes. He says vote down the subscription and then
                        "canvass the important question with a view to both roads."</p>
                    <p>We regret the tone and spirit of the article of "Augusta." He speaks of a set
                        of "Railroad sharpers" and of "something like a conspiracy among the
                        Railroad sharpers against the best interests of the county." This language
                        is harsh and uncalled for, so far as our information extends. The Valley
                        Railroad Central Committee, whose address we published last week, is made up
                        of some of the best men in the county--men whom the whole county has been
                        wont to confide in. Certainly they are not "Railroad sharpers."</p>
                    <p>Again: "Augusta" seems to think the town of Staunton ought not to vote to tax
                        the county. If the town votes for the tax it will vote to tax its own
                        property ratably and equally with that of the county, to pay the debt. The
                        right vote and the duty to pay go hand in hand. Nearly one-tenth of the
                        whole tax will be paid by the town. "Augusta" seems also to think a majority
                        vote can carry the tax. He is mistaken; it will require a three-fifths vote,
                        just as the law has always been.</p>
                    <p>Again: This will be no "contribution to a greedy corporation." It will be a
                        subscription of stock, to be owned by the county, voted on by the county,
                        and the dividends on which will come into the county Treasury.</p>
                    <p>The county of Augusta will stand on the same footing as Rockbridge,
                        Botetourt, Roanoke, Staunton, and the city of Baltimore; and they, together
                        will have full power to govern and control the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
                        Company, even if it wished us evil.</p>
                    <p>Again: "Is there a company?" We are informed there is. But if there is not,
                        the subscription of Augusta county will make a
                        Company, with at least $3,200,000 of valid capital--that will suffice. The
                        charter of the Valley Railroad Company was not subject to forfeiture in any
                        specified time.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>For the Spectator</p>
                    <p>The following facts and figures have been collected from authentic sources
                        and with great care and may be depended upon as correct:</p>
                    <p>The subscription asked from Augusta county is $300,000, for which the county
                        is to issue its bonds payable in twenty years, with an annual interest of
                        $18,000, and for which the county is to receive of the capital stock of the
                        road $300,000.</p>
                    <p>The Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company have proposed to lease the Valley
                        Rail Road for twenty years, from the time it is completed for 6 per cent on
                        the cost of building, thus guaranteeing an income to the road equal to the
                        interest on the bonds.</p>
                    <p>The whole amount necessary to build the Road will be completed by this
                        subscription, and ensure the completion of the Road in two years from the
                        time the county gives the bonds.</p>
                    <p>The present value of the stock of twelve Rail Road Companies, as shown by
                        sales in Baltimore and New York during the present month, of Roads having no
                        greater advantages than the Valley Rail Road, show an average of 104 1/2 or
                        4 1/2 per cent premium. This brings us to the following estimate:</p>
                    
                        
                            The county bonds
                            $300,000
                        
                        
                            Interest for 20 years
                            360,000
                        
                        
                            Total
                            $660,000
                        
                        
                            Rent from the B. &amp; O. on the guaranteed profits of the
                                stock for 18 years
                            $324,000
                        
                        
                            Value of stock of the county
                            314,000
                        
                        
                            Total
                            $638,000
                        
                        
                            Balance for the county to pay
                            $22,000
                        
                    
                    <p>But as the two years interest has to be paid before the Road is completed and
                        the $14,000 of profit or stock cannot be realized until the Road is in
                        operation, therefore the amount to be raised by taxes is $36,000 in two
                        years or $18,000 each year.</p>
                    <p>The value of taxable property real and personal of Augusta county in 1868,
                        was over $12,000,000 and it is confidently estimated now by our best
                        financiers, that its present value is $15,000,000. If we take the estimate
                        at $12,000,000 the necessary tax to raise the $18,000 of interest will be 15
                        cents on the $100 of property and at $15,000,000 it will be only 12 cents on
                        the $100 or less than 1/2 of 1 per cent for two years only.</p>
                    <p>Thus it is demonstrated beyond the possibility of a doubt that for the small
                        addition to your tax for two years of 12 cents on the $100 you can secure
                        all the benefits and profits of the Road and the distribution of $1,360,000
                        in the county while making the Road, add to the value of your property from
                        25 to 50 per cent and give you from $10 to $20 profit for every dollar you
                        pay in tax. These are facts which can be proven by evidence that would stand
                        the test of any Court of Justice--facts that cannot be refuted. Be wise then
                        in time and vote for your own interest, the interest of the county, and
                        reject the advice of the penny wise and pound foolish, who would skin a
                        flint for a cent and spoil a knife worth sixpence.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>John B. Gibson died near Fishersville at the residence of his father, Mr.
                    Overton Gibson. "The writer knew much of this young man in health and in
                    disease. A brighter and better character never lived in our midst. He possessed
                    every noble element which belongs to the gentleman, the man of business and the
                    devout christian. He was truly a stay and comfort to his aged father and
                    motherless brothers and sisters, whose irreparable loss with that of a whole
                    community, they must feel most deeply." The notice also included an account of
                    his death-bed scene, where he bade farewell to family and friends.<br>(Names in announcement:  John B. Gibson,  Overton Gibson)</blockquote>
