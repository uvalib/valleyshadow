                    <p>STAUNTON, January 21st, 1870.</p>
                    <p>MR. EDITOR: -- Dear Sir -- Thinking that a few unvarnished remarks from a New
                        Jersey farmer, sojourning in your pleasant town, would not be inappropriate
                        to your valuable paper, I make the following. During my travels through the
                        State I have seen a great diversity of soil, but have seen none better
                        adapted to agriculture than the lands in and around Staunton, and I think
                        when Virginia becomes reinstated to her former position in the Union, which
                        I hope will not be long, and the leeches let go their hold on the State,
                        there will be such an influx of immigrants into the State as will "astonish
                        the natives," and I presume it is, owing to an erroneous idea that is
                        prevalent in some sections of the country, that a stranger from the North
                        would not be treated very civily among the people of your state that has
                        kept many from settling in the State. But so far as my observations extend I
                        know it is not the case. I have been treated with the utmost kindness and
                        civility by the people of this Grand Old State. During my stay here, I have
                        visited the different State Institutions, and have found them presided over
                            <sic>be</sic> efficient and gentlemanly officers.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir, hoping that Virginia may soon be restored to her former greatness,
                        and the Divine Ruler of the Universe will so guide and direct the
                        Representatives of the State that they will govern with fairness and
                        equanimity, that it will become the greatest State in the Union, which I
                        believe it is destined to be, I remain, Yours truly,</p>
                    <p>A JERSEY FARMER.</p>

                    <p>The Richmond <emph rend="italic">Evening News</emph> says that "the abolition
                        of slavery has pleased us in new relations towards each other, and it will
                        be well for us if its extinction would carry along with it many of the
                        prejudices and wrong notions which its presence among us produced and
                        cherished. It seems to us that in the past, the people of Virginia had a
                        great disinclination to work because they had entertained the idea that
                        manual labor was degrading. It was but natural that this should be so,
                        because there was amongst us an enslaved class of persons, whom we
                        considered as inferior to ourselves, to do such work for us. Slavery, also,
                        by rendering it unnecessary for us to perform manual labor, did certainly
                        imbue our minds with erroneous views in regard to the dignity of labor, and
                        if it did not make us absolutely lazy, at least, it tended to keep dormant
                        the latent physical energies which we possessed.</p>
                    <p>It behooves our people now to eradicate from their minds all such prejudices
                        and notions, and make efforts to emulate the character of Northern men in
                        this respect. Educated to it from boyhood, they work at all kinds of labor,
                        not spasmodically, but persistently, not ignorantly, but intelligently, and
                        as a matter of course they always obtain a competency, if not wealth. It has
                        been proverbial "that a Yankee would make a fortune where a Virginian would
                        starve," and really there has been much truth in the saying to make it
                        pleasant to our ears -- they are coming among us, they will bring with them
                        their energy, their skill, their industry and their thriftiness -- they will
                        cultivate the land, they will put crops into it that it never heard of
                        before, they will build manufactories, cut down the timber and saw it into
                        slaves, develops the mining and mineral of the State, and do everything
                        which will be productive of a dollar. We invite them to come, we want them,
                        but, Virginians, are you going to stand idle, and see these men get rich out
                        of your dear old State? Won't you rather put your shoulder to the wheel and
                        help them, and as they prosper, you will prosper too. Throw off your old
                        prejudices, old ideas, all barriers, and come down to your work like men. It
                        is in you to do it, and we believe you will. Let our people be determined to
                        acquire these characteristics of Northern men, and it will avail them much.
                        -- It is folly to grieve over facts. It is wisdom so to act as to take
                        advantage of them. Slavery is gone. We must labor. The Yankees will come
                        amongst us, they will work, they will grow rich, and if we don't strive and
                        keep pace with them on the road to affluence and position, ere long they
                        will become the ruling spirits in this Southern land. What Virginian would
                        like to see that? Bestir yourselves, then, and put forth the latent energy
                        and strength that is in you, and all will be well.</p>

                    <p>How do you feel since the State has been re-admitted into the Union? Feel
                        that we have been <emph rend="italic">taken in</emph>, but, in the lingo of
                        the "man and brother," we'll not <emph rend="italic">take on</emph> much

                        have "added insult to injury," and the injury inflicted will be forgiven
                        sooner than the insult wantonly offered. A few days since, we asked an
                        honest Hibernian if he felt any better since the State was admitted. "<emph
                            rend="italic">Divil' a bit,</emph>" said he, "<emph rend="italic">I
                            don't like the way 'twas done!</emph>" He struck the key-note of popular
                        sentiment. Our people "don't like the way 'twas done." They desired the
                        admission of the State, but desired her to be admitted as the equal of any
                        other State. They will not assent to her degradation. The deed has been done
                        without giving the State an opportunity to express her assent or dissent.
                        She has been <emph rend="italic">taken in, nolens volens</emph>. She asked
                        for bread and they gave her a stone -- a jagged fragment of Plymouth <emph

                    <p>We hope that the young men of this State will not desert their mother,
                        Virginia, at this time especially, when she so much needs their assistance
                        to repair her sad losses. They constitute her sheet-anchor of hope. She
                        desires to keep her sons at home, and we hope that they will comply with her
                        wishes. In the language of the <emph rend="italic">Norfolk Virginian</emph>,
                        "we trust they will join us in making a courageous fight for the full
                        restoration of their Mother State to her former power. They can do it if
                        they will only work with patience and resolution. It cannot be done in a
                        day, but the natural advantages of Virginia will rise superior to all the
                        combinations against her, and it is in this faith that we appeal to the
                        young men of the State to hew out careers for themselves at home, among
                        their own kith and kin, in sight of the graves of their own heroic ancestry,
                        among mountains opulent in histories, and rivers which flow between banks
                        rich in the memories of the illustrious dead. Youth is full of the love of
                        adventure. Youth hears the same bells which tolled Tom Whittington's
                        fortune. Youth looks abroad; but the Youth of Virginia owe it to all the
                        high and peculiar considerations to which we have alluded to remain at home;
                        and there are vast inducements to them to follow our advice. We have a
                        mineral wealth which surpasses the gem-lit caverns painted in <emph
                            rend="italic">The Arabian Nights</emph>. We have a water power which
                        foams seaward with a force equal to the manufacturing needs of a continent.
                        We have cattle and butter-raising districts broader than European
                        principalities.-- We have fat fields which grow the best wheat, the best
                        corn, the best tobacco, and the earliest fruits sent either to foreign or
                        domestic markets. We have a submarine mine of wealth in our broad bays, and
                        noble rivers, with their innumerable tributaries, which furnish
                        inexhaustible supplies of food that in other and less blessed countries men
                        call luxuries, while these same waters furnish us the cheapest of all
                        highways to our markets whether these be at home or abroad. We have, in
                        addition, all the amenities of an old society whose graces have become a
                        proverb in the land; and with this array of facts before the youth of this
                        State, we may well be excused from any imputation of selfishness when we
                        call on our younger brothers to unite with us in a resolute effort to
                        restore Virginia to her former opulence and power. Virginia has suffered
                        from emigration in the past. She sent forth men to build up the very States
                        which have been most active in destroying her liberties; and now in her
                        "voiceless woe" she appeals to her surviving children to remain within her
                        maternal embrace and return some part of their <unclear>final</unclear>

                    <p>MESSRS. EDITORS: -- The Stay Law will expire by constitutional provision, in
                        a few weeks. Creditors will then begin to press for payments of debts, and
                        much distress must ensue. Every measure that will tend to give relief, and
                        facilitate the settlement of balances between neighbors will be welcomed by
                        the community. Money which is the ordinary measure of value and medium of
                        adjustments, is now unprecedentedly scarce. All the lawful currency of the
                        country is required to pay State, Municipal, and Federal taxes and foreign
                        debts, and but little is left to settle balances between neighbors at home.</p>
                    <p>It becomes, then, a matter of interest to consider whether some substitute
                        for money cannot be devised, which will answer the purpose of settling local
                        balances, by becoming a medium of exchange.</p>
                    <p>Almost every man in the community occupies the double relation of debtor and
                        creditor. Many have quite as much due to them as they owe to others. But by
                        reason of their inability to collect what is <emph rend="italic">due to
                        them</emph>, they are unable to pay what is <emph rend="italic">due from
                            them</emph>, and are liable to be subjected to great loss and
                        inconvenience.</p>
                    <p>In thinking of this matter it has occurred to the writer of this article that
                        if a system of exchange of evidences of debt could be instituted, it would
                        afford great relief to the community. Thus, if A owes B $100 and B owes C
                        $100 and C owes D $100 and D owes E $100 and so on through the alphabet, it
                        is obvious that if X at the lower end of the list, would take the note of Z
                        for $100 and pass it to Y, in payment of his debt of $100, and Y in turn
                        would pass it to W, who would pass it on to V, and so on, backward, to A,
                        the one note of $100 would extinguish 25 debts of $100 each, without the
                        intervention of a dollar.</p>
                    <p>The great difficulty is in giving practical effect to such an arrangement is
                        the fact that debts are of different amounts, and therefore you cannot make
                        the exchange, because the debts will not fit.</p>
                    <p>But this difficulty is by no means insuperable. Let us, by way of
                        illustration, suppose a case.</p>
                    <p>A owes B $5,000 for which he gives him his negotiable note, payable at 90 or
                        120 days. -- Under ordinary circumstances B will either hold this note until
                        maturity, or have it discounted at Bank where it will remain, dead capital,
                        until its maturity, rendering no service to anybody.</p>
                    <p>But now let us suppose that B instead of giving one note of $5,000 gives 20
                        notes of $100 each and 60 notes of $50 each, making the same aggregate of
                        $5,000, what would be the consequence. B probably owes the greater part of
                        the $5,000, in small sums, to his merchant, his grocer, his shoe-maker, his
                        tailor, his school-teacher, his blacksmith, &amp;c. How easy would it be
                        for B to go to these various creditors and say, "I wish to pay you, but I
                        have no money. Here are notes which are unquestionably solvent -- take as
                        many of them as will satisfy your demand and we will square our accounts."
                        We venture to say that there is hardly a creditor who would not consent to
                        take these notes, in satisfaction of his debt. He, in turn, would take them
                        to his creditor who would use them in the same way, and thus, long before
                        the notes matured, they would probably discharge forty or fifty thousand
                        dollars of debt.</p>
                    <p>All that is necessary to give currency to these notes as a medium of
                        settlement is that they shall be drawn and endorsed by persons of
                        unquestionable solvency. They should be endorsed in blank so as to pass by
                        delivery like Bank notes. Our ordinary Bank currency is but the negotiable
                        note of a Bank secured by collaterals. And why should not the note of an
                        individual or individuals of unquestionable solvency be just as current as
                        the notes of a Bank?</p>
                    <p>The great advantages of this kind of paper would be that while it would
                        perform the functions of money in settling the local balances at home it
                        would not go abroad like money. It would remain here to be used in settling
                        balances among neighbors to whom the drawers and endorsers of the notes were
                        known.</p>
                    <p>We venture to say that if $20,000 or $30,000 of large debts were cut up into
                        small notes of $50 to $100 each, they might be made available in less than
                        one year to settle the large part of the indebtedness of the county.</p>
                    <p>A land bond for $1000 is really the representation of $1000 of Capital. But
                        in the shape of a land bond, it is dormant capital. It does nobody any good.
                        Cut it up into negotiable notes of $50 or $100, and, at once, it becomes
                        active capital, available for most of the uses of money -- passing from hand
                        to hand -- paying debts -- stimulating industry -- giving life to business
                        -- starting new enterprises, and adding to the general prosperity of the
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Let some of our business men set this thing on foot, and we are very much
                        mistaken if it does not afford great relief to the community and impart new
                        spirit to our people.</p>

                <summary>Mrs. Martha Steele Baldwin, wife of Judge Briscoe G. Baldwin, died at her
                    Staunton residence on January 24th. She was 79 years old, daughter of the late
                    Chancellor John Brown of Wytheville, and a long-time member of the Presbyterian
                    Church. "She was a lady of fine intellect and generous feelings. Her genial and
                    cheerful temper in early life made her the brightest ornament of the circle in
                    which she moved, and the object of warm attachment to her family and friends.
                    Her heart and her hand were always open to the appeals of charity. She possessed
                    a ready wit, and a fine taste for music and poetry. In the earlier period of her
                    life, when her children were growing up around her, her house was the scene of
                    warm-hearted hospitality, and of delightful enjoyment to the young."</summary>
