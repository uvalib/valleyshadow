<b>Where the Money Goes and How to Get it Back</b><br> (Column 06)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Anonymous writer "Progress" wrote another article in favor of the Valley
                    Railroad. Talked about the benefits towns experienced wherever railroads ran
                    through them and predicted similar prosperity for Staunton if they support the
                    Valley Railroad. Warned the citizens not to listen to those who say it will cost
                    too much.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Every one is just now complaining of hard times and dullness of business. It
                        will be admitted by all that this is all owing to the scarcity of money --
                        that if money was plenty times and business would be good. It then becomes
                        an important question to all -- where is the many hundreds of millions of
                        dollars in circulation in the United States? and why have we not got our
                        share of them in the Valley of Virginia? To answer this question is the
                        object of this article. Commerce, manufacturers, trade and enterprise are
                        the great features that distinguish civilization from savage life, and money
                        is the circulating medium through which they are carried on -- the life
                        blood of the body politic of all business, and Rail Roads and Steamships are
                        the arteries through which trade and its life blood, money, flows. You might
                        as well expect to find streams of blood flowing through the parts of animals
                        where there are no arteries, as to look for money in the section of country
                        where there are no Railroads. The writer has had peculiar opportunities in
                        judging of this matter. He has for the last twelve years been connected with
                        the manufacture and sale of an article which was of universal use and has
                        found its way into every part of the habitable earth. His Company has
                        upwards of three thousand agents scattered through every nation on the globe
                        in direct communication with the home office, which enables them at all
                        times to feel the pulse of the money market in all parts of the world.</p>
                    <p>Now when we have an application for an agency, or it is proposed to extend
                        our business into a new section, how do you suppose we determine the
                        prospect of success. Simply by taking a Rail Road map and examining the Rail
                        Road and Steamboat communication in the section. If it has one Rail Road it
                        is worth trying -- if two, it is good, and if three or four it is certain of
                        success. Now it is not the mere matter of transportation that makes this
                        difference, for our articles can be transported anywhere, over any Road at a
                        trifling cost, but it is entirely owing to the prosperity of those sections
                        which have Rail Roads and the money in circulation in them. There is no
                        profit in doing business among poor and destitute people. These are truths
                        and facts, drawn from an actual experience of a successful business, and
                        merit careful consideration from the people of Augusta at this time, when
                        they are about to decide their status in the business world for many years
                        to come by their votes on the Valley Rail Road question. The writer has many
                        times set down in his own room and estimated within 5 per cent of the amount
                        of business an agent would be able to do in a new and untried county, town
                        or section in North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
                        simply by consulting a Rail Road Map. There is another feature of this
                        matter worth consideration. The best articles to which experience have given
                        the preference find ready sale in the sections supplied with Rail Roads
                        where not only money, but general intelligence is most circulated, and
                        interior articles, especially of machinery are driven out to seek a market
                        in the more obscure sections and are there hawked about by sharp peddles who
                        impose on the credulity of the people, and thus the sections with out Rail
                        Roads get the worst of everything for what little money they have, and at
                        the highest prices. The writer is cognizant of the fact that the people of
                        Augusta County has within the last year spent enough money for worthless and
                        second rate articles, to have paid their tax on the Rail Road for five
                        years, because the makers of better articles cannot afford to spend their
                        money to bring their trade to your notice while they have better fields of
                        operation. But you will object to this that you have one Rail Road through
                        the county. The Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Rail Road is not a Rail Road in
                        the sense of which I am speaking, it is not an artery leading through and
                        connecting different parts of the country, but it is only a vein whose
                        effect is to return the blood to the heart, and which acts as a drain to
                        draw the money from its extremity and cause it to flow to Richmond, nor will
                        it ever become a great artery to Augusta County, when completed on an air
                        line as it will be, the line through Augusta will become a mere side line,
                        and while the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio is of more importance than any other
                        line to the general prosperity of the State as a great artery of trade, yet
                        it has not the local importance to Augusta county that the Valley Rail Road
                        has, even if it was equal. The experience I have given above is fully
                        demonstrated that two Rail Roads are as much better than one as one is
                        better than none, indeed their importance rise in arithmetical proportion.</p>
                    <p>Then, citizens of Augusta, be wise in time, do not be deceived by the whining
                        of skinflints and misers, too stingy to expend a trifle for their own good
                        and the prosperity of the county. Let me introduce you to an article in the
                            Valley Virginian, of July 7th, where it is
                        demonstrated that if you are worth $10,000 your Rail Road tax will be only
                        $6 a year -- Most of you are not probably worth over half in taxable
                        property, which will make your tax only $3 a year. Will you for this trifle
                        doom yourself and the county to years of hard times, scarcity of money,
                        poverty, and hardships. -- Remember your vote is a final decision of Rail
                        Road or no Rail Road. Ponder and think. -- Convert yourself and get in
                        earnest and convert your neighbor, and come up to the polls on the 6th of
                        August determined to win the victory and save the county from ignorance and
                        folly.</p>
                    <p>The writer has no private log to roll, no selfish purpose to serve. His
                        business is not in the Valley of Virginia, and in the very nature of it
                        never can be much affected by the Valley Rail Road one way or another. His
                        property is not dependent upon this Road as yours is, but he resides among
                        you and is jealous of the honor of the Valley, and desires to see the
                        prosperity of his native county, and will probably bear a heavier portion of
                        the tax than any one of those, who are opposing the Road to save their
                        trifling share of the cost. He is advising you for your own good from his
                        experiences, and not for any private ends.</p>
