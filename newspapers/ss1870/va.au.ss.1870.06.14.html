<b>The Valley Railroad</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Baltimore and Ohio Company recently subscribed $1,000,000 to the Valley
                    Railroad. Editor insisted that Augusta county must subscribe $300,000 to ensure
                    the construction of the railroad.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Wednesday last the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company subscribed one
                        million of dollars to the Valley railroad. The city of Baltimore had
                        previously subscribed $1,000,000 on condition that $1,200,000 be procured
                        from the counties and towns in the Valley of Virginia and $1,000,000 more
                        from persons and corporations able to pay. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
                        Company voted the million that the last-named condition might be complied
                        with. There remains now to be subscribed only $300,000, which is the basis
                        required, as the county of Rockbridge has subscribed $400,000, Botetourt
                        $200,000, Roanoke $200,000, and the town of Staunton $100,000.</p>
                    <p>It is only necessary now for Augusta to vote the proposed subscription of
                        $300,000 to insure the construction of the Valley Railroad. She would be
                        acting unwisely not to do so, for she would be more benefited by its
                        construction than any county along the line. It would be a burning shame if
                        she should cause the defeat of this great improvement by failing to vote the
                        subscription proposed. Her name, now honored wherever mentioned, would, in
                        that event, become a by-word of reproach. She should vote the subscription
                        with unanimity.</p>

<b>The Consolidation Bill</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Spectator reported on the passage of a bill that consolidates the
                    assets several railroad companies. The Spectator opposed the bill, both because
                    they suspect it was passed through the use of bribery and because they believe
                    that it will increase State debt and divert commerce. They hope the Governor
                    will take action to veto the bill.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We regret to be obliged to announce to our readers that this bill has passed
                        both houses of the General Assembly. Ugly rumors are in circulation in
                        regard to the means employed to effect its passage. For the first time in
                        the history of Virginia, charges are made of bribery and corruption being
                        used to influence the votes of members. We do not know whether these rumors
                        are well or ill-founded, but we deeply regret that any pretext should have
                        been afforded by the friends of the bill, for even a whisper of suspicion.
                        Our Legislators should be like Caesar's wife -- not only void of corruption,
                        but above suspicion.</p>
                    <p>We regard this bill, independently of the means alleged to have been used to
                        pass it, as presenting no claims to Executive approval. -- We believe it
                        will prove disastrous to every great interest of Virginia -- injurious to
                        Lynchburg and Petersburg, and ruinous to Norfolk. We believe it will prove
                        profitable only to the New York and Norfolk steamship line, whose decks and
                        holds will be the Eastern depot of the consolidated line. We believe that
                        the people of Norfolk will find, when too late, that it is a measure
                        intended to bring trade not to, but through Norfolk. We believe that all the
                            merchandize transported from the West, will be consigned to
                        New York and not to Norfolk, and the favored steamship line, (which, we
                        strongly suspect is owned by the backers of consolidation) will receive it
                        all, direct from the Railroad. And so of the freight going Westward; it will
                        be consigned, not to the commission houses of Norfolk, but to the agent of
                        the consolidated line, and will be whisked away without any profit to
                        Norfolk. Consolidation will make some people rich, no doubt. Who these
                        favored parties are, we do not know. We would like, however, to see a list
                        of the stock-holders -- not the nominal, but the real owners -- of that
                        steamship line. We could then give a pretty shrewd guess, as to who will be
                        made rich at the expense of the State, and who probably footed the bills of
                        cost incurred in pushing consolidation through the Legislature.</p>
                    <p>As for consolidation, in the proper sense of the term, viz.: the uniting the
                        three roads under one management, we have nothing to say against it, farther
                        than to express our distrust and fear of all gigantic monopolies. But there
                        are features in the bill, which has just passed, against which we must enter
                        our most earnest protest. We protest against the spoliation which is about
                        to be practised on the State. -- We protest against the State's being robbed
                        of six millions of dollars, for the benefit of a few greedy speculators. On
                        behalf of our impoverished tax-payers, we object to their being despoiled of
                        six millions of Assets, which Gov. Walker, in his patriotic and
                        statesman-like message, has shown, could be made available to pay off six
                        millions of debt, and thus relieve the people of $350,000 of taxes per
                        annum. This would be no small matter in these days of destitution. We know
                        that the consolidationists say, that the market value of the stocks is now
                        greatly below par. Granted. But so are the stocks of all our Railroads, and
                        of our cities, and of our State, under par. But it is a conclusive answer to
                        this, to show, that parties are willing to trade depreciated State bonds,
                        for these depreciated stocks, dollar for dollar. That is certainly so now,
                        in regard to the stocks of the Lynchburg and Tennessee R. R., and we have
                        reason to believe it will soon be so, in regard to the stocks of other
                        roads. -- If they have the capacity to extinguish our State debt, pro tanto, and relieve our people from taxation, it
                        matters not what their market values may be, their debt-paying capacity
                        makes them equal to par for that purpose.</p>
                    <p>We also foresee great difficulties in settling with West Virginia her share
                        of the old debt, if we meddle with and squander the assets applicable to the
                        discharge of that debt.</p>
                    <p>What answer can our commissioners make, to those of West Virginia, when the
                        latter require that we shall assume the six millions, which, without her
                        consent, we have undertaken to give away? Will not our commissioners be
                        stopped from requiring West Virginia to assume any part of the debt incurred
                        in subscriptions or loans to these roads?</p>
                    <p>If our commissioners undertake to say, the stocks were worth only $16 or $20
                        in the market, the answer is ready -- "we are not enquiring about the market
                        value -- we are enquiring of the value they would have been to us, in paying
                        off the debt." If you had handed over to us, $2,300,000 of Lynchburg and
                        Tennessee stock, we could, with it, have paid $2,300,000 of the debt. Now as
                        you thought proper to give away this stock, you must take the consequences,
                        and assume all that debt. And so with the stocks of the other roads. No
                        answer can be given to this view, because it is absolutely correct. The
                        Legislature, therefore, by this consolidation bill, not only gives away six
                        millions of stocks, but it virtually assumes six
                            millions of the old debt, which will have to be thrown out of the
                        account, between the two States of Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
                    <p>But the consolidationists say, they have secured four millions of the debt.
                        How secured it? By putting it in a second mortgage, behind a prior mortgage of fifteen millions of dollars. Is any
                        body stupid enough to regard this as anything but a delusion and a snare. --
                        Would any body give 5 cents in the dollar, for a debt so secured? This is
                        the boldest imposition that any one ever attempted to practice on the
                        credulity of any people. Suppose, at any time, the company wish to get rid
                        of the State's posterior mortgage, is it not plain, they can readily do so?
                        They have only to expose the whole work for sale, and buy it in, for the
                        amount of the first mortgage, and where would Virginia then stand? The
                        purchasers under the first mortgage, would acquire a perfect title, free of
                        all subsequent mortgages. The only way for the State to protect herself,
                        would be, to buy in the road for the amount of the first mortgage, and thus
                        become the proprietor. Would any one recommend this course? Looking at the
                        second mortgage, in the light of common sense -- behind a prior mortgage of
                        fifteen millions, we are constrained to say that we regard it as an
                        unmitigated humbug -- a swindle and a cheat.</p>
                    <p>The only hope now, is, in the firmness and patriotism of the Governor. He has
                        made the financial condition of the State his special study. His financial
                        message showed that he understood it perfectly. His recommendations in that
                        message were wise and practical. He showed how the debt might, without
                        taxation, be largely reduced. He made it plain that the stocks of the
                        Railroad companies, could be made available for this object. Yet, with all
                        the light which his message threw on the subject, the Legislature has chosen
                        to go counter to all his suggestions, and in defiance of every principle of
                        right and justice, to strip our impoverished people of their only means of
                        honestly paying their debts, and relieving themselves from an intolerable
                        burthen of taxation.</p>
                    <p>We earnestly hope the Governor will veto this bill. We believe that when the
                        matter is fairly understood, three-fourths of the people will sustain him.
                        We believe, further, that the day is not far distant, when some of those who
                        now support the bill, will thank him for having saved the State from the
                        consequences of their folly. Excitement, infatuation, madness, have ruled
                        the hour. Appeals have been made to local prejudices and passions, until
                        such a fever was created, that reason was dethroned and men went blindly in
                        the path that was marked out for them by designing and interested leaders.
                        When the sober second thought of the people has had time to produce its
                        effects, they will perceive how their interests have been sacrificed, and
                        the public welfare disregarded.</p>
                    <p>This question has been suddenly sprung on the people and their
                        representatives. Let the bill be vetoed. Let time be given for deliberation.
                        Let it go before the people. Let it be an issue in the next election and we
                        will vouch for it, that it will stand repudiated and condemned by the
                        popular judgment.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>Thursday last, the 9th inst., was the day appointed for paying the annual
                        tribute of affection to the confederate soldiers who "sleep their last
                        sleep" in the cemetery near this place by decorating their graves with
                        flowers. It commenced raining early in the morning, and the rain continued
                        to fall almost without interruption till after the hour appointed for the
                        ceremonies of the day. Notwithstanding the rain, large numbers assembled at
                        the Town Hall, where it had been announced, per published programme, that
                        the head of the column of the procession would be formed. By the hour
                        appointed to form the procession, all were in readiness, the bands of music,
                        the fire companies, the friends of temperance of Staunton councils, the
                        pioneers, the ladies with their wreaths and bouquets of flowers, but the
                        "peltings of the pitiless storm" continued without abatement, or any
                        prospect of doing so for hours. Under these exceedingly inauspicious
                        circumstances, those to whom had been assigned the chief management of the
                        ceremonies thought it best not to attempt the performance of them in such
                        inclement weather, and announced that the decoration would be postponed to
                        another time. But it soon became manifest that those who had assembled for
                        the sacred purpose of paying their tribute of love and affection to the
                        loved and lost would not be prevented from doing so, however unfavorable the
                        weather. Acting spontaneously and without prompting upon the sentiment,
                        unexpressed save in action, that as the soldiers, when living, never allowed
                        the weather to prevent them from performing their arduous duties, even at
                        the peril of their lives, so those assembled to honor their memories would
                        not allow the weather to prevent them from performing their duties to the
                        soldiers now dead, they, as if impelled by a single impulse, resolved to
                        decorate the graves of the soldiers at that time, regardless of the
                        character of the weather, and the official announcement of the postponement
                        of the ceremonies. Accordingly, notwithstanding that the rain continued to
                        fall, there was a spontaneous movement, and as many, it was estimated, as
                        two thousand persons visited the cemetery in that inclement weather and
                        performed the sacred duty of decorating every soldier's hillock home in that
                        "city of the dead." -- This was a spectacle worthy to be witnessed by
                        spirits of a higher and better sphere. The ladies, with flowers beautifully
                        arranged, decorated each and every grave. The Bands discoursed appropriate
                        music, sweet though solemn. Besides the music at the soldiers' cemetery,
                        dirges were played at the graves of the soldiers buried in the citizens'
                        cemetery.</p>
                    <p>The corps of pioneers, assisted by the members of the fire companies and
                        others, with spades and shovels, dressed such graves as most needed it.</p>
                    <p>It was a touching spectacle to see -- in the afternoon, after the ceremonies
                        above mentioned had been performed and those engaged in them had returned to
                        their homes -- the mute girls from the Deaf and Dumb and Blind Institution,
                        marching in procession to the cemetery each with a garland of evergreen to
                        place upon the graves of the soldiers. This procession was preceded by the
                        new Band wagon of that Institution beautifully wreathed in evergreen. This
                        tribute of love and patriotism by these unfortunate mute girls sensibly touched our heart.</p>
