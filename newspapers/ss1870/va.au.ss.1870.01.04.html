                    <p>The opponents of the admission of Virginia have not gained much headway
                        during the recess. Judge Underwood was in Washington Wednesday, and says
                        that while there is much that, as a radical, he cannot approve in the
                        present reconstruction of Virginia he nevertheless favors her admission as
                        soon as Congress reassembles. He does not see that the State is to be much
                        benefitted by any further delay. -- The times are so dull and wages so low
                        in Virginia that the colored people are going Southward, and he estimates
                        that the State will lose nearly twenty thousand of this class of its
                        population.</p>

                        practically finished. It secures the ballot to the black man of the South,
                        and saves the Republican party of the North. And when that amendment is
                        proclaimed the question of universal suffrage is staged,

<b>The Democratic Party</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The Richmond Dispatch urged the people of the South to avoid any alliances
                    with either the Democratic or Republican parties. Instead, the Dispatch
                    recommended that they form a new national party that could better represent
                    their interests. Also analyzed the reasons why neither the Democratic nor
                    Republican parties could effectively help the South.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>We have just read some excellent reasons, says the Richmond Dispatch, why the people of Virginia should not
                        unite with the Republican party. We have never counselled them to do so, and
                        therefore we are not called upon to show that these reasons are
                        insufficient. We have, however, advised them that it would be best, for the
                        present at least, to avoid entangling alliances with either the one or the
                        other of the parties into which the northern people are divided. Whoever
                        will examine the record of the Democratic party of the North in a candid
                        spirit must admit that so far as their acts are concerned they are so
                        hostile to the southern people that they must be accounted as truly the
                        enemies of what we hold to be the real principles of Federal Government as
                        are the moderate Republicans. If anybody can see the practical difference
                        between the maintenance of the right of the Federal Government to make war
                        upon the States and the consolidation doctrines of the Republicans, his
                        perceptive powers are greater than our's.</p>
                    <p>"My own county, which gives a Democratic majority of three thousand," said
                        Senator Thurman, the leader of the Democrats in the United States Senate,
                        the other day, to Senator Stewart, of Nevada, "sent more soldiers to the war
                        than your whole State." This teaches us the difference between the
                        Republicans and the Democrats of the North. The Republicans told us
                        beforehand that no State had a right to secede, and that if any one
                        attempted to secede it would be whipped back into the Union; and they kept
                        their word. The Democrats told us time and again that they believed in the
                        resolutions of '98 and '99, and would not allow us to be whipped if we
                        seceded; and they did not keep their word. On the
                        contrary, they boast of having done more to subjugate us than the
                        Republicans. The Republicans claim that the National Government is
                        all-powerful; and act up to their belief. The Democrats profess to believe
                        in the rights of the States, but they always aid the Republicans when the
                        pinch comes. They advocate States' rights, and vote and fight for
                        consolidation, just as they advocate repudiation privately and then desert
                        and vote against and denounce the Mungens who take them at their word. We
                        are no Mungen.</p>
                    <p>Negro suffrage was forced upon the southern people by the Democrats in the
                        last House of Representatives. When the reconstruction measures were first
                        proposed the Republicans had no more idea of enfranchising the negroes than
                        we had ourselves. But whilst one of these measures was under consideration,
                        a Radical proposed, as an amendment to the bill, to confer the right of
                        suffrage upon the negroes. The moderate Republicans voted against this
                        amendment; and if the Democrats had voted with them it would not have been
                        made a law. But the Democrats caring nothing for us, and wishing to make
                        capital for themselves at home voted for it. The consequence was that when
                        the bill thus amended came up upon its passage the whole Republican party in
                        the House voted for it and carried it. The Democrats voted against it; but
                        it was too late. The mischief had been done. Can we rely upon such allies?</p>
                    <p>All this does not prove that we can safely unite with the Republicans. But it
                        shows that we should lean upon a broken reed if we trusted the northern
                        Democrats. We should rather refuse to unite with either party as at present
                        constituted. We may thus compel a reorganization of the parties at the
                        North. The Democrats are so hated by the northern people that the
                        indignities which have been visited upon our heads were due rather to this
                        feeling than to any real hostility towards us. We suppose there can be no
                        doubt that Congress was actuated more by a determination to circumvent
                        President Johnson and keep down the so-called Copperheads than it was by a
                        desire to punish us when it entered upon the work of reconstruction upon the
                        plan of Thad. Stevens. We have had to suffer for the sins of those who were
                        supposed to be recognized by us as our allies. Every act of Mr. Johnson
                        intended for our benefit resulted in our injury. Every act of the northern
                        Democrats intended to strengthen their party by making friends in the South
                        has only caused Congress to deal the more harshly with us. And if to-day we
                        were to resist by force those acts of Congress which the northern Democrats
                        assure us are unconstitutional, and therefore not binding in law or morals,
                        those same Democrats would vote millions of money and send thousands of
                        soldiers to put down "a wicked and causeless rebellion."</p>
                    <p>"Give a dog a bad name and you may as well kill him." The northern people
                        will not unite with a party calling itself "Democratic." They have the same
                        sort of prejudice against it that we have against the carpet-baggers and
                        scalawags. Not that the masses of the party did not go hand in hand with the
                        Republicans throughout the war, but because a few men -- Vallandigham in
                        Ohio, Wall in New Jersey, Fillmore in New York, Pierce in New Hampshire, and
                        other men of courageous hearts and firm nerves -- stood out against an
                        unconstitutional and unjustifiable war. We can understand why southern men
                        should feel disposed to honor such men as those we have named, and why they
                        might wish to unite with them if they had any party to back them. But they
                        have no such party. They are Democrats in deed as
                        well as in name; whilst nearly the entire body of the party thus called
                        consists of consolidationists or Republicans in principle -- men who believe
                        that secession was a damnable heresy; that the Federal Government not only
                        had the right but that it was its duty to compel the southern people to
                        return to their allegiance to that Government; and that there is in fact no
                        limit to the powers of said Government. We repeat, the northern people will
                        not sustain a party calling itself "Democratic." But we believe that if the
                        Democratic party were out of the way a new party might be organized under
                        some other name which would command the support of a majority of the people
                        of that section upon a platform at least as acceptable to the southern
                        people as any which the consolidation Democrats can honestly adopt. So long,
                        however, as we assist to keep up the present Democratic party, we aid in
                        inflaming the passions of the northern people against ourselves, encourage
                        the maintenance of a party which can never obtain control of the Government,
                        and therefore can never benefit us; prevent the reorganization of the
                        Republican party upon a more liberal basis, and forbid the organization of a
                        new national, all-embracing party, which might otherwise be formed and
                        enabled to ride into power upon a platform of principles broad enough to
                        afford standing-room for the men of every State in the Union. We act now
                        with the same wisdom as did the Jacobites in Scotland who, long after the
                        British Parliament had overthrown their old <br>[bottom section of column 2
                        too dark to read]<br> in the restoration of the rightful heir to the crown.
                        We surely need not thus perpetuate our own helplessness, when by a different
                        line of conduct we may mount the wave of popular favor and upon its crest
                        ride into power.</p>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Jonathan Horn died on December 28th. He was 73 years old. "Father Horn was,
                    no doubt, trying for some years to prepare for this solemn change, and
                    consequently his last hours were of great peace and consolation. He was much
                    interested for the religious welfare of his children."<br>(Names in announcement:  Jonathan Horn)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Mrs. Elizabeth S. Johnson, wife of Robert Johnson, died in Staunton on
                    December 22nd. She was 62 years old and a long-time member of the Episcopal
                    Church. "She bore the painful affliction of which she died, with christian
                    resignation, giving undoubted assurances that she was at peace with God, and had
                    put her house in order. In all the relations of life, she well sustained the
                    character of a modest woman, affectionate daughter, devoted wife and fond
                    mother."<br>(Names in announcement:  Elizabeth S. Johnson,  Robert Johnson)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>George W. Frame died near Spring Hill, Augusta County, at the residence of
                    his father on December 26th. He was 28 years old. "Mr. Frame had been living in
                    Illinois for some time, and returning about a month before his death to his
                    native state, with the hope that he might in some measure regain his health, but
                    his disease--consumption--ran a rapid course and death soon claimed him as her
                    own. All that were with him in the latter part of his illness could but see with
                    joy and hear with gladness the evidence of that faith which he professed in
                    Christ, which seemed to grow stronger and stronger as he neared his end."<br>(Names in announcement:  George W. Frame)</blockquote>

<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>Janet Taylor Bell, daughter of Maj. H. M. Bell of Staunton, died on January
                    1st. "There is perhaps no death that has caused such universal regret and
                    sympathy with the bereaved parents as the one we have chronicled above, and
                    there can scarcely be one which is more touching or heart-rending than the early
                    demise of a beautiful young girl scarcely in her teens, and just now the pride
                    of her parents."<br>(Names in announcement:  Janet Taylor Bell, Maj. H. M. Bell)</blockquote>
