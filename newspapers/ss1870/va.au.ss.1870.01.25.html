<b>Admission of Virginia</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>A reprint of the bill re-admitting Virginia to the Union. This bill
                    contained many new amendments, including the reinstatement of loyalty oaths, to
                    the one passed by the House of Representatives. Both houses have now passed this
                    new bill, and it awaits the President's signature. The editor believed
                    Virginians cannot fully rejoice over readmission now because the amended bill
                    made Virginia "no longer the peer of her sister States."<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>On Friday last a week, the House of Representatives, by a large
                        majority, passed Bingham's Bill for the unconditional admission of Virginia,
                        and, as the Senate had been considered more liberal than the House, it was
                        supposed that the bill, as adopted by the House, would be unhesitatingly
                        adopted by the Senate, and up to the time of going to press last week its
                        adoption by the Senate was hourly expected by a majority of the citizens of
                        the State. The result has shown that they were greatly mistaken. On Friday
                        last, just a week to a day from the time the House passed Bingham's bill for
                        the unconditional admission of the State, the Senate, after loading the bill
                        with amendments and obnoxious conditions, so as wholly to change its
                        character, passed it, by a vote of 48 ayes to 10 nays, as follows.</p>
                    <p>An act to admit the State of Virginia to representation in the Congress of
                        the United States.</p>
                    <p>Whereas, The people of Virginia have framed and adopted a Constitution of
                        State government, which is Republican; and whereas, the Legislature of
                        Virginia elected under said Constitution have ratified the Fourteenth and
                        Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States; and whereas,
                        the performances of these several acts in good faith was a condition
                        precedent to the representation of the State in Congress; therefore,</p>
                    <p>Be it enacted, &amp;c., That the said State of Virginia is entitled to
                        representation in the Congress of the United States; provided, that before
                        any member of the Legislature of said State shall take or resume his seat,
                        or any officer of the State shall enter upon the duties of his office, he
                        shall take and subscribe and file in the office of the
                        Secretary of State of Virginia for permanent preservation an oath in the
                        form following:</p>
                    <p>"I, ----, do solemnly swear that I have never taken an oath as a member of
                        Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State
                        Legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support
                        the Constitution of the United States, and afterwards engaged in
                        insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the
                        enemies thereof. So help me God."</p>
                    <p>Or such person shall, in like manner, take, subscribe and file the following
                        oath:</p>
                    <p>"I,------, do solemnly swear that I have by act of Congress of the United
                        States, been relieved from the disabilities imposed upon me by the
                        Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. So help me
                        God." Which oath shall be taken before and certified by any officer,
                        lawfully authorized to administer oaths. And any person who shall knowingly
                        swear falsely in taking either of such oaths, shall be deemed guilty of
                        perjury, and shall be punished therefor by imprisonment not less than one
                        year and not more than ten years, and shall be fined not less than one
                        thousand dollars. -- And in all trials for any violation of this act the
                        certificate of the taking of either of said oaths, with proof of the
                        signature of the party accused, shall be taken and lawfully held as
                        conclusive evidence that such oath was lawfully and regularly administered
                        by competent authority.</p>
                    <p>And provided further, That every such person who shall neglect, for the
                        period of thirty days next after the passage of this act, to take, subscribe
                        and file such oath, as aforesaid, shall be deemed and taken, to all intents
                        and purposes, to have vacated his office.</p>
                    <p>And, provided further, That the State of Virginia is admitted to
                        representation in Congress upon the following fundamental conditions:</p>
                    <p>That the Constitution of Virginia shall never be so amended or changed as to
                        deprive any citizen, or class of citizens, of the United States of the right
                        to vote who are entitled to vote by the Constitution herein recognized,
                        except as a punishment for such crimes as are now felonies at common law,
                        whereof they shall have been duly convicted under laws equally applicable to
                        all inhabitants of said State, provided, that any alteration of said
                        Constitution, prospective in its effects, may be made in regard to the time
                        and place of residence of voters.</p>
                    <p>That it shall never be lawful for the said State to deprive any citizen of
                        the United States, on account of his race, color, or previous condition of
                        servitude, &amp;c., of the right to hold office under the Constitution
                        and laws of said State, or upon any such ground, to require of him any other
                        qualification for offices than such as is required of all other citizens.</p>
                    <p>That the Constitution of Virginia shall never be so amended or changed as to
                        deprive any citizen, or class of citizens, of the United States of the
                        school rights and privileges secured by the Constitution of said State.</p>
                    <p>Whether it will be adopted in the House without further amendments remains to
                        be seen. It will probably be changed and be bandied from one House of
                        Congress to the other for some time. It is now evident that the announcement
                        of the admission of the State, whenever made, will not furnish any occasion
                        for rejoicing. It was a sad day when Virginia went out of the Union, and it
                        will be a sad day when she goes in again -- upon the conditions of the
                        Senate bill, which places the degrading brand of inferiority upon her,
                        making her no longer the peer of her sister States.</p>
                    <p>P. S. -- On yesterday, (Monday,) the House passed the Senate bill as given
                        above, as will be seen by the following special telegram:</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, January, 24th.</p>
                    <p>House concurred in the Senate amendments this evening -- ayes 156, noes 57.
                        Bill goes to the President for signature. So old Virginia is in the Union
                        again, of which she was the mother. I did not shout when she went out, and I
                        shall not shout now that she is in; for Congress let her come in very
                        ungracefully.</p>
                    <p>SIDNEY.</p>

                    <p>We have urged, says the Baltimore Gazette, a full,
                        patient and prompt acquiescence in the legitimate results of the war -- in
                        the abolition of slavery and all its adjuncts and surroundings. -- We have
                        encouraged the emigration of honest and decent men from the North to the
                        South, and have insisted always that the latter should and would, if
                        permitted, cheerfully co-operate in the work of reconstructing the Union and
                        maintaining the Constitution. But if contempt for the unprincipled men who
                        direct the course of the Radical faction; if detestation of the despicable
                        means by which they have secured the ascendency of a Radical minority in the
                        Southern States; if resentment at the daily and hourly violation of the
                        fundamental law of this land, and the overthrow of the very corner-stone of
                        civil freedom on this continent; if hatred of arbitrary rule and military
                        despotism; if a loathing of a faction which seeks to perpetuate its power by
                        making negroes and unprincipled adventurers the law-makers and governors of
                        the Southern people; if these feelings come under the category of prejudices
                        and animosities, then do we entertain these last most cordially. We shall
                        encourage them now and hereafter to the best of our ability; we shall
                        endeavor to strengthen their growth in the hearts of the Southern people,
                        and we do most cordially pray that in the generations yet to come the
                        convictions and feelings which animate us to-day may fire every Southern
                        breast with ten-fold the intensity with which we cherish them. The love of
                        honesty, the love of right, the love of law and the love of country, these
                        are what the Radical faction affects to class with prejudices and

<b>The Republican Party</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>An article from the New York Herald primarily concerned with the ways in
                    which the Democratic party can unify the country and regain power. Outlined the
                    failings and weaknesses of the Republicans that the Democrats could exploit in
                    the future. The Democrats might even elect the next President if they take
                    advantage of the divisions within the Republican party and the absence of a
                    clear, popular Republican platform.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The New York Herald says that, if the Democrats be
                        progressive and national, and will adopt a policy suited to the present and
                        looking to the future, they may secure the Presidential succession and a
                        long lease of power. -- "Looking," it says,"at the divisions in the dominant
                        party on vital questions of public policy, at its violated promises and
                        shortcomings, at its reckless extravagance, at its want of defined
                        principles in the management of public affairs, and at its indifference with
                        regard to supporting the administration it has chosen, we are naturally led
                        to inquire what prospect there is for perpetuating its power, and what
                        chance there may be for the opposition party. There was a positive issue on
                        the slavery question -- the one, in fact, which brought the republicans into
                        power -- as there was, too, in the prosecution of the war; but neither
                        exists any longer. The Republicans, however, have used the slavery agitation
                        and the war for political capital long after the questions were settled and
                        until they are worn out. The people are tired of them, and look for other
                        questions or issues that bear upon the present and future. -- In this
                        respect the dominant party does not meet the wants and expectations of the
                        country; for, as was said, it has no positive policy, no platform of
                        principles, and no unity or cohesiveness beyond that which the spoils of
                        office give. Who, then, is to govern this great country? What party can take
                        the place of the one in power? Are we to drift along this negative way
                        without principles and statesmen, or shall we have a party with a defined
                        policy, that will represent the sentiment of the country and the living
                        issues of the day?</p>
                    <p>The Democrats have a good prospect before them, if they know how to use their
                        opportunity-- if they will leave the dead past and take a new departure in
                        accordance with established facts and the spirits of the times. They may
                        elect the next President, though General Grant may be again the candidate of
                        the Republicans. Even his popularity and glorious war record would hardly
                        overweigh the failures of his administration, the shortcomings of the
                        Republican party and the desire of the people for a change. The great State
                        of New York has taken the lead already in a political revolution favorable
                        to the Democrats. In the last election for members of Congress they gained
                        considerably, and in many local elections they have shown signs of returning
                        life. Although the Radicals have made extraordinary efforts to establish
                        their power in the Southern States they have evidently overreached
                        themselves, and there is little doubt that these States will be Democratic.
                        A large part of the negroes will go with the white people on political
                        questions, for they will see that their interests are identical, and it
                        requires no prophet to tell us what party the Southerners will affiliate
                        with. Judging from all the signs of the times the Democrats have a good
                        chance for the Presidential succession three years hence. But they will lose
                        that, if they adhere to their old, exploded dogmas and attempt to undo what
                        has been accomplished by and in consequence of the war. Our Northern
                        Democrats must accept the platform and policy of the Southerners, with all
                        the concessions to the negroes and the amendments to the Constitution. They
                        cannot go back and succeed, for the mass of the people are opposed to a
                        counter revolution. However much opposed before to some of the changes that
                        have been made, they accept them now and want peace. Let the Democrats,
                        then, drop the dead past; let them be progressive and broadly rational; and
                        let them adopt a policy suited to the present and looking to the future, and
                        they may secure the Presidential succession and a longe lease of power."</p>

                        and tyranny, the Radical faction is steadily carrying out its partisan
                        schemes. Most of the Southern States are already under the control of the
                        negroes, and the interloping knaves who represent "the powers that be" in
                        Washington, and those which are not quite so subservient to the will of
                        Congress as it desires, are in process of dictatorial reconstruction.
                        Georgia is now again remitted to the guardianship of the depraved and
                        abandoned Bullock, who has entered a new career of infamy under the
                        protection of General Terry's bayonets.</p>
                    <p>Virginia, standing for weeks by the doors of Congress, has been addressed in
                        terms of contumely and insult, and has been given distinctly to understand
                        that, in or out of the Union, she must bear herself as the obsequious slave
                        of those who now control her destinies. Not only is every principle of
                        right, of law, and of justice disregarded by the dominant party, but the
                        solemnly plighted faith of the Federal Government and the pledges of a
                        majority of the members of Congress are regarded by it as of as little value
                        as "dicer's oaths." -- Balt. Gazette.</p>

                    <p>In accordance with the announcement published last week, a meeting of the
                        "Ladies Library Association" was held at the Va. Hotel last Wednesday, at
                        which the Association was regularly organized by the election of a
                        President, Librarian, Treasurer and Secretary. Another meeting will be held
                        at the Va. Hotel to-morrow -- Wednesday -- at 11 o'clock, A.M. The Ladies of
                        this Association expect to open the circulating Library in a room over the
                        store of Messrs. Ackerman &amp; Co., by the 1st Thursday in February.</p>
                    <p>We would urge upon those citizens, who are able to do so, to make liberal
                        donations of money and books to this Library Association. We would recommend
                        to the young gentlemen as well as the young ladies of this place to become
                        subscribers. They could not spend the amount of subscription more
                        profitably. For a few dollars, they will have the use of the Library for
                        twelve months.</p>
