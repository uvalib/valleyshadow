<b>Our Ticket</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The editor details the virtues of every Republican candidate, especially
                    their war records. He also urges Republicans not to stand idle and let the
                    Democrats take another election. The article calls on all true Republicans to
                    form clubs to drum up support and get out the vote to retake the county from the
                    Democrats.<br>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Convention which met on Wednesday, the 5th instant, did its work well.
                        The result of its labor meets the hearty approbation of the entire
                        Republican party, and even the unwilling Democracy admit that the ticket is
                        unexceptionable. We predict for it a triumphant election, because it is
                        composed of such men as will bring to the polls the whole strength of the
                        party.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. Josiah W. Fletcher, our candidate for Sheriff, is known to most of the
                        voters of the county as an excellent and worthy gentleman, an earnest
                        Republican and a gallant soldier in the war to suppress the rebellion and
                        restore the Government. He bears on his person an honorable voucher of his
                        bravery in the face of danger, which he will carry with him to his grave.
                        His almost unanimous nomination, where such well known and worthy gentlemen
                        as John Walter and Jacob Kendig were his competitors, is an encouraging
                        assurance to our citizen soldiers that the loyal people of Franklin county
                        will be slow to forget the lasting debt they owe them. Mr. Fletcher has been
                        Deputy Sheriff during the last three years, and is thoroughly acquainted
                        with the duties of the office.</p>
                    <p>Lieut. S. Wilson Hays, nominated for the office of District Attorney, is one
                        of the Editors of the REPOSITORY, and a young lawyer that gives promise of
                        more than ordinary ability. During the war, when not yet arrived at manhood,
                        he threw aside his books and left Lafayette College to offer his services to
                        his country. He entered the army as a private, where he soon rose to be 1st
                        Lieutenant of a company of infantry. At the close of the war he came to
                        Chambersburg, studied law, and has since been engaged in the practice. He
                        will be a popular candidate, is worthy of the office, and will receive the
                        warm support of his fellow soldiers and the Republican party.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Elias K. Lehman, candidate for Commissioner, and Capt. Joseph W.
                        Winger, nominated for Auditor, are both soldiers of stainless record and
                        esteemed citizens, worthy of any office in the gift of the county. They are
                        men who do not seek emoluments or honors in politics, and the places
                        assigned them on the ticket were imposed upon them by the people. John
                        Bowman, of Guilford, will make an acceptable Director of the Poor, and
                        protect well the interests of the county.</p>
                    <p>--Like the County ticket, the Republican District ticket, is emphatically the
                        work of the people. Good and unexceptionable men of great ability in
                        Chambersburg had been announced as candidates for Assembly and Senator, but
                        the Convention thought it best to give these nominations to other sections
                        of the county, and did so.</p>
                    <p>Capt. John H. Walker, upon whom was conferred the nomination for Assembly
                        resides in Metal township, and has not been a candidate before, for the sole
                        reason that he has hitherto positively refused to accept it. He is a modest,
                        unassuming gentlemen of unblemished character, beloved by all who know him.
                        He went into the war from a pure love of country, and fought bravely to
                        rescue the government from the hands of traitors. It is such men as he who
                        are wanted in our Legislature, and the same spirit which nominated him will
                        also elect him.</p>
                    <p>The Convention named Col. Wm. D. Dixon as her choice for the State Senate,
                        which will, without doubt, secure his nomination in the district. Adams
                        county, it is said, will present no person for the position, and concedes
                        the right of Franklin county to make the nomination. Col. Dixon's military
                        record is associated with that of the Pennsylvania Reserves, the most
                        faithful and gallant corps in the Army of the Potomac, in which he proved
                        himself to be a brave soldier and a good and reliable officer. He has never
                        been a candidate for any office, and, like Capt. Walker, the Convention
                        sought him, and not he the Convention. His election to the Senate will be a
                        pledge to our people that so far as in him lies, the true interests of the
                        District and of the State will be protected.</p>
                    <p>Col. D. W. Rowe, at present Additional Law Judge by appointment of Gov.
                        Geary, has already been made the choice of three counties of this Judicial
                        District for that office. Fulton county, which holds her convention on the
                        24th instant, will also instruct for him, so that he will be the unanimous
                        choice of the Republicans of his whole district. He is well known, and his
                        qualifications for the position are so universally acknowledged, that we
                        deem it unnecessary to speak of them here. He has already presided in the
                        courts of the district, and is strongly supported where he has been. He is
                        also a soldier, who distinguished himself greatly in the late war.</p>
                    <p>The action of the County Convention in naming Hon. John Cessna, of Bedford,
                        by such a decided majority as their standard bearer for Congress in the
                        campaign, will, we feel confident, secure his nomination in the district.
                        Bedford county had instructed for him before, it is understood that he will
                        carry Fulton, and it is not unlikely that Adams county will go for him. The
                        Gettysburg Star and Sentinel, the organ of Hon.
                        E. M'Pherson, says on this subject:</p>

                    <p>"Mr. Cessna has already carried Bedford and Franklin, and it is understood
                        will carry Fulton, so that this action of Franklin virtually settles the
                        Congressional nomination, in which we suppose Adams will concur. Gen. Koontz
                        has many friends over the district, and would have been cordially sustained,
                        had the current of opinion been favorable to his nomination. Mr. Cessna is a
                        powerful campaigner, and a gentleman of great ability and energy, who will
                        conduct a vigorous and successful campaign."</p>

                    <p>This is the whole Republican ticket. It can be elected from top to bottom, if
                        Republican voters but do their duty. It may be defeated if they do not do
                        their duty. Never, perhaps, was a stronger, more unexceptionable ticket
                        presented for our support. But let not its strength and popularity, by
                        lulling us into a feeling of confidence and security, work its defeat. We
                        must have organization, thorough, systematic organization. Without this we
                        can do nothing. The people have given us candidates; now let the people go
                        to work and elect them. There must be a Grant and Colfax Club in every
                        township to distribute documents, to make out lists of voters, to bring
                        every Republican voter to the polls on the second Tuesday of October, and to
                        convert as many of the Democracy from the error of their ways as possible.</p>
                    <p>The nomination of Seymour and Blair, the candidates espoused by the
                        unconverted rebels of the South, has already alarmed, and justly too, the
                        reflecting men of the Democratic party. They see that there is no safety
                        from revolution and anarchy, from repudiation and financial ruin, but in the
                        defeat of these men and the election of Grant and Colfax.--Thousands are
                        already joining the ranks of the Republican party. By thorough organization,
                        by calm and truthful discussion and comparison of the iniquitous doctrines
                        of the Democracy and the principles of universal liberty and right of the
                        Republican party our triumph will be assured and the country rescued from
                        the revolution threatened by Blair and his rebel associates.</p>
                    <p>Let a few earnest republicans in each township call a meeting to organize a
                        Grant and Colfax Club, and when the meeting is held let it elect a
                        President, Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary, and appoint committees
                        to canvas the votes, to see that no one is led astray and that all who can
                        be persuaded to do so, are made to vote the Republican ticket. That is all
                        the organization that is wanted, and that, if properly managed, will elect
                        our whole ticket, because it will bring out a full vote. Last October we
                        were defeated because sixty-two thousand voters failed to come to the polls,
                        of which three-fourths were Republicans; and yet the State was lost by but
                        nine hundred and twenty-two votes. We were defeated by our own supineness
                        and indifference. Let us not be defeated again.</p>

<b>Chambersburg and China</b><br> (Column 02)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper urges the citizens of Chambersburg to work to ensure construction
                    of the Waynesboro railroad with Chambersburg as a terminus, and then joining it
                    to the road linking Gettysburg and Philadelphia. Such an accomplishment would
                    ensure that Chambersburg process "the Asiatic trade seeking the seaboard and
                    European markets." The paper estimates all could be accomplished by raising
                    $45,000. "Should she neglect it and suffer, for want of a small sum, the forming
                    line of trade to pass her side and connect other and rival towns, she will one
                    day lament her supineness."<br>

<b>The Appraisement of Damages</b><br> (Column 03)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The paper criticizes the methods used by the current Commission to
                    compensate border damages. While the editor is sympathetic to border grievances,
                    he insists the best way to recoup the losses is to wait patiently for the
                    federal government to provide compensation so the state would not be bankrupted.<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The Commission appointed under the act of the Legislature of last winter, to
                        appraise the damages suffered by the citizens of Franklin, Fulton, Bedford,
                        York, Perry and Cumberland counties, sat in Chambersburg, on Thursday of
                        last week. We are loth to say anything unfavorable towards any movement
                        which promises in the slightest degree to afford compensation for the great
                        losses our people sustained by the war. Many of them were seriously crippled
                        in their means, and some rendered absolutely pennyless, and we hold that a
                        great prosperous State like the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, no mean empire
                        in itself, should not fail to make full compensation to the sufferers.</p>
                    <p>But this is not contemplated in the action of the Legislature. The law says:</p>

                    <p>"When such claims have been fully adjudicated, reported and filed, it shall
                        then be the duty of the proper officer of the Commonwealth, to be designated
                        by the Governor, to proceed to recover compensation for said losses from the
                        general government, and when so collected, and not till then, shall the
                        amount so recovered be paid, pro rata, to the
                        sufferers of said counties, in accordance with the report of the said
                        commissioners of their claims, and their receipting in full to the
                        Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."</p>

                    <p>We know that this Commission has been rendered popular by means of the
                        impression having been spread abroad that the State proposes to pay these
                        losses. It is entirely without foundation. The law contemplates nothing more
                        than the making of an estimate of the losses and submitting it to the
                        General Government, and even then does our people the injustice to provide
                        that they must receipt in full to the State no matter what proportion of the
                        losses be paid. The action of the Commission itself, while performing the
                        duty intrusted to it by His Excellency Gov. Geary, was such as to discourage
                        and disgust applicants, but whether this arose from circumstances against
                        which they could not provide or was the result of their own complicity with
                        bad men, we do not pretend to say. It was impossible to prepare and examine
                        with any care and correctness the statements of losses of a thousand men in
                        one day even if the best opportunity had been given, but the Commission sat
                        in a hotel and were surrounded by Justices of the Peace and cross-road
                        lawyers from other counties, like scavengers in the wake of an army, who
                        plundered without stint the unfortunate victim who had already suffered
                        greater losses than he could bear. We still recollect with pride the
                        dignified and manly body which sat in the Court House in the spring of 1866
                        to adjudicate the losses of the citizens of Chambersburg occasioned by the
                        burning of the town by rebels. No one could say aught against them. No
                        breath of suspicion was ever whispered against the purity and integrity of
                        their action. It was in the power of the present Commission to have done as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>We would not be willing to say one word to discourage any one from making
                        every effort to recover a claim, so just as these we have mentioned, from
                        the Commonwealth or the General Government, but we do not hesitate to say
                        that the General Government will never pay a cent upon the present
                        appraisement. If Congress ever does, and we sincerely hope she will,
                        conclude to compensate us, an estimate of the losses will be made in a
                        careful and judicious manner; the best testimony will be had, an abundance
                        of time will be taken, and a just and impartial decision will be made. The
                        labor of this Commission will be thrown aside as so much waste paper, and
                        the expenses incident to its execution will be so much lost to the State,
                        while that filched from our citizens, in the shape of fees, will go to make
                        an apex to the monument erected to our former losses.</p>

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>COMRADES:--The Boys in Blue are organizing for another campaign, under their
                        great leader U.S. Grant. They are marshaling for a conflict with the same
                        enemies they were compelled to meet and overthrow before. The hosts that
                        fought under Lee, and shouted for Davis in 1864, are again banded together
                        as one man, to accomplish by the ballot the same purposes they sought to
                        effect by arms. Their object is the same, their inspiration the same, their
                        leaders the same, their allies the same. The soldiers of Stonewall Jackson,
                        who cheered for Horatio Seymour in 1862, are cheering for him now. The
                        leaders of the Rebellion openly declare that in the election of Seymour, the
                        object of the war on their part will be at last accomplished. In every
                        Southern city, bells rung and bonfires blazed over the Democratic
                        nominations, because they embodied the spirit of the "Lost cause." Treason
                        and Democracy joined hands at New York, and vowed the triumph of the
                        principles of the rebellion, or else anarchy. Against Grant, the
                        representative of Union and Peace, they vomited forth denunciations and
                        threatenings; they decreed the State Governments of the South, now at length
                        so happily represented in Congress of no validity, and openly declared that
                        they must be overthrown by arms, and the Union be again disrupted, because
                        Loyalty controls them. Squarely on this issue they nominanted
                        Gen. Frank Blair for the Vice Presidency. The issue again therefore is the
                        Union.</p>
                    <p>The Republican Party and the Union soldiers together, through terrible years
                        and trials saved the nation as one, and now in the very act and article of
                        consummating the restoration of all the States to their normal orbits in the
                        Federal System and their accustomed paths about the central Government, the
                        enemies of union and peace advance to prevent the consummation so devoutly
                        to be wished, and begin the re-inauguration of chaos and anarchy in the
                        South, in the demand that the restored States shall be hurled out of the
                        Union by military violence, and their Governments overthrown. Over against
                        these revolutionists and anarchists, stands the grand figure of Grant,
                        surveying a Union restored and rapidly cementing together in every part, and
                        uttering the sigh of the nation, "Let us have peace." The same hero who won
                        for us soldiers, by your aid, Liberty and Union, now undertakes to
                        accomplish for us Fraternity and Peace. His bugle notes summon you to this
                        struggle, and under his leadership another Vicksburg, another Appomattox
                        Court House await you. Rally to the standard of Grant. The rebels defame
                        your glorious captain, the Democrats are fouler still in their abuse of him
                        they have eulogy only for Wade Hampton and the murderer Forest of Fort
                        Pillow infamy. Rebuke their calumnies, speak out for him who speaks for
                        himself only in his great actions. Rally to the standard of Grant and
                        victory.</p>
                    <p>In 1864, at Chicago, the Democracy declared the war a failure, now they
                        declare reconstruction a failure; then, they denounced the commander in
                        chief of our armies the civilian Lincoln, now they denounce the
                        General-in-Chief the warrior Grant; then in the midst of war, they were for
                        peace, now in the midst of returning peace, they threaten war; heretofore
                        they clamored for the admission of the Southern States, now that seven of
                        them have been admitted they demand that they be thrown out; then when the
                        issue of national currency was necessary to the nation's life, they were
                        against greenbacks, now when a sound currency is necessary to the prosperity
                        of the nation, they would flood the country with Greenbacks. Then, soldiers,
                        by your arms only--for they refused you the right to vote--you proved their
                        declaration that the war was a failure, a falsehood, now by your votes alone
                        you will prove reconstruction not a failure; then Lincoln triumphed as Grant
                        will now; then they did not succeed in stopping the war and thus secure
                        disunion, and now they will not be able to prevent peace and union; then the
                        Republicans so managed the finances as to secure triumph in war, now they
                        will be so managed as to obtain prosperity in peace; at that juncture you
                        saved the nation's integrity and honor, in this crisis you will do the same.
                        What soldier will hesitate between Grant and Seymour? That you will refuse
                        to follow your old leader, who led you to so many glorious victories, to the
                        crowning victory of all is impossible. You cannot be deceived.</p>
                    <p>"Forever true, you wore the blue, and followed General Grant,<br> The Boys
                        in Blue, forever true, will follow General Grant."</p>
                    <p>By order of the Club of Boys in Blue of Chambersburg. JAMES G. ELDER,

<b>The Proposed Female College</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>A late number of the Greencastle Valley Echo
                        contains the following communication, signed "W," on this subject:--I
                        declare, with your permission, to call attention to the enterprise which has
                        been set on foot, to establish somewhere in this section of country a
                        first-class Female College. The enterprise has been fairly inaugurated, and
                        being a matter of public interest, will, I am sure, when rightly set forth,
                        commend itself to favorable consideration.</p>
                    <p>There is no need of writing at this day of the importance of female
                        education. This importance is felt; and so deeply felt, that parents on
                        behalf of their daughters are demanding wiser and more liberal educational
                        facilities. It was an old barbarous notion that woman, as compared with man,
                        was destined to fill an inferior place, and consequently had less need of
                        personal culture. And this old barbarous notion, while long since given up
                        in theory, yet in all the best conditions of society up to the present, has
                        continued to exert some practical force. It has operated everywhere to
                        retard the progress of female education. It has given it in the appreciation
                        of the people a subordinate place, and has helped to limit its breadth and
                        thoroughness. There is, however, here, in our day, a marked advance. It is
                        now conceded that woman, while she is not man, as some narrow minds would
                        make her, is yet man's equal in all that is noble and good and true. She has
                        a place to fill which is peculiarly her own, to which she is appointed of
                        God--a place of relative importance, equal to that filled by the stronger
                        and coarser sex--for the right filling of which she needs the most effective
                        cultivation of all her powers.</p>
                    <p>She has no gift of nature which is not designed for wise employment. Her rich
                        intellectual, moral and emotional endowments, are essential for her work,
                        else they would not have been bestowed. Their right use belongs to the
                        sphere in which she is called to move. And their right development, by the
                        best educational process, is therefore an imperative duty.</p>
                    <p>These have become commonplace convictions, yet growing every day more deeply
                        into the mind and heart of the people. And they produce of necessity a
                        demand for increased thoroughness in female education. Parents looking with
                        pride and hope to the coming of a true and noble womanhood to their
                        daughters, are deeply concerned that they shall be prepared for it, by the
                        most liberal personal culture that lies within reach.--There is therefore an
                        increasing demand for a class of institutions that will furnish to young
                        ladies the facilities of a broad and thorough intellectual and moral
                        training.</p>
                    <p>To meet this demand for this section of country, the Presbytery of Carlisle
                        has set on foot a movement to organize and establish a Female College, which
                        shall embrace a full classical and scientific course, and shall afford to
                        young ladies advantages equal to those enjoyed by young gentlemen in the
                        very best colleges in the land.--The purpose is that it shall be not a
                        school of fashion, but a real training place--a place for the most liberal
                        personal culture in mind and heart.</p>
                    <p>It is not designed to make it sectarian, not even denominational, yet as a
                        pervading element in all true education and as the capstone of its
                        completeness, it will embrace in its course the great principles of Reformed
                        and Evangelical religion. It will be free from ecclesiastical control
                        governed by its Board of Trustees. And its location will be determined in a
                        large degree by the amounts of money contributed by the different places.</p>
                    <p>In order to make it independent of patronage--leaving what is paid in for
                        tuition, to be expended in part at least, for educational apparatus--and at
                        the same time to bring its privileges within the reach of as large a class
                        as possible it is proposed, beyond the necessary buildings, to secure and
                        settle upon it an endowment of two hundred thousand dollrrs; thus
                        enabling it under all circumstances to insist upon a high grade of
                        scholarship, and to do its work in a thorough and finished manner. This is
                        what is proposed. Its realization, either in full or in part, depends of
                        course upon the measure of interest taken in it by the people. An appeal, in
                        proper form, for pecuniary aid will be made shortly; and in the meanwhile,
                        let liberal and thinking men consider how much they owe to such an
                        enterprise. There are personal and family considerations which might move
                        almost every man who is able to lend it his aid. But beyond these every man
                        owes something to society at large. Every man has an interest in the
                        elevation and refinement of social life, yet such elevation and refinement
                        can proceed no faster and rise no higher, than the personal culture of
                        woman.</p>

<b>The Appraisement of Damages</b><br> (Column 01)<blockquote>
<font class="section-head">Summary: </font>The committee for appraising war-damage claims sat at the National Hotel in
                    Chambersburg on Thursday. Swarms of farmers from the surrounding countryside
                    descended on Chambersburg to submit claims. Dishonest clerks swindled
                    claim-seekers out of money by charging farmers to fill out forms the

                    ordered 2,000 forms to be printed, and urge those who need help filling them out

<font class="section-head">Full Text of Article: </font>
                    <p>The practical workings of the Ku-Klux-Klan are at last being brought home to
                        the citizens of Franklin county. Actual facts prove this organization to be
                        no myth, but a stern reality--inflicting death on all persons who are known
                        to be loyal. A short time since, Rev. Thomas Agnew, formerly of Mercersburg,
                        moved to Tennessee. He is universally known as a devout man of God, and from
                        his childhood has faithfully followed the teachings of his Master. In his
                        manners he was always inoffensive, his sole object being to advance the
                        cause of Christianity. Since his removal South, he has been engaged in the
                        teaching of Freedmen. His labors have been so successful that unrepentant
                        traitors have determined that he should leave the country. He has received
                        three notices that his life will be the penalty he will pay for continuing
                        his labors among the down-trodden and oppressed. So alarmed have his friends
                        in our midst become for his safety, that on Sabbath last they requested the
                        prayers of one of our churches, that he might be delivered from the hands of
                        his enemies. This is but one of the many instances of rebel persecution. The
                        Union men are helpless, and the traitors are still battling for the "lost
                        cause." This will be so as long as a recreant Executive, forgetful of his
                        pledges and promises, offers no protection, and gives no redress to good
                        citizens.</p>
